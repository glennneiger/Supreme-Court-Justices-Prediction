    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Julian Bond et al., Appellants, versus James Floyd et al. 
    Mr. Moore.
speaker="howard_moore_jr" startTime="18.193" stopTime="141.434">
    Mr. Howard Moore, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from the United States District Court, the Northern District of Georgia dismissing the complaint and action brought to compel the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of Georgia to admit an elective representative, Julian Bond. 
    The plaintiffs were not on in Mr. Bond, but Dr. Martin Luther King, a constituent and resident, Mrs. (Inaudible), a resident and registered voter, each suing as members of their respective classes. 
    The plaintiffs sought an injunction against the enforcement of a special House resolution excluding Mr. Bond. 
    The plaintiffs also sought injunction against the state constitutional provisions upon which the House relied to exclude him. 
    The appellees are James 'Sloppy' Floyd, an elder state official who is acting in concert with him. 
    A general election was held in Georgia on June 15, 1965. 
    That election was conducted pursuant to legislation enacted in the weight of the decision in Toombs against Fortson as a result, House District 136 was created. 
    Mr. Bond was opposed in that election by Malcolm J.Dean, who was a Dean of Men at Atlanta University in Atlanta. 
    In that election, Bond polled 2320 votes to 487 votes for Dean. 
    More persons voted in Bond's District, in District 136 then in any other district within the entire state. 
    There are 6500 voters in House District 136, 6000 of them are Negroes. 
    About two weeks before, Mr. Bond was scheduled to have been sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives. 
    Samuel Young, a worker with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and it --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    A worker, what?
speaker="howard_moore_jr" startTime="142.711" stopTime="220.981">
    Mr. Howard Moore, Jr. 
    A worker sir with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee known variously and popularly as SNCC. 
    Young was a navy veteran. 
    He was shot and killed near a gasoline service station in Tuskegee, Alabama. 
    Young had lost one of his kidneys in the ill-fated Bay of Pig -- the Bay of Pigs invasion off the coast of Cuba in 1961. 
    He was approaching the service station to use the restroom. 
    Samuel Young was very well liked within SNCC. 
    Three days after Young's funeral on January 6, 1966, SNCC issued the statement to the press, critical of American policy in Vietnam and of his pass for respecting equal rights for Negroes in the United States. 
    The entire statement is set forth at pages 135 to 137 of the record. 
    The statement plays responsibility for the murder of Samuel Young upon the Federal Government. 
    The statement equated, the failure of the administration to protect Samuel Young with the death of Vietnamese peasants resulting from the aggressive foreign policy conductive in the violation of international law. 
    The following four paragraphs are perhaps the most relevant paragraphs to these procedures and I shall read from the record at page 137.

    137?
speaker="howard_moore_jr" startTime="222.000" stopTime="304.533">
    Mr. Howard Moore, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    Those paragraphs recite as follows. 
    We are in sympathy with and support the men in this country who are unwilling to respond to a military draft, which would compel them to contribute their lives to United States' aggression in Vietnam in the name of the freedom we find so close in this country. 
    We recoil with horror at the inconsistency of a supposedly free society where responsibility to freedom is equated with responsibility to men -- oneself to military aggression. 
    We take note to the fact that 16% of the draftees from this country are Negroes called on to stay for liberation in Vietnam to preserve a democracy which does not exist with them at home. 
    We ask, where is the draft for the freedom fight of the United States? 
    We therefore encourage those Americans who prefer to use their energy in building democratic forums within this country. 
    We believe that work in the civil rights movement and with other human relations organizations is a valid alternative to the draft. 
    We urge all Americans to seek this alternative. 
    Going full well, it may cost their lives as painfully as in Vietnam.

    Mr. Howard Moore, Jr. 
    Yes, I believe its 41 sir. 
    A following release of the statement later in the afternoon, a newsman employed by a state-owned radio station, WGST in Atlanta caused union buying at home. 
    And I have to repeat, Mr. Bond was at home at that time he received this particular call. 
    The newsman asked by who did not, as we said earlier, participate in drafting the statement whether he endorsed the SNCC statement by replied he did and added, as a pacifist he was opposed to all laws and was eager and anxious to encourage people not to participate in it for any reason that they chose. 
    The newsman pressed Bond to specify his reasons for endorsing the statement. 
    And Bond said, "I agree of the statement because of the reasons set forth in it, because I think it's sort of hypocritical for us to maintain that we are fighting for liberty in other places and were not guaranteeing liberty to citizens inside the communal of United States". 
    He was further pressed by the newsman and he reiterated his pacifist beliefs. 
    And he indicated that he was opposed to either side killing in Vietnam. 
    That is to the United States killing in Vietnam and to the Vietcong killing in Vietnam. 
    And that his temperament was such that he was opposed to abrupt changes. 
    This may be found in the record of page 114. 
    On the morning of January 10, 1966, Mr. Bond arrived in the House of Representatives to take his oath as a representative elect from the 136 House District. 
    Now this was not the first time that Mr. Bond had gone to the House of Representatives. 
    He'd gone there earlier in -- about two years earlier to observe a proceeding and he was forcefully ejected from the House. 
    The clerk on this occasion in January 10th, 1966, ordered him to stand aside as the oath was administered to other representatives. 
    Challenges were filed to Mr. Bond's right to be sworn and seated. 
    The challenges were signed by at least 75 white members of the House. 
    They were based upon Mr. Bond's statement to the press, the petitions charged among other things that Bond's actions and statements gave aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States, violated the Selective Service law, tended to bring discredit and disrespect to the House of Representatives. 
    The challenges are set out in the record at pages 13th and 15th. 
    Also said that Mr. Bond's statements indicated that he could not take the oath, they were repugnant to the oath. 
    A special committee then was composed for the rules committee and three additional members, including two Negro members. 
    I should say they were approximately eight Negroes who were in the House. 
    This was the first time that a Negro had sat in the House since 1907 and this was due to reapportionment and one other White representative from Fulton County. 
    A hearing was held on the challenge petitions for the expressed privilege of deciding the substance of what Mr. Bond said and the intentions behind what he said. 
    For evidence, they introduced the tape of a phone interview on January 6,1966, a tape of an interview with Mr. Bond in the hall of the state capital immediately after the clerk refused to administer the oath to him. 
    And they call Mr. Bond as a witness apparently against himself. 
    There is note of this tape are on file and available to the Court. 
    At the hearing, Mr. Bond was asked whether he admired the courage of people who burnt their draft cards. 
    And his reply was, "I admire people who take who take an action and admire people who feel strongly enough about their convictions to take an action knowing the consequences they will face. 
    And that was my original statement when asked a question". 
    Mr. Bond called four witnesses who urged proceeding and stated that he deserved the right to be seated. 
    One of those witnesses was his opponent in the democratic primary. 
    The other was his opponent in the general election. 
    The other two witnesses were the two Negro members of the Georgia State Senate. 
    The special committee then recommended that Mr. Bond not to be seated. 
    A two-Negro member dissented along a white legislator from Fulton County. 
    The House then adopted House Resolution 19 not to seat Mr. Bond in accordance with the majority recommendation from the special committee. 
    Mr. Bond and his constituents then brought this action for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment. 
    On February 14, 1966, the special three-judge court rendered -- filed a judgment against the appellees. 
    It unanimously held that it had jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had a series -- substantial First Amendment rights. 
    The Court -- Chief Judge Tuttle dissenting struck from the complaint the names of the appellants other than Mr. Bond on the grounds that they like such a direct interest in the litigation which would give them standing to bring the complaint. 
    On the merits, the Court was also divided. 
    The majority agreed that the substantial issue in the case rests on the guarantee of freedom of speech or to dissent under the First Amendment. 
    Nevertheless, it held that Mr. Bond's statements, an affirmation of the SNCC statement as they go on the functioning of the Selective Service system could reasonably be said to be inconsistent with and repugnant to the oath which he would be required to take. 
    Since the exclusion and while this case has been pending on appeal, Mr. Bond has been twice reelected to office. 
    The first reelection occurred in February of 1966. 
    He was unopposed in that election, he won it by 682 vote to none. 
    He was again reelected on November 8, 1966, justice Tuesday, by a vote of 2136 to 948. 
    That can be very little doubt that Mr. Bond is the choice of the voters in House District 136. 
    But with respect to the legal issues presented or raised by these set of facts, Mr. Boudin will develop them in detail. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Leonard B. Boudin
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="703.919" stopTime="707.303">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Boudin.
speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="707.303" stopTime="841.870">
    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The central issue in this case, I see -- as I think Your Honors conceive from the development by Mr. Moore is whether a state legislative body's refusal to sit an elected representative whether refusal is based upon his public expressions of opinion on national issues, whether such a refusal violates the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment incorporated in the Fourteenth, whether it deprives him since it is a national issue that was under discussion of a privilege in immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment and whether it unconstitutionally deprive those who elected Mr. Bond of their right of franchise in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, possibly the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now the court below recognized that there was a very substantial issue of freedom of speech involved here, as it indicated at page 142 of the records. 
    But it held that an elected rep -- legislator had less right than an individual citizen to express his views on public issues. 
    As the Court said, Mr. Bond's right to speak and to dissent as a private citizen is subject to the limitation that he sought to assume membership in the House Record 151. 
    And the Court was -- of the view that since it said, the statement of SNCC was against national policy. 
    I think the first time a Court has ever made such a determination, at least the federal court in these days that it was Mr. Bond's duty to remain silent or forfeit his position. 
    Now that based (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="841.870" stopTime="847.037">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There's no question as a matter of fact that the statement was contrary to national policy, (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="847.037" stopTime="852.919">
    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    I supposed the statement can be said to be contrary to what the Government position is in the particular matter.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="852.919" stopTime="853.914">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Contemporary national policy.
speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="853.914" stopTime="858.386">
    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Yes. 
    Whether national policy had any real significance as a criterion of course was (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="858.386" stopTime="859.410">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is of course another question.
speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="859.410" stopTime="1025.338">
    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    -- is quite right. 
    Now, the difficulty with the Court's reasoning in holding that a legislator elect has less right to express himself on public issues, is that it assumed the voice contrary to what this Court has said in Lemont and in Martin against Travis and a number lot of cases that it is solely for the of the speaker that the First Amendment was written and is to be enforced. 
    On the contrary, there is at least a greater right in the public to hear the speaker. 
    And so the status of the speaker should not derogate from the right of the public to hear his statement. 
    As a matter of fact this Court explicitly in Wood against Georgia in a quotation which is set forth at page 30 of our brief held that an elected sheriff had a right to issue a press relief challenging a charge to a grand jury. 
    And the Court said that the petitioner was an elected official and had the right to enter the field of political controversy. 
    The role that elected official playing our society and he makes it all the more imperative, that they'd be allowed freely to express themselves on matters of current public importance. 
    But our position here is not nearly that there was a right on the part of Mr. Bond to make the statement, that he had a duty to express himself if those were his views on these public issues or at least three interrelated reasons. 
    The first is that, as a presumed leader, we now see he's been elected three times, leader of his people in the 136th District. 
    He has the right to exercise his influence upon them to attempt to persuade them to his point of view. 
    The second is, it can be presumed, I think fairly, that he states it for a substantial number of them, they having elected him several times in the course of this controversy and he as their spokesman and if that is their view, why cannot it be expressed through him. 
    And the third reason, is the reason suggested by this Court's statement in Garrison against Louisiana and in New York Times against Sullivan, namely that the public has a right to know anything that affects the qualifications of the individual whom they have elected. 
    And what could be a better way of assessing the qualifications of the man but in having him express his views in this way. 
    The position of the court below giving a lesser right, a lesser duty to the individual because if he is elected undercuts all of these principles.

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    We would say that as a matter of principle, subject to of course prosecution for a crime with the usual elements of due process in criminal cases that the Georgia legislature could not exclude Mr. Bond or any other person.

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    -- despite the -- its not necessary but our position here which -- is that there is an absolute right on the part of the legislator elect to say anything he wishes and not to be disqualified, subject of course to criminal prosecution and as -- and if they're appropriate to a libel suit assuming that the Court were -- were to hold that libel suit did not violate the First Amendment as it has. 
    Our view is that the reason for this absolute right to take office, subject to the qualifications set forth specifically in disqualifications in the Georgia Constitution, a constitution promulgated by the people of Georgia or their predecessors of course, is that there is not only the right of freedom of speech involved here but the freedom of the franchise. 
    And the -- and they'd be just as appropriate for me to -- well perhaps I ought to discuss the -- the freedom of a franchise a little later. 
    No, I will develop it at this point the -- if Your Honor pleases since we've reached that point and come back to the First Amendment and the arguments of the Court a little later.

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Well, the freedom of the franchise so far as this Court is concerned has so far having developed only into the Equal Protection Clause.

    Under what part of the constitution?
speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="1165.077" stopTime="1212.923">
    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    I would say however that it is inherent in represented democracy that the will of the people should be reflected in the election of their people and that anything that would have obstruct that would be inconsistent by our entire system of represented democracy as set forth by the Court in the recent cases of Reynolds against Sims, etcetera. 
    Now the Court has adopted the instrument, an appropriate one of the Equal Protection Clause as the key but it seems inherent in our democratic system that the will of the people should not be prevented by an existing legislative majority which very often has been elected at the same time as the man whose case is in issue. 
    Now, the reason I say that Your Honor --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that equal protection?
speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="1302.112" stopTime="1480.436">
    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    That is equal protection and that's what we are relying upon here. 
    Now, the system of which was applied here of denying the right -- the right of an elected representative to take office on the basis of qualification enunciated by the legislative body at the time the demand appeared to take office, is of course inconsistent with our entire history or federal history and of our state history. 
    And when the issue was raised at the time of the Constitutional Convention, the Federal Constitution Convention, and it was proposed to allow a legislature to determine the conditions of taking office. 
    It will be recalled that people with such diverse views as Madison and Hamilton agreed that the legislative body was not the body to impose the qualifications, contrary to what the constitution itself should have provided. 
    And this was of course inherent in the historic struggle in England which Madison made reference and refer of course to the -- I refer of course to the Wilkes case. 
    And that to the attempt by a -- the English Parliament to present Mr. Wilkes reelected and elected several times from taking office. 
    If I may return for the moment to the issue of the freedom of speech and then return here, let me indicate that the Court below, in addition to adopting a standard of giving less protection to the legislator elect in the freedom of speech area, adopted a self-imposed system of restricted judicial review. 
    What the Court said was that because of the separation of power's principle and the principle of federalism, it would not protect the First Amendment rights in this case, the way it would in an ordinary case. 
    And instead it would apply what it called a rational evidentiary rule that is to determine whether there was any rational basis for the legislative impairment of First Amendment rights in this case. 
    Now aside from the fact that of course, this Court and other federal courts have repeatedly -- despite the doctrine as a federalism and a separation of powers, federal courts have moved into the protection of rights against state body and courts of course, by virtue of their inherent function have protected rights even though the rights was sought to be taken away by legislative groups or by the executive or by commissions.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1480.436" stopTime="1484.053">

    So, if the constitution that's done that, the Courts have been the instrument?

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Yes, of course. 
    I agree on that. 
    Now, the reason why the Courts -- what the court did below was improper in our view was because we are dealing here with the First Amendment. 
    We are not dealing here with the regulation of property under the Due Process Clause. 
    And I think what was said in West Virginia against Barnette and in succeeding cases indicates a distinction between the standards to be applied, a regulation of property and impairment of First Amendment rights.

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    -- which explicitly. 
    That is quite through. 
    Now, none of the -- none of the test ever used by this Court, whether it was the clear and present danger of Schenck or whether it was the modification of Chief Judge Hand in the Dennis case, adopts it by a majority of this Court or whether if the Sherbert against Verner case of a compelling state interest. 
    None of these tests ever moved down to the test used by the court below namely, is there a rational basis for what was done. 
    The court below in using this rational basis test drew it out of two cases that has no possible bearing on the issues here. 
    Those cases were the Thompson against Louisville and Garner against Louisiana where -- what the Court did here -- there was to reverse convictions on the ground that there was no semblance, no iota of evidence to support the convictions under the Due Process Clause. 
    And of course that has -- it cannot be applied here because I think that not even the appellees would urge that if there was an iota of evidence to justify the impairment of First Amendment rights that this Court could sustain the court below. 
    Now the appellees rely upon a decent kind of rational evidence -- evidentiary test. 
    They referred to the cases of Konigsberg and Schare cases involving application through admission to the Bar. 
    And it is -- those are the cases which -- in which this Court sustaining applicants for members of the Bar, I'm talking about the first (Inaudible) case. 
    Now, as held that upon an examination of the whole record of that record, does not show a rational basis for the denial of membership with the Bar that the Court will not sustain the denial by the character committee involved. 
    But of course, there is a very real distinction between an application for admission to the Bar on the basis of good character to be determined by a character committee and the question of whether or not a person who is elected by the people of his district is to be -- is to take his seat. 
    Whatever may be the test, I'm not rearguing now the test that was used in Schware and Konigsberg. 
    So I would argue with an absolute right, despite political views or opinions. 
    Whatever may be the test in the Bar cases, that test certainly can't be applied where you not only have the question of freedom of speech. 
    But you have the question of giving voice to the electoral vote of the people here. 
    Our view I believe --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's not in your brief, is it?
speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="1784.236" stopTime="1995.383">
    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    We have not argued that in our brief Your Honor, in view of the frequent statements by the Court on that subject, and because we don't think it necessary to press the issue. 
    We think that we have enough here in terms of both the First Amendment and in terms of the Equal Protection Clause. 
    I'm not briefed with that. 
    Now even if we take any test other than the absolute test which we have suggested if necessary in order to vindicate not only the First Amendment rights but the Equal Protection Clause here. 
    We think on this record, the court below acted unreasonably and arbitrarily and that there is nothing to sustain the view that the statements made my Mr. Bond are inconsistent with his constitutional duty or show that he would not care -- he would not execute his oaths of office. 
    I come shortly to the question of what the oath of office actually means. 
    Because as Mr. Moore has indicated, the statements that were made here by Mr. Bond, although we would argue that they would be protected if they were in the form of a speech, of a leaflet, of an argument in the marketplace, were actually as indicated a response to an inquiry made by a reporter. 
    Whatever the cases might suggest and we have seen none that are against us on this on the subject of incitement, on the subject of attempting to instigate overreaction, none of that happens to be in this case. 
    As I say, I would argue that Mr. Bond's right to go into the seat make the same statement was absolutely protected by the First Amendment. 
    But here, we do not have any of that. 
    I do not think it can be said fairly that in this record, the remarks made by Mr. Bond support an argument that a compelling state interest justifies this infringement of his First Amendment rights. 
    Now tending for the moment for the question of the Georgia constitution and the oath of office, the court below recognized that there was no qualification set forth in the Georgia constitution which was not met by Mr. Bond, and that he was disqualified under any of the specific provision. 
    What it said however was that there was a rational basis for -- the belief by the legislative body that Mr. Bond could not conscientiously take the oath to support the constitution of the United States and of Georgia. 
    An oath which is set forth at page 47 of our brief and which provides in the following language, I will support the constitution of this state and of the United States and on all questions and measures which may come before me, I will so conduct myself as well in my judgment the most conducive to the interest and prosperity of the state. 
    This said to legislature, Mr. Bond was not able to take because of the public expressions of opinions that he had made. 
    And of course --

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Yes, that is a very real distinction. 
    I think that there's no question but that he had to take the oath if he wanted to take office. 
    This oath is a -- first of all, the oath itself or at least part of it is required by Article VI, Clause 3 of the Federal Constitution which require state legislators to take the oath to support the federal constitution. 
    The oath -- and that is really our point here Mr. Justice Harlan is a mode of taking office not a standard by which the judge, the fitness of the man to take office. 
    It is like all of these oaths of taking office, a promissory oath, a solemnification of the important step of taking office. 
    And it is not to minimize it in the slightest to say that it is not intended as a method of refusing to let people take the oath, which was done in the present case. 
    There is a New Jersey superior court decision which I may -- will ask the Court to leave -- to cite since I have not put it in my brief but told our opponents about Imbrie against Marsh in which Judge Bigelow discussed this particular problem and --

    That is my opinion that that he would be permitted to take the oath of office. 
    I don't think -- I think once you move away from the function of the oath namely, that it's merely the preliminary step to taking -- carrying out your official function and turn it into something which could be examined in the point of view of determining whether the man can consciously or properly or means to take the oath, then you move into an unlimited area which is exactly the area that we rendered to here.

    The case would be exactly the same and of course, exactly the case that we have here. 
    Since the Georgia legislature and its members as we note from the amicus curie briefs which have developed this in detail consists of members who have repeatedly and officially as legislators, taken the position that the decisions of the Court protective of civil liberties that the decisions of the Courts in the field of civil rights are not to be obeyed. 
    And I would say that the -- all of those people when the Georgia legislature have taken these positions violative of the constitutional rights of American citizens have a right to take their position and cannot be precluded even though if one were to adopt the standard we have just discussed, one could say, "None of them could conscientiously take this oath of office".

    That does create a problem and a problem which I think I can avoid by indicating that I agree that the triggering factor here and the admitted factor, there's no dispute as to this is the statement of Mr. Bond, the public expression of opinion.

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Well, as Your Honor will see from our brief, we are also of the opinion that the bill of attainder provision is applicable here. 
    And that it does trigger the right of the Court to intervene.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Does due process trigger?

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Now as to due process it would depend -- as to due process I have more doubt. 
    I think that it is the -- sorry Your Honor. 
    I think it is precisely because of the special position which has been recognized the First Amendment possesses, relationship to what the Court has said, "The vitality of our institution". 
    Because it is an explicit provision of the constitution and because it is then given -- put it one way or the other, this preferred status that the First Amendment will always be able to trigger the protective use of the judicial arm. 
    I should like to add Mr. Justice Fortas that of course, bearing in mind the fact that we also have speech of the particular kind relating to national issue, we are also relying upon the fact that upon the specific immunities and privileges clause requiring --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I can say that it -- and it'd be difficult for us state to take the position and it has a Republican form of Government if it denies to the persons who have by hypothesis been duly elected the opportunity to take their seat in legislature. 
    I can see that possibility. 
    But if you take the next step and say that Section 4 of Article 4 is in this situation as this Court has held it, it could be another situation is nonjusticiable. 
    Then I have a little problem in going from the -- this question of state power to the question federal power.
speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="2961.182" stopTime="3002.479">
    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    The Court of course in Baker against Carr was able clearly to distinguish the line of cases beginning with Luther against Borden involving the Republican form of Government and held that where specific rights were being denied. 
    In fact that it might also involve a derogation of the Republican form of Government and trusted to the political arm did not mean that the Court would indicate the rights involved there. 
    And so here we think where we have a First Amendment right clearly within the scope of the Court's historic power to bend the case.

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    So far as this Court is concern, we are not arguing that that was the fact. 
    We are relying upon the First Amendment issues here. 
    I think that -- I will not argue the bill of attainder issue but merely indicate to the Court that I think that under the Levitz-Watson Dodd case. 
    This is clearly a bill of attainder because one looks at the charges that were made against Mr. Bond at the kinds of questions that were put together. 
    At the results that follow, it is clearly a legislative determination of guilt of this loyalty of something approaching sedition of something approaching oppositions to the national interest which in the light of what has occurred up to now is clearly a permanent. 
    It would make no difference or would temperate permanent proscription from office. 
    This is a very different question from the question of judging the qualifications. 
    That is determining whether a man linked standard specifically set forth in the constitution at which the quasi judicial function familiar to the Court. 
    Here we have a legislative determination where there is no standard set forth in the legislation or constitution. 
    A trial, and no one who raise his extended record and sees the cross examination of Mr. Bond by his judges can doubt that he went through a real trial as to its political opinions and views and that he was found guilty and declared not once but three -- that twice ineligible to serve in a legislature.

   Argument of Arthur K. Bolton

    Attorney General Bolton.

    Mr. Arthur K. Bolton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. 
    As has been safely apparent from the discussion of the problem before this Court today is a great historical significance not because the Georgia legislature is the only legislative body which has ever refused to seat a member in judging his qualifications. 
    But because this is the first time insofar as we have been able to ascertain that the issues presented in this case have ever been before the Supreme Court. 
    Indeed historically, there seems to be a lack of precedent for this case to be here. 
    But I should concede in candor that in view of recent decisions of this Court, history alone does not control nor indeed should it control and without waiting or conceding any of the arguments raised in our brief, I will consign our argument to the basic constitutional questions raised and the basic constitutional rights of Mr. Bond which this Court may find it necessary to determine. 
    When the Julian Bond's story broke the New York Times interviewed Louie Loreman who was one of the five socialist who were expelled by the New York Legislature in 1919. 
    It inquired why no court action had been taken by them at that time, said Mr. Loreman. 
    We regard the concept of separation of powers as far more important than own case. 
    If judges can decide who can seat in the legislature then they can decide who shouldn't seat. 
    This would be a much greater offense to a Democratic Government than anything a stupid majority of legislators might do in an individual case. 
    So I think it will be readily agreed therefore that this is a first impression case before this Court. 
    And that is it may for the first time construe the power of a legislative body in determining qualification of its selected membership, it is of paramount importance. 
    The question concerning Mr. Bond's election and his subsequent election except for the fact that he has not been refused a seat by the Second Legislature, it is merely the committee's recommendation which will go to the General Assembly next January.

    Mr. Arthur K. Bolton 
    During a taped interview with the representative of the media, Mr. Bond after endorsing the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee statement was asked why he endorsed it and his answer was as follows. 
    Why? 
    Endorse it -- this, because I like to think of myself as a pacifist and one who opposes that war and any other war and eager and anxious to encourage people not to participate in it for any reason that they choose. 
    And secondly, I agree with the statement because of the reasons set forth in it. 
    Because I think it is so hypocritical for us to maintain that we are fighting for liberty in other places and we are not guaranteeing freedom to citizens inside the continental United States. 
    Further reading, may it please the Court. 
    When they asked if he thought his views were at variance with the duties that might be required of him as a representative in the House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, Mr. Bond replied, "Well I think the fact that the United States Government fights a war in Vietnam. 
    I don't think that I as a second class citizen of the United States have a requirement to support that war. 
    I think my responsibility is to oppose things that I think are wrong, if they are in Vietnam or New York or Chicago or Atlanta or whatever".

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="arthur_k_bolton" startTime="5150.224" stopTime="5431.913">
    Mr. Arthur K. Bolton 
    -- get -- touch on that issue as to the due process. 
    So it is our position that the federal constitution provides a minimum qualification, the only qualification there. 
    May I go back one moment because of course I digress -- you might -- the Court might say is, this is a -- why, why does the U.S. Constitution, why is that important? 
    Well, why is a state legislature, why is that important? 
    We have 50 states and I've said in the state legislature and why is that an important position? 
    Well, may I just very briefly state that a state legislator doesn't just make laws that affect the people in his district. 
    A state legislator makes laws which affect the people of the entire state of which he is a member without the record modes of transportation now. 
    A state legislator makes laws which affect the people of the entire nation. 
    But not only that and to have a constitutional form of government, there is a single member of a state legislature could theoretically be or could theoretically cares the deciding vote in -- as to whether or not the United States Constitution itself, an amendment thereto was ratified. 
    So it is an important office. 
    Now when Mr. Bond -- when the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee issued this statement on January the 6th, Mr. Bond made his statements on it and then the legislature of the House convened on January the 5th. 
    Mr. Bond was an elected representative which we maintain with all except the foul qualification that of being bound to support the constitution of the United States. 
    There is a necessity for free speech under the constitution. 
    I don't think I need to repeat that to this Court. 
    It ensures the process of orderly government. 
    This Court has imposed limitations on free speech, the known line in cases of obscenity and in the advocacy of law of violation. 
    It is our position that Mr. Bond in adapting the statement of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and in his statements thereon advocated violation of the Selective Service Act. 
    And therefore his speech was not protected but even assuming that his speech was protected, we have to remember Mr. Bond's position, he was not a citizen. 
    He was a -- in a position of a public servant making comments reflecting upon his qualifications, the qualifications imposed by the Federal Constitution. 
    The Georgia House, under the Georgia Constitution is the sole judge of his qualification. 
    And we think that because Mr. Bond of his elective position, he had a great responsibility and obligation than that of an ordinary citizen and that was the qualification which he was to be bound to support the United States Constitution. 
    And therefore we say, that in this instance and under these circumstances, the Sixth Article, Article VI of the Constitution is of equal rank and dignity with the Bill of Rights of the First Amendment to the Constitution. 
    And that the legislature in acting as a judge of his qualifications was authorized to treat Article VI of the federal constitution as controlling insofar as determining his qualifications.

    Mr. Arthur K. Bolton 
    Sir I think -- if I can just summarize. 
    I think that the legislature was a judge of his qualification, a 184 members in the vote thought he wasn't qualified, 12 members voted to seat him. 
    What the standard of review, I think that the lower court was correct in stating a rational basis was the standard of view -- of review. 
    I don't think we're concern with whether or not another forum might have judged Bond differently but we are concerned with the fact, was there are any evidence upon which the Georgia House could form a rational basis for finding him disqualified under the United States Constitution.

    We say that the qualification imposed in the constitution was judged by the Georgia House.

    But even if he -- it'd be determined to the speech of Mr. Bond would have been protected as an ordinary citizen, the qualification imposed by the United States Constitution has equaled dignity with the First Amendment and is not controlling and the House was authorized to determine his qualification. 
    We think that Mr. Bond was afforded due process.

    Mr. Howard Moore, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    With respect to what he meant by his statement in his position. 
    He says, "I have suggested that congressionally outline alternatives to military draft to extend it to building democracy at home. 
    The posture of my life for the past five years has been calculated to give me a grip, the ability to participate the formulation of public policies. 
    The fact of my election to public office does not lessen my duty or desire to express my opinions even when they differ from those held by others".

    I don't quite understand the question but I'm not defending on that ground. 
    I'm defending on the ground that he has a right under the First Amendment to express those views and not could be excluded from the legislature.

    I rather thought his statement sounded like he is proud of his views.

    If I may move on to the note which we'd like to conclude, is that the State, the respondents construe Article VI provision with respect to the oath to be synonymous with support of the Government or support of a particular administration. 
    The Article itself provide support of the constitution and that's a very meaningful and such as to the distinction that one can't support the constitution in good faith unconscientiously and not support the particular policies of a given administration. 
    And that dramatizes what I think has been an unconstitutional application of that provision in this particular case. 
    Thank you.
