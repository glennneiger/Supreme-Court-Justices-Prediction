    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court. 
    This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari from the Third Circuit. 
    It involves a question of the interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the petitioners here plaintiffs below are group of drug companies who were confronted with a mandatory enforcement regulation which they believe was issued beyond the statute and beyond the authority of the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. 
    Accordingly, they filed a suit in the District Court at Wilmington under the declaratory judgment of the statute and the Administrative Procedure Act asking for relief from the mandatory enforced with requirements of this particular regulation alleging that they were seriously injured in their business in any way which I will refer to later in some more detail.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="120.133" stopTime="122.040">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They asked for a declaratory judgment, didn't they?
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="122.040" stopTime="221.598">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    Declaratory judgment and an injunction Mr. Justice Stewart under the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    The case was heard on cross motions for summary judgment. 
    There are no facts in dispute. 
    It's a pure issue of law as to what this particular section of the statute means. 
    All administrative proceedings are over. 
    These petitioners or plaintiffs stand in the posture where they must conform with this regulation which they consider invalid or they must get to redress through this action in the Court or await being sued. If they simply await being sued and undertake to exist that they are paroled, they will be subject to criminal proceedings. 
    They will be subject to civil proceedings in the way of injunction. 
    They will be subject to seizure, indeed multiple seizure, of their products. 
    And they are also subject to what perhaps is the most reprehensible situation of all which undoubtedly some members of the Court would be familiar. 
    The indirect enforcement power of this agency to deny company's opportunity to put drugs on the market or denied on certifications and in other petty administrative ways prevent companies that wish to challenge this legislation from going about their otherwise lawful and normal business.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="221.598" stopTime="223.330">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Reprehensible, Mr. Gessell?
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="223.330" stopTime="684.141">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    I think it's seriously reprehensible Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    The indirect type of enforcement of that kind puts a company in a position where it is unable to get the type of hearing which our type of society contemplates should be appropriate. 
    Now, the issue here is I believe quite narrow. 
    In the District Court, the District Court found that the companies had standing to sue that there was a right to bring an action under the declaratory judgment statute, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the District Judge then proceeded to the merits and held that the plaintiffs were correct with respect to the interpretations of the statute. 
    When the Government took the matter to the Third Circuit, the Third Circuit did not come to the issue on the merits. 
    The Third Circuit took the position that the Food and Drug Act did not provide a basis for a suit such as has been brought here and held that the controversy was not right that there was no threatened, haste or controversy and that therefore the action was premature. 
    And petitioners lost in the Court of Appeals on that ground without the Court of Appeals coming to the merits. 
    We accordingly are here on a – cert was granted on a procedural question as to the whether or not a case or controversy exists in the face of this allegedly illegal regulation and whether the statute permits if there is a right of controversy as we feel there is, whether the statute permits this particular type of action. 
    Now, the regulation in issue is designated by the defendants as an enforcement statute. 
    It is immediately operative and it applies to all prescription drugs and to all companies selling prescription drugs throughout the United States. 
    It is mandatory in its terms, it is stated in the words of command and it directs compliance. 
    And the statute is so worded and the regulation is so worded that if a company chooses not to comply, its drugs will be deemed misbranded and accordingly all of the consequences that flow upon a misbranded article under the statute criminal, civil and other types of sanctions apply. 
    The particular regulation in issue is a regulation that directs that in the case of a prescription drug whether a label be used or an advertisement be used any type of printed literature of any kind every time the brand name or trade name of the drug is used, that must appear opposite the generic name that is to say the technical name of the particular drug. 
    The agency takes the position that the provisions of 502 (e) (1) of the statute which are printed at page 4 (a) of my main brief if the Court please requires this interpretation of the statute. 
    We take the position that the statute requires only that there be prominent display of the generic name and that there is no requirement that that name appear every time, all the time whenever the brand name appears. 
    It is Mr. Chief Justice, as all were -- we had briefs before Your Honor here with some 40 plaintiffs and every time we said “petitioners” we put a parenthesis in and spelled out the names of the 40 different companies that are before you today. 
    Now, the -- the injury that is facing this industry is of several types. 
    They are not only facing these sanctions but they would be required under these regulations to change their materials, to undergo addition expense, to publish a type of literature that would be certainly at the least confusing and far less effective. 
    We think the controversy is clearly right for adjudication. 
    The statute's directions are explicit and the question presented is a mere and simple question as to whether or not the statute reads the way the Food and Drug Administration says it reads. 
    There's an impact that is clearly adverse on the business of these petitioners, the regulation controls the manner in which they have to conduct their business. 
    It sets a standard of conduct and there are no further administrative proceedings or any other thing of that kind to which they can advert. 
    The government says there's an exemption provision but that is not the case, the exemption provision does not read with respect to the advertising aspects of the regulation. 
    So this problem, this horns of the dilemma officer's choice or which you want to call it, that confronts these companies is a realistic, actual and immediate type of controversy from which the only relief that they can seek is by asking for declaratory judgment and protection under the Administrative Procedure Act unless they simply want to sit back and face the penalty uncertain as to time, uncertain as to his business consequences, certain to contain highly adverse publicity, certain to bring discredit upon the company if they're sued in one form or another in some manner or another. 
    Now, we have a very interesting situation here after the Court of Appeals in our case held that the controversy was not right, the companion case to be argued next came before the Second Circuit and there Judge Friendly dealt with the very problem that I'm dealing with here, discussed in specific detail, the decision in our Third Circuit case and held quite contrary to the Third Circuit that -- and in the manner in which we say is the appropriate type of holding here that the controversy was right, that there was a judiciable controversy, and that it should be determined now and not at some later time.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="684.141" stopTime="689.228">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And Judge Friendly saw no real distinction between your case and his case, did he?
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="689.228" stopTime="715.247">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    On the question of the rightness Mr. Justice Stewart, of the controversy, there are substantial differences between the two proceedings (Voice Overlap) but on the questions of whether this type of threat from a regulation creates a right controversy, there was agreement -- there is agreement, and the two cases are all the same.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="715.247" stopTime="720.701">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, you agree and Judge Friendly agrees, I think counsel in the next case don't entirely agree.
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="720.701" stopTime="750.575">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    Counsel in the next case have a very trouble some problem because they have numerous factual issues and they seek to distinguish the two cases I suppose because of that. 
    In our situation, unlike theirs, there is no confusion as to the meaning of the statute in its – or the regulation in its operations. 
    There is no further proceedings before any court, there is nothing to determine except what this statutes means.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What do you -- how do you draw the line Mr. Gessell between administrative actions that are reviewable on injunction and administrative actions where you have to wait until summing -- the actions taken by the agency, what's the -- how would you define it as theoretical or general manner?
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="770.878" stopTime="785.097">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    Well, as I read the Administrative Procedure Act to start there, if the process of rule making is complete, this Court has said that is a final agency action.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="785.097" stopTime="790.344">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Would you apply it only in the cases where there has been rule making?

    I think that is all we have before us here --

    Well, how --
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="792.878" stopTime="805.905">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    -- I am sure there are types of -- there are types of agency action short of rule making which perhaps because of their emergency character or something else would fall in a different basis.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="805.905" stopTime="856.623">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, let's go to another field. 
    Let's suppose the Securities and Exchange Commission adopts a rule that affects the securities industry or rule let's say regulating brokers in some way or other, is it your theory that when that rule making process is completed, the brokers may bring an injunctive action and that the Court have jurisdiction to entertain that and that the brokerage companies have standing to maintain it and that the controversy is right without waiting for the SEC to take action against a particular company?
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="856.623" stopTime="857.436">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    Oh, yes and it is --

    No.

    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    No. 
    No Mr. Justice Fortas, that issue specifically has been decided by this Court in three cases, Columbia Broadcasting, Frozen Foods and Storer have all dealt with that question and have all decided that the controversy was right. 
    There, there were rules by the Federal Communications Commission for example in both Storer and Columbia Broadcasting that specified that a station could only -- broadcasting company could only own so many stations or that a certain types of contracts would be considered improper and a license would be canceled if the matter came up. 
    And the Court in both of those instances said that the matter was right and it could be --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    No --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes. 
    But now, let's -- let me take this with you again looking forward and you're thinking of all many of those cases. 
    But I suppose that when you come to test, let's suppose that to get in the proceeding on the merits here, you get beyond the purely semantic question of whether on its face the statute supported what the Commission had did here, and you get to a question of reasonableness, and that is raised by your complaint here, isn't it?

    Yes we do.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="995.980" stopTime="1020.069">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright. 
    Now, in order to evaluate that allegation, wouldn't it be necessary to consider the specific impact of the regulation upon specific products and specific industry problems and may -- may not that be the difference between this case and the cases to which you referred?
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="1020.069" stopTime="1036.580">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    Well, I think not for two reasons. 
    In the first place, in this case our allegations on which we rest our charges of unreasonableness all conceded. 
    It's conceded this is confusing, it's conceded that this --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1036.580" stopTime="1038.239">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You mean the Commissioner concedes --
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="1038.239" stopTime="1038.829">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    Yes --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1038.829" stopTime="1038.941">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- that this is --
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="1038.941" stopTime="1045.357">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    -- the cross motions for summary judgment here and all of our allegations of our complaint are accepted as fact.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1045.357" stopTime="1052.232">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, that's kind of extraordinary isn't it that Commissioner would concede that his own regulation is confusing?
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="1052.232" stopTime="1427.913">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    Well, Your Honor I think the reason for it, I think it isn't extraordinary because it is confusing. 
    But I think the reason -- the reason for it is that the Secretary has taken the position from the beginning that this is the only interpretation which the statute permits. 
    This is not an economic regulation, this is not a regulation dealing with questions of safety, this is not a regulation that says, we really think we have to do this in our expertise. 
    This is a regulation that issues because he says, this is what the statute means, it's the only thing it means, and this is the way it has to run. 
    Now, I would also say this in response to Your Honor's question that where you have issues of fact and I would think perhaps that would be the case in many of the type of situation you postulated, this statute provides that there has to be, in the rule making process, an evidentiary type hearing and then that is reviewed by a Court of Appeals. 
    We have now an evidence -- any underlying evidentiary hearing for this regulation whatsoever. 
    This is just a mandatory direction from the Secretary as to how he proposes to enforce this particular provision of the statute. 
    And since there is nothing on which to take testimony, nothing on which to concern ourselves except what the statute means, it seems to me that this is the way an industry should be proceed to get a standard rule of conduct determined when the Secretary attempts to impose that illegally. 
    And it's -- it's rather amusing here that when the defendants here are turned in an -- because they're rather troubled by this decision of the Third Circuit, they don't support it in many particulars, when they turn to the question of the merits which was not before the Court in the cert petition but they say, “Well, why don't -- why don't you decide the merits while you're here”, they say this is a simple case. 
    There's no controversy, the public interest requires it to be promptly determined, and let's go at it and decide it. 
    And I almost wondered whether the same person wrote the first part of the brief that wrote the second part because you can't -- in the context of this case, there is nothing in our -- to argue about as to the meaning of the regulation, as to the reasons for the regulation, and it's a pure question of statutory interpretation. 
    The other aspect of our case concerns whether or not Congress precluded this type of review. 
    And I would like in few brief moments to deal with that question. 
    We have in this statute a saving's clause which states the remedies provided for at this subsection, this is on page 6 (a) of my appendix shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies provided by law. 
    The entire legislative history is full of discussion about the right to bring injunctive actions, declaratory judgment actions, no report of Congress, no words in the statute are designed in any way to say that the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act do not apply here. 
    And we are unable to see how particularly in the face of the saving clause which we believe has general application and the debates that one can say that Congress must have intended, the Government says or we must assume they say. 
    Well, there's no basis for such assumptions, no basis for that intention, and that the literature of this Court is full of declarations that say we want a favor the right of citizens to review actions of regulatory bodies. 
    And I would like just for a moment before you adjourn for lunch to leave this thought with you, I've been mitigating around this country a good deal in the last few years and it's a surprising thing to see the number of times, the Government is seeking to prevent a fair test of their power or their right to do something. 
    They raise sovereign immunity, they raise standing to sue, they raise venue questions, they raise questions of who should be the party. 
    And the atmosphere was not unlike that with I heard in this Court last Thursday with respect to the question of this Court's mandate in El Paso. 
    The fact of the matter is this Government attitude is that we want to have it our way, we want to make businessmen knuckle under and comply to illegal regulations because we have all these indirect and subversive opportunities to force compliance, and we hope that everybody relied on, we hope that everybody will not challenge the statute that enough people will be frightened to adhere to the regulation even when it's invalid and thus we'll have a long period of administrative compliance which will support the regulation. 
    Thank you.

    The answer to your question Mr. Justice White is yes but the factors that lead us to the view that review is necessary now are the desirability of uniformity in this industry and the desirability of avoiding the hazards and the disadvantages that come and attend in publicity to come if you're sued criminally or if all your goods are involved in multiple seizures.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In this case and the one immediately following it, the company subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act have brought actions in District Courts the challenge formal a regulation issued by the Food and Drug Administration which construe or interpret various terms of reason amendments for that Act. 
    In neither of the cases has the Food and Drug Administration or the Attorney General apply any of the challenge constructions in any concrete manner to any of the plaintiffs in the case. 
    In neither instance, have any of the three remedies authorized by the Act, seizure of misbranded or adulterated goods, injunction against their future distribution, or criminal prosecution been instituted by the Attorney General against any of the plaintiffs. 
    The plaintiffs in both cases contend however that since the regulations reflected the considered views of the agency and since obedience to these regulations would require them to change their way of doing business in some fashion, they are entitled to bring actions at this juncture to determine whether the regulations are valid.

    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    The issue of rightness which is common about these cases is one, which is this Court noted well ago in the Rochester Telephone case in 327 U.S. is not limited to administrative regulations or administrative law problems but applies across the Board to a variety of instances in which statutes maybe construed. 
    Let me turn first then to these generally applicable principles of rightness in the context of this case. 
    The statute involved in this case --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1995.730" stopTime="1998.454">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What do you mean precisely about rightness?

    Whether, Mr. Justice Black, whether the issue presented the legal issue which is presented for decision by the Court is appropriate to be heard now or at some point when it's more definite and certain who is hurt and how they're hurt. 
    We submit that this Court has held in a variety of instances and properly so that hypothetical or future harms to a person or to a -- to a plaintiff in any suit are not the stuff of which adjudication is made and that it's appropriate ordinarily to wait until a party is individually and specifically harmed in some definite manner and --

    I think there is a case or controversy in the -- in maybe in a broad sense of what case or controversy means. 
    Of course this Court has at times --

    Well, that's.

    (Voice Overlap) District Court in its declaratory judgment action could the exercise of discretion and not to entertain.
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="2081.023" stopTime="2150.148">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    Well, that --that's established law under the Declaratory Judgment Act certainly. 
    But I think it goes beyond that Mr. Justice White, that Court generally exercise their discretion when cases are not exercised at discretion. 
    But they do not entertain premature suits. 
    They do not entertain actions which although there is according to the plaintiff's complaint a present difference with the Government agency or with the defendant nonetheless a plaintiff is not adequately harmed at just that precise time and will be able to challenge the regulation in the future. 
    I think that's a key element here, that there is really nobody is suggesting, and Mr. Gessell as at various times adverted to improper or suggested that there's some impropriety in the Government putting off the decision in this case. 
    Now, of course this is not a case in which this regulation will never be tested. 
    The only question is whether it should be tested now or in a particular suit involving a particular label in which the Food and Drug Administration and the Attorney General determined that under the Food and Drug Administration's construction of this Act, that label violates the statute.

    Suppose it's true?

    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    Well, we think -- we think he's focusing on the wrong thing Mr. Justice Black. 
    He's saying he suffers irreparable injury if he obeys the regulation. 
    The real question is does he suffer irreparable injury if he waits until that later action when he can challenge the regulation. 
    And we say he does not suffer irreparable injury within the meaning of this Court's ordinary rightness decisions if he waits until later. 
    In other words, there's no question Mr. Justice Black that if he listens to this regulation and he follows it that he will have to change the label he is now using.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2208.824" stopTime="2208.949">

    Yes.

    What we theoretically might occur if that's the law.

    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    True. 
    But we think that danger of being prosecuted criminally is precisely the kind of injury that any person who is theoretically subject to a criminal statute can allege. 
    A very perfect recent instance we think Mr. Justice Black is what this Court did has done in the travel to Cuba regulations. 
    In Zemel and Rusk, the plaintiff in that suit brought an action against the Secretary of State seeking to have -- the travel to Cuba restriction declared not only invalid in the sense that he wanted to have his passport validated to Cuba, but also seeking ruling from the Court, a declaratory judgment that would it would not violate Section 215, the Immigration Nationality Act for him to travel to Cuba. 
    This Court very clearly held that it was premature to consider that challenge to the Criminal statute at that point although he was subject to the harm of criminal prosecution if he then traveled to Cuba which he had every intention according to him --

    Seizure in chaos (ph) in any case of misbranding, seizing a shipment or whatever product, a carton of the goods and having a suit, a viable action then in the District Court in which the Attorney General is required to establish that the drugs are misbranded and therefore subject to seizure. 
    Now, they would not be Mr. Gessell spoke of multiple seizures. 
    Multiple seizures are not authorized in these circumstances. 
    Multiple seizures are authorized under the statute only when the drug that's being sold is hazardous or dangerous to health in some way. 
    When the only misbranding that's involved is a violation of this kind of a statute or as construed by the regulation, there is no authority from multiple seizures. 
    So the only possibility here on the civil side and it's been the consistent practice of the Attorney General of the Food and Drug Administration to apply civil remedies when there are litigable issues of construction of a statute of this kind.

    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    No, none. 
    None.

    No.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- or injunction or criminal prosecution?
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="2530.063" stopTime="2556.775">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    When the Food and Drug Administration believes that a drug company is violating the Act, it has those remedies. 
    A drug company subject to an order which is of the legislative Congress before, and the one specifically enumerated in the statute where there is delegated to the Food and Drug Administration, the power to promulgate regulation regarding deleterious substances, ordinarily has review by way of the specific remedy provided in the statute which is in the Court of Appeals.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2556.775" stopTime="2637.760">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I understand that. 
    Now, is there any way -- the question I was trying to get at with Mr. Gessell is this, if this Court should hold that the injunctive remedy is available in the present case, would it also follow or would it not that an injunctive remedy is available in other cases under the Food and Drug Administration. 
    For example, suppose Food and Drug Administration decides that the inclusion of certain type of ingredient and the certain type of Drug may result in great injury to the population, maybe poisonous or cause all sorts of damage. 
    And somebody brings an injunctions suit to enjoin the enforcement of that, is that case the same as the case we have before us or is it different? 
    If we hold in the present case that an injunctive proceeding lies, does it follow that where Food and Drug says you cannot get out a drug and call it so and so if it contains such and such an ingredient, that injunctive proceeding wouldn't be in that case, we're just trying perhaps not very well --
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="2637.760" stopTime="2638.010">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    As I understand --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2638.010" stopTime="2639.382">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- as I have asked with Mr. Gessell.
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="2639.382" stopTime="2758.033">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    Yes. 
    As I understand the petitioner's rationale, I think it would have to apply in that case although in your circumstances Mr. Justice Fortas there are other remedies provide in the statute in which a drug company can review but I think that precisely in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question that's precisely our main ground of objection here Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    The Food and Drug Administration would be delighted to have an authoritative determination of -- by a court of -- at least the validity of this regulation. 
    And it turns out in this case that such a determination in this particular suit would affect and buying most of the large drug companies in the United States and would authoritatively settle the every time question. 
    The real problem though is what a holding of this kind opens the doors to because if this suit can be brought in this case by 27 of the large drug companies in the United States, there is nothing to prevent suit being brought tomorrow by any one of those drug companies against any other regulation of the federal -- of the Food and Drug Administration. 
    Indeed, against any other interpretative regulation or indeed against even another clause in this very regulation. 
    This regulation was issued by the Food and Drug Administration as part of a whole sequence of regulations administering the drug amendments of 1962. 
    Drug companies were given the opportunity to provide to supply written comments to those proposed regulations. 
    They objected not merely that every time regulation but they objected also to the requirement in this regulation that the generic name appear in conjunction with the brand name that it appear in brackets or parenthesis. 
    Now, they are not involved in the suit, but as a matter of fact if this Court were to hold that this suit can be maintained is absolutely nothing to stop any one of these drug companies from bringing another suit tomorrow or the day after to declare that provision unjustified, impermissible under the statute.

    So that is it fair to say that in the sense what is being -- what petitioners are seeking to have the Court's rule on is a there's a question which can I use this without invading his abstract in the sense that they're asking us to rule that the secretary's construction of the statute is unjustified as an abstract matter and that we allow -- we do no take into account whether in view of actual examples, actual factual record, the construction -- the Secretary's construction of the statute as within the area of rational judgment that some people urge is a factor in construing the propriety of the exercise of delegated power.

    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    Right. 
    I was just coming to that Mr. Justice White, that irrespective of the questions of rightness that apply generally and would apply to none and to actions not affecting administrative agency, in this case, the Food and Drug Act, both Congress and this Court have recognized that suits of this kind brought out of the usual course, prematurely will do serious harm to the administration of an Act which had a substantial, remedial impact on the nation's consumers in this entire area. 
    In Mytinger and Casselberry in 339, U.S., this Court specifically noted that really are held that in a case which was far more right really than this one in the sense that they were really two adversaries contesting a particular product at a point in time when the Food and Drug Administration was proceeding against that product. 
    Nonetheless this Court held that it would be undermining the intent of Congress under the Food and Drug and Cosmetic Act to allow review at that point. 
    And we think that the entire legislative history of this Act demonstrates as much because there was much tugging and pulling in Congress before Section 701 (f) which provides the judicial review of only very limited number of orders was finally enacted.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3258.755" stopTime="3259.378">

    The natural tendencies of administrator and I don't see it -- I don't say that's in any disparaging way as to get submission rather than context and that this strategy was designed, I imagine, to get sufficient acceptance?

    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    Yes.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And, Mr. Lewin, is it fair -- is it fair to say that that is the underlying idea of the Food and Drug Act and that the Act has somewhere in some respects a peculiar place in our regulatory system, that is to say I don't know of hand of any other statute that has -- this prompt seizure power (Inaudible), but isn't that bound in with the purpose of the statute dealing with in their old days that was justified on the grounds you were dealing with dangerous drugs. 
    And they proved that it might be dangerous. 
    And you do now have extra ordinary procedures here because of that, isn't that right?
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="3326.057" stopTime="3362.941">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    That's right and we think that the -- that the fact, the review scheme that the statute provide we think is really exclusive at to these kinds of procedures the kind of proceeding is calculated to get expeditious resolution of this -- of these kind of questions because if this suit had not been brought when it was it would've been a matter of weeks or months before an application would have been made for a new drug or would have been passed on by the Food and Drug Administration, it would've been up in the Court of Appeals, and this very regulation in all its parts would've been before the Court of Appeals for review.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Yes.
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="3401.872" stopTime="3410.974">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    -- an irreparable harm. 
    There was a Fish or Cut Bait position that the defendants in those cases may have been put in to, where the people were subject to those regulations.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3410.974" stopTime="3413.115">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    And it hadn't been applied to it, I don't believe, isn't it?

    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    Pardon?
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3413.843" stopTime="3415.312">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    They hadn't even been applied to it?
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="3415.312" stopTime="3460.631">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    They hadn't been applied. 
    But on the other hand those particular individuals or plaintiffs in those suits had to make at that point decisions which --repercussions of which would be felt only later. 
    In other words, the Columbia Broadcasting System for example, the plaintiff in the Columbia Broadcasting System case would have to sever its contract with the variety of licensees if it was going to obey that order. 
    If it was going to wait until later to test it, assuming then that the time that had lapse that they waited until they actually felt the pinch of that regulation, they would have irrevocably loss certain options that were opened to them at that stage. 
    I think the clearest illustration of this is not a case in this Court but is in the Nash-Finch case which the petitioners --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3460.631" stopTime="3461.127">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    On what?
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="3461.127" stopTime="3544.518">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    -- rely on. 
    The Nash-Finch case in 288 F.2d, where the Federal Trade Commission had issued a regulation saying, that they construed the statute as in effect of waiving all rights unless the party sought review within 60 days in a Court of Appeals. 
    Now, if you waited until you felt the pinch of that regulation, you would lose your time to review in the Court of Appeals. 
    So, in those cases, those are the kinds of instances we think with the delay itself works the harm. 
    In other words, if delay really having those questions reviewed later rather than now is what causes harm, then we think you're entitled to possibly to go in an earlier stage and seek -- and seek relief at that stage. 
    But if there's no harm caused from the delay other than possibility of seizure which this Court held in Mytinger and Casselberry under the Food and Drug Act was not enough to give you the right to go in and sue in advance even though it might harm your reputation, then we don't have a right to go into that stage. 
    Frozen Food Express presents a closer question but we nonetheless think that in that case because the Commission has enforcement power itself because there was a separate statute authorized in review unlike -- broadly of all Commission orders, for that reason we think Frozen Food Express might be distinguished from the present case.

    Mr. Lewin, I think if the petitioners argue that the Congress specified certain pre-enforcement action should take place in the -- pre-enforcement review action to take place in the Court of Appeals but except that for those all other pre-enforcement procedures, or actions, or review should be in the District Court, and you argue that the congressional selection of few to go into Court of Appeals and meant to work to be in the other?
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="3576.611" stopTime="3601.818">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    Well, because we are – and we think it's plain from the legislative history and we try to outline it in our brief that what Congress was concerned with was the delay that would be caused by pre-enforcement judicial review. 
    When Congress moved -- at a very late stage, Congress moved the remedies from the District Courts to the Court of Appeals, it was doing to expedite the enforcement of Food and Drug Regulations, it would as the contrary in that (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3601.818" stopTime="3607.619">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you mean the initial suggestion was that these specified pre-enforcement reviews action should be in the District Court?
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="3607.619" stopTime="3630.531">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    That's right. 
    And that was amended at a very late stage, put them up in the Court of Appeals and the purpose of that was to expedite it. 
    If, on the other hand, what you're doing in the very same breadth is opening the door to a wide variety of actions in the District Courts, then all you're doing is you're adding another level of judicial review, you're slowing down the proceeding, and we think this case and the one that follows it demonstrate quite clearly how that, why that's true.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3630.531" stopTime="3641.136">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But your argument as I take is that if there was general pre-enforcement review procedures available in the District Court, the Congress didn't need to do anything at all.
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="3641.136" stopTime="3643.851">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    That's right, Congress wouldn't have any -- we think the whole fight (Voice Overlap)
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3643.851" stopTime="3647.380">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Unless they wanted to expedite certain ones of it?
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3647.380" stopTime="3660.846">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Always it is clear that the legislative history I thought now that the briefs is quite a scrap, (Inaudible) no judicial review and broad judicial review unless it's compromised.
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="3660.846" stopTime="3713.296">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    Definitely. 
    But we think Mr. Justice Harlan if you take the reading of Section 701 (f) (6) that the petitioners in this case do and that the Second Circuit did in the Toilet Goods case, then that whole scrap becomes utterly meaningless because Congress in the one hand was fighting really tooth-and-nail about exactly which kinds of regulations, you should subject to review in a specific review provision when it was in the other hand just giving away or authorizing companies such as those that are involved in these two cases to institute an action at any time they like in the District Court. 
    That's in effect the consequence of what a petitioner's argument, that Congress was fighting about a specific review provision when it was at the same breadth intending to save a broad range of case and which could always be instituted in the District Court under Declaratory Judgments Act.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3713.296" stopTime="3718.160">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, do you have a broad reservation in the acts of doing that?
speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="3718.160" stopTime="3790.984">
    Mr. Nathan Lewin 
    Yes, but we think what that was intended to reserve in light of the congressional uncertainty at that time as to what would be available, that was intended to preserve we think -- really the remedies -- first of all at (f) (6) Mr. Justice Harlan specifically refers to the remedy in this subsection. 
    In other words, saying that the remedy specifically provided for an (f) (1) are not to derogate from any other remedies available. 
    In other words -- and we think Congress is referring only to review of those kinds of regulations and what Congress was saying we think is that their 90-day-limitations period and all the very specific provisions to review in the Court of Appeals were not to apply in cases where for example the Food and Drug Administration has not followed the procedures outlined in the prior subsection where for example, they hadn't given notice to the parties, they hadn't given them an opportunity to present evidence in those kind of cases or in substantive due process cases of some kind it was still permissible to go into a District Court after the 90-day-period had expired and bring an action.

    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    I would like to deal with two words that have been used this afternoon “premature and abstract” and I'd like to simply give you one example of what the Government said as the way we should deal with this problem. 
    I suffer from gout Mr. Chief Justice and others too, suppose the company has developed a cure for gout and the drug has cleared, they say don't lift that drug on the market because we will not approve the labeling because you don't have generic every time and take that up through the Courts for a period of two to two-and a half years to get these regulations straightened out.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3834.193" stopTime="3913.396">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    If they do that now, won't they Mr. Gessell, with all kinds of regulations and rulings you're going there with the Food and Drug with the new drug application, then you've got to go through the varying process of getting a clearance on that but so far as I know, nobody is ever here before succeeded in getting an injunction against the enforcement of the class of regulations. 
    Now maybe there's something in the legislative history here or the legislation itself that makes this a special case. 
    But I have two questions if so what is it and the second question is if we rule here that in this situation, an injunction proceeding can be maintained, does it or does it not follow that we're giving the drug companies or anybody else who maybe affected an injunctive remedy in cases where for example, Food and Drug Administration says that you cannot market such and such a drug unless you show on the label and under certain uses it's poisonous to people.
speaker="gerhard_a_gessell" startTime="3913.396" stopTime="3924.002">
    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    My answer to that is very clear and simple. 
    In that context, you have to have an evidentiary hearing, you go to a Court of Appeals and that's all there's to it.

    Mr. Gerhard A. Gessell 
    I have dealt with the premature point. 
    Now, it is -- now it is not abstract. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas asked, what is involved in seizure? 
    And he was advised that someone seizes libel-some goods, that isn't all that's involved. 
    We've had two reason seizures against drug companies banner headlines in the Washington Post, The Star, and all the newspapers of the country press releases, background statements, these companies are in the sensitive business. 
    And the necessity of having to meet that kind of publicity barrage or the company's seizure I think is something that creates a real quarrel and a real problem. 
    And as far as multiple seizures are concerned there is plenty opportunity here to seize the drugs in any number of company at the same time, one company, three companies, five companies, 20 companies and the Government is trying to keep total chance to pick and choose to move to determine its strategy hoping in the meantime that by this jawbone enforcement, as Mr. Justice Douglas suggested, people will comply even though they probably clearly in view with the District Judge have gone beyond the law.
