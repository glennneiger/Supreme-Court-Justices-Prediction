Specht v. Patterson
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="35.407">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 831, Francis Eddie Specht, Petitioner, versus Wayne T. Patterson, Warden, et al. 
    Mr. Williams, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="35.407" stopTime="174.889">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Francis Eddie Specht was convicted in Colorado in 1959 of the crime of indecent liberties and the statute prescribes the punishment of 10 years for that crime. 
    He was not sentenced under that statute. 
    He was sentenced under the Sex Offender statute to the only sentence allowed by that statute, an indeterminate sentence of one day to life. 
    That statute allows a trial judge to sentence people convicted of the crime of indecent liberties and other crimes. 
    If they fit into a certain classification, the class is a threat to the public if at large or an habitual offender and mentally ill. 
    The issue which Francis Eddie Specht presents to this Court is whether he is entitled to participate by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    In the process by which the trial judges reaches the conclusion that he is in the class eligible for a different sentence, under the Sex Offender statute that is whether he is a threat to the public if at large or an habitual offender and mentally ill. 
    Just a word about the statute, there are certain enumerated offenses, indecent liberties, incest, they're all sex offenses. 
    The statute says that if a person is convicted of one of those offenses then the district judge, and this is in Section 1 of the statutes in the appendix of the brief, if he has of the -- opinion that such a person is a threat to the public if at large or an habitual offender and mentally ill, may in lieu of the sentence provided by the statute defining the crime sentence him under the Sex Offender statute. 
    The Act goes on then to require that the judge have the person psychiatrically examined. 
    It allows him to incarcerate him for a period of time after conviction necessary to have the psychiatric examination conducted --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I think I misunderstood then. 
    First of all, it has to be a conviction of one of the speci --enumerated specified offenses --
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="181.271" stopTime="181.402">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="181.402" stopTime="183.454">

    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="185.380" stopTime="191.081">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Then the trial judge has discretion. 
    He --
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="191.081" stopTime="191.225">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    What?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="191.225" stopTime="201.251">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He can -- he could in this case and he can under the laws if we go ahead and sentence him to whatever sentence the law says shall be -- may be imposed for each one --
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="201.251" stopTime="201.284">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    To this case?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="201.284" stopTime="202.459">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- for each specified offenses.
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="202.459" stopTime="202.873">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="202.873" stopTime="210.752">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But if he'd -- and he has the discretion do that. 
    But otherwise, he doesn't want to do that, what does he do? 
    Does he then have the man examined by a psychiatrist?
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="210.752" stopTime="224.458">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    Yes. 
    Then he has the discretion to initiate the inquiry. 
    That is the way I would say it. 
    He has the discretion to have the man examined psychiatrically. 
    He elects to proceed under this Act is one way to say it --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="224.458" stopTime="224.473">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="224.473" stopTime="262.258">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    -- but that doesn't commit him to giving this sentence under this Act. 
    It's my reading of the Act. 
    Now, that's a different reading in the Third Circuit makes it a Pennsylvania statute which is identical. 
    But he begins to inquire and the Act provides that an information gathering mechanism and that is the psychiatric report and since 1957 but not before 1957, it makes it clear that he gets also a pre-sentence report from the probation department. 
    From 1953 to 1957, the Act did require that and I frankly, I don't know what the practice was.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="262.258" stopTime="271.217">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So -- and then -- so this -- before he can sentence the man under this Act, he has to have that kind of a psychiatric report?
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="271.217" stopTime="271.578">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="271.578" stopTime="280.045">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But on the other hand, even after getting that kind of report, he can decide to sentence him under the original criminal statute, is that right?
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="280.045" stopTime="280.671">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    That's the way I read --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="280.671" stopTime="280.898">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or is the facts so clear --
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="280.898" stopTime="281.801">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    -- the Act, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="281.801" stopTime="283.129">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- under the law?
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="283.129" stopTime="348.508">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    I don't think that there's a Supreme Court case in Colorado saying that because I don't think there's a case that's exactly raised that. 
    But referring, and this is in our brief on page -- begins on page 28 and over the top of 29, Section 5 of the Act, it says, “Whenever a District Court after a psychiatric examination of and report on a person convicted of any one or more of the crimes shall be of the opinion that it would be to the best interest of justice to sentence such a person under the provisions of this Article. 
    He shall cause such person to be arraigned before him and sentenced”. 
    Now, I believe that if you're going to give meaning to that you have to say that after the examination, after this information gathering procedure has occurred, he can then decide that he does not want to sentence him under the Sex Offender statutes. 
    And that emphasizes, Your Honor, the critical aspect that we say that this information gathering process is. 
    The determination whether the man fits this classification and is eligible for this sentencing.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="348.508" stopTime="361.810">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But, let me see if I understand it. 
    He can be sentenced under the statute applicable to the particular offense without the psychiatric examination having been ordered.
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="361.810" stopTime="444.805">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    That's correct. 
    I believe that the pre-sentence investigation report is in every case required by statute. 
    But the psychiatric examination is peculiar to this and this emphasizes in our view, this -- the fact that the statute provides this classification, these standards which this man has to meet before he can be sentenced and provide an information gathering process emphasizes that the legislature meant that these statutes were important and they have to be met and they gave a mechanism to be sure that they were met. 
    And what they didn't do and what the statute doesn't do as construed by the Courts in Colorado was give the person who is convicted a right to participate in that information gathering process by which the judge makes the decision. 
    Now, whether you call it discretion, whether you say he -- that he must be of the opinion, he has to reach a state of mind that that man is in that classification. 
    And we say, let us at least know what information you are facing that up. 
    And if it's wrong, give us a chance to contradict it. 
    And we say that the Fourteenth Amendment entitles us to do this, to participate in this process and to correct errors in information upon which the judge relies.

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Are these separate statutes?
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="447.259" stopTime="457.143">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    The criminal statute in this case, indecent liberties is -- yes. 
    Its 40-2-32 of the Colorado statutes and the Sex Offenders statute is 39-19-1 through 10.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="457.143" stopTime="461.317">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What if they are all the same statutes?
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="461.317" stopTime="549.782">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    Not if they were in the same statute and the same words, no. 
    In other words, if that statute says you can give him 10 years or if you find he's in this class, then you can give him one day to life. 
    My position would be the same because it seems to me that what the legislature has done and the Colorado Supreme Court said this too. 
    As -- they have said they're only certain people you can do this too, threats to the public or habitual offenders and mentally ill. 
    In the Vanderhoof case, citing Colorado and that cited in our brief, the -- that -- that those -- the objection made by Mr. Vanderhoof, he said, "This Act is unconstitutional because it just gives the judge carte blanche to do what he wants". 
    And the Colorado Supreme Court said, “Oh, no, it doesn't. 
    He merely finds a fact. 
    The legislature has made the classification”. 
    And so we say that because that fact -- well, in one of the phrase of this Court is of critical importance. 
    He is entitled to participate in the decision-making process. 
    In another line of authority in this Court, the recidivist cases it's essentially independent of the fact of conviction. 
    The fact that he is a threat to the public or an habitual offender and mentally ill. 
    And this Court has said that in those cases, the person is entitled to participate because of the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment in the decision-making process.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="549.782" stopTime="558.227">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In this case, was it found that he -- which was it found, that he was --constituted as threat or bodily harm to the members of the public or that he was a habitual offender and mentally ill?

    However, Your Honor, it says really what it did -- adminis -- it used to be before 1957 that the trial court said which date -- institution the man went to and he could send to a hospital or the appropriate institution. 
    In 1957, when they amended the statute, they say you can send them to the penitentiary but the Parole Board must within six months review the case and decide on an appropriate institution. 
    As a matter of fact, however, Your Honor, we don't know why Francis Eddie Specht was sent and the record does show that he was sent in November of 1959 to the penitentiary and he was there until the record shows 1964.

    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The Colorado statute is identical in all material respects I think to the Pennsylvania statute, the Barr-Walker Act. 
    The Barr-Walker Act was enacted in 1951; the Colorado statute in 1953. 
    And I think the copy -- the Third Circuit considered the Barr-Walker Act in the case of United States against Maroney, which is cited in our brief, and they said that this process, this Act, wherein when a man is convicted of a crime, then an inquiry is made whether he has some additional characteristics, some additional attributes, maybe he has them, he gets a much more severe punishment. 
    They said that would define a new criminal status. 
    And because it's a new criminal status, he has to have the entire -- the full panoply of procedural rights consistent with that then they argued about the question of whether the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the right to jury trial and they didn't agree on that but they agreed on everything else. 
    And if that's correct, this is the same case. 
    As I indicated, the recidivist cases are relevant, pertinent that it -- this is an -- as punishment at the very least. 
    Well, I won't say it the very least because I've got another position at the very least and that's the Kent case. 
    And this is at least a decision of critical importance to the man whether he's going to be a definite sentence. 
    Ten years, and all he has to do is wait and he's out or whether its one day and life and under this statute, he can't be free. 
    No absolute release unless in the words of the statute, “The interest of society and the welfare” -- the dictates of justice in a welfare society dictate it that he be free otherwise the best he can get is parole, supervised freedom. 
    Its --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="808.738" stopTime="816.366">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    This cannot go to (Inaudible)?
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="816.366" stopTime="960.168">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    That's correct. 
    Interesting -- interestingly enough however, the Colorado Supreme Court has said he has not bound by that psychiatrist's opinion. 
    And that's that the case of Trueblood against Tinsley, the first Colorado case in which the constitutionality of this statute was before the Colorado Court and in that case, the psychiatrist report said this man is not mentally ill and it didn't say that he was a threat to the public. 
    Now, it was somewhat ambiguous I think on whether it was enough of a basis to -- well, whether it was required, it affirmatively said that he's a threat to the public. 
    But the Colorado Supreme Court said, “We're going to accept your argument, Mr. Trueblood that this psychiatrist report doesn't -- really affirmatively support the judge's action but the judge isn't bound by it.” 
    Actually, I think they were saying the same thing here that the same instruction we give to juries in Colorado every time there's an expert witness. 
    Say, you're the trier of fact and you can hear all the facts and you can accept that expert's opinion as it appeals to your reason and intellect. 
    And I think they were saying the same thing here to the judge or that -- to Mr. Trueblood, they're saying the judge can decide the facts on the basis of his and the rest. 
    And as far as I know, the rest was as a pre-sentence investigation report. 
    The authority that has been -- I won't say, consistently say that against us because the first time that was decided against us, it -- is in the Tenth Circuit by Judge Murray is the case of Williams against New York in which this Court said that -- I think that was a pretty narrow holding. 
    It was the question in -- the holding in that case that the judge can't consider information developed out of court. 
    That he is not limited to listening to information developed in court with cross-examination. 
    But that holding has been expanded by the Tenth Circuit and is argued before this Court in a greatly expanded sense to justify a procedure where not only is the judge considered the information developed out of court but he doesn't tell you what it is? 
    You can't see it if you asked so there's no way of knowing it if it's wrong. 
    Now --

    It would have bearing in this sense, Your Honor. 
    It would certainly authorize the judge to consider as an initial matter the pre-sentence investigation report and the psychiatrist report.

    He is a danger to the community and makes the finding.

    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    Well, I would say that he better have something else beside the psychiatrist report that the Supreme Court concede because in the case of Trueblood against Tinsley, they say -- they said, and I think all they had there was a psychiatrist report and the pre-sentence investigation report and they said we have looked at this record and there is sufficient in here to justify the judge reaching this conclusion in spite of some of this language of the psychiatrist. 
    But well, there's that case and then there's the -- there's the Ray case where it's clear that the Court does look at this and I think in the Sutton case and they do look for those are all habeas corpus not on direct appeal; they are all Rule 35 motions to modify, vacate or amend the sentence. 
    But they looked at it. 
    But I -- as I read the Colorado cases, Your Honor, if -- the judge went against here -- there was no indication in any of that then I'd say, yes, he'd -- he would have trouble of it. 
    But I would still object. 
    I still object to the procedure because that doesn't really give you the -- at the proper level the right to intervene.

    Mr. John E. Bush 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The Colorado sentencing of Sex Offenders Act is a statute which provides solely and simply for imposition of an indeterminate sentence. 
    It is our position that this indeterminate sentence stands on the same basis as any other indeterminate sentence, a matter which has become common place, a common place practice throughout the country, in particular the federal system. 
    The indeterminate sentence provided is one which we consider to be responsive to the -- in liking the approach to sentencing. 
    We can compare this form of sentence with the older form of sentence and find that this is a sentence which rejects the concept of punishment and retribution and substitutes in its place that control and discipline. 
    It's a plan's rigidity with flexibility. 
    The discretionary decision to impose the sentence under the Sex Offender Act is measured by specific standard set forth in the Act which is in contrast to the orthodox Colorado sentence where the fixing of the indeterminate sentence is within the plenary control of complainery -- discretionary control of the trial court. 
    We therefore offer --

    The -- this is the -- it has the same legal operative effect.

    One other additional benefit which accrues under this type of sentence is that referred to by opposing counsel and this we submit is a decision. 
    The decision imposed sentence is one which is reviewable by the Supreme Court in the sense of any fact finding process or decision-making process, discretionary of the trial court. 
    Whereas, other sentences, the classic sentence or the Orthodox sentence in Colorado is not reviewable.

    The examination is conducted and it is principally at the Colorado Psychopathic Hospital in Denver, to the medical school but the Court can commit him any other place or private psychiatric institution or any place else. 
    Pre-sentence Report is prepared in the meantime by the Probation Department. 
    Both reports are filed in the Court. 
    Hearing is set for imposition of sentencing and at that point in time, the Court has three alternatives to sentence him under the -- which is 40 days, 2 days, 30 -- to the Indecent Liberty Statute, grant probation or sentence him under the Act of sentencing those sex offenders.

    Mr. John E. Bush 
    This is correct, Your Honor. 
    The sentence speaks by statute. 
    The question in our judgment presented is, does a sentencing statute re -- which responds to the enlighten approach to sentencing of undue process? 
    In resolving this question, petitioner assumes the stance that most of the critics of this form of statute or of the other form, which is normally called the Sex Psychopath statute, assume and we think that the fundamental error of approach of this -- of the petitioner in this case is that he confused on statutory scheme with the statutory scheme provided by the statutes which are commonly known as the “Sex Psychopath Laws”. 
    The Sex Psychopath Laws, however, are civil commitment proceedings. 
    They are not sentencing statutes. 
    These statutes provides for the basis for commitment. 
    Under the Colorado law, the conviction provides the basis for commitment. 
    Very obviously, in the petitioner's case, the panoply of civil rights -- of due process rights, attached to his trial. 
    We submit that upon conviction, he has then subject to whatever sentence the legislature has in its discretion determined. 
    Referring to the statutes which are generally talked about as Sex Psychopath Laws, one is a civil commitment proceeding similar to the type considered by the Court in Minnesota Ex-rail Pearson versus Probate Court. 
    The basic scheme there provided is that a petition is filed and the petition is usually based upon the allegation of a criminal charge. 
    And it's interesting to note that in these proceedings, no requirement has ever made that that charged be ever established. 
    Yet, this can form a basis for a man's commitment. 
    The second is a civil commitment procedure which operates ancillary to a criminal case. 
    This letter form takes two shapes. 
    One is set in motion by a petition prior to conviction; the other permits the filing of a petition to commit after conviction. 
    Some provide that if commit -- civil commitment is ordered, the criminal charges are dismissed. 
    However, the majority of states provide that when recovery is affected, the defendant is remanded to the trial court for either trial or execution of his sentence, a procedure, which in our judgment is, could be said and has been said by some to be self-defeating. 
    In any event, this discussion in our judgment serves to show -- to establish only one thing and that is what procedure or what scheme the state adopts is a matter of wisdom of policy, one which should be addressed properly to the state legislature.

    The initial -- under the statute, the initial place of commitment is the State Penitentiary, the Parole Board then is charged with the duty to transfer or retransfer between any of the state or institution based upon the need for treatment, rehabilitation and control which gives rise to another very good point. 
    And that is, that this statute permits the full range of state facilities to be available to this individual if it is a program necessary simply a vocational training in order to increase the one's maturation as some psychiatrist say it's the most pro -- it is the problem in many of the cases of sex offender -- purely and simply lack of maturation. 
    And, vocational training will suffice as the necessary rehabilitation then the man may be transferred to the state reformatory and undertake a vocational training program.

    Sure --
speaker="john_e_bush" startTime="2977.485" stopTime="3238.396">
    Mr. John E. Bush 
    -- clear up one point. 
    We have always addressed ourselves to a question of substantive due process. 
    Is the statute valid on its face unless it, by words and phrases, explicitly require a second trial? 
    Now this has been the question that has been addressed to the Court. 
    Now, apparently petitioner is benevolent in his attitude. 
    First, we went to the benefit of the Pennsylvania Court which is a procedural due process question purely and simply. 
    And then, we end up in our reply brief saying that all that is required is substantial justice. 
    Well, we have never denied the sense of substantial justice should not be afforded. 
    We should never deny the due process, should not afforded. 
    We think due process should be afforded in each and every stage of the proceedings. 
    The question is, what is the shape and form of due process which attaches to sentencing. 
    I think the Court very clearly said what that is in Townson versus Berg and that is a question of fair play. 
    The same questions here addressed to the Court, we think, were disposed of in Wanes versus New York and Wanes versus Oklahoma. 
    We think that the Third Circuit draws a very insubstantial distinction to justify its finding or its determination that this is a separate trial. 
    And of course, the Court does not tell us what is the quantity or quality or shape performed of due process which attaches to the second trial. 
    So it's difficult for us to respond to it. 
    In any event, the Court drew the analogy, the principal premise and their -- so logistic approach was that they drew analogy between this law and the habitual criminal law and relied on these Court's decisions in Oyler and Fretag, Chandler versus Fretag. 
    We say number one, the Third Circuit misinterpreted the holdings in those two decisions. 
    I think the only question addressed to the Court in both of those decisions was whether or not the defendant was entitled to counsel. 
    And the Oyler case that went on that he was also entitled to reasonable notice which we would think would be obvious under any sentencing hearing in order to have effective assistance of counsel. 
    Very obviously, he must have a reasonable notice of the hearing. 
    Going to the procedurals, the third point, in any event as to habitual criminal act, why do we say that it is not analogous? 
    We say that we would like to be unshackled from the habitual criminal law. 
    This, the habitual criminal law has one purpose in mind and that is punishment alone. 
    We submit that it represents the past. 
    We have tried to reject the habitual criminal law. 
    It has essentially become functus oficio in Colorado and we have gone almost entirely to the indeterminate type sentence. 
    So if we're bound by, as the Third Circuit says the habitual criminal law, then we will be mired so to speak in the past and will be unable to progress to the future. 
    The other is, there's a finding of fact and we say this is unsubstantial/insubstantial. 
    If this is true, Colorado can overcome that point by the simple device of eliminating the statute. 
    Well, it's a separate statutory section. 
    Well, we can eliminate that objection too by a simple device of amending the indecent liberty statute and adding thereto most of our statute, statute providing or I won't say most but many of our statutes providing for sentencing or in separate sections.

    Well, that's a generic word, Your Honor.

    In the classic -- oh, I'm discussing now on the classic sentence of a hearing to impose sentence, which very obviously he is entitled to counsel. 
    He is entitled to notice. 
    Very obviously, he has notice of the nature of the proceedings. 
    Ordinarily, he is entitled to the information upon which sentencing will be imposed. 
    Colorado has never denied that this information should be withheld from the defendant. 
    And in practice, it is uniformly done throughout the state. 
    We submit to the Court of the -- excuse me.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="john_e_bush" startTime="3364.073" stopTime="3437.737">
    Mr. John E. Bush 
    Well, it is not necessarily, Your Honor. 
    I'd like to clear that up. 
    It is not necessarily an ex parte record of the probation report. 
    The pre-sentence report is designed to serve the purpose of the defendant and most defendants are satisfied with it. 
    Now if the unusual circumstances arise where he wishes to correct or add to it, most courts will permit that. 
    So it is not necess-- it is not an ex parte in that sense. 
    Firstly, ordinarily, he has knowledge of all the information contained in that pre-sentence report. 
    He makes known to the Probation Department what information he wishes to have here. 
    It's the normal probation process. 
    The Probation Department interviews his family, his employer and so forth and ordinarily, all of the information that he could have -- could cared to have in -- have before is contained in here the very limited circumstances he is dissatisfied. 
    This I cannot represent that it is dissatisfied that he would be guaranteed the right to subpoena witnesses to correct. 
    It is normal. 
    He would normally do that.

    Mr. John E. Bush 
    This is the normal practice. 
    It is not by specific rule. 
    In Denver, where about 40% of the criminal cases arise at the State of Colorado, it's been in that practice for as long as the man can remember. 
    There have been during practices in some counties, smaller counties, by verbal directive of the chief -- of then Chief Justice two years ago, they were directed as to all counties that they be made available. 
    So it is essentially in practice the same as the Court Rule 32.

    Mr. John E. Bush 
    Well, we must take, Your Honor, the allegation of the petitioner as true since it was dismissed on its face by the trial court, by Judge Ray and affirmed on that basis by the Tenth Circuit. 
    His allegation in the complaint, Your Honor, is that the psychiatrist report was made available to his counsel but he did not see it.

    Your Honor, it was not explicit in our rules and as I say, the custom in practice is that he -- this report be made available to defendant's defense counsel.

    But in this case, in this case, was it submitted to the counsel on an understanding that it would not be eventually defended?
speaker="john_e_bush" startTime="3532.596" stopTime="3584.146">
    Mr. John E. Bush 
    To the best, I have consulted with trial judge in this case. 
    This is not a matter of record. 
    The best of his recollection, he made this available to counsel with the stipulation that the conclusions in the report not be made known to the defendant for his own benefit. 
    It was not a question of disclosing or keeping confidential the facts upon which these doctors conclusion rested. 
    And if the counsel was free to make use to that report and the facts contained therein insofar as he saw fit to interrogate the defendant if this is true and so forth, was this done and on and could have tested in any manner the informational process to see if it was designed to elicit the truth as that principles expressed in the Townson case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3584.146" stopTime="3596.875">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose the defendant had found some facts in there that he was satisfied were not true and he has some witnesses who could have disprove, could he – could he brought them in?
speaker="john_e_bush" startTime="3596.875" stopTime="3635.498">
    Mr. John E. Bush 
    Well this, Your Honor, I would say a matter of discretion in the trial court. 
    I would submit that the Townson versus Berg decision is binding on the states and that it must be a process which is designed to elicit the truth and if there are sound basis upon which that informational process should be corrected or supplemented, then in my judgment be abuse it'd discretion to be denied this type of an evidentiary hearing. 
    But again, it's a qualified right. 
    We use -- the defendant would have to show a substantial basis for and not just waste the Court's time. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Michael A. Williams
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3635.498" stopTime="3637.629">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Williams.
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="3637.629" stopTime="3787.938">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    May I respond to that, Your Honor? 
    The inference here is that he would have had the right that Colorado courts might let him see that psychiatrist report. 
    In his petition, in this page 7 of the record, he says, “In Court, counsel for petitioner and the District Attorney were reading the hospital's report. 
    The petitioner attempted to read the same over his counsel shoulder. 
    The Court had much. 
    Petitioner Mr. Specht, report is solely for your counsel and District Attorney. 
    Behind this legal wire certain of secrecy. 
    Petitioner was sentence”. 
    That's what he says here. 
    And as Mr. Bush says, there'd be no evidentiary hearing. 
    When he responded to this in the federal court, he didn't say that so specifically or that is so specifically just said. 
    Everything that isn't admitted is denied. 
    And that was his response to their. 
    And -- and if we're going to go, Your Honor, we have the Supreme Court record, that Francis Eddie Specht put before the Supreme Court of Colorado when he said this sentence is unconstitutional and one of the reasons that he said that's unconstitutional is because he says that he was not able to look at the psychiatrist report. 
    That's in his brief. 
    And Mr. Bush, well, I don't know if Mr. Bush or the Attorney General wrote the brief. 
    Responding to that, and I said, on the petitioner's report, he alleges that the sentencing procedure denied him equal protection of laws and due process. 
    This first phase is for this attack is that at the time of sentencing. 
    He was not afforded due process. 
    This assertion is apparently based on a false premise that the sentencing must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the trial such as examination of the psychiatrist report and the right to cross-examining the expert's submitting a report. 
    We know of no principle which requires an opportunity to be heard as to the information upon which the judge may properly rely or utilized in determining the proper sentence. 
    That's what the Attorney General said in the Supreme Court of Colorado and the Supreme Court of Colorado in their opinion says, Mr. Specht several contentions as to the constitutionality of the statute are not properly founded. 
    So, they clearly said and he has said consistently, “I ought to be able to look and I ought to know”. 
    And the Supreme Court of Colorado said, “No, sir”. 
    Our basic point is that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3787.938" stopTime="3790.477">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you leave that record with the Court?
speaker="michael_a_williams" startTime="3790.477" stopTime="3837.983">
    Mr. Michael A. Williams 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Is that the -- this may be an unlikely response to sentencing. 
    The legislature has put some limits on the judge and he said if you're going to do this, we want to be sure we've got the right guys. 
    We've expressed ourselves in general and we say 10 years of indecent liberties but we're going to give you the power to do more than that. 
    There are some peop -- they've given standards. 
    The Supreme Court of Colorado said those are legislative standards; it's a fact finding process and all we say is that important. 
    We are getting to the Act. 
    We don't have the right to help. 
    Make sure that that information of which those findings are made is correct in a traditional way that we do these things in this country.
