    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    I represent --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="21.721" stopTime="25.345">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Redfield, you may proceed.
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="25.345" stopTime="270.452">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    I represent seven magazines whose names appear in the title of this action, as well as their publishers. 
    All of these magazines were published outside of the State of Arkansas and all the publishers are non-residence of Arkansas. 
    Six of them are from New York and one is from Connecticut. 
    Yet, they have been subjected to the sovereign power of the State of Arkansas, for that -- for the courts of that state to determine whether or not these publications may be sent through the mails and otherwise across state lines into the State of Arkansas. 
    An action was brought in the county of Jefferson in Arkansas, in a little town with 20,000 population by the name of Pine Bluff. 
    And the court adjudicated these magazines to be obscene although they have national circulation and are accepted as readily as the Playboy Magazine or anything of similar types of magazines in current circulation. 
    I'm not going into the question whether or not these magazines are obscene because of the limited review in this case. 
    I'm addressing myself to the statute and the record was made on the statute alone. 
    The object of the statute as -- has specifically stated among other things, is to catch the nonresident authors and publishers. 
    They state that in Section 2714 if Your Honors are following me. 
    The statute provides that the mere sending of the literature across state lines into Arkansas shall be deemed a submission by the sender to the jurisdiction of Arkansas. 
    And that a statute -- an action may be commenced by the prosecuting attorney of the (Voice Overlap) for adjudication of the obscenity of mailable matter. 
    And I emphasize the obscenity of mailable matter because I think it will be a bothersome phrase because to me it seems contradictory. 
    The statute also provide with service on the nonresident office and publishing by mail. 
    And I should emphasize too that this statute as distinct from the one you had here nine years ago in the Kingsley Books case does not fix a period for trial immediately after joined thereof issue, nor does it fix a period for the determination of the issue as we had continuably books.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="270.452" stopTime="272.850">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And the books will be banned in Jefferson County?
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="272.850" stopTime="273.629">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    No, sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="273.629" stopTime="274.536">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Until adjudication?
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="274.536" stopTime="326.230">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    No, sir, it does not. 
    Does not provide for non -- was anything like that determined. 
    And the -- a judgment may be rendered declaring the obscenity of the publication and enjoined any act condemn by the statute and it may direct a respondent to dispose of obscene mailable matter and may direct the sheriff to seize and destroy all such obscene mailable matter in control of the respondents wherever it may be found.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="326.230" stopTime="329.487">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That's if the respondent doesn't dispose of it himself?
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="329.487" stopTime="674.366">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Yes, sir. 
    And contempt proceedings have provided together with the extradition of the publisher in the event should fail to abide by the decree and should he fail to do so, he may be subjected also to a felony prosecution with one year in jail and a $2000 fine. 
    Now, as I said before, none of my clients are residents of Arkansas. 
    In order to show a cause was issued in February of '64, they appeared with an advisory jury trial hand and the jury advised the court that these books were obscene whereupon the court entered a decree declaring their obscenity and enjoin the appellants from sending or causing to be sent into Jefferson County the above magazines. 
    He does not say which issues. 
    He just talks about the above magazines. 
    That all said magazines shall be destroyed within ten days by them and the court retained jurisdiction. 
    He determined whether or not subsequent issues of the magazines may be obscene. 
    Now, this is not the Kingsley Book case which I argued here nine years ago. 
    It has certain features that are similar but it does not wind itself at all within the context of the Kingsley opinion. 
    And I should add too as I emphasized before that although this Court recently in the Freeman against Maryland case sort of found favor was the Kingsley statute in a sort of a model. 
    In Kingsley, there was a provision for a trial one day after the issue was joined. 
    And the decision had to be rendered within two days. 
    And I suppose that is why the statute appealed to the court in the Freedman case, as we've -- some of the justices. 
    I -- I have not been reconciled to the Kingsley decision as a protection of the right of speech that is guaranteed Fourteenth and First Amendments. 
    But I know from -- I hope I know that I'm not quixotic enough to ask this Court to overrule it in view of what happen in the Freedman case. 
    But, as I cannot help observing that one of the features that you might have heard -- one of the counsel who might have been on my side say -- that he say that this sort of a procedure because it lends a certain amount of security to the bookseller and perhaps it does. 
    I'm pretty sure he's mistaken because I have seen cases, at least one case I've participated in where the -- moving picture censor, order of the State of New York granted a license for the reduction -- for the showing of a motion picture and nevertheless, the police department in the City of New York threaten the exhibitor because he claimed it was obscene although the censorship board held it to be non-obscene. 
    So I'm not sure that there is any security in this form of a statute. 
    But some people as I say are always looking for security, I've even found people who find security in jail and they're willing to go to jail for the sake of the comfort they may find there. 
    But being as it may, there's a great distinction here between Kingsley and the Arkansas statute. 
    In Kingsley, there was no attempt to control the authors and publishers who were non-residence. 
    The statute operated against persons in the State of New York and the books that were found in the State of New York. 
    And here, there is no attempt to conceal the fact that they are trying to reach the out-of-towners. 
    So it makes the publisher and author in New York subject to the terms of this statute.

    I think that if -- since your position that the general appearance below, without any reservation or any qualification did not constitute a submission to the jurisdiction of the court for purposes of the application of the statute in the form in which it was applied?
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="770.325" stopTime="770.720">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    No, its not.

    That it --
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="771.814" stopTime="925.451">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    No, I wouldn't say that one has to do with the other to question one appearing in a court and not forcing another to serve you outside the state or anywhere else but just coming in and still maintaining -- you claim that the statute is unconstitutional because it has this effect upon the out-of-towner. 
    I don't think it -- I don't think the procedure with respect to the service of the summons has anything to do with the operation of this law. 
    If this statute would mean that an author or publisher who conducts himself in New York by standards of New York would become amenable to the laws of every other middle Pine Bluff in the United States of which we have a myriad of them. 
    Now, under the laws of the State of New York, these magazines were perfectly inoffensive. 
    Gent Magazine for example was a magazine involved in a Richmond County case which the court has noted in several opinions. 
    And if Gent case was published and distributed in New York under the New York concepts of what is bad or obscene, it would place a publisher or an author in a -- not only unfair but in -- it would burden them completely if he couldn't send them out across state lines without the fear that he was going to be subjected to every little town that decides for itself, what this -- its standards are. 
    It appeared as a burden on him, of having to engage counsel in every little town that decided to initiate proceedings like this against him. 
    And moreover, he couldn't meet the standards of every little town in advance.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose the -- I beg your pardon. 
    Supposed a New York publisher sent agents down into Arkansas and those agents open up a newsstand so that this would be the publisher operating directly in Arkansas, selling this.

    Now, in -- we have to bear in mind something that would seem obvious but could stand repetitions that in the Jacobellis case this Court pointed out that we cannot tolerate the situation whether limits of expressions fixed by state lines only. 
    And Mr. Justice Harlan, I state of another generation in 1909 in the International Textbook Case, pointed out that even where a correspondent school was required -- a correspondent school of Pennsylvania was required to qualify as a foreign corporation in another state before it could maintain a suit, that Justice Harlan writing for the Court held such a requirement unconstitutional because this was an obstruction to the transmission of intelligence from one state to the other. 
    And I suppose those sentiments can be brought up to date by other members of the court. 
    And in the case of Licey v. Haden (ph) where one of the states attempted to prevent the sending of liquor across state lines into that state, this Court held that the sending -- even a sending of liquor was forbidden -- I mean, even the obstruction to the importation of liquor within a state would be condemned. 
    Yet this Court has held from time -- time and time again that the literature certainly is on a higher level than liquor. 
    The burden that was placed on the author and publisher here unjustly to nothing but timidity and terrorize them. 
    And the expense in defending everywhere would be just another added burden to his already harassed job of being a publisher.

    But I -- and I think -- I'm not sure that I understand all of the opinions of the Court in this area where they have that opinions of the Court but my understanding of one of the opinions in the Massachusetts case last term was that there had to be -- that a -- that in order prosecute or suppress something in the teeth First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. 
    That something had to have three conjunctive ingredients, not disjunctive.

    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    No, sir. 
    But -- neither is the thing about adding defensiveness. 
    But if ever -- every time you add an element by a decision, the legislature would affirm that to add another sentence into this definition. 
    The order -- since consistently approved this language here from Roth, even though you do seem to add other elements. 
    These other elements will have to come in under instructions as for the jury. 
    There's no way you could -- just keep adding sentences to each time the legislature amends.

    What this case -- what came up under the several proceedings of the statutes, we have a twin weapons here. 
    We have a civil and criminal proceedings and as to our civil proceedings is from the last two cases today this could solve some of this scienter problems. 
    Because here you have to -- in any criminal prosecution, you're going to have to show knowledge of contents under our statute and you're also going to have to show either that 2907 has turn it down or that it has been judicially determined to be obscene in an Arkansas proceeding. 
    Plus, they knew it was -- had been so adjudicated. 
    You've really got some scienter provisions here that are no funds than any other state and protecting First Amendment rights and Fourteenth as -- incorporating the Fourteenth. 
    This law was carefully drafted in Roth and Kingsley's Books. 
    They tried to put as many safeguards as they could to bail it. 
    Basic safeguard is the definition on mailable matter and non-mailable matter.

    You have to show that he published -- to bring a civil action to get -- to get a declaration, you'd have to have a prosecutor attorney bring the action.

    Mr. Fletcher Jackson

    Now, under that provision, is there any requirement of a specific intent scienter, mens rea in the sense that publisher brought it in with the intent of selling, distributing something knowing it to be obscene and with the purpose of capitalizing on its quality as obscene literature, it's a very rough statement of what a -- well, summed up by -- what I sum up by the phrase specific intent.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, as a matter of fact, is it correct that under 41-2716, the prosecuting attorney would bring a criminal proceeding against the publisher in the keys that I put to?

    Yes, sir.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- or do you think that this is any different, knowledge of its contents mean something different in 2716 than it does in 2717?

    Mr. Fletcher Jackson

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well then, let's take that very carefully if you don't mind. 
    In 2716, which is this proceeding, the civil proceeding, the prosecuting attorney brings the case on. 
    All he has to do is to show it to satisfy the requirement of knowledge of contents is to show that such and such a person or a company published this magazine. 
    That satisfies knowledge of contents for purposes of the civil proceeding?
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2374.076" stopTime="2374.825">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2374.825" stopTime="2403.523">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright. 
    Now, subsequently, after -- this -- that a civil order has been entered, the prosecuting attorney brings a criminal proceeding, are you telling us and if so, what's the basis of it, that the prosecuting attorney in order to satisfy that same requirement mainly with knowledge of its contents, has to prove something else.
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2403.523" stopTime="2423.298">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    He has to prove these elements. 
    One, that the person had knowledge of the contents. 
    Two, that they are sending or you know, for sale and so forth into the state this obscene matter. 
    He's got to show that it was either -- other than mailable matter or that it was mailable matter known by such person to have been judicially found to be obscene.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2423.298" stopTime="2423.783">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright. 
    What I'm going to ask you --
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2423.783" stopTime="2424.621">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    Or it just got --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2424.621" stopTime="2433.870">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I understand all that. 
    Here, we have in these cases, we have mailable matter. 
    We have a judicial determination in the proceeding before us.

    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2434.786" stopTime="2439.073">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And therefore, we have knowledge of the judicial determination --

    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2439.521" stopTime="2462.253">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- in the case that I have put. 
    What I'm asking you is, whether it's your submission to this Court that the prosecution has got to prove anything additionally to show that the defendant in this phase number two proceeding had knowledge of the contents of the magazine.
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2462.253" stopTime="2466.458">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    Yes, sir. 
    He'd have to show like a -- an affirmative showing of knowledge of contents.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2466.458" stopTime="2472.374">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Of what kind? 
    That's what I'm asking. 
    Remember, we're talking about the publisher.
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2472.374" stopTime="2473.137">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    The publisher?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2473.137" stopTime="2473.821">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes.
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2473.821" stopTime="2482.593">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    You'd have to show that he was -- to prove by showing he's supervised the printing or he read it before publication.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2482.593" stopTime="2484.700">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And that is -- is that the kind of showing -- and that's the kind of --
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2484.700" stopTime="2487.965">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    That would show knowledge of contents, wouldn't it?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2487.965" stopTime="2537.111">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But my point is that neither phase number one nor phase number two, if I correctly understand the statute in your explanation, is there any requirement that the prosecution proves specific intent and the question that we have before us and I think further to the question that we have before us maybe, whether in view of the lack of necessity in the statutory scheme of the showing of specific intent or scienter beyond the point that you have described? 
    And either phase one or phase two, whether in view of that fact, phase one, the phase one order, is constitutionally defective.
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2537.111" stopTime="2553.110">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    You'd still have to prove mens rea in -- even under number one, you'd have to show intent, intent to sell or distribute these obscene matters if you have to show mens rea even under this.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2553.110" stopTime="2557.615">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You and I know that there are lots of kinds of these in qualities in mens rea and scienter --
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2557.615" stopTime="2558.725">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2558.725" stopTime="2571.850">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And we're talking about two kinds here. 
    I'm talking about what the sort refer to as specific intent and you're referring it to the knowledge of the contents, etcetera.
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2571.850" stopTime="2654.546">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    My point was sir that this judicial determination will put a publisher or a distributor of a notice that this matter is likely to found of -- that it is obscene in the civil matter and he's likely to be found obscene in a criminal matter. 
    In other words, it gives him -- what problem as yesterday in one of those cases was that knowledge of contents and knowledge that the material was obscene. 
    And this goes a little bit further than the usual statute. 
    Towards the mailable matter and non-mailable matter, the great book of all publications would be a mailable matter. 
    That definition of mailable matter, the -- be part it makes it almost completely broad. 
    It says any other printed or written matter or material which has not been determined to be non-mailable under the laws of the United States. 
    That was the definition of mailable matter, is anything that has been given a second class permit or has never been presented to the post office for determination. 
    That would leave non-mailable matters s to something that has been excluded by the post office. 
    And anything that's been excluded by the post office, that would be this -- in effect, same as a judicial determination as far as showing you all later a scienter.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2654.546" stopTime="2660.971">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, do we have before us a section of the statute dealing with non-mailable matter?
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2660.971" stopTime="2662.262">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    The definition sir?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2662.262" stopTime="2668.272">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I said, do we have that, the court determination? 
    Aren't all of these magazines mailable matter?
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2668.272" stopTime="2670.821">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    All of them are mailable matter, yes sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2670.821" stopTime="2678.053">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Because the statute is much -- what shall I say, much more rugged with respect to non-mailable matter --
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2678.053" stopTime="2678.287">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2678.287" stopTime="2697.383">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Apparently on the theory that you've just stated, namely that the matter is non-mailable, it does not have the advantage, protection or sanctification of the post office department action and giving it a second -- allowing it the exercise second class privileges.
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2697.383" stopTime="2779.166">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    It allows publishers and distributors to rely on the post office determination as their -- you know basic protection. 
    If they have that protection, they're pretty well safe unless it's a borderline case. 
    The main thing I wish to stress is -- he raises the prior restraint to him. 
    And really, this is not really a prior restraint case. 
    There is no restraint before an adversary hearing. 
    There's no I -- provision for an injunction pendente lite. 
    You can only have -- you can -- the prosecuting attorney can only ask for a power in injunction. 
    And a power injunction can only be given after judicial determination. 
    We're not really in the -- depends on where a prior restraint is. 
    But here, you got a judicial determination before there is any restraint. 
    A matter of fact, in the present case, the testimony shows that these magazines were still on the stand after the suit was filed all up to judgment. 
    One of the witnesses bought some later editions before the final trial was over. 
    These magazines until they were ordered -- ceased were never taken off the stand. 
    So, the issues can go on the stand. 
    There's really not much restraint here.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2779.166" stopTime="2802.931">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    As a practical matter, the criminal provision never come into play in a magazine case or ask you, why can your injunction ever be effective in a magazine case? 
    Say you'd proceed against the magazine that comes out every two weeks?
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2802.931" stopTime="2803.548">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    The only way I understood --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- twice a month, you can't have a preliminary injunction.

    Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2811.273" stopTime="2841.384">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So by the time you've had your trial, that issue with the magazine is long since out of date and then it gets new ones on the stand. 
    Then you haven't been to ban that magazine on the stand anyway while -- during the trial. 
    And so -- and once the newer issue comes out, the old magazine is not going to be sold again anyway so you will never have an opportunity to apply your injunction to the old issue or the criminal provision, isn't that true?
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="2841.384" stopTime="2844.335">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    As far more or less what's happened here?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, some are or rather I don't get that from this language, is this further considered, ordered and decreed that the defendants are hereby notified that any future distribution or sale of the above magazines, and that doesn't mean the specific ones there -- they are which they -- you're talking about which are of like obscene character comparable to the above issues of said magazine will be enjoined upon a showing of that -- if the magazines are obscene. 
    Now does that simply mean that if they dared to publish any magazine of like character, that they can be summoned in the court on an order to show cause under this injunction and have those burned in the same way?
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="3411.120" stopTime="3419.997">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    No, sir. 
    I don't think so.

    Would you turn to page 18 of my brief sir and --

    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    I understand. 
    So that by saying as to the -- you're question sir, there, the -- in the middle of page 18 is an excerpt from the Arkansas Supreme Court hearing which shows the fact of what this decree is. 
    They construed this Chancellor's Decree in it's -- it says, the -- it doesn't really mean anything, just retaining of jurisdiction unless it would mean the -- as to service of process and having them subject to the jurisdiction that would mean only --

    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    Yes, sir.

    -- future issues. 
    Or to the timemean the court held a hearing that has to be held before any order of (Inaudible).
speaker="fletcher_jackson" startTime="3500.440" stopTime="3510.272">
    Mr. Fletcher Jackson 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's why they construed the Chancellor's Decree. 
    They knew they couldn't enjoin future issues.
