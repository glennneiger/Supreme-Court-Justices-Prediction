    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, which unanimously affirmed a summary judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, holding that the petitioner had expatriated himself pursuant to the authority of 401 (e) of the Nationality Act of 1940 by the act of voting in an election in the State of Israel in 1951 for the legislature of the State of Israel. 
    This case was to be argued by the general counsel for the New York Civil Liberties Union Nanette Dembitz-Berman, who wrote the briefs in the case and it is Mrs. Berman's appointment as a judge of the family court of the City of New York that brings me here today. 
    She is very disappointed that she missed this opportunity to address the Court on this subject. 
    The facts are very simple and are stated in a stipulation of facts which appears in the record and -- at page 11 and are simply that the petitioner who was born in Poland in 1893, immigrated to the United States in 1912, was naturalized in 1926 and went to Israel in 1949, a year after that state was established in 1948. 
    And in 1951, he voted for the second Knesset, which was the second election of the legislature of Israel. 
    At that time indeed, when there was no Israeli citizenship at all and that everyone who voted in that election, voted on the basis of their residence in Israel. 
    Indeed, it was that legislature which a year later adopted the first Israeli law of nationality and established Israeli nationality. 
    The District Court, in the basis of the stipulation of facts in which it appeared that the petitioner voluntarily voted in that political election, stated that it was bound by the decision of this court in the Perez case in 1958 and held that he had lost his citizenship as indeed when he applied for a United States passport in 1960 to return to the United States, the consul in Israel so determined and the State Department approved that loss of citizenship and when he did return, he obtained a full hearing, which is part of the record, before the Passport Review Board which affirmed this loss of nationality and then he brought this -- this action. 
    The record does indicate that the man's profession, he was an artist by profession, a painter and sculptor, and indeed in this country, he has some of his paintings which are products of the WPA Art Program in some of our high schools and hospitals. 
    The case presents squarely the constitutionality of this Section 401 (e) of the Nationality Act of 1940, which is repeated in haec verba in Sections 349 of the present Immigration and Nationality Act.

    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Over -- yes, overruled Perez, which is now. 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, when I -- I recognize the -- from the facts of the reargument that was ordered in Perez, the 100 pages of opinions on that -- in that case and the Trop case, the 75 of pages of opinion in the Mendoza case which followed a year -- few years later, in which again the court ordered rearguments. 
    When I read the opinions of the Court in those cases and read the records in the briefs, I must say I was nonplussed as to what I've read to the consideration of the Court of this -- again of this issue, which has been obviously so painstakingly considered by the Court. 
    In the short time that is available to me, I felt it would be bootless and of no assistance to the Court to try to review here the formulations of the applicable constitutional doctrine. 
    Most of the justices are sitting here have expressed themselves on the constitutional doctrine. 
    It occurred to me that in my short time, I might assist the Court by examining very briefly the two factual propositions which are, I submit, accepted by the majority of the Court in the present case and which I believe are factually false. 
    One of those propositions in which the Solicitor General bases his argument, one of those propositions is that for an American citizen to vote in a foreign election is an indication of some diminution of his allegiance to the United States and some adherence to a foreign allegiance. 
    The other proposition is that for an American citizen to so vote in a foreign election, in some way embroils the United States in foreign affairs or in some way exacerbates or makes more difficult the handling of foreign affairs. 
    I would submit to Your Honors very briefly that both of those propositions are factually inaccurate. 
    Now, as to the first proposition, that voting in the --

speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="391.600" stopTime="456.973">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    I agree -- subject to my basic constitutional position that where we're dealing with citizenship granted by the Fourteenth Amendment, a Congress has much less authority and indeed, my final proposition is that Congress has no authority, under the Constitution to remove United States citizenship that this can only be done by the voluntary act of the United States citizen and all that the power of Congress is, is to regulate the manner in which this voluntary expatriation shall be expressed. 
    Obviously, a man cannot put a note of expatriation on his desk floor and take it out when he wants to. 
    Congress can say that if you wish to adjure allegiance to the United States, if you're abroad, you must do it before a consul. 
    If you are in the United States, you must do it on the forms supplied by the Attorney General of the United States. 
    The limit of Congress' power is to regulate voluntary conduct or conduct which in most instances or in common experience is voluntary.

    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    From the Fourteenth Amendment which provides that every person born in the United States or naturalized alien is a citizen of the United States and the state in which he resides. 
    And from the opinions expressed by some of the justices that this sets up a relationship between the United States and its citizens, which the Congress does not have the power to terminate, that the relationship of citizenship can only be terminated by the act of the individual and that Congress is therefore limited to regulating those voluntary acts.

    That may be a clear indication but what if the citizen says, “Now, look, I don't intend to lose my United States citizenship at all.

    So why should you take this to be an expatriation? 
    I say I'm still a citizen.” 
    Now, how come Congress can recognize that event?
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="543.321" stopTime="569.828">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Well, my -- my -- my personally belief that Congress may take conduct which normally connotes a putting off of your United States allegiance and taking on a foreign allegiance and may nominate that may -- as a control of voluntary conduct may say that that is expatriation. 
    Even though the individual says that, “I denied what I'm doing,” has a natural effect --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="569.828" stopTime="577.072">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So Congress can say that that there's some -- there's some events which will result in involuntary expatriation.
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="577.072" stopTime="604.585">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    No, I -- well -- we're standing on a very narrow ground, Your Honor, of whether conduct which in common experience is considered voluntary, whether the particular individual who was acting voluntarily and becoming as I said that I don't want this to have the result which the law says it shall have. 
    Now, I say that that's voluntary conduct and all that the Congress is doing and all that it can do constitutionally is recognized this effect --

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="607.945" stopTime="613.399">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If Congress says voting shall result expatriation and the persons who knows that, he goes and votes. 
    Is that voluntary?
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="613.399" stopTime="679.858">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    But the trouble with that is, Your Honor, is that voting as a factual matter does not indicate a maybe voluntary conduct but it's not voluntary conduct that indicates a lack of allegiance to the United States or the adherence to a foreign state. 
    Now, let me very briefly just state one page of history on this matter. 
    This came into the law in 1940. 
    Our courts, from the founding of the Republic until 1868, in many opinions of this Court and other courts, had considered the whole problem of expatriation and indeed a very strong opinion was held that the common law applied and that allegiance was permanent and there could be no expatriation. 
    This was debated in the courts. 
    There were cases on voting for example. 
    There were three cases, a federal case, a main case, and Iowa case in which the individuals had voted in Canadian elections. 
    The courts unanimously held that voting was not an indication of loss of United States allegiance. 
    These cases are quoted in Borchard's Diplomatic Protection Abroad and cited in our brief.

    I would derive it upon the nature of the relation to count -- the relationship between the Government and its citizens under our Constitution. 
    I would say that the one thing that Congress in achieving its statutory objectives that one sanction that is not available to it unless the Constitution gave to it expressly was the termination of citizenship, the termination of the relation between the state and one of its -- one of its members.

    Among others, yes.
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="738.023" stopTime="788.834">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Well, Your Honor, the opinions of the Court have discussed Mackenzie as a suspension of citizenship during coverture because of the special relationship of the wife as part of the husband. 
    I think that deals with that case so far as Savorgnan case is concerned that this is the case that really I was discussing with Mr. Justice White where a woman becomes naturalized in the foreign state. 
    And although she signed the papers and becomes naturalized and abjures allegiance to the United States, she said “I did it because my husband, the United States -- the Italian consul in St. Louis asked me to do it. 
    I really don't want to lose my citizenship.” 
    I am content to take the position that conduct, which is considered normally as voluntary conduct that merely by -- say so, the individual may not say that it doesn't have the result that law said it does.

    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Well, if Your Honor pleases, an examination of this history indicates that there was no evil that Congress was trying to prevent. 
    Let me try or range you directly, Mr. Justice Clark this way. 
    And on the second factual proposition that our foreign relations might be affected, the truth of the matter is, that voting in foreign elections, there's not the slightest indication that voting in a foreign election had in a -- legally, at the invitation of the foreign government in effect, has any effect on our foreign relations. 
    Let's examine --

    Mr. Edward J. Ennis

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    It couldn't have any effect on the foreign relations with Israel.
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="851.656" stopTime="1071.819">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Yes, but let me tell -- let me suggest two other instances Your Honor, which perhaps point out your question. 
    This 1940 law is on the books for only one reason. 
    The Chairman of the Immigration of the Judiciary Committee, Immigration Subcommittee, Mr. Dickstein of New York, was exercised by the fact that German aliens, resident aliens and naturalized Germans went back to the czar in 1935 and voted that the czar should be German rather than French. 
    This didn't bother the French government. 
    It didn't bother the German government, it didn't bother the State Department but it certainly bothered Mr. Dickstein and he proposed to the President of the United States that he set up a commission to examine the nationality laws and to codify it. 
    In the course of that codification, a new section which we're dealing with crept into the codification which the -- which was transmitted to the president for the very modest letter by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to the effect that these are only suggestions for the consideration of Congress. 
    One of these suggestions was voting in a political election in a foreign state or participating in an election of plebiscite to determine the sovereignty of a foreign territory. 
    The entire support for that proposal is in two short paragraphs. 
    In the rest of this report, the other proposals are supported by judicial decisions, by diplomatic decisions, the correspondence between the Secretary of State and foreign governments. 
    This course which we're dealing with has two sentences in it. 
    Along the line, Your Honor, suggested without any factual support whatever and here's what they are. 
    This section is clear, applicable on any case on American votes in a political election in a foreign state whether or not he's a national thereof. 
    Taking an active part in the political affairs of a foreign state by voting in a political election therein is believed to involve a political attachment and practical allegiance thereto, which is in consistent with continued allegiance to the United States whether or not the person in question has acquired the nationality of the foreign state. 
    There was not one iota of factual support for the statement prepared by the State Department, I think by the Assistant Solicitor, Mr. Flournoy, who was the State Department expert for many years on nationality questions. 
    At the suggestion of the -- Mr. Dickstein, the Chairman of the House Immigration Committee, there is -- not only no support for that statement but the factual evidence in the diplomatic history of the United States was at that time that voting in a foreign election was not an indication of throwing offered or any diminution of allegiance to the United States for taking on allegiance to a foreign state. 
    As I've indicated to the Court, the judicial decisions which are the contrary, the diplomatic correspondence which discussed that great length how you could lose United States nationality was limited entirely to naturalization abroad, and residing abroad as part of that naturalization, or adjuring allegiance to the United States. 
    There was no support whatever for that statement.

    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Well, let me give you one, a bit of factual information. 
    The first page of the record contains Mr. Afroyim's identification booklet which he had a hand in when he voted. 
    That lists him as a citizen of the United States. 
    I mean there wasn't any question that he was a citizen of the United States and only of the United States and that he disclosed this and voted as a citizen. 
    Now, if Your Honor's suggestion is that this case might be distinguished on this basis from the matter of a person who was a citizen of the foreign state, all I can say that the statute as drawn will not support such a distinction and indeed, my last argument and the one that appeal to Mr. Justice Whittaker in the -- in the Perez case, was that in any event the statute that's drawn was too broad because it covered a person, an American citizen who voted in the foreign election whether or not the circumstances indicated any diminution of U.S. allegiance or any taking on of a foreign allegiance.

    Of course, I understand that.

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    -- and perhaps said that I would vote that but it appears to me that it has to be voluntary as indicated in Perez by -- if one who said “I'm a citizen of the United States and I would like to vote in your election and they said okay, I -- certainly it would not be a voluntary relinquishment of his citizenship to the United States insofar as your expression is concerned while in Perez, while he is repetitiously or rather he represented the Mexican government he wasn't (Voice Overlap) but it seems to be a volun -- more volunteer there would be in the other case.
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="1222.917" stopTime="1352.826">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Well except, Your Honor, might -- perceive, of course, the distinction Your Honor's suggesting that I do not stand on it. 
    This law has been held to take away the United States citizenship even if you vote in a municipal election as to whether it should be local option that forbear control or not. 
    This law has been -- by the people administering it by the lower trib -- administrative tribunals, they say any voting in a foreign political election or in a plebiscite takes away your United States citizenship and I do not think that Your Honor's distinction will support the constitutionality of this statute because I do not believe that a dual citizen, the voting in a foreign election and exercising his rights under his second citizenship indicates any desire to terminate his United States citizenship. 
    I do not think that factual supports there. 
    At any rate, it is curious that the instance which brought this law into being in this all instance, as I say without any diplomatic or factual or judicial support was this voting in the czar which disturbed me that our Government nor the other two governments involved, the German or the French government. 
    But it's suggested in this one paragraph, which is all that this Court relied on in Perez. 
    In any event, it is not believed that an American national should be permitted to participate in the politics, in the political affairs of a foreign state and at the same time retain his American nationality. 
    The two facts would seem to be inconsistent with each other. 
    I suggest to Your Honors that in view of the complete lack of any authority for that statement, it is purposely extremely tentative in its own terms. 
    It's a suggestion and curiously enough, Congress took this tentative suggestion and passed it without any debate at all and put this into the Nationality Act, which was generally a codification of the former laws and edit this provision without any debate on it.

    I understand that, Your Honor, but that is a -- that is perhaps a more difficult proposition than the -- than what the factual proposition is, that foreign relations are not exacerbated by voting in a foreign election which is usually at the invitation of the foreign government. 
    And if Your Honor will read again the majority in Perez, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, for the Court, has one citation and for the proposition that the foreign relations of the United States might be affected by voting. 
    He cites one article in the American Journal of International Law, Mr. Bruce's article which deals entirely with the question of private persons by propaganda in our soil or in the soil of one nation attacking a foreign government and Mr. Bruce concludes his article by saying, this is the kind of private conduct which cannot be controlled in our country. 
    This is only citations of the Court for the proposition that Congress might reasonably think that voting in a foreign election injured our foreign relations and was a sufficient basis for what Mr. Justice Brennan has called the “drastic and truly terrible remedy of expatriation”.

    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    No, Your Honor, it would not. 
    I have wanted to refer, Your Honor, to this factual basis because frankly, it was the only thing in reading the opinions of the court and in reading all of the briefs, it was the only thing that I had -- that I thought I found that have not been completely explored in the opinions of the Court that namely, that this proposition that voting in the foreign election did indicate some diminution of allegiance or taking on a foreign list was just erroneous and also other factual proposition that our foreign relations are affected. 
    Now, let me give you other example and I will sit down. 
    In addition to this --

    May I suggest this? 
    I'm wondering.

    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Yes.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your interest in that voting as to what effect it would have as I understand it under your Fourteenth Amendment argument is that it is not sufficient to show a voluntary enunciation of citizenship by an American citizen to show that he voted in a foreign election.
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="1626.191" stopTime="1630.298">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Of course not, Your Honor. 
    It doesn't establish any such thing.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1630.298" stopTime="1652.963">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And your argument under the Fourteenth Amendment as I understand it is based on the fact that it must be a voluntary renunciation of citizenship and while there could be conduct -- could be conduct such as the shaking of the head or something that would in itself show a renunciation, that does not.
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="1652.963" stopTime="1653.921">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1653.921" stopTime="1660.177">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That under the Fourteenth Amendment, there must be a plain or a valid renunciation of citizenship --

    Will you regard the Fourteenth Amendment as imposing enunciation of congressional power of your own statement.

    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Of course, Your Honor. 
    I'll sit down by calling Your Honor's attention to one other factual matter. 
    Congress has recognized that voting in a foreign election in effect does not diminish your relation -- your allegiance to the United States by providing -- by having to amend the Act; to provide that every American citizen who voted in Italy between 1946 and 1948 should be given their citizenship back because it was recognized that often voting of foreign relation, contrary to being against the United States citizenship may be done at the instance of officials of the United States, asking for support of a foreign government by American citizens residing in that territory who are eligible to vote. 
    So that the American citizens, thousands of them, who voted the Italian elections after the war from 1946 to 1948 had been given back their citizenship by Congress, recognizing, I submit, in effect that such voting is not a voluntary giving off up your citizenship. 
    If I have -- I think my time has expired. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Charles Gordon
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1739.902" stopTime="1744.853">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gordon?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="1744.853" stopTime="1773.278">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is a suit seeking a declaratory judgment of citizenship. 
    Petitioner is a naturalized citizen who voted in a political election in Israel. 
    He disputes the findings of the lower courts that he thereby lost his citizenship. 
    The facts to some extent were recited by petitioner's counsel but there are a few more that I'd like to call to the Court's attention.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1773.278" stopTime="1779.256">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is there -- Mr. Gordon, I beg your pardon. 
    Is there a finding that he intended to relinquish his citizenship?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="1779.256" stopTime="1782.369">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    No, there's a finding that it was voluntary. 
    He --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1782.369" stopTime="1783.752">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But his voting was voluntary?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="1783.752" stopTime="1793.377">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    His voting was voluntary. 
    He says that he did not thereby intend to give up citizenship. 
    The Government does not -- did not in the stipulation agree to that.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1793.377" stopTime="1795.043">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Did the Government contest it?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="1795.043" stopTime="1798.556">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    They did not contest it. 
    They -- the Government says it's immaterial.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1798.556" stopTime="1808.408">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And that's really the issue that we have. 
    In other words, the Government says that it's immaterial whether he intended to or not and he says that it is material.
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="1808.408" stopTime="1924.549">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Why, I believe that's one of the issues. 
    There are several others that were posed where Congress can impose citizen -- loss of citizenship against his will where the Congress was acting reasonably in making such a determination so forth. 
    Now, to some extent, the facts are reflected as has been indicated in the stipulation of the parties. 
    The stipulation is set forth at pages 11 to 12 of the record. 
    In addition, the certified passport file of the Department of State was incorporated by reference in the motion for summary judgment and was considered by the District Court and by the Court of Appeals. 
    The passport filed is lodged with the clerk of this Court. 
    Petitioner was born in Poland about 1893. 
    He came to the United States in 1912 at the age of 19. 
    He was naturalized as a citizen of the United States in 1926 when he was 33 years old. 
    In 1949, he left the United States with an American passport. 
    He then went to Israel in 1950 and remained there for 14 years. 
    Now, by his stipulation, petitioner concedes that he voluntary voted in the election in 1951 in Israel for the second Knesset or parliament. 
    It appears also from his Israeli identification booklet, which Your Honors will find at pages 1 to 2 of the record that he voted additionally in two other elections 1959 and -- 1955 and 1959 for the third and fourth Knesset. 
    Now, it also appears that following --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1924.549" stopTime="1930.191">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case, however, was not decided at all upon his voting in those two later elections, was it?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="1930.191" stopTime="1931.530">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    I'm not sure. 
    This was the stipulation --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1931.530" stopTime="1934.068">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, they're decided, I thought on a stipulation of fact.
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="1934.068" stopTime="1958.522">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    No. 
    The other -- the State Department record and this booklet, which is at pages 1 and 2 were before the District Court and the Court of Appeals and they did refer to the facts which appear in the State Department record. 
    So the courts were considering that too. 
    And I don't think this Court is limited to determining only on the 1951 election. 
    He voted in three national elections.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1958.522" stopTime="1967.987">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Do I understand in the first to those elections, under the laws of Israel, it was not neces -- it was necessary only to be a resident because indeed there was no such --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well now, it's an -- may be important to know on -- what basis this case was decided. 
    I'd understood that it's decided on the stipulation of facts which indicates that which is -- which includes only the first of those three votes.
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="1997.199" stopTime="2023.791">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Your Honor, the passport file of the Department of State was incorporated by reference in the motion for summary judgment and was considered in the opinion of the District Court and the opinion of the Court of Appeals. 
    I think that was equally before the Court and it is lodged in the files of the clerk of this Court. 
    I don't think the court below -- I think they found that on the basis of that voting alone, they lost but they had build the facts and I think this Court will consider.

    Well, I'll be glad to describe that to Your Honor. 
    Under the law of Israel, known as the “Law of Return”, all Jewish persons were welcome to Israel; they could become settlers. 
    That law was passed in 1950. 
    He went to Israel a month after that law became effective. 
    In 1952, Israel passed its nationality law, saying that all Jews who had settled in Israel under the Law of Return were automatically Israeli's citizens but they have a right to elect not to accept Israeli citizenship by filing a written election. 
    We have passport which was submitted by the petitioner which shows that Israel regarded him as an Israeli national, issued passport to him and therefore, he did not file such an election.

    Well, Your Honor, as I was not in the case at the District Court. 
    As the parties then conceived the issue, it was a simple issue of the constitutionality of the statute based on a single act to voting. 
    But I think that in adjudging this --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2275.565" stopTime="2287.192">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But why shouldn't we take the case like that instead of this other evidence which apparently you didn't -- the Government could have put in the evidence if they wanted to.

    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Mr. Justice White, I believe that in issue of this importance is very desirable to get the record as full as possible and I think that if the record were as full as it can be, it would indicate that petitioner has demonstrated his diminution of allegiance to the United States has indicated that he regard himself as a citizen of Israel. 
    Indeed, he did not apply for an American passport for ten years and did apply for an Israel passport and obtained it.

    Well, we could, on that evidence so that the Court can hold on this current statute unconstitutional and still -- and still say that he'd lost his citizenship on another ground.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know.

    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    By being naturalized and by some voluntarily action as part. 
    That's conceivable, I believe. 
    But at least, insofar as voting is concerned, the decisions of this Court have indicated that in order to sustain the statute, there must be some indication of the diminished allegiance and my view is that the act of the voting in itself, indicates such a diminution. 
    But if it becomes important in the context of this case, I think the facts here if fully developed would demonstrate that the allegiance of the petitioner here is primarily to Israel or was at that time to --

    So when the case was tried on stipulation of facts and decided on a motion for summary judgment, can the Court enlarge the allegations in the complaint and decided on an issue further than that is in the complaint?

    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    But, Your Honor, the -- there's a misconception that the case was tried only on the stipulation of facts because with the motion for summary judgment, the Government incorporated by reference the passport file of the Department of State and it was considered by the District Court and the Court of Appeals. 
    Your Honor will notice the opinions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals contain facts which nowhere appear in the stipulation. 
    I myself wondered where they got those facts until I found out that the passport file of Department of State was before the Court.

    My view is that the Perez case is still the law that this Court is not modifying, that it is sound and that on the basis of the Perez case, the mere fact that there was voting in a foreign political election, voluntary voting is enough to cause expatriation.

speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="2815.364" stopTime="2949.844">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Except for these passports. 
    These passports weren't submitted by petitioner to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and they are in the Immigration record. 
    They were never before the Court. 
    I mentioned them only because petitioner is seeking a declaratory judgment that he is a citizen and if these documents, which bear I think on his citizenship status are not brought before the Court. 
    The Court may enter a judgment declaring him to be a citizen when he actually is not. 
    I'm sorry the argument went off on this pageant but it seems to me that it was our duty to bring these facts to the attention of the Court. 
    Well, I -- I go back to the argument. 
    I want to emphasize the possibility that in this case and unfortunately some of these facts are not fully developed in the record. 
    All of them are in the record except for this passport. 
    The indications that petitioner intended to become a citizen of Israel. 
    I repeat, in 1950, he went to Israel. 
    He lived there for 14 years. 
    He did not apply for a renewal of his American passport which expired in 1950. 
    He did not expired -- applied for renewal for 10 years. 
    He did not register with the American embassy or consulate. 
    He did obtain this Israeli identification booklet in 1951. 
    In 1952, after the new nationality law became effective, he did obtain an Israeli passport. 
    He voted in three national elections. 
    It seems to me that under those circumstances, of course, he didn't asked to retain his American citizenship when the new Israeli nationality law went into effect. 
    It seems to me that under those circumstances, petitioner has indicated that his primary allegiance is to Israel and not to the United States.

    One record, if we are willing to affirm but quite another in a much more extensive record, if we are so misguided in your point of view is to reverse. 
    Now, that's kind of a novel concept as first concerned but may be I'm just not adequately informed as to procedure.

    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Well, Mr. Justice Fortas, I would say that differently. 
    In my view, the record in its present shape is sufficient and in my view, the record in its present shape requires an affirmance of the lower courts. 
    In my view, the statute as it was upheld in Perez contemplates that the mere fact of voting in a foreign political election, voluntary voting as is conceded here causes a citizen to lose his nationality. 
    They found correct in that, then there's nothing further in the case. 
    But I suggest these additional facts in the event the Court may determine their relevance.

    Well, if Your Honor feels that my duty to this Court permits me to exclude these facts, that's alright but I thought the Court would want to know these facts. 
    The only reason I brought them to your attention is that they may be significant in the determination of this issue. 
    And they were before the District Courts. 
    The courts did consider them and refer to them.

    No, there -- there are some additional circumstances.

speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="3463.968" stopTime="3470.866">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Because that -- that was the only issue they thought was significant. 
    That alone, they said, was sufficient to uphold the statute.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know but they have -- neither court -- certainly the District Court never found any fact with respect to these other two years.

    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    That is perfectly right, Your Honor, but the District Court found that one fact alone. 
    I think the District Court indicated that it wasn't necessary to go any further; that this fact alone was sufficient to cause loss of citizenship.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I don't know how we're going to sit up here and say that even if we wanted to, how -- how we could say that what facts were.

speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="3503.528" stopTime="3530.794">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Well, if those facts are deemed broad, in my view, they're not relevant. 
    In the view of the Government at that time they entered into stipulation, in the view of the District Court, in the view of the Court of Appeals, those additional facts are not relevant. 
    And in my view, if the Court agrees, then there's nothing further to the case. 
    Then the statute is constitutional and then petitioner lost his citizenship. 
    It seems to me that --

    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Well, I think we can leave the other material aside if the Court agrees with me in that position. 
    If the Court finds that voting in a foreign political election under Section 401 (e) under the Perez case itself expatriate him then there's nothing further to consider.

    No. 
    Your Honor, that is not so. 
    The District Court and the Court of Appeals knew about it. 
    It was before them. 
    No, this wasn't hidden from anybody. 
    The only regret I have is that they weren't printed in the record because they were before the court below. 
    This is not something I dreamed up. 
    It was considered fully in the court below.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Gordon, isn't it a fact that when stipulation of fact is presented to a court and the Court rather amounts to a request to the Court to decide the case on the basis of these are the facts in stipulation. 
    If they were preliminary motions, a motion for summary judgment or motion to dismiss to which affidavit were attached or as you get here, you attach record. 
    And thereafter, a stipulation of fact is presented to the Court by the parties. 
    Isn't it customary for the court to decide the case on the basis of stipulation of facts without reference to the affidavits or whatever may be attached to the motion for summary judgment? 
    Is that the way we run law business?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="3688.607" stopTime="3692.997">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Mr. Justice Fortas, I would say it would depend on the context and on the understanding of the Court.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3692.997" stopTime="3713.930">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    If the parties in the -- in the stipulation of fact, went to the Court also to consider the affidavits or a transcript that was involved in some of the preliminary motions, there would be a reference to that. 
    That would be incorporated in the stipulation of fact.
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="3713.930" stopTime="3717.012">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Well, I -- I agree that that's a possibility but the motion for summary judgment --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3717.012" stopTime="3785.041">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And now you're here telling us -- you're here talking to us about this case in which those stipulation of facts and you're also using a phrase that was “before the Court”, some other documents that were involved in the preliminary motions. 
    Now, I submit to you that what lawyers do before trial courts and then appellate courts, case that's involved that's decided on the basis of stipulation of fact is to assume that the Court attended to the material included in the stipulation of fact. 
    And this is some other reference, some other provisions as something else is said here and you might have put there might be a nature in the file with the clerk. 
    But that doesn't mean that it was before the court in the sense of being a part of a factual record to which the Court devoted its attention in deciding the case.

    No.

    In my view of the statute, the mere fact of voting is sufficient to cause expatriation.

   Rebuttal of Edward J. Ennis
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3873.925" stopTime="3874.960">

    Very well.
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="3874.960" stopTime="3895.804">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I have no further argument but I've been a member of this Court for 30 years and I would not submit and request this Court to rule an Act of Congress unconstitutional and improper record. 
    What's been said here about passport is entirely out of order and in two minutes, I can make it perfectly clear to the Court that you have a proper record and a proper issue. 
    The --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3895.804" stopTime="3898.878">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may take five minutes then.
speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="3898.878" stopTime="4214.609">
    Mr. Edward J. Ennis 
    Your Honor, under the Nationality Act and the laws of nationality, there are some 15 grounds. 
    Now the way it's determined whether a person has lost it's nationality. 
    He goes through a passport. 
    He goes to the consul. 
    This printed form, Your Honor, Certificate of Laws and Nationality, he gives an affidavit. 
    It's made out. 
    Here's the certificate that he lost his nationality by voting in an election on July 30 of 1951 not that he used the passport there who was naturalized in some other country. 
    That's a precise issue. 
    And the Certificate of Nationality was issued. 
    Now, what is this business on the record? 
    When he got to the United States, now I learned from my friend here that he got here on Israeli passport. 
    Well, may be that's the only he could get here when in 1960, the United States consul said he'd lost his citizenship and that he -- and he came here to bring the suit to get it back. 
    Now, what happens? 
    When the consul issues this Certificate of Nationality, you have under the State Department regulations an appeal to the Passport Review Board. 
    This is a transcript of the record, 100 pages in which to Mr. Afroyim himself without counsel went before these three members of the board and there were president in addition to the three members: the chief of the foreign operations division and specialist on Israeli affairs. 
    Now, they talked to Mr. Afroyim for a 100 pages and they talked on one issue. 
    Did you lose your nationality when you voted in the one election in 1951? 
    Now, in the basis of the record and their affirmance of the consul's action, he brought an action in the District Court and his attorney, and he insist the United States attorney assisted by the attorney for the District Court as well the Immigration Service, do stipulation of the facts. 
    Now on page 11 it says that, “On November 14, 1960, the American consul in Haiti ruled he had lost his -- that he had expatriated himself on July 30 of 1951 by voting in a political election in a foreign state. 
    That's all that was in the case. 
    It was whether that vote lost his nationality. 
    Now, in addition to the stipulation, the Government brought in at the hearing before the district judge the administrative file offered in evidence. 
    It's limited to the 1950 -- to the -- 1951 issue. 
    We made no objection, his attorney at that time. 
    And this is part of the record and it's in this Court. 
    But still, the issue is only one simple thing. 
    Did you lose your citizenship by voting in 1951? 
    Now, my friend, Mr. Gordon called me and he said, “I found out that your client had a passport, an Israeli passport.” 
    I said, “Charles”, I said this, “I don't -- I didn't know that.” 
    I said, “This has got nothing to do with the case.” 
    The Nationality Act does not make having a foreign passport. 
    It was in -- by the way, it was in described to the '40 Act. 
    It was stricken out by Congress using a foreign passport. 
    I said, “Charles, it's not in the record. 
    The record is limited -- I'm perfectly happy. 
    I have the record included this 100 pages discussion about this 1951 loss of nationality. 
    I said, “These passports which you discovered from the Immigration file”, which the Solicitor General of the United States has not relied on in his brief and you want to bring this in, it can only have one purpose to prejudice this Court against this individual and I object. 
    And if you do it, I will tell the Court it's improper and I object”, which I'm telling the Court. 
    Now, I submit to Your Honor, that if this -- that this Court has a complete record here on which to rule whether Mr. Afroyim lost his nationality by his vote 1951. 
    If he did not lose it by his vote in 1951, the Department State of the United States is perfectly free to tell him that he lost it by having a passport, by voting in a 1952 election, by voting in a 1953 election or any other ground which they want to imply although its not expressed in the loss of nationality provisions. 
    This is a separate proceeding. 
    This isn't a matter at large to decide whether Mr. Afroyim lost his nationality by four or five of the 20 Acts set there. 
    It's to decide whether he lost it by voting in 1951. 
    And this record is 100 percent complete on that issue because it's a 100 pages of passport review testimony limited to that issue. 
    These passports are not in this case; they have no business in the case and they're -- here they merely confused issue and why. 
    Because the Government perhaps now feels that since as part of the passport record, as part of this appeal record, there was this identification document which everybody who resides in Israel gets and that has in it an indication that he voted in a municipal election and in other elections. 
    But the Department of State, knowing this, did not decide to wholly was expatriated for those elections. 
    This -- the Department of State decided and all we have here is the decision whether he lost his nationality by voting in the 1951 election, there's nothing else in the case and this record is entirely complete for this Court to decide whether Perez is a law of the United States.
