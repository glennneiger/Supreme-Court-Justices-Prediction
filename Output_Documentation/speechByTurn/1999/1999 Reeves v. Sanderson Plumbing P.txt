    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    In October 1995, the petitioner Roger Reeves, a man of age 57, was fired by the respondent Sanderson Plumbing from his position as a supervisor. 
    Reeves filed suit claiming he had been discharged because of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. 
    Respondent Sanderson Plumbing in turn asserted that it had terminated petitioner because he had inaccurately recorded the attendance of the employees under his supervision. 
    The case was tried before jury, the jury found the respondent employer liable for age discrimination. 
    But the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent was entitled a judgment as a matter of law. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    In awarding respondent judgment as a matter of law, the Court of Appeals preceded from the premise that a plaintiff’s prima facie case of discrimination, combined with proof that the employer’s non-discriminatory explanation is false, is always insufficient without more to sustain a verdict of discrimination. 
    But our decision in an earlier case, St. Mary's Honor Center versus Hicks makes clear that such a showing by the plaintiff may permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that the employer unlawfully discriminated. 
    Proof that the employer’s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination and depending on the circumstances it may be quite persuasive. 
    The Court of Appeals therefore erred in assuming that a plaintiff must always produce additional independent evidence of discrimination. 
    In this case, judgment as a matter of law after the jury verdict was inappropriate. 
    In deciding the motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the court should review all of the evidence in the record, but it must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the moving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence. 
    Thus, it should only give credence to the evidence favoring the non-moving party as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that the jury is required to believe. 
    Applying that standard here, we find the District Court was correct to submit the case to the jury. 
    The Court of Appeals impermissibly substituted its judgment concerning the weight of evidence for the juries. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a concurring opinion.
