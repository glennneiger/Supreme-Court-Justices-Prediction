    This case concerns the respective authority of Federal Trial at Appellate Courts to decide whether as a matter of law, judgment should be entered in favor a verdict loser. 
    The case resulted from a tragic episode. 
    Bonnie Weisgram died when her home caught fire, her son petitioner Chad Weisgram, won a jury verdict against respondent Marley Company, the manufacturer of an allegedly defective heater installed in Bonnie Wiesgram’s home. 
    At trial, heater manufacturer Marley repeatedly objected to the testimony of three witnesses presented by Weisgram as experts, identifying the alleged heater defect as the cause of the fire. 
    Marley urged that the witnesses’ testimony was unreliable and therefore inadmissible under the standard this Court set in Daubert against Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals and follow-up decisions. 
    The Trial Court overruled Marley’s objection and denied Marley’s request for judgment as a matter of law. 
    On appeal, the Eighth Circuit reversed and directed entry of judgment for Marley. 
    The Court of Appeals held that the testimony of Weisgram’s witnesses was inadmissible and concluded that the reaming properly admitted evidence was inefficient to support the jury’s verdict for the plaintiff. 
    We granted review noting that Court of Appeals have disagreed on the question whether it consistent Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 and Appellate Court may direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law, in this circumstance. 
    We now affirm the Eighth Circuit judgment. 
    In a 1967 case Neely against Martin K. Eby Construction Company, we explained that if a defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law is erroneously denied by the Trial Court, the Appellate Court has three options: It may order a new trial; or it may remand the case for the Trial Court to decide whether a new trial or entry of judgment is warranted; or finally it may direct entry of judgment as a matter of law for the defendant. 
    Adhering to Neely's reasoning we reject Weisgram’s argument that Appellate Courts lack authority to choose the third course, directing entry of judgment as a matter of law, when the proof becomes inadequate upon exercising erroneously admitted testimony. 
    In this circumstance, no less than when a plaintiff fails to produce sufficient evidence in the first place, an Appellate Court has authority to render the final decision. 
    In sum, if in a particular case, the Court of Appeals finds that the Trial Court is better positioned to decide a new trial rather than judgment for the defendant should be ordered, the Appellate Court should of course return the case to the Trial Court, for such an assessment. 
    But if as in the instant case, the Court of Appeals reasonably concludes that further proceedings are unwarranted because the loser on appeal had a full and fair opportunity to present the case including, making arguments for a new trial, the Appellate Court may appropriately instruct the Trial Court to enter their judgment against the jury verdict winner. 
    The Court’s decision is unanimous.
