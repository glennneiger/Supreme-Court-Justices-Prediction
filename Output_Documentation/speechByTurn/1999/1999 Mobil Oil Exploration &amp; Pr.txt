    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    In 1981, two oil companies paid the government $156 million upfront for lease contracts that gave them the right to explore for offshore oil, but only if various government departments following certain standards and deadlines that were all referenced in the contract only if those government departments approve the exploration and drilling plans. 
    Then Congress, later passed specific legislation that changed those referenced deadlines and standards making it more difficult for the companies to obtain the necessary approvals that the contract said were required. 
    So the companies then asked for their money back. 
    They sued for restitution. 
    The Court of Claims said that the crossed referenced deadlines and standards were essential parts of the contract; they asked but what else did the companies buy for $156 million and the United States, it added, by changing those deadlines and standards in a significant way repudiated the contracts and it had to give the companies their money back. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed, it thought that the deadline changes didn’t hurt the companies because they would not have gotten the necessary approval anyway. 
    Well, we now reverse the Court of Appeals. 
    We think that whether the companies would or would not have gotten the necessary approvals anyways beside the point, the companies aren’t asking for damages, they just want their money back. 
    If a lottery operator fails to give you a ticket that you buy, you get your money back even though you never would have won the lottery. 
    The operator didn’t give you your chance of winning that you paid for and that’s true irrespective of whether that chance would eventually have led to a win. 
    The same is true here, the statutory changes in the deadlines were important to the companies. 
    They amounted to years of the additional delay and in those circumstances the government is insisting upon the contrary to contract changes, however justified that statute may have been as a matter of policy, amounted to a repudiation of the government’s basic contract with the companies. 
    They didn’t waive their rights in our view and elementary principles of the Contract Law and Restitution Law therefore say that the Government has to give them the money back that they put upfront. 
    We all explained this at greater length in our opinion. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
