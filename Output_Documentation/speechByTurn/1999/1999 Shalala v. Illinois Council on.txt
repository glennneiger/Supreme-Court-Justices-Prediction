    There are special statutory provisions in the law that in effect say that no action to recover on any claim arising under either the Medicare or the Social Security Acts can be brought in a Federal Court, unless the claimant has first presented his claim to the agency. 
    Now, this Court has previously held that those provisions govern efforts not just to get money, but also an effort legally to attack the validity of an agency rule or regulation in general attack as well as specific claim. 
    By insisting that all such claims first be presented to the agency, the statutory provisions go beyond the ordinary administrative law principles of rightness or exhaustion of remedies which do require an initial agency presentation often but not always. 
    But this court’s cases seemed to say that a more absolute rule is needed, because of the special importance of giving agencies that administer such massive and highly complex programs as Medicare or Social Security, an opportunity to consider even the most purely legal challenge to a regulation first, before court becomes involved. 
    The plaintiff in this case is an association of nursing homes. 
    It challenged the lawfulness of certain Medicare rules and regulations without first going to the agency. 
    The District Court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 
    The Court of Appeals thought that a more recent Supreme Court case called Bowen versus Michigan Academy of Family Physicians has changed the law, as I just described it, and instead read the relevant statutes as permitting an initial challenge to the lawfulness of a Medicare regulation in Federal Court. 
    After reviewing the matter this Court by a five to four majority concludes that Michigan Academy did not change preexisting law, where that question is simply want to channeling a case to the agency first rather Michigan Academy applies to permit an initial proceeding in a District Court only where, unlike this case, the alternative would be no review at all. 
    We explained all this at some detail in our opinion. 
    Our conclusion is that the nursing home must present its case to the age homes, they have to present their case to the agency first before they can go to court, and we reversed the Seventh Circuit’s determination to the contrary. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Stevens, Justice Kennedy join, and Justice Scalia joins in part.
