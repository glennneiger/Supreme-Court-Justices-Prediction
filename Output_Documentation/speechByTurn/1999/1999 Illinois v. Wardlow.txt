    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in No. 98-1036, Illinois v. William Wardlow. 
    Mr. Devine.
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="11.600" stopTime="53.090">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    On September 9th, 1995, when William Wardlow looked at Officer Nolan and took flight, the officer had reason to believe that there was a problem. 
    He pursued and stopped Wardlow to investigate and discovered a loaded gun in his possession. 
    The three key factors in this brief statement are flight from a clearly identified police officer without provocation. 
    These factors provided reasonable suspicion supporting a Terry stop. 
    At the core of this case...
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="53.090" stopTime="59.610">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    When you said he had reasonable cause to believe there was a problem, you mean that he had reason to believe that crime was afoot. 
    Is that the test?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="59.610" stopTime="67.329">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The reasonable police officer had, under these circumstances, reasonable suspicion to believe that crime was afoot.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="67.329" stopTime="69.081">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What crime?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="69.081" stopTime="81.530">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Throughout the history of this country, flight has been considered by the courts and by commentators as inherently suspicious.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Of what?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="82.190" stopTime="111.296">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    It is not... it is not required, Your Honor, that the officer have reasonable suspicion of a particular crime. 
    This was commented on in Anderson and in LaFave. 
    If the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity may be afoot, as this Court has noted, there may be innocent behavior, but the officer, the reasonable officer, can stop briefly to determine whether his suspicions are justified or not.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="111.296" stopTime="117.073">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Does he have to have some rough idea of what kind of crime? 
    I mean, it wasn't money laundering I take it.

    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    No, Your Honor.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What was it?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="119.097" stopTime="149.728">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    it is our submission that if the officer has reasonable suspicion that there may be some type of criminal activity... and flight has historically been related to criminal activity, as Mr. Burrill noted in his commentary back in the 1860's, that flight for a burglar, an arsonist, a robber is common, and that in fact if someone committed one of these acts, that it is so natural to flee that if an individual did not, he would be considered mentally deficient.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="149.728" stopTime="167.766">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I suppose if a policeman sees somebody with a smoking rifle, he wouldn't exactly know what precise crime was... was probable or possible either. 
    The man might have killed somebody or he might have shot a bald eagle. 
    You really wouldn't know which, would you?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="167.766" stopTime="189.564">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    You would not, Your Honor. 
    In addition, going back to Terry, the case which is the seminal case on this issue, the activity that the officer noted was as consistent with innocent behavior as with what the officer suspected, namely that the individuals walking around were casing the joint preparing to rob a department store.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="189.564" stopTime="197.737">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr.... 
    There is some reference in the Illinois court opinions to the fact that this was a high crime neighborhood. 
    Does that bear on your calculus?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="197.737" stopTime="217.966">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Mr. Chief Justice, we are proposing that a rule be adopted that is not limited to high crime areas. 
    We believe that the flight is so inherently suspicious that when you have unprovoked flight from an identified police officer, that wherever it takes place, it provides the reasonable suspicion necessary.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="217.966" stopTime="233.548">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, you want some per se rule, it sounds like, rather than what we have normally done on a Terry stop, which is inquire whether there is reasonable suspicion based on the totality of the circumstances. 
    You reject that as the test?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="233.548" stopTime="249.961">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    No, Your Honor. 
    This, in fact, comports with totality of the circumstances. 
    But what we do say is when these three factors are involved, they are sufficiently important and sufficiently focused that they provide and should provide the officer with a reasonable suspicion.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="249.961" stopTime="285.832">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But in... in... in this case, there may well be special circumstances that would enter the mix. 
    The officer was going to a building that the officers thought was the location for a lot of drug trafficking. 
    And presumably we have circumstances here where the... where the person who ran had seen that it was a police officer following that person, and so that's different from a flight where the person doesn't even know there's a police officer...
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="285.832" stopTime="287.030">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Well, no, Your Honor, there are three...

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    there.
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="287.318" stopTime="308.949">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    There are three factors that we propose be part of the rule: one, the flight; second, that it's from a clearly identifiable police officer; and thirdly, that it's without provocation 
    We understand that just flight in a vacuum doesn't give us the reason to say that there's reasonable suspicion, but when the three factors are combined, we believe that that is... that is the case.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="308.949" stopTime="309.199">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Mr....
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="309.199" stopTime="319.313">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Would be the same rule if, say, the... the person who's stopped was wearing jogging shoes and sweat pants and a sweatshirt and carrying a basketball?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="319.313" stopTime="342.347">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Your Honor, it would fit in, in that the reasonable police officer, the standard that the Court uses, would have to conclude that the flight was in response to his presence and without provocation. 
    So, whatever the garb of the individual, if he looks at the police officer, and then takes off, that creates the reasonable suspicion.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="342.347" stopTime="348.913">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What... what if he had seen him running, then he stopped for a while, then he saw the police officer, and he started running again? 
    That would still... that would still apply, wouldn't it?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="348.913" stopTime="356.054">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I would say in that case if the individual is running in the direction, glances at the police officer, and continues on.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="356.054" stopTime="356.259">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    No.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    He stops. 
    He had stopped and he was catching his breath and then he looked up and saw the police officer and took off.
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="360.057" stopTime="367.943">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    I would say that that's ambiguous behavior that would fall within the totality of circumstances rather than within the rule we're proposing, Your Honor.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="367.943" stopTime="462.142">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Devine, the... let me tell you the difficulty that I have with your proposal. 
    You... you mentioned a moment ago, quite correctly, that under any reasonable suspicion rule, some innocent people are going to be stopped or are liable to be stopped under that rule, and we accept that. 
    That's... Terry... Terry starts on that premise. 
    The... the trouble is how high is the risk that... that innocents are going to be stopped or... or how many innocents are going to be stopped in relation to the... to the whole? 
    That... that seems to me the tough question. 
    And the reason it's a tough question here... I'd like you to comment on it... is that it seems to me that if we accept your premises, where in the high crime area a clearly identified police officer arrives... and in fact, in this case arrived as... I guess in a convoy of... of four cars... it seems to me that anyone in his right mind is going to want to get out of the way fast. 
    If I were standing on that corner, I don't know whether I would run or duck into a... an alleyway or what, but I would want to get out of the way. 
    And therefore, it seems to me, on your premise, there are going to be a substantial number of quite innocent people who, recognizing the spot they are in, are going to go on and get just as far away from the police and any shoot-out or whatnot that may occur as they possibly can. 
    And it raises the specter of simply too many innocent people getting picked up on your rule. 
    What do you say to that?
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="462.142" stopTime="492.235">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Well, Your Honor, I would again note that flight, going back to the time of the Framers, has been considered suspicious behavior, but looking at the balancing this Court does in analyzing the reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, we look at the governmental interest. 
    Here the governmental interest is a police officer who's on the scene, sees an individual look at him, and take flight. 
    The police officer does not have the ability to further investigate. 
    The police officer does not have any ability to find out what is going on.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="492.235" stopTime="534.195">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but he may have the ability to note a number of other facts besides the one that you mentioned, and some of them have come up on the bench here. 
    What if... what if the individual in fact ducks into a... runs toward a building which is a known crack house? 
    I mean, there... there are lots of little details that come into a totality of the circumstances test that might make, for example, the stop in this case a perfectly good Terry stop, but it gives one pause when you ask us, number one, to depart from totality, number two, to come up with a bright line rule in which there's at least a substantial risk of a lot of innocent people being... being caught.
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="534.195" stopTime="544.952">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Your Honor, I... I would submit an alternative thought, namely that... that flight is such inherently aberrant behavior that it does create the reasonable suspicion...
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="544.952" stopTime="558.699">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but we don't have a rule that says anytime anyone flees from the police, there is... there is sufficient suspicion for a Terry stop. 
    We don't accept that rule. 
    And in fact, that... that's even narrower than... than you're arguing for in this case.
speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="558.699" stopTime="565.591">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine

speaker="richard_a_devine" startTime="758.869" stopTime="811.457">
    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    My response is that... that since Terry, when the Court discussed that issue, this Court has said that under the Fourth Amendment we apply a colorblind test. 
    We look at the balancing outside of those issues, and if those issues are there, application of sanctions under the Fourth Amendment isn't going to resolve them. 
    They should be handled, as this Court has said, as recently as Wren, either by equal protection claims or section 1983 claims or administrative charges within the particular police department. 
    I would submit, Your Honor, that if we start to classify when we can do a Fourth Amendment stop, based on Terry, or arrest based on probable cause, considering what the race of the police officer is, the race of the individual that is involved, the Fourth Amendment will be unworkable and will prevent the police officers from doing the job that we want them to do. 
    That's why we believe a bright line rule is appropriate here.

    Mr. Devine, your... your question presented is whether a person's sudden and... in petition for certiorari, whether a person's sudden and unprovoked flight from a clearly identifiable police officer who is patrolling a high crime area is sufficiently suspicious to justify a temporary investigatory stop pursuant to Terry against Ohio. 
    That doesn't sound to me so much like a request for a bright line rule, as saying do these circumstances come... satisfy the Terry case, which maybe it's another way of saying the same thing. 
    But I... I don't read that necessarily as saying that you believe that every time these factors coalesce, there will be a cause for a Terry stop.

    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Well, Your Honor, we do submit that... and the high crime area is in the cert petition, but we submit that the three factors that we've identified, flight without provocation from a clearly identified police officer... you reach a point where you have reasonable suspicion with those factors. 
    And we believe it is important that this Court speak clearly on this because a police officer does have to make an instantaneous decision...

    Mr. Richard A. Devine 
    Well, Your Honor, we would... we have made a point of differing... distinguishing avoidance from flight. 
    Turning one's gaze, crossing the street, walking away do not constitute flight. 
    Certainly in that instance, if the individual in the car sped off after observing a police officer, we would say that is flight without provocation that would justify the Terry stop.

speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1211.094" stopTime="1253.531">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    It's certainly true, as respondent and his amici point out, that individuals may, on some occasions, have innocent motives for fleeing the police. 
    But the purpose of a Terry stop is not to apprehend individuals who are known to be guilty of criminal offenses; rather, it's to provide a means by which police may resolve ambiguities in situations where they have reasonable... reason to suspect criminal activity, but lack probable cause to make an arrest. 
    And in our view, flight from identifiable police officers will ordinarily correlate sufficiently with likely involvement in criminal activity.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, Mr. Stewart...
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1254.357" stopTime="1268.020">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What do you do... 
    do you propose some per se rule, as Mr. Devine was arguing, or are you advising us to stick with the Terry reasonable suspicion/ totality of the circumstances?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1268.020" stopTime="1302.822">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    I think we... we believe you should look at the totality of the circumstances. 
    I think in the end our position is not significantly different in... in substance from the petitioner's, although we may use different terminology. 
    Our view is that ordinarily when an individual flees at the sight of an identifiable police officer, under circumstances in which the officer reasonably infers that the individual is running because of the officer's presence, rather than for some other reason, ordinarily that would raise a sufficient inference of guilt to justify a Terry stop. 
    The question of provocation has...
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1302.822" stopTime="1315.946">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Are you saying that there's... is there a right of an individual to go their own way even though there's a police officer known to be on the scene? 
    Can you walk away rapidly? 
    Can you just not want to have anything to do with them?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1315.946" stopTime="1365.813">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    I think there... there is a... there is no right to avoid police observation or police contact, that is the Court... in public areas. 
    Public areas are, by their nature, subject to police surveillance and this Court has held that even without particularized suspicion, police may approach an individual on the street and request voluntary cooperation. 
    Now, there is a liberty interest in freedom of movement in public areas, and the police may not arbitrarily restrain the individual in that exercise of liberty. 
    And I think what the Court has referred to as an individual's right to go on his way is really simply another way of stating that without particularized suspicion, the police can't require the individual to answer their questions. 
    They can't even require the individual to stand still long enough to hear the questions.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1365.813" stopTime="1413.550">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But there... what do you make of the slippery slope argument that... that takes the... the situation one step further? 
    It was made in at least one of the amicus briefs. 
    As you say, the police certainly can properly ask a question of anybody on the street, and most people will answer the question or at least not behave rudely. 
    If the petitioner's petition... position is accepted, what do we do or what rule would we have in the case in which the individual who was accosted by the police on the street and asked a question, instead of answering it tells the officer to go to blazes or perhaps something stronger than that? 
    Does that... is that going to be the equivalent of flight, i.e., deviant response, and... and justify a Terry stop?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1413.550" stopTime="1425.893">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    No. 
    I think... I think flight is really different fundamentally in at least three respects from less extreme means of expressing a desire to avoid...
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1425.893" stopTime="1427.379">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Let's assume the language is extreme.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1427.379" stopTime="1480.795">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    Okay. 
    One of the... one of the things that is distinctive about flight is that in many cases it is likely to connote a panicked reaction, an emotional reaction to the police presence. 
    And... and panic is in our view more likely to signal consciousness of guilt than is an... an emphatic, salty expression of disdain for the police. 
    The second... the second, and perhaps the... the most fundamental difference is that flight expresses the desire not simply to refuse cooperation with the police, but to be free from any form of police observation or scrutiny. 
    And that's really one of the reasons that we think the purposes of the Terry stop are particularly implicated in this situation; that is, the fundamental purpose of the Terry stop is to allow the police briefly to freeze the status quo while they undertake further inquiry to determine whether there...
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1480.795" stopTime="1506.224">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    If you're going to frisk the person, doesn't the policeman have to have at least some notion of what kind of a crime this person might have committed. 
    Justice Harlan said in Terry that to frisk him, you'd have to have... that the reason for the stop is an articulable suspicion of a crime of violence. 
    So, if we have no idea what kind of crime is at stake... he just runs... what's the ground for frisking him?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1506.224" stopTime="1516.544">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    Well, I think the ground for frisking him is, first, the belief that he may be... the ground for frisking him is to protect the officer's safety while the stop is taking place.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1516.544" stopTime="1519.683">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    You disagree with Justice Harlan's articulation of the standard.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1519.683" stopTime="1531.943">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    Well, I think what Justice Harlan was saying... I don't know that Justice Harlan had in mind the situation in which police had an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity but no particular crime in mind.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1531.943" stopTime="1536.977">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, that... that was not the view of the majority in Terry. 
    Justice Harlan wrote separately, did he not?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1536.977" stopTime="1583.667">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    That... that's correct. 
    And in terms of the principles, the rationale underlying the Court's Terry stop jurisprudence, I don't think there is any basis for saying that police have to be concerned with a particular crime. 
    The purpose of the Terry stop is to resolve ambiguities, and in United States v. Sokolow, for example, the... the police... the law enforcement agents, roughly speaking, had drug crimes in mind, but there was no particular form of narcotics that they suspected. 
    There was no particular unlawful transaction. 
    So, to return to your question, Justice Souter, part of the reason that we think flight is extraordinary again is that it denotes a desire not simply to refuse cooperation, but to avoid all forms of police scrutiny. 
    And for that reason, in our view, it's a particularly appropriate occasion for a Terry stop.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I would think it would be more suspicious.

speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1625.982" stopTime="1635.641">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    Typically... you could make the argument either way. 
    Typically the courts have regarded presence in a high crime neighborhood as... as reinforcing rather than undermining suspicion, but I think...
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1635.641" stopTime="1640.759">

    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    That's correct. 
    I think our basic point is if you have flight from an identifiable police officer in apparent response to the officer's arrival and nothing else on either side of the scale, that should be sufficient to justify a Terry stop. 
    Here we think that the... the fact that this occurred in a high crime neighborhood at least somewhat reinforces the inference of suspicion.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    There could... there could be a lot of elses, though, besides mere provocation, couldn't there?

    Now, what if something like that has been going on and a woman is driving along in a car and there is a real policeman, plain clothes, he puts a red light up and she takes off fast? 
    Now, would you call that provocation?

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

    In response to petitioner's argument with... with the three tests, the reason flight alone or flight from a police officer without provocation cannot in every situation constitute a per se rule, is if someone doesn't want to speak with the police, sees them coming, and walks, skips, jumps, gets on his bike, or get in a car, he would be subjected under this per se rule to a Terry stop, and for no other reason than he didn't want to speak with the police officers. 
    That's why the Illinois Supreme Court, using a case-by-case analysis found it untenable in this situation, that flight in every situation was reasonably suspicious.

I think the argument developed on... on the petitioner's case is that they think these circumstances generally come within a Terry stop rule, not that every single time you have a flight, as Justice Scalia's questions indicate, you're... you're going to have a basis for a Terry stop.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, no, it's not at any rate or any speed. 
    Surely, you realize that just from listening to the argument. 
    It's a panicked flight.

    Mr. James B. Koch 
    Well, if I can apply it to this case, and Justice Souter's comment, in this particular neighborhood... though we would disagree it is a high crime area, the Illinois Supreme Court said it was on a de novo review... but it would make perfect sense for... if you see four police cars and eight police officers converging on a scene at one time, that one person might duck behind a car. 
    The Solicitor General would call that aberrant behavior. 
    Others might flee so that they... they aren't subjected to gunfire, maybe being called as a witness, being interviewed. 
    And again, in this case, it makes perfect sense because my client left the scene, went around an alley and came right over to the police. 
    He came back to them. 
    So, it might be that everybody in the neighborhood would... would accordingly react. 
    So, it wasn't panicked. 
    It was a reasoned judgment to avoid some confrontation between the police and whatever it was that called four cars and eight police officers to the scene.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm not really sympathetic to... to those who... who run away because they don't want to be called as a witness.

    Mr. James B. Koch 
    No, I don't, Your Honor, but... and I don't know that you would be sympathetic either to those who don't want to be subject to misidentification or harassment, those who don't want to be intimidated in the area. 
    There may be people who... who don't want to be called as a witness. 
    There may be people who are simply intimidated by the entire nature of seeing four cars and eight police officers converge on a scene.

    There may indeed.

    You really don't think it's an articulable basis that a police officer is patrolling a beat.

    You are not, as I understand it, arguing here that it would have been error for the Illinois courts to say under Terry that on all of the circumstances of this case, the Terry stop was valid. 
    As I understand it, what you're arguing is that it is not a proper basis to reverse the Supreme Court of Illinois by adopting a per se rule that flight in response to the police in high crime is per se enough.

    You are not really. 
    You are not really agreeing because you are not really saying that... in response to my questions, you... you indicated that you have no factors that you can bring forward on the other side. 
    I mean, we don't have to have a per se rule in order to say unless there are some factors which otherwise explain it to the reasonable police officer, unprovoked flight, upon seeing a police officer, is enough to satisfy Terry. 
    That's not a per se rule. 
    It's just that there are no factors on the other side.

    Mr. James B. Koch 
    Justice Scalia, what the Illinois Supreme Court said was what was untenable was there were no articulable facts in the record from which they would be willing to tilt in this situation individual's freedoms in favor... whether it's per se or totality, in favor of the State.

    You don't look to anything else.

    The... the intermediate court and the Illinois appellate court had a more thorough discussion of the facts I think than the supreme court did.

    And certainly the manner in which you exercise your Fourth Amendment rights shouldn't be bootstrapped into a violation of them and cause a Terry stop any more than perhaps if Mr. Bostick had said... had been asked, I'd like to search your luggage, and he says, I don't want to. 
    Can that be bootstrapped into a search of his luggage? 
    And the answer has to be no. 
    So, there's a very important constitutional point here, that my client can come and go as he pleases absent some objective criteria that he's engaged in criminal behavior. 
    So, yes, you can get on your bike, get in the car, walk away, absent something articulated by the police that causes him to be stopped, which is absent from this record.

    I would submit that that is not grounds for a Terry stop.
