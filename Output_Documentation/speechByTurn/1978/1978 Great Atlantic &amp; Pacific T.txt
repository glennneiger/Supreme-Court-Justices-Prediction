    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The first of these cases, Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, Petitioner, against the Federal Trade Commission is here by reason of the grant of a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    The question presented is whether the petitioner, the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company violated Section 2 (f) of the Robinson-Patman Act as amended by knowingly inducing or receiving illegal price discriminations from the Borden Company. 
    The Federal Trade Commission found that there had been such a violation and the Court of Appeals affirmed this finding. 
    For the reasons set out in the Court's written opinion, filed with the clerk this morning, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. 
    Mr. Justice White has filed an opinion dissenting in part and so as Mr. Justice Marshall.
