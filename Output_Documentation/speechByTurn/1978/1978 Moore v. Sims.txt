    Mr. David H. Young 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the court. 
    Today we are concerned with numerous sections of Title II of the Texas Family Court which is Texas’s effort to deal with the Law of Parents and Children. 
    It's a codification obviously of many parts, it in part reflects in statute as a in case law as existed prior to its passage in 1973 and in part reflects what the legislature or what the case law in the absence of statute said the law was and it also of course reflects changes that the legislature made in the statutes and case law. 
    Those various aspects of the family court have interplay in the sections which are before you here today. 
    Some of the sections which we'll be discussing are matters of law that pertain to virtually any case in the civil courts of Texas and others are sections that pertain to rather more limited aspect of child abuse and still others are sections which have only to do with certain instances or certain procedures in child abuse. 
    Because of the numerous chapters and sections involved, when I am making my argument, I will try to use more than merely numbers of chapters when I am describing things, for instance chapter 17, I will always try to refer to that as to the emergency protection provisions, chapter 14, I will try to remember to refer as a conservatorship or custody provisions, likewise chapter 15, termination of parental riots, chapter 11, which is involved here as well as essentially the wholly procedural chapter and chapter 34 is involved as not a judicial per se chapter at all, it's really an investigative agency kind of chapter. 
    I would also like to utilize some of my time to very briefly state what the court below held because we are not appealing everything that the court below held and from reading the opposing briefs, it is at least my judgment that many of those briefs are on issues that are not before this court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="164.010" stopTime="171.426">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It is possibly to briefly state what the court below --
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="171.426" stopTime="555.263">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    I hope so, I want to try, I think it's difficult and I certainly don't want to use that part of my time doing it. 
    First of all, of course, the abstention issue we clearly are appealing. 
    They held Section 1110 of procedural statute unconstitutional on its face because it failed to require an attorney ad litem for a child in any suit affecting a child under the Emergency Statute, the Conservatorship Statute or the Termination Statute. 
    We are only appealing that as to the necessity for an ad litem at the emergency hearing, the chapter 17 hearing, we are not appealing it as to its impact on any of the other proceedings, whether for conservatorship on a permanent or temporary basis or on termination. 
    They held in three sections, 1111, 1705, and 1706, that all were unconstitutional is failing to require an adversary hearing within 10 days of the emergency taking of the child. 
    We are not appealing to any of those. 
    They held section 1115 unconstitutional on its face as to the standard of proof saying clear and convincing evidence is required instead of preponderance, we are appealing that. 
    They held 1702 unconstitutional and that saying, it was unconstitutional on its face, but saying that immediately, the statute says, a child that is seized will immediately will be taken before a court or this agency seizing the child will immediately obtain a judicial sanction if you will to have possession of the child. 
    They interpreted that to mean that the, that immediately is the “very day” of the taking we are appealing that limited aspect of the holding. 
    They said that 1703 is unconstitutional on its face and that it fails to require all reasonable efforts to serve notice to one of these suits. 
    We are not appealing that and we would frankly characterize that as one of the more gratuitous holdings of the court below, because there is no question that all reasonable efforts should be made and were made in this instance to notify the parents of the proceedings and in fact they had actual notice. 
    They held section 3405 unconstitutional on its face as failing to require notice and a hearing for the parents before any psychological or psychiatric examination of the children, we are not appealing that, that wasn't even an issue in this case. 
    Physical examination was an issue in this case and the court made no adverse holding as to that. 
    They also held the child abuse neglect reporting enquiry system unconstitutional as applied and that the state had provided for a central registry of cases of suspected abuse and those cases on that registry were not limited to instances in which a judicial determination as to the abuse have been made. 
    Finally they held 3408 unconstitutional on its face. 
    That being the confidentiality provision and held it unconstitutional and so far as it did not provide for parents to be notified of the contents of the records that the state had on them, alright or requiring the states upon request to reveal the contents of the record except for informance, we are not appealing that. 
    One other thing, which I think is confusing, also is that the Woods case it's my understanding it's not before this court. 
    It was consolidated on a limited issue of the right of indigence to reporting counsel and in their decision in this case and the judgment the court below said that consolidation was ill-advised. 
    We did not in our brief anyway cite to you what became of that case. 
    The court allowed the state courts to proceed and in December of 1976 some two or three months, after the decision in this case was rendered the Court of Civil Appeals reversed the judgment and restored the children to Mrs. Woods that decision is reported at 545 Southwest second 573, that reversal was based on an insufficiency of the evidence kind of question. 
    That I hope gets me into what I would like to talk about regarding abstention, because in that case the Woods case the State Courts were allowed to function, were allowed to go ahead through their normal processes and what happened is that the parents want to talk about abstention, it's also necessary to spend just a little bit of time on a chronology of the events that occurred. 
    On March 25th 1976 there was a report of child abuse at the school in question of Department of Human Resources worker went their to investigate it and the children were taken to a child welfare clinic. 
    The next day, the very next day, not the very day, but the very next day, a temporary order was obtained. 
    Day after that Paul Sims who is the subject of this litigation really, excuse me was hospitalized where he would remain for some 10 days.

    Mr. David H. Young 
    No, Your Honor there is, according to the deposition of Judge Lowy, which I will discuss; they did attempt apparently to file a motion to modify. 
    It's my understanding that the District clerk said judge Lowy was not present, he being the judge which had entered the temporary or emergency order a few days before that and went to see another judge to see that he would hear it. 
    He evidently said he did not want to hear it, and that led.

    Mr. David H. Young 
    That's right, that's why I am taking some time to go through it in the first place. 
    On the fifth however Judge Lowy was around and a hearing was had in his court room. 
    The fifth was the 9th day of the duration of the 10-day emergency order. 
    At that time plaintiffs below had pending a habeas corpus action, and a hearing was conducted at the bench, if you will, all of this is explained in some detail in Judge Lowy's deposition and then motion to modify was never mentioned to him at that time.

    Mr. David H. Young 
    Brought by the state, I've forgotten the name of the individual, who signed the complaint but it was brought by the state, this is a day after the children were picked up at school. 
    They were in --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="696.970" stopTime="700.510">

    Yes.

    Now that's one--
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="707.660" stopTime="732.898">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    That's one, the next one was as a result of this hearing on the 5th in Judge Lowy's court wherein the motion for habeas was pending, also that was on the 9th or the 10th day I forgot which of this 10 day order. 
    Questions as to venue of these proceedings --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="732.898" stopTime="735.278">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well who brought the second proceeding?
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="735.278" stopTime="779.465">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    This, the second proceeding was brought during a continuance of this hearing. 
    The hearing was convened at 10:30 in the morning as a result of the hearing Judge Lowy had substantial questions as to venue of these proceedings in his mind, it was discussed by counsel for both parties before the court, and he said he will recess this hearing until 5:00 o'clock to give the parties, both parties an opportunity to file whatever it is they're going to file. 
    As a result of that at 4:00 or something, the state filed a second suit.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="779.465" stopTime="781.156">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In the same county or different?
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="781.156" stopTime="782.840">

    In Harris County, the same county.

    The same county.

    Mr. David H. Young 
    Yes, as a result of the second suit, the Judge took an official cognizance if you will of the venue issue, transferred that second suit to Montgomery County and transferred with it the habeas action on which no action had been taken.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="808.685" stopTime="810.650">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Who brought the habeas action?

    The Sims.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="811.249" stopTime="822.099">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The Sims. 
    So we have three proceedings pending before anyone went into Federal Court?
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="822.099" stopTime="842.586">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    You could even say four if you wanted because at some point the Sims also brought -- attempted to bring an original habeas action I believe in the Court of Civil Appeals which is an intermediate court, which they refused to take, there having been no decisions below.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="842.586" stopTime="843.637">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They didn't succeed.
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="843.637" stopTime="846.563">

    They didn't succeed. 
    But as I understand it that's not the question.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="846.563" stopTime="855.822">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, well I am trying to get the actual pending state proceedings, were the two brought by state agency, both in Harris County one transferred to some other—
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="855.822" stopTime="856.729">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    Montgomery County.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="856.729" stopTime="864.875">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Montgomery County and the habeas proceeding brought by the Sims in Harris County also transferred to Montgomery, is that it?

    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="865.555" stopTime="869.408">

    Yes.

    Mr. David H. Young 
    That order pursuant to chapter 17 was good for only 10 days and this subsequent hearing that we are talking about not an ex-parte hearing it's the first that had been -- when the order was obtained.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="882.376" stopTime="885.618">

    Mr. David H. Young 
    It was on the fifth so it would be the 9th day I think yes, which is why I think he said, he gave him till 5 o'clock to get whatever additional pleadings, motions they would have. 
    That order expired by its own terms on the 10th day. 
    After that 10th day, there was nothing possible further to do so it's—
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="904.880" stopTime="910.669">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The proceeding in which that order was entered did not terminate with the expiration of the order, did it?
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="910.669" stopTime="927.624">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    Well, that's a very close question and I think that's why the second proceeding was filed seeking temporary conservatorship and why it's that proceeding that was transferred along with the habeas to Montgomery County.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="927.624" stopTime="936.117">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well let me put it to you this way. 
    In your abstention argument what state proceedings as pending do you rely upon?
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="936.117" stopTime="944.106">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    We relied this to chapter 17, was filed before any proceedings of substance on the merits in Federal Court.

    I am confused with these numbers.

    I am sorry I said I tried not to do it.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="953.244" stopTime="960.022">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That was pending you say when the federal suit was brought. 
    You said earlier –

    Mr. David H. Young 
    We argue that it's a question of definition of what the -- there was no order, there was order in effect by the county.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In any event, you say the second state agency proceeding which they brought in Harris, transferred to Montgomery that certainly was a pending proceeding—

    Mr. David H. Young 
    Without question as was the habeas.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="976.366" stopTime="979.139">

    As was the habeas, yes.

    Yes, it's immediately to the north, I don't believe there are any counties in between, if you can't tell one from the other it's all urban.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is it perfectly clear the second proceeding was pending because the order was entered as I, in my notice showing April 6, and wasn't till April 19th that the federal case was filed and there's a more than a 10 day gap and had anything -- it was not another 10 day order that expired by its terms?
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="1009.323" stopTime="1020.585">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    That gets to, that's what it was subsequently interpreted to be by the Federal Court.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    If you so view it that would no more have been pending in the first one, they'd be precisely of the same standard.

    Mr. David H. Young 
    Oh, yes because I distinguish between a pending law suit and an order that's in effect. 
    It wouldn't be necessary for any order to be in effect to have a pending law suit in state court if my understanding is correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1043.808" stopTime="1053.017">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well couldn't the other side argue that after the 10 days it ran on till April 16th that you retained custody of the children without any legal support for what you are doing?
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="1053.017" stopTime="1123.347">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    Oh they did and that's what they did argue on April 5th in the hearing in Federal Court, whereupon we said accepting that we didn't use these words, but accepting that as a given then can we go file another lawsuit in Montgomery County and get all those cleared up, and it was our understanding that managing judge said, yes, whereupon we did on April, on May the 14th, whereupon the Sims is absenting themselves from anywhere where they could be served with a writ of attachment that went with that case but somehow mysteriously they must have learned about it because they returned to Federal Court on the 21st seeking a temporary restraining order against this, against the attachment. 
    That hearings by the way which was not, it was some 16 days after the Attorney General's office and other defendants had entered and the appearance of some sort anyway and that hearing in Federal Court and we were never notified of the second, of the application for a temporary restraining order, there was no hearing conducted on it but it was granted.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1123.347" stopTime="1132.145">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But, if you rely on the May 14th action, the new suit brought then that is a good -- almost a month after the federal case had been filed.
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="1132.145" stopTime="1160.222">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    That's right and it's that aspect of the confusion why in our abstention argument, we put it under several different sections and dealt with the Hicks against Miranda kind of an issue whether a federal case has -- whether a State court proceeding has to be pending before there are substantial proceedings on the merit and in Federal Court as a separate issue. 
    When we say there was -- we say we would have it either way.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1160.222" stopTime="1164.692">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The temporary restraining order you were -- but you were notified after it was granted.
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="1164.692" stopTime="1305.509">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    Oh sure yes, without question. 
    The effect of that temporary -- the relief that it had been sought immediately as a result of that second suit in Montgomery County was to have child placed with his maternal grandparents where he'd been staying a good part of the time anyway and where he'd been going to school, because they resided in Harris County. 
    So somehow while absenting themselves from the prospects of service the Sims did find out, obviously seek out some relief from the State Court action. 
    I mentioned earlier, the confusion that results because the Family Code contains different things. 
    And one of the things that is so confusing in the first Federal Court hearing is the distinctions, are the distinctions between venue and jurisdiction on the one hand and the Family Court's concept of continuing jurisdiction on the other. 
    The Sims has argued in the State Court that there was no continuing jurisdiction in that case in Harris County and therefore it should be dismissed. 
    Well, continuing jurisdiction didn't have anything do to with this case. 
    There was no proceeding already pending in Harris County, which would have been sufficient to give the Montgomery County Court continuing jurisdiction. 
    Did I say there was no case pending in Montgomery County, which would -- to which the Harris County Court would have had to referred it back. 
    What the Harris County Court did was take these arguments that both sides were making i.e. the fact the children and the parents both reside in Montgomery County and realize that mandatorily under the family court that venue was in Montgomery County while he did have jurisdiction. 
    He did have jurisdiction and he says in his deposition it's sufficient to enter the show-cause order that he did and transfer it back.

    Mr. David H. Young 
    Okay. 
    Maybe the last thing I better say about abstention is it Hicks does away with this Hicks against Miranda in our view does away with the race to the court house theory. 
    There's no issue that all the parties had actual notice in Federal Court of what the State intended to do. 
    It was explicitly addressed to the Judge, we think he consented in effect to it and in any event there is no finding below of the kind of bad faith or harassment that would be necessary to overcome the abstention. 
    There's not even a bad faith allegation in the pleadings, there's one harassment allegation as to the last proceeding in Montgomery County. 
    No findings below about bad faith or harassment where the appellant they're not -- I realized I've used up virtually all of my time on only one of the three big issues of the case. 
    I can't really address the other two in the remaining time.

    Ms. Windell Porter 
    All right sir. 
    I'll do that. 
    Let me state at the outset sir that we realized and we submit and acknowledge that there's a compelling state interest in a state being able to pickup children in emergency situations.

    Ms. Windell Porter 
    No sir, I do not concede that this is an emergency, what we concede to sir is that there's an interest here on the part of the state that if in fact there were any children at any particular time now or even then in danger of any harm that that state has an interest in being able to take those children into custody.

    Why was this particular child picked up?

    Ms. Windell Porter 
    Right sir. 
    On March 25th just briefly, a referral was made to the Child Welfare Department. 
    The child was picked up, three of the children were picked up not just Paul, the referral was only in respect to Paul. 
    On March 26, there was a suit that was filed for protection of the child, supposedly with the referral only as to Paul; the suit was filed in relationship to all three of the children. 
    On March 26th, the first ex parte order was issued by the Judge.

    Your Honor, I do not know when those pictures were taken.

    I would assume and usually in the regular course of business that on when Child Welfare picks up the children that the pictures are usually taken at that same time, well, this is just something from me.

    Were they not buttressed also by the doctor's examination, which said that there had clearly been a case of child abuse?
speaker="windell_porter" startTime="1606.113" stopTime="1693.743">
    Ms. Windell Porter 
    Your Honor, they were buttressed by an affidavit by the doctor. 
    However, there was never any testimony because there was never any court hearing. 
    Usually, what occurs is when these particular suits are filed there's usually an affidavit presented to the judge by the social worker or by the attorney from Child Welfare, which states what the result of the doctor's examination is. 
    On March 31st, the appellees went in and sought to modify the March 26th ex parte order. 
    That order lasted no longer than 10 days. 
    After the expiration of that order pursuing to the Texas Family Court, the judge was to do either one of two things. 
    Order the children restored to the parents or direct Child Welfare or its attorneys to a file a suit affecting parent-child relationship. 
    On March 31st the appellees went into court to file a writ of habeas corpus. 
    I'm sorry, I left out one fact about the March 31st order. 
    The motion to modify, they were not even allowed to file that particular motion. 
    We feel that was effectively denying them any particular access.

    Only the admittance that it was stamped and returned to the attorney for appellees and the usual practice is that if it's stamped it's received and if the judge is not there then what they would do would be to set a hearing on it later on. 
    Then the writ of habeas corpus was filed on March 31st. 
    The writ was denied, the judge would not rule on the writ, because he said that he lacked jurisdiction, because the appellees were resident of Montgomery County. 
    After, on that same day sir, later on another suit was filed concerning -- affecting the parent-child relationship.

    Thank you.
speaker="windell_porter" startTime="1849.412" stopTime="1990.388">
    Ms. Windell Porter 
    The March 31st order was not a writ of habeas corpus, that motion was a motion to modify the March 26 Ex Parte Order where the judge took custody of the children for the ten-day period. 
    After not being permitted to have a hearing on the March 31st Motion to modify the March 26 Ex Parte Order, they then went back and attempted to file a writ of habeas corpus because at that time the Ex Parte Order pursuant to the Texas Code of Civil Procedure had expired because it only lasts for 10 days. 
    After refusing to rule on the writ because of lack jurisdiction, then the case was transferred to Montgomery County along with a second suit that was filed on the very same day that the parents were in Court, trying to have a hearing on writ of habeas corpus. 
    All of this was transferred to Montgomery County on April 5th. 
    It's really interesting to know that although the parents had been in the Court room that there was still no effort to even notify them about the second Ex Parte Order that was issued. 
    Front of that, that order stated that a show cause hearing would be held, that is stated in blank. 
    It didn't say when, where, who or what. 
    They were never notified of that order. 
    They were never notified of that particular suit for whatever reasons. 
    The appellee's filed their original complaint in Federal Court on April 19th. 
    It is our contention that there was no pending state court proceeding in which to the appellee's could have litigated their constitutional claims by way of a defense.

    Ms. Windell Porter 
    No sir. 
    They were not appealable; they are interlocutory decisions. 
    Further as a matter of Texas State Law, if a person wants to raise the questions concerning the constitutionality of state of seizure of children, they cannot raise them even on appeal, and the case is in REW. 
    We believe that this court's ruling in Gerstein versus Pugh is applicable in this particular case. 
    There was nowhere for them to go.

    Ms. Windell Porter 
    Your Honor, the only thing that they would have been able to do and they would not had been able to raise their constitutional questions or the issues of constitutional law in either a writ of mandamus or a writ of habeas corpus, which are the two things because the writ of mandamus sir, would have dealt with whether or not the release sought, or whether or not the there was an abuse of discretion, say if a writ of mandamus had been filed for the clerk not receiving the motion to modify, or for the judge not to have any hearing on the motion to modify. 
    And of course, the writ of habeas corpus will only deal with who had legal custody.

    There was no action taken in Montgomery County by the Montgomery County Court until May 14th of 1976, and then on May 21st there was hearing then set for May 21st. 
    It appears so that the burden, the state was putting the burden on the family to go in and to accord themselves a hearing. 
    The interest that the states sought to protect, there was no danger to them. 
    As all of the time the children were in the custody of the state and I might point out that even though the case was transferred to Montgomery County where no action was taken in Montgomery County and it was transferred with a show cause hearing that the children remained in the custody for the entire 42-day period of the Harris County Child Welfare.

    Both, the first one, but on May 4th when they filed in the Court of Civil Appeals. 
    There was no proceeding that was pending, in order for them to avail themselves of and I would think that the Younger doctrine and those related cases at least contemplate that the individuals, that the litigants have some reasonable way, some means, some real valid means of being able to raise their constitutional issues. 
    I'd like to speak a little about the CANRIS statue and that is the process that the state gathers information concerning abuse or alleged abuse of children. 
    This statue does not provide for the persons even finding out what information is alleged. 
    There is no opportunity there for the persons to correct the information.

    The failure to give notice to the parents, but that failure to give notice to the parents sir that he is referring to is the failure to give notice to the parents when say child welfare is going in and requesting an order, which could issue without notice and without a hearing to have either the children or the parents examined. 
    And I thought that, that was what he was alluding to. 
    I do know that the state has put in their brief that CANRIS does not injure persons. 
    We feel that it does because there is no way, there is no opportunity for them to correct any information and we would think that there should be provided at least some type of opportunity.

    Ms. Windell Porter 
    Your Honor, I would like to point out that in the district court's opinion that the court does state that there was never any evidence to show as to whether or not there was any abuse by the parents. 
    One of the things that happened immediately before the referral was made was that the father was at the school and he saw the child poking a pencil at a little girl and he told him to stop and the child did not stop and he paddled the child in the presence of the teacher. 
    Now Paul has stated and this is not in the record that he was paddled after his father left by the teacher who wanted to paddle him some more and I would just once again say that there was no determination by the Federal district court and no evidence presented as to whether or not there was any child abuse and I suppose that that would be something that would be issued, an issue in any pending state litigation. 
    Let me say this on the Woods case if I may. 
    I know what has become of the Woods case because I represent Ms. Woods again after the Court of Civil Appeals returned the child, Child Welfare reinstituted an action against her and that case is now pending, there is a final hearing now pending that case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3140.263" stopTime="3141.862">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In Federal court or State court.
speaker="windell_porter" startTime="3141.862" stopTime="3310.803">
    Ms. Windell Porter 
    In State Court sir. 
    And I think that, the other thing that, the other reason why habeas corpus or any remedy say if there had been any pending proceeding would not be available was because in Texas by statute the ex parte orders maybe stepped, in other words if one goes into court and obtains a restraining order or an ex parte order, the statute fails to say how many you can have, however appellants have conceded to that affect and they are not contesting that, but that was one of the things that was an issue at that particular time because the court at that time had not made a determination as to whether or not the stacking where one order could be issued immediately almost after another order had been expired was unconstitutional either on its face or as applied. 
    The other thing is and I think that what's happening with Mr. Woods is that this shows the likelihood of what may reoccur again. 
    This is not an isolated instance. 
    Appellant stated that the children are presented to the court. 
    They are not presented to the court, there was no presentation here. 
    As I said before we are not saying that if in the event that there is child abuse, that children should not be taken into custody but we are hoping and we are saying that should they be taken into custody then because of the fundamental rights involved because of the reciprocal rights between parents and children that a hearing should be held and that hearing should be held immediately in order to make some determination as to whether or not there is any validity say to the referral. 
    This was not there, by immediately sir, I would say as soon as practically possible.

    But not in the Court of Civil Appeal, likewise a mandamus action for instance against a clerk would be brought in the District Court against a judge, it can be brought in the Supreme Court with original jurisdiction, you just have to get in the right place. 
    The issue as to why counsel at this argument right here, kept saying that the cases were transferred from Harris County to Montgomery County because Harris County didn't have jurisdiction, that's not why they were transferred. 
    They were transferred because Harris County didn't have venue, Harris County did have jurisdiction, all that, all the rationale for that is in Judge Lowy's deposition, which is also in the record in this case.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Young Section 10 of the judgment says that Section 3408 is unconstitutional on its face and so far as it fails required reports and records of child abuse and neglect and so forth, he made available to the parents the subject of investigation, do I correctly understand you are not appealing from that.
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="3686.718" stopTime="3846.014">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    That is correct we are not appealing that. 
    Instead of answering some of the questions, the pictures are all of one child, Paul Sims. 
    Two were taken by the Child Welfare worker. 
    Three, by the police officer at the hospital, I don't recall, which is, whether it's two and three or three and two, but they are all of the same child, all within a very short span of time. 
    The result of the Federal Court taking the view it did on abstention is of course that appellees get to litigate their constitutional claims, but nobody ever gets a hearing on the merits about what happened to this child or these children. 
    That's what the state was after, that's what the state repeatedly tried to get before the Federal Court. 
    The state even asked the Federal Court to being there and seeing how things were going, they even asked the Federal Court to appoint an ad litem for the child and it was denied, saying in affect why don't you apply the same standard to yourself that you want us to follow with regard and the court didn't do it. 
    With regard to the question of the motion to modify, appellants didn't have anything to do with that. 
    The appellants are not the judge nor are they the District Court, normal procedure in Texas is if you file a pleading that requires a hearing is that would you go to the judge; any judge that was there in Harris County could have heard it. 
    It was true apparently that the judge that was there was reluctant to hear it, but there is no indication whatsoever that appellees went to him and asked him to hear it. 
    There is no indicate, all of the evidence is to the contrary that they fled Montgomery County to keep from having to hearing. 
    They said there is no hearing where they could raise all the issues, well the last thing they wanted was a hearing in Montgomery County. 
    They didn't go to work. 
    The didn't send the kids to school and they couldn't be found. 
    The issue of whether or not an emergency order is appealed below and submit is answered by appellees own case. 
    The REW cite that I gave you earlier was in the Woods case, it says, at page 575 in volume 545 of Southwest Second. 
    An appeal could have been taken from the emergency order even though the appeal would not have stayed the order citing Section 1707 of the Family Code.

    REW is the State Court version of the Woods case, which was temporarily consolidated with this one and is now no longer consolidated. 
    It reversed the termination of criminal rights in that case, but it was on the factual insufficiency of the evidence. 
    There is a split in the different Courts of Civil Appeals in Texas as to whether or not all such temporary custody orders are appealable or not.

    Mr. David H. Young 
    I suggest it should and that's the place to resolve it and like this court one of the ways to get to the Texas Supreme Court is when there is a split in the circuit so to speak, that's where that issue should be resolved. 
    With regard to CANRIS, the Child Abuse and Neglect Report and Inquiry System, the District Court didn't say, the District Court's opinion is not even internally consistent on this point, I don't believe, they didn't say we couldn't make the investigations. 
    They didn't say we couldn't keep accusatory files. 
    They said we could keep investigated files, what they said was, you can't store it and retrieve it electronically, that's all, that's all the opinion means on the Child Abuse and Neglect Report and Inquiry System and that is if we are here talking most of our time as we are about comity and federalism and allowing the state to go about its own business, if you can't keep your files in the medium over your own choosing, then the Federal Courts have gone to meddling.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Could I ask you. 
    Was the petition for habeas corpus that was filed initially and then transferred to Montgomery County, was that petition ever acted on? 
    Was it ever denied?

    Mr. David H. Young 
    No, the normal course in Texas is if someone files a petition asking for relief they go to the judge to the clerk and get a hearing on it, and the Sims filed that petition and never asked for a hearing as far as the --

    So it's still sitting there.

    Mr. David H. Young 
    It is still there.

    Of course if the children were ultimately returned anyway.
speaker="david_h_young" startTime="3981.474" stopTime="3985.326">
    Mr. David H. Young 
    And they were returned so long ago that it's problematic whether we could do anything about it.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, that is moot now, isn't it?

    Mr. David H. Young 
    That's one of our contentions, yes. 
    The passage of time is just, we didn't ask for termination in the first place and when we were only seeking temporary conservatorship over child to try to give him some help while he needs it. 
    Then once the time is passed where he needed it, there is not much point is us trying to do anything.

    The case is submitted.
