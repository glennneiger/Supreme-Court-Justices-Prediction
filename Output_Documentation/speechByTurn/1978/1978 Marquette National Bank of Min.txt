    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    These cases are here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Minnesota. 
    The First National Bank of Omaha, Nebraska is a national bank chartered in Nebraska. 
    It's also enrolled in the BankAmericard plan and includes among its customers under that plan a number of cardholders who are residents of the adjoining State of Minnesota. 
    The rate of interest permitted to be charged to cardholders under Nebraska law is 18% on unpaid balances. 
    Under Minnesota law, it's 12%. 
    The Supreme Court of Minnesota held that this Omaha and Nebraska Bank could charge resident cardholders in Minnesota, the 18% rate and is not limited to the 12% rate authorized by Minnesota law. 
    The Minnesota Supreme Court reached that conclusion on the ground that as a national bank, the Omaha Bank is a federal instrumentality whose interest rate for its BankAmericard program is governed by federal law, and federal law, the National Bank Act, 12 United States Code Section 85, authorizes a national bank to charge interests on any loan at the rate allowed by the laws of the State where the bank is and the word of the statute is located. 
    The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the Omaha Bank for the purposes of the statute was located in Nebraska, therefore, authorize the charge in Nebraska 18% rate. 
    We agree and unanimously affirm the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court.
