Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The case is submitted we’ll hear arguments next in Greenholtz against Inmates of Nebraska Correctional Institution. 
    Mr. Gillan you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case involve the question of whether procedural due process applies in the granting a parole and if so the extent of the required procedures. 
    As this Court is aware the Circuits have been pretty evenly divided on this, some of them saying that no procedural due process applies at all and others saying that it applies to the extent that reasons must be given for the denial of parole. 
    As a matter of fact the Fourth Circuit in Franklin versus Shield required more extensive procedures and the court sitting en banc it reversed the panel and said that the only procedures required was giving of the reasons for the denial. 
    However, in this case the Court of Appeals mandated very extensive procedures of requiring that each inmate be given a formal hearing at the time that he first became eligible, that he be given notice of the factors that would be considered and so forth, I won’t list all of them. 
    The most important one, I think the one that we are most concerned with is the last, the Court of Appeals said that an inmate denied parole must be given a full and fair explanation in writing of the essential facts relied on and the reasons for denial. 
    Now we have no objection to the giving out the reasons for denial, because under State Law he is now required to be given the reasons for denial, but when the Board is required to given him a full and fair explanation in writing of the essential facts relied upon, we think that they are changing the entire type of hearing and making it an evidentiary hearing and it would be very difficult for us to comply with that. 
    So the issues --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="243.994" stopTime="247.852">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    One way to comply might be to abolish of parole.
speaker="ralph_h_gillan" startTime="247.852" stopTime="248.651">
    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    I beg your pardon.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="248.651" stopTime="251.562">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    One way to comply it might be to abolish the parole system.
speaker="ralph_h_gillan" startTime="251.562" stopTime="541.752">
    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    Yeah, it’s very true Your Honor and I think that there, there may well be a strong inclination for various states to do that if some of these procedures are recorded. 
    Now so our question here is whether it applies at all and whether Nebraska has complied with any procedures which are required by the Federal Constitution. 
    We believe that there are two basic reasons why procedural due process should not apply to the granting parole. 
    I will discuss the weaker of those two arguments first. 
    First we believe that there is a difference between the deprivation of a right which has already been granted, a freedom which has been granted and the refusal to grant that freedom in the first place. 
    Now the Fifth Circuit has relied pretty exclusively on that distinction in Scarpa versus U.S. Parole Board and in Morrissey versus Brewer, this Court quoted with approval the language in Bay versus The Board of Parole drawing that distinction, holding that there is a difference between refusing to give some one a benefit and taking away a benefit which are already been given. 
    I am not contending that that distinction should be decisive in this case because I can visualize a situation in which a state statute provided that upon proof of a certain set of facts that a person should be entitled to a certain benefit or conversely that he should be entitled to a certain benefit in the absence of proof of facts or certain facts. 
    I do think however that the cases indicate that the showing should be much clearer and the case of the granting of a benefit and that the procedures that would be required would probably be less in that situation. 
    The primary reason that I believe the -- that procedural due process should not apply in this case, if that under State law there are no provable facts, which require the granting of parole and there are no facts which must be proved to denial. 
    The Statute that Nebraska operates under is cited in our brief and first of all it makes denial of parole dependent upon the Parole Boards having an opinion. 
    It’s not – there is nothing in here that says that if the -- if it should be found that certain facts are true that he shall be granted parole that or that he may be denied a parole in the event certain facts are established. 
    It provides whenever the Board of Parole considers release of a committed defender, it shall order his release unless it is of the opinion that his release should be deferred. 
    And then look at the factors that are the conditions under which they can deny it. 
    There is a substantial risk that he will not confirm to the conditions of parole. 
    What facts would one prove that would show that there is a substantial risk that he will not confirm to the conditions of his parole.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="541.752" stopTime="550.451">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I suppose that might show that he had done parole three times previously and that all was broken, his conditions with parole that could be --

    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    They would be purely predictive Your Honor and then the next is even less susceptible to approve. 
    His release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for law.

    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    I am startled at the position that the Solicitor General has taken in this case because I have read the Federal Act and I find it virtually indistinguishable from the Nebraska Act in this respect. 
    Because the Federal Act also says that the inmate shall be paroled unless the Parole Board finds and I believe one of the criteria is that his release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for law.

speaker="ralph_h_gillan" startTime="871.263" stopTime="898.794">
    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    You made it clear in Morrissey versus Brewer that a man who is on parole has an expectation founded on State Law that his parole will not be terminated in the absence of misconduct and so unless they have evidence of specific misconduct they cannot terminate his parole.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Gillan, suppose the State statute provided that the Parole Board could act on the basis of a hunch, say the language was very, very broad and said that because these things are largely discretionary they can act on the basis of their personal experience with respect to certain kinds of people and if they just think that there is some risk that the man may not be behaving properly, they have a statutory right to do it, would that statute be on constitution?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    If its not then there really is no fundamental distinction between granting and denying. 
    If you rely on the, is the status, the language of the statute make any difference.

    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    Well, of course according to the government’s position as I understand it, the statute could provide no standards whatever. 
    The government seems to takes the position that this period, this could be in the complete discretion of the Parole Board with no standards whatever in which case I suppose they could under the statute at least to do it on any basis they wished on the whim or a hunch or anything that they saw fit. 
    Nebraska has seen fit to lay down some standards for the Parole Board to guide them and they exercise their discretion and --

speaker="ralph_h_gillan" startTime="1024.319" stopTime="1061.440">
    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    No, that’s right, he does not. 
    Frequently, I believe that his file is discussed with him if there is something in there which the Parole Board feels is important one way or the other and the granting or denial of parole that matter is discussed with him, but there is no guarantee of course that that will be true and he has no access to it.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    We submit today a fair determination of facts decisive of rights is the basic purpose of procedure or due process. 
    The reason for having a hearing is to determine facts and unless there are some facts which are capable of being determined which are decisive with rights, we see no purpose in having a due process hearing.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1095.517" stopTime="1118.884">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well does that mean really that there are three different positions taken here that the State takes a position there is a neither a liberty or property interest involved, the government says there is a -- the Federal Government says there is a property interest because of the statute and your opponent say there is a liberty interest because of the freedom that would resolve from the granting of parole.
speaker="ralph_h_gillan" startTime="1118.884" stopTime="1208.715">
    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    I say that there is no liberty interest, because the liberty interest has been taken away from him by his conviction and sense. 
    And that liberty interest can be revived only in the event that a state statute makes provision for its being revived. 
    Now, in a situation where he is granted a parole then the State by its action pursuant to the statute has recreated the liberty interest and has provided that cannot be taken away from him in the absence of misconduct. 
    But until that liberty interest is recreated it does not exist. 
    I believe that this matter has to be considered pretty much in property right term, property interest terms which must be created by a State statute in this situation and unless we find an interest created by State statute in a parole then it doesn’t exist --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1208.715" stopTime="1215.863">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Gillan, doesn’t the Nebraska Statute first provide that after a certain period of time the inmate is eligible for parole.

    Mr. Gillan, you were just reading the statutes supposing there are four reasons why parole release may be denied. One that he may be is, we will not confirm the conditions of parole and then they list the other three. 
    Now assume you have a case in which the members of the Parole Board get together and they all agree that there is A, no substantial risk, B, the letting him out after ten years in jail it wouldn’t create disrespect for the law and C, they say each of these four conditions is met and they’ve put that down in writing and say so.

    That’s right and the parolee when he’s released gets a copy of the statute and he’s told if we get worried about the way you’re behaving even if we don’t have any proof of anything at all we have the power to revoke your parole like that.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2394.096" stopTime="2430.757">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, in the Federal system particularly on many of the States, inmates are released on what’s now called work release very frequently independent of any statute and independent of the parole system they want to go somewhere and work on a job and report back. 
    Would you think that once an inmate is allowed to go and work on a job, he has acquired some new or different interest from what he had before he was allowed to go on a work release program?
speaker="william_alsup" startTime="2430.757" stopTime="2600.566">
    Mr. William Alsup 
    In such cases that Mr. Chief Justice I think the government’s position would be clear most of these worked furlough programs are for short durations up to 30 days, and it is in absolute condition of any of those work study or work release programs that the Warden or the Bureau of Prisons has a absolute authority to terminate the program or the liberty at anytime. 
    Under those circumstances under a statute or in regulation which conferred no entitlement to work release or furlough, we would say there will be no right to a due process hearing at all. 
    Because there has been some questions raised about the Federal Parole System or perhaps I could take just a moment to draw the Court’s attention to two features of the Federal Parole Statute which at least for purposes of the issue that’s presented here distinguish the Federal Parole System. 
    Unlike the Nebraska Statute which creates a presumption that the prisoner will be released at the first moment of eligibility or shortly thereafter, the United States Parole Commission Statute establishes utmost a presumption that the prisoner will be released at sometime during the guidelines established by the United States Parole Commission. 
    The Commission is absolutely free in its discretion to select a date within that guideline range, although if the commission selects a date outside the guideline range, the commission must have good cause to do so. 
    Because the commission has absolute discretion to select a date within the guideline range under the position that we have taken no due process hearing and all would be required so long as the release date is selected does fall within that guideline period. 
    Now that’s under the statute itself. 
    I should hasten to say as a second distinguishing feature that by regulation, the United States Parole Commission has adopted a procedure of setting a presumptive release date which, very soon after the prisoner arrives at the Federal Institution which tells the prisoner that on, for example, March 3rd 1981, the prisoner will be released so long as a, there’s good behavior be a satisfactory release plan has established and finally there’s no subsequent new information that comes to light which shows that the original plan was a mistake in the first place or the original date was a mistake. 
    Now, in fact just by regulations issued yesterday by the Parole Commission this presumptive release date practice is now been extended –-
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2600.566" stopTime="2603.247">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did you state that Federal?
speaker="william_alsup" startTime="2603.247" stopTime="2603.748">
    Mr. William Alsup 
    That’s correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2603.748" stopTime="2604.834">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Okay.
speaker="william_alsup" startTime="2604.834" stopTime="2717.663">
    Mr. William Alsup 
    This Federal procedure of a presumptive release date has now been extended by regulation issued yesterday to virtually all Federal prisoners. 
    The significance of that is that under the position of the United States, once a presumptive release date is set subject to those conditions it cannot be changed or altered without some sort of the due process hearing. 
    With respect to the merits, it is our position that denial of parole requires a due process hearing only where the statute or regulations or some mutual expectation as the Court said in the Leis versus Flynt case last Monday, exist to create an entitlement to release. 
    We think this follows from two propositions. 
    First, the denial of parole itself does not result in a deprivation of liberty, the deprivation of liberty occurs upon conviction. 
    The denial of parole continues the incarceration under that lawfully imposed sentence. 
    Now, if the Court accepts that argument then the remainder of the argument seems to be dictated by this Court’s decisions since Roth in which the question has been very clearly posed in terms of whether or not to State or Federal Statute or some custom has created an entitlement under given circumstances. 
    Here the Nebraska Statute does create an entitlement to release so as the Court of Appeals found upon subject to defeasance upon any of four conditions and we believe that does fall within this Court’s definition of what an entitlement.

    I see, and you don’t use, here entitlement to what?
speaker="william_alsup" startTime="2793.514" stopTime="2906.059">
    Mr. William Alsup 
    It looks more like liberty than property but because it an entitlement and because both liberty and property are used together in the Due Process Clause, we would think that the analysis which respect to each would be the same whether or not there is some entitlement either to liberty or to property. 
    With respect to what processes do there is normally the due process cases in this Court have address the full panoply of rights or components on the hearing. 
    In this particular case the petition only raise two issues. 
    One of those issues was when should the hearing be held not about the components should be and other issue is whether or not a summary of the evidence of fact should be required. 
    In my remaining time I would like to address briefly just the first of those. 
    It is a very important question that differentiates parole releases from parole revocation and at one with the question of when the hearing itself should be held. 
    Unlike the case in Morrissey where the revocation hearing had to come in the wake of the alleged violation, here we have a sensitive process of monitoring the progress of an inmate and the very question itself was determining when is most propitious movement to hold the hearing is itself a delicate question subject to the expertise in the Parole Board. 
    And for that reason we would suggest that perhaps the Court of Appeals was an error in mandating that that hearing be held at the first movement of eligibility rather than perhaps at a movement when the hearing might really do the inmate or good.

    What do you think about the question I put first to you on Brandon, if a Judge who has the option to grant probation at the time of the verdict permits a hearing, an argument on whether it should be granted and then simply without any elucidation denies probation and sentences this defendant to traditional term, must you give reasons?
speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="2967.172" stopTime="2974.225">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    I would start first from the proposition Your Honor, that in sentencing the process if there’s typically not been a requirement for a statement of reasons for the sentencing --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2974.225" stopTime="3012.616">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I’m trying to find it out. 
    I’m trying to see if there’s some analogy. 
    What if he then carried on suppose he – the counsel says I’d like to argue and present some evidence as to why you should grant probation here and the judge says no I don’t need any argument and I don’t need any evidence, I’ll decide this matter on my own and he adjourns Court and later or at this very time opposes the sentence 10 to 30 years, 3 to 9 years, must he give reasons, must he conduct the hearing, it’s been the question.
speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3012.616" stopTime="3023.935">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    Yeah of course in the concept -- in the process of the criminal proceeding the inmate or the individual has been accorded a great deal of due process, the facts upon which a judge will base his assertion.

speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3028.108" stopTime="3039.502">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    Correct Your Honor, but the judge is acquainted with the facts that came through that process and that’s the facts that will influence his decision as to whether or not to grant probation, as to whether or not what sentence is going to be complied.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3039.502" stopTime="3054.361">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But in most states as you’ll find the statute that permits the judge to grant probation, does that create a reasonable expectation that the judge might grant probation?
speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3054.361" stopTime="3106.586">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    It creates a reasonable expectation in my line that the judge might grant probation and to the -- the due process has been accorded throughout the criminal proceeding accords the inmate or the individual what he is entitled to. 
    As to your question on reasons I think there is a fundamental distinction between sentencing and the parole system. 
    In sentencing if you deny -- if you indicate that you are not going to grant probation, there is no function served as such by the reasons. 
    It does not advise that individual of anything that he could do to get probation in the future. 
    It’s the decision made at that point. 
    On the other hand in the parole process if you advise the inmate of the reasons for his denial of parole, then at a future time he can work or as he goes along he can work on those items and attempt to convince the Board at his next hearing that he should be granted parole.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3106.586" stopTime="3126.519">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Isn’t that almost exactly the same thing if the judge is required to say why he denies probation, and then denies it, and the prisoner goes to the institution he has got a little bit of a idea of what he should do in order to qualify for a parole, is that not so?
speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3126.519" stopTime="3249.316">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    I have not -- frankly certainly Your Honor the factors or considerations would be precisely same in the probation versus a parole concept. 
    I would agree with you it would probably help the inmate though to know something about what he should be doing to correct his personality problems whatever they maybe, so that he can better convince the parole board to grant him parole, but that might be several years, three, four, five years off and the parole board’s attitudes maybe significantly different than what that sense in judge’s attitudes maybe. 
    As the Solicitor General has argued here, a liberty interest is created by the statutes in the State of Nebraska. 
    That interest is routinely deprived by the practices employed by the Nebraska Parole Board, but it’s not yet been pointed out to the Court with any specificity if the stage at which the parole release decision is made in the State of Nebraska and the lack of procedural protections which are there afforded. 
    In fact the parole release decision is seldom made at the final parole hearing rather it is made in the State of Nebraska at a case in record review, a proceeding at which few of any procedural safeguards are employed. 
    In these reviews the inmate is not entitled to present evidence either documentary or live. 
    He is not entitled to the assistance of counsel or counsel substitute. 
    He is not entitled to see, hear, or know of any adverse information received or considered by the Board. 
    Indeed the most fundamental of the procedural protection is his presence of that hearing is in practical reality denied. 
    The Board of Parole Nebraska conducts these review hearings on two days out of each month. 
    During the period of July 1, 1975 through June 30, 1976 they conducted 645 of these hearings on those two days out of each month. 
    At average it is out to about seven minutes per hearing at which the Board’s principal function is ask the inmates a few questions and then excuse him from the room while they make their determination.

    Due process requires or the state statutes in the first place Your Honor requires those factors to be considered, many of those factors can come only from the inmate and the only opportunity he would have is either through a written submission--

    I would suggest that a written submission Your Honor in the case of many inmates would not be an adequate opportunity for that inmate to make his case. 
    There are many inmates who simply cannot express themselves in writing, cannot bring forth factual information they might need to. 
    They need the opportunity to appear before that Board to have a meaningful chance to talk to that Board and to make the case for parole.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you think you should be able to testify or call witnesses?
speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3490.900" stopTime="3533.288">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    I do Your Honor. 
    Let me clarify I think in that respect why I think that is true. 
    In Nebraska there are two types of parole proceedings, the review hearing and the final hearings. 
    It’s at the review hearing the decision is typically made. 
    They decide at the review hearing whether the inmate should be set for a final hearing in the case. 
    It’s used as a screening device. 
    I would suggest to the Court in Nebraska that the final hearing is in fact simply confirmation of the prior decision of the Board at the review hearing. 
    Roughly, well in a six month period 375 inmates at Nebraska who were eligible for parole were denied that final hearing on the basis of the review hearing. 
    Now the final hearing Nebraska statute permit --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3533.288" stopTime="3540.716">

    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    I shudder at the thought too if all hearings were to have lawyers at it and if it was of very adversarial nature. 
    I don’t suggest that it should be anything but in formal; I think that the inmate should have the opportunity to bring in the witness for in an in formal discussion if he has witnesses who indeed can present evidence that --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3558.128" stopTime="3560.965">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    He can ask some of the inmates or someone like that.

    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    We are not contending here that he has a right to an attorney in this type of proceedings. 
    Nebraska at the final hearings permits the inmate if he can afford counsel on his own to have those -- to have counsel present.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3570.966" stopTime="3574.031">

    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    It’s not my understanding Your Honor in review hearings of many there would be a rare exception that any would run 30 minutes. 
    The testimony of the Chairman of Board of Parole was that in general these hearings take no longer than 10 minutes.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3602.461" stopTime="3623.143">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well of course in many courts, including this one.

speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3623.143" stopTime="3636.394">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    No, I think most cases arising in this Court however have come from lower courts where there was in fact a great deal of due process court and that’s significantly different in the parole situation.

    And now when you talk about the informal procedure the very purpose, historic purpose of procedure and formality is to speed up the process instead of letting people just wander all over the lot and talk at will in any form they want.

speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3658.995" stopTime="3660.291">

    No, I have not done a calculation on that but for each of the formal hearings that we would, in the words of the board they would call it a formal hearing, if they could call it due process right so the due process this Court might say was applicable. 
    They would have one less review hearing that they would have to conduct because the review hearing now serves essentially as a substitute.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3684.684" stopTime="3689.623">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3689.623" stopTime="3711.534">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    It would approximately double the number of formal hearings that were likely to be held by the Nebraskan Parole Board during the year. 
    I don’t believe that that adds a significant burden to them nor that’s a burden that can be easily handled. 
    They have five members currently; all five members sit at every formal hearing. 
    The Nebraska statute does not require that, it requires only a majority of the board members to sit with the hearings.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3711.534" stopTime="3717.069">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you think we should tell Nebraska how many of its parole officers should sit in that hearing?
speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3717.069" stopTime="3810.923">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    No, this Court should not tell Nebraska that. 
    I simply say that because this Court is under its own cases concerned with an analysis of what the burden is to the state of the additional safeguards that it might employ. 
    I am saying that the burdens incurred in this case wouldn’t be burdens that could be handled by the Nebraska Board of Parole because they have the extra members that they could utilize and because it would result in a like reduction in the number of review hearings that would be held. 
    I do not argue that there is not some increased burden to the state. 
    I say simply that the interest of the inmate and his liberty outweighs that burden. 
    The discussion we have been having of course assumes the applicability of the Due Process Clause to parole release proceedings. 
    That analysis requires an examination of the nature of the interest at stake. 
    The analysis must begin I think with an examination of Nebraska’s statutory provisions. 
    The statute has been quoted here several times. 
    I think it bears reading again, “whenever the Board of Parole considers a release of committed offender who was eligible for release on parole, it shall order his release unless it is of the opinion that his release should be deferred because,” it lists then the four statutory grounds upon which parole maybe denied. 
    That same statute lists 14 factors that must be considered by the Parole Board in its decision. The statute comes from the Model Penal Code, is an exact adoption of that, of the provisions of the Model Penal Code.

speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="3926.827" stopTime="3999.871">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    I do not deny that there are large elements of discretion in the parole release proceeding, but I suggest that Nebraska statutes channel and instruct the Parole Board on how to exercise that discretion. 
    And under those circumstances there is a statutory entitlement to a fair consideration of parole. 
    In discussing that very statute the National Advisory Commission on the Criminal Justice Standards and Goals stated that the model penal code represents a turnaround in the traditional assumption that the burden of proof however evaluated rests on the inmate. 
    It proposes that an inmate is to be released on parole when he is first eligible unless one of the four conditions exists. 
    I suggest to the Court that the statute therefore creates a presumption in favor of release defeasible only if one of the limited number of grounds for denial is found to be present. 
    This case thus unlike is Meachum versus Fano where there was no such statutory entitlement. 
    It rather is like the Morrissey case, it is like Wolff versus McDonnell both in that it affects the term of confinement of the inmate rather than the conditions of confinement as were at issue in Meachum and because --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What if, what if the record showed that a particular inmate coming up for eligibility and his record is being processed in the board and by the staff and it shows that seven times in four years he was put in solitary confinement for assaulting fellow prisoners and guards, and the most recent being within 30 days. 
    Chairman of the Parole Board says that, no use of even wasting seven minutes on this fellow, no hearing at all.

    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    You are asking me, do I think he has been denied due process? 
    I certainly do. 
    Part of the risk in the Nebraska procedure and I think in any Parole Board, the procedure that might be the file of another individual and at least by that, it might be the file of another individual. 
    You may have two John Does and you are looking at the wrong John Doe and you deny the hearing to the individual who was --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4052.143" stopTime="4066.798">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That’s what we are suggesting. Morrissey is the only reason for holding it, but suppose there is only one John McCormick Doe in the entire prison, and the Chairman says, check this out and they say, yes there is only one.
speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="4066.798" stopTime="4310.545">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    I certainly agree with you Your Honor that in some extreme circumstances we are going to know, and the Parole Board is going to know, beforehand that a hearing-- and perhaps the inmate will know, is essentially useless. 
    But in many cases I think it will be very useful both to the inmate and the Board. 
    And if the Court can instruct us on how to draw a line between what will be useful and what won’t in that standpoint, I think you know it would be very helpful to our concern, but absent that kind of a line I think that all of those hearings are going to have to be conducted for the benefit of the many over those -- over the extreme examples. 
    The Board has argued here in some of the questions of concern this objective of discretionary nature of the decision. 
    I think it’s important to note that this Court’s cases have required a consideration of the interest at stake, not the nature of the board’s proceedings in determining whether due process applies. 
    Release proceedings in my mind are two step process, the first is a fact gathering process, through the file, through the social history of the inmate, through the correctional department talking to the employee, the people he may be employed by, it gathers many objective facts that the Parole Board will consider in the exercise of its discretion; that discretion being the second step in the parole process. 
    But it’s significant and important to the inmate and so they have the ability to ensure that the facts upon which that predictive expertise of the Parole Board is exercised are accurate and correct in order to prevent the occurrence of inaccurate decisions based upon inaccurate facts. 
    Briefly I’d like to call the Court’s attention as well the notice provisions undertaken by the State of Nebraska as to parole proceedings. 
    In the State of Nebraska at a parole release review hearing or at a final hearing if the inmate is either deferred or denied parole, he is informed of the month during which he will next appear before the Board. 
    He is not advised however as to the day or the hour at which that hearing will occur, that information is supplied to the inmate only on the day of the actual hearing through the posting of a list at the penal complex of the inmates who will be heard on that day. 
    In notifying the inmates of the reasons for denial particularly following a review hearing the notice takes on the effect of being almost meaningless to the inmate. 
    The Board uses a pre-printed form called a PB-1 an example of which is located at page 35 of the appendix. 
    While the Board continues a statuary ground or the form contains statuary grounds for denial of parole, the Board simply checks it off without explanation of what the specific facts upon which it is relying are. 
    In 80% of the cases it checks item A which reads, your continued correctional treatment, vocational, educational or job assignment in the facility will substantially enhance your capacity to lead a law abiding life when you are released at a later date. 
    No explanation is ever given on this form to the inmate as to which of the alternatives listed in that item apply to him, and no response is made to an inmate if he requests the Board specifically to tell him whether it is correctional treatment, vocational treatment, educational treatment or job assignment that they are concerned with. 
    The second part of the form is entitled correctional deficiencies. 
    It’s commendable that the Board would want to tell the inmates how to correct their deficiencies, but six listed deficiencies are stated on that form, and in 379 I think the figure is, out of 385 cases covered in the survey in the back of the appendix, the inmates had all six items checked, items such as joining self improvement clubs regardless of the fact that the inmate was a member of every self improvement club at the penitentiary.

    No, they meet more frequently than that. 
    They have five days that they conduct hearings during each month. 
    One of those days is at the woman’s reformatory and for the youth offenders, while two others days are spend on final hearings. 
    The two days that I was referring two are spend on review hearings. 
    That’s their general practice throughout the year.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4409.288" stopTime="4417.101">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But you are not suggesting that the part-time people put in only two days a month in the aggregate?
speaker="brian_k_ridenour" startTime="4417.101" stopTime="4504.179">
    Mr. Brian K. Ridenour 
    No I am not Your Honor. 
    I really could not tell you how much but I assume they do spend sometime beforehand looking at some of the files at least for the final hearings. 
    Review hearings I think the process is generally to open the file at the hearing and look at it at that point, just because of the sheer numbers they are dealing with at that point. 
    With respect to the interest at stake, I could say only that in Morrissey, the Chief Justice indicated that the liberty of a parolee although indeterminate includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty, by whatever name that liberty is valuable and must be seen as within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    I submit to this Court that there is not a significant difference between the present liberty interest whether it be created by statute or it arise from the constitution and this Court should conclude that parole in Nebraska is-- and parole release decisions are subject to the Due Process Clause and that in order for Nebraska to comply with the Due Process Clause the inmate must be afforded a reasonable advance notice, a meaningful hearing, a record of those proceedings, and the opportunity and a written statement of the reasons for denial including the essential facts relied upon. 
    So that he may specifically know what it is that he needs to do to correct his behavior and to perhaps gain a parole at a future time.

    Mr. Ralph H. Gillan 
    We’ve, not Your Honor except that I will say that the Attorney General’s office does not work with the Parole Board on a daily basis, and so we are not as intimately familiar with their procedures as Mr. Ridenour would indicate. 
    I will answer one question, they serve six year terms and they have a secretarial staff only. 
    They have -- there are parole counselors at the penitentiary, but they do not serve under the Parole Board and the Parole Board has no control of them. 
    The only staff that the Parole Board has is secretarial.
