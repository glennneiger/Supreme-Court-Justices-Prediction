National Labor Relations Board v. Baptist Hospital, Inc.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The case is submitted. 
    We'll hear arguments next in National Labor Relations Board against Baptist Hospital. 
    Mr. Come, I think you may proceed when you're ready.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="71.636" stopTime="521.416">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Sixth Circuit that involves the application of the principles for determining the validity under the National Labor Relations Act of rules barring employee union solicitation and literature distribution in hospitals which were enunciated by this Court's decision in Beth Israel Hospital last term. 
    The facts are briefly these. 
    This Baptist Hospital is a nonprofit hospital located in Nashville. 
    It has 600 patient beds and more than 1,800 employees. 
    For a number of years prior to October 1974, the hospital maintained the rule which prohibited anyone to solicit patients or visitors while on hospital premises without written approval of the administration. 
    In August of 1974, Congress enacted the Health Care Amendments to the National Labor Relations Act, bringing nonprofit hospitals under the Act's coverage. 
    In response to these amendments and to the fact that the union had began a campaign to organize the hospitals employees, the hospital after consulting with its lawyers but not with any doctors issued in October 1974 a revised rule. 
    The rule provided in pertinent part that no solicitations of any kind including solicitations for union membership will be permitted by employees at anytime including work time and non-work time in any area of the hospital which is accessible to or utilized by the public. 
    Solicitation was barred in other areas by employees who were supposed to be working or when conducted in such a way as to interfere with employees who are working. 
    The effect of this rule is to bar employee solicitation and literature distribution in such public areas as the hospital's cafeteria, gift shop, lobbies, public restrooms, entrances and even the parking lot across the street from the hospital and to confine such activity to nonpublic areas which were not -- or where not all the employees were accessible. 
    The Board upon charges filed by the union concluded that the revised rule violated Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act to the extent that it prohibited employees on soliciting the union during their non-work time in areas of the hospital other than the immediate patient care areas, the Board in short followed its decision in Saint John's Hospital that held while a hospital could lawfully bar employee solicitation or literature distribution in immediate patient care areas such as the patient's rooms, operating rooms, and therapy rooms are barred on that activity in other areas was presumptively invalid absent a showing by the hospital that was necessary to avoid disruption of patient care. 
    And the Board adopting the findings of the administrative law judge concluded that the hospital had not made that showing of special need here. 
    The Sixth Circuit in the decision rendered before this Court's decision in Beth Israel denied enforcement of the Board's order. 
    The Sixth Circuit found that the testimony by the hospital and two doctors as to the necessity for creating and maintaining a tranquil atmosphere throughout the hospital for patients and visitors was sufficient to establish special circumstances that warranted the hospital's restriction of employee solicitation and distribution in these public areas. 
    We submit that the Court of Appeals erred in not applying the principles that this Court enunciated in the Beth Israel case. 
    In Beth Israel, the Court held that the Board's general approach of requiring a health care facilities to permit employee solicitation and distribution during nonworking time in nonworking areas where the hospital had not justified the prohibitions as necessary to avoid disruption of healthcare operations was consistent with the Act. 
    And the Court went on to find that the Board had reasonably applied that principle in concluding that the hospital had overstepped the line in prohibiting employee solicitation in its cafeteria which was used primarily by employees but also by patients and visitors. 
    Now, this case differs from Beth Israel in that it involves not only the hospital cafeteria but other public areas accessible to patients and their families. 
    In addition, as I indicated, there was a testimony by the hospital administrator and the two of its doctors in an effort to justify the rule. 
    Now, let's look at the facts here. 
    A hospital cafeteria here is essentially similar to that in Beth Israel. 
    The hospital study of cafeteria usage is not as detailed as it was in Beth Israel. 
    However, it shows that the employee usage was nonetheless substantial, 68% on weekdays and at least 47% on weekends, at least of those that went through the line. 
    The percentage of patients in the remaining 32% or 53% of the cafeteria's patrons is not shown by the hospital study but there is testimony in the record to indicate that only a small percentage of the patients used the cafeteria, most of them obtained their meals in their rooms and they can only go down to the cafeteria if they receive special permission to go down there.

    Now, Mr. Come, what significance is your reference to special permission? 
    Of course that's routine in the hospital.

    Well, --

speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="535.703" stopTime="582.928">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, I'm emphasizing it to show that the -- there's nothing in this record to indicate that the use of the cafeteria was a predominant part of the hospital's therapeutic treatment here. 
    That the use of the -- that the cafeteria, the testimony shows was primarily a place of the employees took their breaks and want to relax and the patient --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="582.928" stopTime="593.549">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, wouldn't a special permission to be relevant to the question whether patients who went to the cafeteria were at least thought to be well enough to associate with the public as opposed to secret people.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="593.549" stopTime="640.533">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    That is correct. 
    And here, as in Beth Israel, the same fact is present. 
    Similarly, the other public areas in which employee solicitation and distribution was barred are areas which the hospital did not consider to be patient care or work areas. 
    There's testimony by the hospital administrator, Dr. Victory to the effect that none of these areas were regarded as a work area or an area of patient care or treatment.

    I think it would depend upon whether or not you could -- it would -- the hospital could show that those were patient care areas and I think in most hospitals, it would be easy to show that. 
    What you have here is just as a blanket rule that bars solicitation in any -- in every public area of the hospital.

    I have no doubt that it will be as we get into these cases more fully.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, Mr. Come doesn't this case, I know you said it but doesn't this case involve the corridor at least to this extent even though the solicitation was not in the corridor, the Board's order, if one reads it one way, does prohibit solicitation in the corridor, if one reads it another way, it doesn't. 
    And I read it frankly to prohibit solicitation in the corridor because I thought the Board didn't treat corridor as patient care areas. 
    I think that's what Mr. Justice Powell was asking you too.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="923.182" stopTime="966.549">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, I think -- I think that what the Board order says is that the hospital just cannot have a blanket ban in these public areas. 
    What they have to do is to define with more precision what are their patient care areas and even with respect to nonpatient care areas. 
    What are areas where it is likely that this sort of activity would interfere with patient care? 
    They have not done any of that in this case.

    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    No, I -- that testimony in short merely indicated that -- and it was given after the rule was promulgated, it was essential to keep a tranquil atmosphere, well, throughout the hospital, that when the doctors were asked about union solicitation, as my brother, Mr. Gold will indicate in more detail, he indicated that what they were concerned about was loud or hostile or volatile union solicitation and that peaceful solicitation one on one, they did not think would affect patient care.

    Mr. Norton J. Come

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    I'd like to get back to your statement, about this corridor that's not being used for treatment. 
    I think the record shows that the first thing doctors not try to do following surgery is to get that patient out into the corridors and into the rooms or the sitting rooms, or waiting rooms or where they visit with families and friends, then they move up and down as the record clearly shows on wheelchairs, on stretchers to and from treatment rooms and nobody can tell in advance when a patient will be so postured. 
    But coming back to the original point, I'd like to know whether the corridors in this case are there.

   Argument of Laurence Gold

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Gold.
speaker="laurence_gold" startTime="1220.473" stopTime="1485.066">
    Mr. Laurence Gold 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    To continue with the point that Mr. Come was discussing, it is our understanding that under the Board's present approach, the first inquiry is in -- is whether a particular area is an immediate patient care area or not. 
    Their factual and legal problems in making that determination just as there are in making any other determination and the Board has not yet articulated its approach to solving all the questions and arriving at the lines of demarcation as an appendix to our brief, the blue brief we reprint our submission to the Board in a series of cases which have come back to the Board after Beth Israel, where we discussed an approach to the differing rules that could be applied at page 40 through 42 that could be applied in the different flat functional areas of the hospital if that is the Board's view to the proper approach. 
    But in any rate, corridors are in the case, this case but they're treated under the Board's order only by a distinction between patient care and nonpatient care areas and that has to be made more concrete depending on what happens in this Court in handling the basic question of whether the overall Board approach is right or at least right with regards to areas other than cafeterias. 
    I'd like to spend the remainder of my time making three basic points. 
    The first is that the overall presumption here seems to us to be a common sense way of developing the law. 
    It rests on two basic premises of the Act. 
    One is that stated by this Court in the Magnavox case in 415 U.S. that the working place or at least nonworking areas of the working place are uniquely appropriate for employee communication that they are presumptively saved to the employees for distribution and solicitation. 
    And secondly, a point made in numerous labor law cases, most specifically I would think in the Allen case 373 U.S. that the party with the facts and the knowledge is the one who ought to have the burden of proof of demonstrating its position. 
    And here of course, the hospital position is that patient care would suffer at least in certain regards if solicitation distribution is allowed. 
    The hospital claims to have the expertise in -- with regard to these medical questions and it's appropriate it seems to us to put the burden on the hospital. 
    This is a rebuttable presumption. 
    This is not a rule of law that we're discussing here. 
    The Board's position that a broad ban on employee discussion is presumptively unlawful in the hospital can --

speaker="laurence_gold" startTime="1517.252" stopTime="1575.995">
    Mr. Laurence Gold 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the best way I can answer that question is to turn to (a) (66) of the record. 
    The -- at that point, Mr. French who did the soliciting here for the union stated what solicitation was and we're talking about an abstraction here and I think helps to make it more concrete. 
    He said, he solicited in the cafeteria and he said I asked if I could join people, other employees who were sitting down taking a break and eating, and sat down and talked with them. 
    That's what solicitation is. 
    It's not a something that's unusual for people to do on their breaks. 
    People whether they're bell boys, whether hospital personnel.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1575.995" stopTime="1584.632">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You moved in to the cafeteria. 
    I'm talking about public areas of a hospital that would correspond somewhat to the public areas of a hotel.
speaker="laurence_gold" startTime="1584.632" stopTime="1585.642">
    Mr. Laurence Gold 
    Well, I --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1585.642" stopTime="1592.472">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You mean they can just -- they can solicit without any interference with working functions?
speaker="laurence_gold" startTime="1592.472" stopTime="1698.775">
    Mr. Laurence Gold 
    I -- I think it would depend on whether it was a nonworking area for them and whether they were on nonworking time. 
    The reason I responded as I did was that it depends, I would think on what they do. 
    If you have two bell boys, to use your example, who are taking a break which is permitted to them in a corner of a hospital and one says to the other, we don't have a union here it would be good if we had one. 
    And they have a quiet conversation in the first -- and the person who to whom that subject is brought says, either that's a good idea or a bad idea. 
    I don't see why -- what employer interest, what hospital interest, what hotel interest ought to say that that is inappropriate. 
    On the other hand, if they are standing at the front desk holding a customer's suitcases and having that conversation with the customer standing there when they are in working time, that's a very different case. 
    So all I was trying to say is that solicitation is the task of normally of discussing and if it happens in an area where such discussions are common, where there is conversation, people walking around, conversing on many different subjects, it's difficult for us to see why off duty employees in a nonworking area should not be permitted to engage in that activity.

speaker="laurence_gold" startTime="1712.370" stopTime="1888.243">
    Mr. Laurence Gold 
    In the nonhospital context or at least, the factory context maybe a better word, solicitation has been permitted in working areas during nonworking time but not distribution. 
    That is a rule that I doubt if the Board would follow in areas where the public is present. 
    And the reason that I've taken your time to stress the point I've made is that the medical testimony in this case seems to us to suffer from a basic defect. 
    It is that the doctors didn't know what solicitation was. 
    Again, I'd like to direct you to page 61 of the record. 
    Dr. Ricketson after testifying for a length of time that's reflected in pages 51 through 60 of the record is cross-examined and the question is union solicitation, do you know what effect it would have? 
    Answer, first may I ask the question to be sure you and I understand? 
    What is union solicitation? 
    What does it consists of? 
    The medical testimony by and large assumes that union solicitation involves turmoil confusion, loud noises, speeches, and so on. 
    We think no matter what the basic legal rule is that whether there is a presumption for or against solicitation, the ultimate question ought to be that whatever the ultimate basic point ought to be that whatever standard an employer adopts if it bears more heavily on union solicitation of a kind that I've indicated goes on in this case, then on cognate nonunion activities discussion of other issues which may have just as great in effect on somebody maybe just as likely to result on an argument. 
    Now, my working experience says that the most likely areas for argument are questions of who is going to win the World Series and foreign policy and so on. 
    If you have general discussion, union discussion ought to be permitted. 
    That is the basic point, we submit.

    Mr. Laurence Gold 
    If I have time I have plan to go on to that but the reason that we think the Board could disregard that testimony is the reason I concluded with. 
    Certainly, if the hospital goes to the point of saying that employees in the cafeteria, employees on breaks wherever there is -- wherever members of the public may be can't talk to each other about anything, then perhaps that rationale makes some sense but that isn't the way this hospital works. 
    This is just like Beth Israel where they tell to the people who work at the hospital that if they discuss patient care, they should be careful not to be overheard. 
    There isn't a scintilla of evidence here that if anybody senses employee conversations on any issue other than union issues. 
    And we think that that is the first point. 
    That testimony is testimony that has nothing to with the real world. 
    The hospital permits TV, it permits radio, patients talk to each other, visitors talk to each other, that's the test.

speaker="fred_w_elarbee_jr" startTime="2057.172" stopTime="2477.052">
    Mr. Fred W. Elarbee, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    I think if the Court please, what we have here is an attempt by the Board to establish a rule that arises out of an industrial setting to a hospital situation which simply does not fit. 
    It's quite one thing when you talk about a manufacturing plant where all the employees are involved and another when you talk about a situation where third parties' rights and interests are involved. 
    Of course the Board got into that in the Retail Store cases, but here, you have even a further, more direct and important interest involved, it seems to me, and that is the right of the patient, or what the patient can expect when he goes to the hospital sometimes quite ill. 
    And what the patient's attitude is with respect to what's happening to him and those around in the hospital. 
    So I think the Board in establishing a rule that simply says immediate patient care areas and speaks to such areas such as the operating room, the patient's room and perhaps the X-ray room. 
    It's far to a limited rule given a modern day hospital when as this record shows as in Baptist Hospital patients are likely to be all with the hospital. 
    The patients who are ambulatory, patients who are transported to different places in the hospital, the rule simply doesn't fit in light of the testimony of this record. 
    In Beth Israel, Justice Blackmun expressed this concern in a concurring opinion. 
    I fear that this unusual case will be deemed to be an example for all hospital eating facility cases and that the Board and the courts now will go further down the open solicitation rule than they would have done had a more usual hospital case than the first one to come here. 
    Justice Brennan in writing the majority opinion advised the Board to follow the cases and the hospital cases as it came before them not to take Beth Israel as a standard, it necessarily was to be applied in all cases. 
    And I think what we have is the Board taking its rule as enunciated in St. John's Hospital and which form the foundation for Beth Israel which this Court decided earlier on a completely and vastly different record. 
    It's taking its rule in St. John's has applied it again in this case without even a discussion of the record evidence in his decision than on a basis of a footnote. 
    But we're following St. John in a footnote, so what we have first of all it seems to me is a Board establishing a rule that rises primarily out of an industrial situation, a manufacturing plant, attempting to transpose it with some modern modification to a hospital with immediate patient care areas and it simply will not fit for a hospital such as Baptist. 
    First of all, I like to point out that there were substantial differences in the record evidence in this case that was presented this Court in the Beth Israel case. 
    Justice Blackmun anticipated that this -- Justice Powell in his concurring opinion anticipated that this might very well arise. 
    Some of the things that are substantially different it seems to me is in a much greater showing in this case that there was public use, visitors and relatives in the Baptist Hospital cafeteria and I suppose along with that non-employees are perhaps patients, it doesn't show. 
    But it does show that about 32% of the patrons in the cafeteria during weekdays were visitors or were nonemployees. 
    It could've been patients and visitors, I suppose. 
    About 53% or a majority on the weekends were not employees in the cafeteria. 
    In the medical testimony, the unrefuted, uncontradicted testimony was that it has anything unsettling that occurs, circumstances that occur to a relative of the patient is inevitably rubs off from the patient and could certainly affect the recovery or the progress of the patient with respect to the treatment he was receiving at the hospital. 
    So you have contrasted. 
    As one of the members of the Court said I believe in Beth Israel what seems to be a typically employee-oriented cafeteria. 
    That's not the record in Baptist Hospital where certainly on weekends, a majority at least according to the surveyor, it was a limited survey according to the record shows that majority of the people visiting the cafeteria over weekends were nonemployees, are visitors to the hospital. 
    One point I would like to make further and if you read this record, all through it, the medical experts, the doctors, treated the hospital as a whole, as a patient care area, those area of the hospital where the patients were likely to be found. 
    They did not distinguish between the operating room or the patient's room or the gift shop where patients visit to get a newspaper or perhaps cigarettes or some other reason. 
    Those doctors did not distinguish between these areas and immediate patient care areas as the Board has done. 
    Another thing that was so vastly different about Beth Israel and is not true in this case, the record evidence in that case showed that the hospital itself, apparently because there were only about 9% -- the business of that cafeteria were 9% of the visitors had used it for, had allowed individual one on one solicitation prior to this case arise, it had used it for the types of solicitation for charities, various types of charities. 
    It had established a table and display rack for brochures and other important, other employee information. 
    That's not true in Baptist Hospital. 
    This record shows that this rule had been imposed for many years. 
    They had not allowed solicitation in the cafeteria. 
    It even shows that Mr. Victory, I believe it was his testimony that one employee attempting to sell Avon products in the cafeteria was disallowed prior, long before this case arose. 
    It's been a consistent rule consistently applied. 
    I think --

    Mr. Fred W. Elarbee, Jr. 
    But Mr. Justice Marshall, I'd like to get to a point here I think it may be somewhat misleading. 
    There's no need for this Court or for us or any of us to assume that union solicitation is just another type of ordinary conversation carried on between two people in a quiet and unassuming manner. 
    This Court long ago recognized in one of the early free speech cases and I think the language was something like the language of the picket line is not the parlance of the power. 
    I don't know whether Metamora days, one of the old free speech cases long time ago. 
    Well, certainly this is not a picket line but the Board has itself recognize that union solicitation can be unsettling. 
    It said it in St. John's. 
    It said, admittedly union solicitation would be unsettling but they said in immediate patient care areas. 
    Now how can you --

    Mr. Fred W. Elarbee, Jr. 
    Not a great deal. 
    Our record as it is -- the ideal place to solicit. 
    But then again and I think this is an important point to this Court. 
    We're not here and I don't think the union is entitled to say we are entitled to ideal circumstances to carry on our activities.

    There are places for hidden discussion, I suppose.

    Mr. Fred W. Elarbee, Jr. 
    That's right. 
    I mean, there's must be an accommodation. 
    After all, we're talking about a hospital. 
    We're talking about patients and if you a had sick one in the hospital, I'm sure you will realize if they are truly sick just overhear two nurses talking about whether or not they are going to go the beach the next day. 
    It's irritating and upsetting to a person who's sitting and wondering if they are going to live or die or something is seriously wrong with him.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3073.846" stopTime="3085.806">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Yes, but there are some people that have been in a hospital and hearing nurses talking about when they are going to get their promotion which has nothing to do with the union but that's alright.
speaker="fred_w_elarbee_jr" startTime="3085.806" stopTime="3110.254">
    Mr. Fred W. Elarbee, Jr. 
    Well, I think the testimony of the doctors was that any type of conduct or conversation which was unprofessional or would show the patient or the patient might be led to believe that these people are more concerned with something rather than patient care or need would be upsetting to a patient and they did not distinguish Justice Marshall between patient's stamina or a patient.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3110.254" stopTime="3117.263">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What I am worried about is that they decide what is good conversation and what is not.

    Mr. Fred W. Elarbee, Jr. 
    Well --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3117.749" stopTime="3124.605">

    And I think some people don't like other people deciding what they should talk about.

speaker="fred_w_elarbee_jr" startTime="3128.383" stopTime="3138.285">
    Mr. Fred W. Elarbee, Jr. 
    Well, yes and no. 
    I suppose we could speculate here what kind of conversations would be permitted, were they ordinary average conversation between --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3138.285" stopTime="3140.026">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, I don't want to get involved in that.
speaker="fred_w_elarbee_jr" startTime="3140.026" stopTime="3232.457">
    Mr. Fred W. Elarbee, Jr. 
    Alright sir. 
    Well, what were they talking about is a right to solicit union memberships on the premises and the Board recognizes the unsettling effects of union solicitation, it said that in St. John's. 
    Given that, how can you say that if you ought to be limited to the operating room or the patients' room. 
    I think that the Board is either saying one of two things. 
    They are either saying that it would not have unsettling effects in other places, it's either saying that or it's either saying it will only upset a few and therefore we should allow it. 
    I don't think that's an acceptable standard. 
    I don't believe -- I believe I've basically covered the point to the Court. 
    I urge the Court again that the court below reviewed the record and found that in so far as the Board had concluded that the hospital here showed special circumstances that the Board limited those special circumstances to the immediate patient care area, the court below specifically found that is not the evidence in this record, and so there was no justification for the Board concluding in the fact of this case that it should be limited to “immediate patient-care areas” and I ask this Court to affirm the decision of the court below which I believe to be correct, Your Honor.
