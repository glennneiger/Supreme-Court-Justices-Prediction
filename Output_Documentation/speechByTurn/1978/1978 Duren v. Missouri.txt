    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Missouri to review a judgment of that Court affirming a -- the conviction of petitioner, Duren, for first-degree murder. 
    Under the Missouri law, women are eligible for jury duty and are subject to call, but they are -- but they are entitled to an automatic exemption upon their request, no similar excuse is available to men. 
    Duren claims that his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to a trial by a jury representing a fair cross-section of the community is violated by the scheme. 
    The Missouri Supreme Court rejected the -- the submission, we reversed. 
    As we explain in an opinion on file with the clerk, this case is ruled by Taylor against Louisiana and decided a few terms ago and under that case and under the constitution the Missouri selection scheme is invalid, and hence, we reversed the judgments of Missouri Supreme Court. 
    And Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.
