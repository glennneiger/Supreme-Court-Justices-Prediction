United States v. Helstoski

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 349, United States against Helstoski and the consolidated case. 
    Mr. Stavis, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="20.127" stopTime="147.507">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    There are two cases here and the 546, our petition, Number 349 of the Solicitor General's petition, the facts in both cases are quite simple. 
    546 which I will deal with first involve the jurisdiction of the District Court to try this indictment. 
    And the facts there obviously the indictment itself which charges a member of Congress with taking money and conspiring to take money by introducing bills in Congress, bills which the indictment charges were in fact introduced, and the bills as specifically identified in the indictment. 
    It is plain from the face of the indictment that the grand jury which found it heard, considered and relied upon proof of the performance of legislative acts. 
    And while it is not clear from the face of the indictment, it is established in the opinion of Judge Meanor and undisputed that's the indicting grand jury, as the grand jury which handed down this indictment received proofs of the performance of legislative act from the United States attorney not from Mr. Helstoski. 
    It is also clear and undisputed that while Mr. Helstoski gave legislative materials to earlier grand juries, not the indicting grand jury, he had no reason to believe at the time that he gave such materials that he was the target of the grand jury, and in fact somebody else was thereafter indicted, tried and convicted.

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    It -- to our fundamental theory, it doesn't.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="161.710" stopTime="163.877">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Might have something to do with the waiver.
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="163.877" stopTime="174.114">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I don't think it has anything to do with waiver either, but I agree that if our theory is correct that this is a jurisdictional allocation then it wouldn't make any difference at all.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Who was the other person under inquiry, another member of Congress?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="178.657" stopTime="226.049">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    No, no somebody who had been employed by the Congressmen some eight years previously, was not then employed and hadn't been employed for many, many years. 
    Now, our position in 546 is, and you put your finger right on it, that the Court had no jurisdiction to try this indictment. 
    And if the Court agrees with us and that of course, it doesn't have to reach the evidentiary issues which were involved in 349. 
    Now, I'm not going to attempt to match the eloquence of this Court and its eight opinions dealing with the Speech and the Debate Clause and review or recant the history of that clause in its meaning in England and in United States.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="226.049" stopTime="242.811">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Stavis, are you going to get it all to the appealability of Judge Meanor's order by the Government? 
    I noticed that you attacked it in the Third Circuit but neither party apparently contest it here. 
    It would seem to me that it is not open and shut that that was an appealable order.
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="242.811" stopTime="270.153">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Well, I -- we -- in the Third Circuit, we certainly didn't believe that it was an appealable order. 
    We moved to dismiss before the Third Circuit on those grounds. 
    The Third Circuit denied our motion. 
    I must confess that we did not cross-petition on that particular issue, but it may very well be appropriate for the Court to address that question on its own motion because --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="270.153" stopTime="277.602">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, we have jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals opinion -- judgment only if it was properly in the Court of Appeals.
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="277.602" stopTime="359.821">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I don't think this matter is properly in the Court of Appeals. 
    Candidly, I don't think the issue which the Government presented in its petition or even properly before this Court, because the entire factual foundation for the Government's petition in 349 is a series of proposed profers of proof which they asked the District Court to rule upon three times. 
    And the District Court refused to do so. 
    So there are no facts before this Court. 
    And 349 is a wholly and an entirely supposititious case. 
    And in that respect, I guess I don't have to call to your attention, the attention of the Court, the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Blackmun concurred in by the Chief Justice only last week in the (Inaudible) case, which you addressed the question of the proposition that this Court ought -- to be handling supposititious cases. 
    You get enough business handling concrete issues, and while the other seven members of the Court didn't agree that that principle applied to that case. 
    There's no question that this Court ordinarily tries and adjudicates only concrete cases.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well that I get -- that's a case in controversy argument, but did I understand Mr. Stavis, you're suggesting that even though you did not cross-petition on the question of the appealability of the order to the Third Circuit that it's jurisdictional and therefore that we can reach and decide it?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="374.706" stopTime="377.837">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I accepted the suggestion of Mr. Justice Rehnquist in that respect.

    All right.

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    May I get back to the issues in 546 which is the jurisdiction of this Court to try -- of the District Court of an Article III Court to try this indictment. 
    That the Speech or Debate Clause establishes jurisdictional allocation comes all through the decisions of this Court including its latest, and there of course is the Chief Justice's opinion in Eastland against Servicemen's Union.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    For the Court?

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I'm sorry.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="424.020" stopTime="424.946">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Opinion for the Court?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="424.946" stopTime="503.347">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Of course, the opinion for the Court. 
    And what you addressed there was the fact that the Speech or Debate Clause affects the availability of judicial power. 
    Now, the corollary to approaching this matter from the point of view of jurisdiction or the availability of judicial power is that no one says that members of Congress are super citizens and Speech or Debate Clause isn't free license to take bribes and commit crimes and introduce bills that are paid for. 
    That the only question is, which is the proper courthouse? 
    Is it an Article III Court or is it the Congress of the United States under both the Speech or Debate Clause and the Punishment Clause and so that there is no question about it. 
    My client never has, does not now nor will he contest the jurisdiction of the Congress of the United States to try the charges which we're involved with here. 
    Because not exactly looking to be charged by any --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="503.347" stopTime="505.868">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Can they try these charges now?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="505.868" stopTime="507.128">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I believe so.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="507.128" stopTime="510.819">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And what sanction could Congress impose?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="510.819" stopTime="524.030">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    By way of Kilbourn against Thompson that Congress has complete power to impose any sanctions it chooses including -- if I read Kilbourn against Thompson correctly, imprisonment. 
    That's what you said in Kilbourn.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="524.030" stopTime="528.925">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose under the constitution that wouldn't be authorized to impose a cruel or unusual punishment, would it not?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="528.925" stopTime="552.865">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Oh, I think there are constitutional limitations upon the exercise of its power. 
    That's Powell against McCormack. 
    We expect that if we act right on this by Congress, we expect to insist upon the due process hearing. 
    And the whole panoply of rights, that would be applied to any judicial hearing and that would be a judicial hearing. 
    It's just an exception to Article III jurisdiction, but --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="552.865" stopTime="554.884">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You going to insist on a jury trial?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="554.884" stopTime="556.848">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    No. 
    No we don't expect to, a jury trial.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Although the constitution guarantees that, isn't it?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="559.830" stopTime="563.466">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Guarantees it, an Article III trial. 
    I do not believe that it would be --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I didn't say anything about an Article III trial, does it?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="565.675" stopTime="580.313">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Well, I would guess however that we would accept the fact that would not be a jury trial. 
    If we would -- if we were entitled a jury trial, we would waive it. 
    I think the essence of the Punishment Clause is that the Congress itself has that power.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="580.313" stopTime="582.999">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Subject to what constitutional limitations?

    Oh, I see --
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="669.754" stopTime="695.447">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    -- will address that particular question.Historically, it has occurred. 
    I think in fact it occurred in the most famous corruption investigation by the Congress in the Crédit Mobilier transaction where Congressman Oakes Ames was charged, tried and convicted but it has -- after he was no longer sitting. 
    And I think there are a number of other examples of that sort.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="695.447" stopTime="708.700">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Stavis, would the net result of accepting your theory mean that Congress could not enact and the President sign a law making it a criminal offense for a Congressman to take a bribe?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="708.700" stopTime="774.352">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Congress has enacted such a law, and such a law is on -- to that books and has been enforced and is valid, but not in respect to the performance of legislative acts. 
    In other words, the Johnson case which wasn't in fact tried under that section is a perfect example. 
    A Congressman takes a bribe to try to influence the Department of Justice, the normal conflict of interest situation or to take in bribe for an act which is not a legislative act in nature. 
    What the Speech or Debate Clause is driving at is that if you want to try a legislative act for the connection with legislative act if you want to try the legislative process that belongs in the Congress. 
    If you want to try just the question of bribery, not implicating the legislative process that you may do in an Article III Court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="774.352" stopTime="796.432">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But when -- Mr. Stavis, when the charge is for taking money in exchange for a promise of a future act, hasn't the Court held that it's not necessary to show the legislative act or the legislative activity?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="796.432" stopTime="824.697">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    And of course that's your opinion in the Brewster case. 
    That's exactly what the Court held. 
    And the whole point of the Government's taking this case is that they want to get around that decision, because in that decision, you said at least eight times, we counted them, that under the Brewster indictment you could not show the actual performance of a legislative act.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="824.697" stopTime="829.217">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, how will we know whether the Government is going to try to prove that until the case is tried?

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Well, that's what we thought accepting that the Government and that's why we don't think you would even consider this case but the Government says, “Please look at our profers of proof, this is really what we want to prove.” 
    We say, “Those people aren't going to testify that way let alone the fact that if they did testify it wouldn't be true.”

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Well, I don't think it's not -- I think its not any fair but correct. 
    But let me get back Mr. Chief Justice to your question, because you said that in Brewster and you looked at an indictment that did not charge the performance of legislative acts. 
    Look at this indictment, on its face it charges the specific performance of designated and named legislative acts. 
    Now if this case goes to trial, and if you prove -- if the Government is permitted to prove the facts as alleged in this indictment, I'm talking about what would've happened if they came up with a Brewster indictment, but if they proved the facts alleged in this indictment that jury is going to be asked to decide questions as to the functioning of the legislative process specifically.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="941.814" stopTime="946.255">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What if the trial court excludes any evidence about the legislative acts?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="946.255" stopTime="1022.071">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Well that's what Mr.-- that's what Judge Meanor said he was going to do and that's why the Government took this case up. 
    They weren't unsatisfied with Judge Meanor's decision which said, “I read the Brewster opinion and I intend to enforce it and not permit the introduction of legislative acts.” 
    The Government took it up that's why this case have been going on now for over two and a half years without a trial. 
    Now, but I want to emphasize that our position is that in the light of this indictment, the issues just does not end with the fact that the Government would not be permitted to introduce that evidence at trial. 
    And that's what my petition is about. 
    I say that the grand jury released and found an indictment which on its face is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. 
    And what the Government is saying is, “Well, let's fix up the indictment a little bit.” 
    Well, maybe they shouldn't have charged and alleged these legislative acts which they designate in that indictment. 
    “Well, we'll just strike it out. 
    Fix it up and make it like the Brewster type indictment and forget that it ever happened.”
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1022.071" stopTime="1032.392">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Stavis, do you agree that if they strike the allegations of the specific overt acts describing legislative acts that the indictment would then be comparable to the indictment in the Brewster case?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="1032.392" stopTime="1086.241">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Before, the morals in this specific legislative act, it's also the allegations in counts 2 (a) and 4 of the indictment which also include allegations of specific legislative acts. 
    Yes, the answer is if all those words were taken out then you'd have an indictment that read like the Brewster indictment. 
    But the trouble about doing that is that by the issuance of the indictment the executive branch of the government, the Executive Branch of the Government has implicated -- Judge (Inaudible) and the grand jury has implicated and impugned the functioning of Congress. 
    Now the point that we make is that when the Speech or Debate Clause is set up to protect this delicate tripartite separation of powers, it means that the --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But Mr. Stavis, would you say then that if before the defendant is put in jeopardy, the def -- the Government can come in and voluntarily dismiss the indictment, that permission to dismiss the indictment then reindict it leaving out all the references to legislative acts?

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1130.167" stopTime="1142.537">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well your position then just so I get is that having told a particular grand jury about a legislative act by a Congressman, that grand jury may never return an indictment against that Congressman?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="1142.537" stopTime="1146.662">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Indictment which charges legislative acts.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1146.662" stopTime="1146.910">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, --
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="1146.910" stopTime="1146.982">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I mean -- of course they (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1146.982" stopTime="1152.131">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I thought you said that in a moment ago if they dismissed the indictment and brought a new one would -- didn't make reference, its still be bad?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="1152.131" stopTime="1161.499">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Oh no! 
    No, what I mean is that they can't -- I mean obviously they can indict him for bank robbery, something having -- they may be able to indict him for bank robbery having --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1161.499" stopTime="1170.229">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, they just excised from the new indictment any reference to the legislative acts and they merely follow the pattern of the Brewster indictment.
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="1170.229" stopTime="1188.134">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    That would be invalid because the grand jury, the grand jury has violated the Speech or Debate Clause but this is not to say that the Government cannot convene another grand jury, present the case which does not involve proof of legislative acts and come out with the Brewster type indictment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1188.134" stopTime="1216.978">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well but that's like Calandra. 
    Once the information has been presented to the grand jury there's nothing more that can be done to salvage the Speech or Debate Clause. 
    The question is whether the indictment it returns is constitutional or not. 
    The idea that if you present a different information to another grand jury, somehow you could call it back to -- call the earlier proceedings back just isn't possible.
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="1216.978" stopTime="1236.220">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    It is not like Calandra. 
    Calandra is a very different kind of a case. 
    In Calandra you decided that under the Fourth Amendment -- the exclusionary clause which is your making that you would allow a grand jury to hear evidence unlawfully seized by somebody else.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1236.220" stopTime="1245.496">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And we also said in Calandra that the right of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment had already been breached and there was nothing that --
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="1245.496" stopTime="1265.095">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I understand that. 
    But here you have an explicit provision of the speech -- in the constitution which says that speech or debate, which I wish would mean legislative acts, shall not be questioned in any other place. 
    In Gravel you said that includes a grand jury.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1265.095" stopTime="1269.413">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did it say he may not be questioned or he may not be required to answer?

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Says he may not be questioned.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1271.402" stopTime="1271.942">

    And, he may not --

    No. 
    Now, did he have to respond to anything in the grand jury?
speaker="morton_stavis" startTime="1279.744" stopTime="1283.977">
    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I think he did at the point when he wasn't the target.

    Unknown Speaker

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    It might be but if I read the Gravel case accurately and I think I do, there is no speech or debate protection from questioning when the grand jury is investigating third party crime.

    And I just want to say in reference to Mr. Justice Brennan's question, that of course is exactly what you do in an immunity case. 
    You forbid the use of immunized testimony. 
    You impose upon the prosecutor an obligation to establish that he didn't use immunized testimony when he got the indictment. 
    If he can't make it he can go to another grand jury. 
    He can go to another grand jury and get an indictment without the use of the immunized testimony, does that all the time.

   Argument of Stanley M.Brand
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1641.958" stopTime="1650.006">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Brand.
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="1650.006" stopTime="1784.660">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I'm here representing the Honorable Thomas P.O'Neil, Speaker, the Honorable Frank Thompson, Chairman and the Honorable William Dickenson, ranking minority member Committee on House Administration of the U.S. House of Representatives as amici curiae.T 
    he interest of the speaker and his colleagues in this case is apparent. 
    It presents serious questions in our minds as to the continued viability of the Speech or Debate Clause. 
    At the outset, I would like to make one point clear. 
    The Congress has read Johnson and Brewster and that Congress accepts Johnson and Brewster. 
    When we saw the Solicitor's petition however, and what we viewed as an attempt to relitigate Brewster, we were concerned, and that's why we are here. 
    To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson's characterization of the clause which he wrote shortly after the adoption of the constitution, “The clause is intended to protect the substance rather than the shadow of representative government, and for that reason it states for any speech or debate they shall not be questioned in any other place.” 
    We believe that this clause operates as an institutional protection as well as a personalized privilege. 
    And to affect this high principle of an unfettered legislative branch, the framers concluded that a jurisdictional allocation was necessary. 
    And we read this jurisdictional allocation from the Speech or Debate Clause read together with the Punishment Clause. 
    Like other jurisdictional requirements, the trial of legislative acts must occur in a proper forum. 
    It is not subject to waiver, Congressman Helstoski cannot waive himself into an Article III Court for the trial of legislative acts.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Hasn't Congress or didn't Congress take quite a long step in relation to the Speech or Debate Clause when they enacted these provisions?
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="1937.718" stopTime="2043.607">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    I don't think so Your Honor, 201 like a plethora of other statutes regulating non-legislative behavior has been passed by Congress in that context. 
    We have statutes for instance, 18 U.S.C. 431 says that a member may not enter into a contract in which the United States is a party. 
    That's not a legislative act, we regulate that by statute. 
    We regulate campaign financing, because we say that when a member takes a political contribution or campaigns for office, he is not engaging in the legislative process and we regulate that through the United States Code. 
    I don't believe you can read 201 in the context of the U.S. Code in the other ways in which we regulate members Congress -- conduct as the one example where we have attempted to put into Article III Courts the trial of legislative acts. 
    I don't believe that's consistent with the design of the Code at this time. 
    At this point we come to the question of the indictment. 
    We would say that there having been neither a waiver nor a delegation under 201. 
    The indictment at issue here which charges legislative acts on the basis of what the grand jury heard is fatally defective. 
    And we say this for several reasons. 
    This is not Calandra and the Fourth Amendment. 
    This is not Costello and the Fifth Amendment. 
    This is the Speech or Debate Clause which is part of the constitution, which the framers placed in the constitution to protect questioning at the earliest possible juncture, not after indictment when the death blow has been dealt as in this case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2043.607" stopTime="2047.008">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, to prevent question anywhere in any other place?
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2047.008" stopTime="2047.697">

    Correct.

    -- grand jury which indicted him --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2065.054" stopTime="2072.272">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why wouldn't it be fully served and if he chooses not to assert it, then there is some form of waiver.
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2072.272" stopTime="2121.230">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Well, if it's never asserted it never becomes an issue, but in this case the grand jury which ultimately indicted him was one which there could be no waiver because he never appeared before that grand jury. 
    What we're saying on the indictment issue is that the indictment is defective because the design of the Speech or Debate Clause is to present -- prevent questioning. 
    If the questioning has already occurred and you are willing to say that we will only at trial put on some evidentiary prescriptions then you have not remedied the potential abuse which exists.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2121.230" stopTime="2126.615">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But what was the questioning before the grand jury which violated the Speech and Debate Clause?

    The legislative acts. 
    It --

    I believe they were directed to the defendant.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2136.104" stopTime="2147.648">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but why couldn't he then assert the speech and debate privilege and fully vindicate it by asserting it at that point, and not having done so, he has waived it.
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2147.648" stopTime="2161.141">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Well, under Mr. Stavis' formulation and I think we would agree with most of that. 
    A member must answer as to third party crime before a grand jury.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2161.141" stopTime="2211.642">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But as soon as it reached him, is it not implied in both Johnson and the Brewster case that he not only need not answer, he may assert the proposition that he cannot be questioned. 
    To give an example, if he were sued in a complaint in a civil case for a libel and the complaint alleged that the libel was committed on the floor of the House, could not the member of Congress simply informally tell the Court by letter or any other way, that he was not going to answer because the Speech or Debate Clause protected him. 
    And he was not going to appear and that any judgment entered on the basis of that complaint would be a nullity under the Speech or Debate Clause?
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2211.642" stopTime="2212.460">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Well as I --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2212.460" stopTime="2223.949">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So that he -- it is more than a quite matter of not being questioned or not answering, he can't even be questioned, isn't that so?
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2223.949" stopTime="2224.961">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    That's correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2224.961" stopTime="2228.742">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, but he then submitted to the questioning here.

    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Well, wouldn't he be -- would the same situation occur where he never appeared and the U.S. attorney went to the Library of Congress and took the legislative material out off there, is that a questioning? 
    He would never have appeared to assert the privilege yet we would assert that that's prohibited.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2247.200" stopTime="2254.552">

    I thought you would assert that even if he appeared and answered freely, nevertheless.
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2254.552" stopTime="2262.895">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    That's correct, he as a claimant in a Article III Court could come in and claim that he should get a remedy from the Court.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2262.895" stopTime="2298.384">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well Mr. Brand, he certainly don't need to -- I know you say that he -- the evidence should never have even been presented to the grand jury, but even if there was -- even if it was properly presented or even if it could be said that he waived in some matter the presentation of the evidence, you still say that he never consented to be indicted. 
    Never consented to be threatened with indictment and that would of course solve a lot of your problems if you win on that.
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2298.384" stopTime="2308.627">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And I gather -- I thought your position was so far does that principle go that nothing that he does before the grand jury can support an indictment.
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2319.973" stopTime="2320.266">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Correct.

    But can he support a waiver?

    -- he didn't testify before this grand jury, did he?

    The one that he was indicted by?
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2327.906" stopTime="2328.692">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2328.692" stopTime="2328.698">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    No, he did not.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2328.698" stopTime="2330.267">

    He didn't testify before that grand jury.
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2330.267" stopTime="2331.008">

    He did not.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2331.008" stopTime="2338.057">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So your position has to be that evidence of legislative acts is inadmissible before the grand jury even though the man itself is --
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2338.057" stopTime="2339.251">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2339.251" stopTime="2348.812">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But the clause doesn't read that way. 
    It says that the Congressman shall not be questioned in any other place, it doesn't say the evidence of legislative act shall not be admissible before a grand jury.
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2348.812" stopTime="2349.049">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Of course the --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That if he -- mentioned even acknowledged with third party crime evidence of legislative act shall be --
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2354.544" stopTime="2367.788">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Well of course the Court -- the clause doesn't say either that, it is merely that evidence shall not be presented. 
    We would read “shall not be questioned” to include the questioning of his legislative acts whether or not he is the authoror or not.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2367.788" stopTime="2370.440">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, he wasn't questioned in the grand jury, was he?

    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    That at time and the grand jury he was not.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2371.419" stopTime="2392.826">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But at the time and grand jury is conducting its investigation, it presumably doesn't have its mind made up what its going to do at the end of the inquiry. 
    Does it have to stop every time somebody propose and introduced in the -- before it a legislative act and decide whether or not it can be received based on what its ultimately going to decide with respect to whom it may indict?
speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2392.826" stopTime="2411.171">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    But in this case there was the -- a mechanism for calling out the legislative acts by presenting -- the U.S. attorney by presenting them to the -- by not presenting them to the indicting grand jury.

    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    Well, our authority would be the residual -- the inherent power of the body is punished, contempts committed by its members at the time they were members for conduct which occurred when they were members.

speaker="stanley_mbrand" startTime="2639.721" stopTime="2673.908">
    Mr. Stanley M.Brand 
    No sir. 
    And I would leave with this thought that the Solicitor has indicated in his brief that the Congress can't do both, they can't discipline appropriately and also legislate. 
    I believe the record is clear that we can discipline with justice through law that we can do it with due process that we can do it with the full panoply of protections and shields that apply in a criminal case, witness the material we've submitted for the record on that. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Wade H. McCree, Jr.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    In June 1976, respondent was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on several charges arising out of grand jury investigations into alleged corruption in connection with private immigration legislation. 
    Count one charged him as a member of Congress with conspiracy to violate the official bribery statute, that's 18 U.S.C. Section 201 (c) (1), by acting with Albert Defalco, his former administrative aid and others, to solicit and to receive bribes in return for being influenced to introduce private bills in the House of Representatives. 
    13 overt acts in furtherance to the conspiracy were alleged. 
    These overt acts consisted of charges that respondent and his administrative aid met with attorneys who specialize in immigration litigation and from whom they received cash payments in return for being influenced to introduce private bills for named aliens. 
    The other three overt acts with which we're concerned here, 2, 3 and 4 also allege the actual introduction of such bills.

    In your view Mr. Solicitor General, for the Government to sustain a case needn't prove anymore than that the money was taken and the promise to do a future act was made?

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    That's precisely the Government's position, if the Court please. 
    The offense was to solicit bribes to perform an official act and the offense is complete once the bribe is solicited and it is unnecessary to show that an official act was in fact done in response to it.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2814.436" stopTime="2825.079">

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    I do not -- we do not disagree with Judge Meanor if a waiver took place. 
    We agree that Judge Meanor is correct that we could not show the introduction of the bills which is the showing of legislative acts unless a valid waiver occurred. 
    But we contend --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Heard when and how?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="2875.042" stopTime="2938.572">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    We submit that a valid waiver occurred when Mr. Helstoski voluntarily presented voluminous correspondents including copies of the very bills that he introduced after he was told that he needn't -- that he was not required to do that. 
    And he did it voluntarily and as Judge Meanor found, he knew of his speech or debate privilege when he did it. 
    Although it was not called directly to his attention, he had raised this privilege in other litigation involving the alleged abuse of the franking privilege. 
    And in fact in his penultimate appearance before the grand jury, he also invoked the Speech or Debate privilege, and so Judge Meanor's finding that he knew it is amply supported and the U.S. attorney told him that he did not have to submit these matters.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the -- but -- just so I had it clear, but absent the waiver you agree that under Brewster in irrelevant cases and under the clause, you could not introduce the evidence that you proposed to introduce?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="2950.311" stopTime="3007.467">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    We do. 
    We concede this. 
    As a matter of fact the -- I'd like to move perhaps right on to the nature of the evidence that is involved here. 
    We think that this evidence falls into three categories. 
    First, the bills themselves which as I've just responded are clearly legislative acts, evidence of legislative acts and absent a waiver, we agree that we could not introduce those. 
    There's a second category of evidence and this consists of correspondence between Helstoski, Defalco, some of the attorneys who represented some of the aliens and some of the aliens themselves. 
    Now we submit that these evidence has to be examined by the District Court on an item by item basis to see whether it --

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    We submit that it's admissible that the Court should find that it's admissible for that purpose because soliciting a bribe is clearly and concededly not in a legislative act. 
    And whatever inducement he may employ for the purpose of soliciting the bribe can not therefore a legislative act and that that is not forbidden by the Speech or Debate Clause.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    If the Court please, that is the way I read that and we would suggest that the past-future dichotomy is not a valid one. 
    We submit that the Court is -- the District Court was too restrictive because under the old Hillman case for example, a statement of a present intention to do something in the future can be the basis for a finding that it was in fact done. 
    And so we think logically, the Court should've -- should not even have made the past-future dichotomy and should've said that in both instances, evidence would be admissible.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3189.393" stopTime="3203.010">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But as I understood your comment a moment ago you said a letter assumed by the Congressman he wrote to someone said, “If you give me X dollars, I will introduce such and such a bill.”

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    General McCree, I suggest you that my earlier colloquy with Mr. Stavis is not entirely irrelevant to some of the questions that my Brother have been asking you. 
    This is a very hypothetical situation we're presented with and I take it you agree that the jurisdiction of this Court exist by virtue of 28 U.S.C. 1254 that the case was in the Court of Appeals and we therefore have jurisdiction to review it.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3271.687" stopTime="3278.433">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    We do and we concede however that unless the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction that this Court does not have jurisdiction.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3278.433" stopTime="3283.764">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And the only way the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction was pursuant to 18 U.S.C.3731?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3283.764" stopTime="3317.698">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Exactly and we contend that this is an order suppressing evidence under 3731, and as such it's appealable if the appeal were taken before the defendant was placed in jeopardy. 
    And we submit that the provision itself admonishes us to give it a liberal construction to effectuate its purposes that is to allow the Government to have a ruling before a defendant is placed in jeopardy.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3317.698" stopTime="3344.977">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think the Government could come in and on its own without the defendant making any motion to say, “This is the evidence we're going to present at trial, we'd like the trial court to rule on whether it will be admissible or not.” 
    And the trial court divides it into categories and said, “This will be admissible, this isn't.” 
    And the Government can then appeal, say that Court's determination that certain evidence is hearsay and were therefore be inadmissible?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3344.977" stopTime="3522.565">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    That's a difficult question, if the Court please. 
    An order in (Inaudible) which is really what it is, indicating what evidence might or might not be introduce is admissible under some systems or procedure. 
    Now whether the federal rules or criminal procedure permit it, I can't direct the Court's attention to a specific provision. 
    But in this case the Court did and the Court had the matter properly before it on the -- on Mr. Helstoski's motion to dismiss. 
    Then Mr. Helstoski raised several questions about the evidence and the Court in its ruling, in fact in its first ruling, its our ruling, it said that we would have to redact the indictment. 
    But in a subsequent written opinion it indicated that we didn't have to redact the indictment but that as the Court has already pointed out, we could show evidence of promises to perform future legislative acts, but not past ones. 
    And so we submit that the Court did in fact suppress evidence, and we suggest that although this Court hasn't decided the question, there are a number of decisions in the Courts of Appeals which have done exactly this. 
    One case that I recall is Batiste versus the United States, in which the Sixth Circuit decided that. 
    And another one in which the -- this Court denied certiorari, that's United States versus Craig from the Seventh Circuit. 
    We suggest that the Speech or Debate Clause creates immunity for a Congressman from civil or criminal liability for his legislative acts and we concede that it shouldn't be construed as narrowly as just a speech or a debate in the Congress, but that it's the kind of act that's generally done in furtherance of a legislative process which certainly doesn't include soliciting a bribe. 
    And so we say that there is an immunity for prosecution for a legislative act. 
    We further submit that the Court has developed an evidentiary privilege, an implementation of this immunity. 
    And as the Court has done with the other privileges, evidentiary privileges that it has created, that we suggest that the shield should not be any roader than is necessary to protect the interest for which it was established.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3522.565" stopTime="3524.759">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    I beg your pardon?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3525.349" stopTime="3526.990">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    All was waivable?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3526.990" stopTime="3686.316">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    And we suggest too that it is waivable. 
    And in this respect of course there isn't any question but that Mr. Helstoski made a gesture before the grand jury of a clean breast of everything. 
    “I want the grand jury to know that I have nothing to hide” and he brought in all of these materials although he was told that he was not required to do this. 
    And to permit him to do this and then to assert a privilege would be to make a mockery our off the privilege because he would just have it one way and not both ways. 
    And the Court does not permit that in other matters and we see no reason why it should in this matter. 
    We'd also like to suggest that there's another reason why the district -- why this indictment is good and why the District Court's restriction on evidence should be reversed. 
    We advanced the theory in Brewster that was suggested in Johnson that if there were a narrowly statute, narrowly drawn to achieve the end of regulating the conduct of its business, that the Congress could then involve the executive branch and the judicial branch in it's -- in the discipline of its members. 
    And we suggest that in Section 201 the Congress has done exactly that in its definition of who is an official. 
    For the purpose of Section 201, it specifically provides that a member of the Congress is, and then it specifically sets forth the offenses which the defined officials cannot -- I'm -- may, of which they may be found guilty. 
    So clearly, this is a statute narrowly drawn to achieve the end of regulating the conduct of its members. 
    And we suggest that there's a good reason for it too. 
    And my brother who was arguing here a few moments ago suggested or stated in response to a question from the Court that a jury wouldn't be available if a member of the Congress was called on for trial. 
    The Congress has decided that for this purpose with the third branch involvement there will be a jury, there can be confrontation, right of counsel.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Well this is really in response to the argument that the Congress has exclusive jurisdiction of the disciplining of its members. 
    And we don't think that we have to labor that because we think if the Court is to agree with his argument there, it would have to reverse Brewster.

    -- we don't understand --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3791.272" stopTime="3803.255">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I thought your position was that with a narrowly drawn statute, Congress could authorize the prosecution of Congressman for the performance of legislative acts.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3803.255" stopTime="3810.057">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    No. 
    If the Court please, I did not mean to give that impression, if I did I stand corrected.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3810.057" stopTime="3813.969">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, then what relevance is your argument in this case then --
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3813.969" stopTime="3814.356">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Well, this is just --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- at this point.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3815.341" stopTime="3840.311">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    -- this is just a second argument why the Congress with a narrowly drawn statute could involve the executive branch and the judicial branch in the disciplining of its members. 
    In addition to the argument that prevailed in Brewster, identifying the act is a non-legislative act, the taking of the bribes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3840.311" stopTime="3856.645">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you're just saying that Congress with a narrowly drawn statute could authorize the executive to end -- to punish a Congressman for conduct falling outside the Speech or Debate Clause?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3856.645" stopTime="3857.551">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Exactly.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3857.551" stopTime="3859.662">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's as far as you --
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3859.662" stopTime="3861.400">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    That is as far as that argument goes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3861.400" stopTime="3869.156">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And this argument -- and it also -- so that this argument doesn't affect whether or not this evidence is admissible?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3869.156" stopTime="3878.172">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Only in this sense that since this is a non-legislative act, evidence --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3878.172" stopTime="3878.597">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, --
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3878.597" stopTime="3882.273">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    -- soliciting a bribe, evidence can be introduced in support of it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3882.273" stopTime="3899.942">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, as long as if you're right on that, if you're right on that maybe. 
    But if the Court thought that this involved evidence or conduct protected by Speech or Debate Clause, your argument then would fall by the wayside?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3899.942" stopTime="3912.024">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    We would have to go to our waiver argument. 
    It would fall by the wayside and only a waiver would permit a prosecution for that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3912.024" stopTime="3922.772">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And so you at least say then that the privilege or the immunity belongs to the member individually?

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    On in -- it was referred -- with respect to the waiver we do. 
    And we suggest that we it would be --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3927.993" stopTime="3932.852">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes but it also is -- it's something that Congress can't waive for him?

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    We suggest -- that the entire Congress?

    Yes.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3936.494" stopTime="3936.871">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Well, superficial --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3936.871" stopTime="3945.602">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I just asked you if Congress could by a narrowly drawn statute authorize the prosecution for a legislative act, and you said no.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3945.602" stopTime="3948.589">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Yes, that's correct and I will not retreat from that position.

    And I'm suggesting that --

    -- privilege does belong to the individual.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3952.759" stopTime="3954.048">

    It belongs to the individual.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="3954.465" stopTime="3975.503">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    It does indeed. 
    And I suggest that to allow an individual to have it both ways is contrary to our whole system of jurisprudence that if he doesn't claim, if he does expressly waive, clearly we think he can be prosecuted.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3975.503" stopTime="3982.034">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But he -- but in this case, I don't see -- is there some evidence that he consented to be prosecuted for a legislative act?

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    No he did not expressly waive, but we have this --

    Not, no did he ever consent to be prosecuted for a legislative act?

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    He did not consent to be prosecuted for a legislative act.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do we need to decide in this case whether Congress could by a very statute more narrowly drawn perhaps than Section 201 submit to the trial for a legislative acts, do we need to decide that here?

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.

    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    Well, we believe however that Judge -- that the Court of Appeals was too restrictive and that Judge Meanor was too restricted -- restrictive and this Court should reverse that decision of the Third Circuit to --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4050.968" stopTime="4057.060">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, there's another alternative, isn't there and that is to let them go their way and see what happens?
speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="4057.060" stopTime="4078.968">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    That is another course that's available to the Court too. 
    But we think that the district judge could benefit from the guidance of this Court in indicating what was referred to in Brewster as Acts relating to legislative acts and not legislative acts themselves.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4078.968" stopTime="4090.288">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="4092.404" stopTime="4145.734">
    Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr. 
    We believe the Government has such a case and we have filed with the Court a sealed appendix that I think contains sufficient evidence to go to the jury, but we would like to take the strongest case we can. 
    My Brother didn't speak about his mandamus action and at least that aspect of it there was a basis for the Court of Appeals denial of his petition and we think that the Court of Appeals was clearly right there. 
    And unless the Court has any questions about that, I would not discuss that in argument here. 
    If the Court please, then that concludes the argument of the Government in this manner.

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I understand that. 
    I understand that you don't have to decide this question, but I thought I heard the Solicitor General conceding that. 
    If I'm wrong, I'd respectfully request to be excused for this error, but if I am right then what the Solicitor General is saying is that while the whole body of Congress can't waive into an Article III Court one member can. 
    And it just seems to me that that falls of its own way.

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    But not when the rights relate to the jurisdiction of a Court. 
    I can't waive myself into this Court, that's one of the points that Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested. 
    We can't, by the fact that I may not even cross-petition. 
    I can't waive the objection to the jurisdiction of the Third Circuit. 
    And if this is jurisdictional then the waiver argument doesn't apply either with respect to Congress as a whole or with respect to an individual member of the Congress.

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    I respectfully suggest to you that you look at Jefferson's manual which is recorded in our brief in which he says, “Yes, he may not waive that privilege of the House of speech or debate. 
    But even if the House should overlook that and he has waived it then he has testified -- he has testified. 
    The next question is, what's the consequence of that testimony? 
    Does that waive him into an Article III Court when the constitution says the Article III Court has no jurisdiction?

    Mr. Morton Stavis 
    Thank you very much Your Honor. 
    I want to focus on my case in just a moment and that is the indictment. 
    And particularly on what may be attractive to some of the members of the Court which is, “Well let's just fix up this indictment.” 
    And I simply want to say that the consequence of that is that you remove the effective operation of the Speech and Debate Clause at the point where it's most important namely where it is accusatory. 
    Now in Kilbourn against Thompson that used the meaning of the term questioning was not Mr. Justice Stevens' in terms of do you ask a question. 
    It is rather, may you make a charge.And I respectfully refer you to Mr. Justice Miller's opinion in which he equates the Speech or Debate Clause the term questioning to the language of the Massachusetts constitution which refers to accusation. 
    If you take that concept and then move over to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question and say, “Is there any case where you set aside an indictment because there's something that happened in the grand jury?” 
    And I say that that's exactly what you do in the immunity type case where a grand jury heard testimony that was barred from him, they shouldn't have heard him. 
    And you say to that prosecutor, “Well if you did it, we cancel that indictment. 
    If you want to go ahead and not use that prohibited testimony, you're free to do so.” 
    And that's all we've ever said here, and if the prosecutor should decide not to do that, in any event we said that the Congress has jurisdiction. 
    And I'm very grateful to you, Your Honor, for indulging me to that extent.
