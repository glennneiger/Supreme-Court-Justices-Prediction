California v. Arizona

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The second opinion I have to announce this morning is an original case, No. 78 Original, the State of California against the State of Arizona and the United States of America. 
    This is a motion for leave to file a bill of complaint. 
    Generally, those motions are granted almost pro forma but this one involves rather complex jurisdictional situation which is set out fully in the opinion of the Court. 
    And for the reasons set out in the Courtâ€™s unanimous opinion, the motion is granted and the defendants are allowed 45 days in which to answer or otherwise respond.
