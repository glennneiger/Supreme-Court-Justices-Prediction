Barry v. Barchi

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in 803, Barry against Barchi. 
    Mr. Hammer, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="62.099" stopTime="292.328">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The question presented by this case is whether a statute which provides for the summary suspension of the occupational license of a harness racing participant prior to any hearing on disciplinary charges denies such licensee due process or equal protection of the laws. 
    A statutory District Court for the Southern District of New York held that it indeed it did. 
    We respectfully disagree. 
    We have appealed and we asked this Court to reverse. 
    On June 22nd of 1976, a horse named Be Alert which was trained by the plaintiff run second in a race at Monticello Raceway. 
    Prior to the race, a blood test was conducted to determine whether any drugs were in the horse's system. 
    That test was passed, however, subsequent to the race, a urine test was conducted and traces of a drug called Lasix were found in the horse's urine. 
    At page 6a of the jurisdictional statement note 5 in the opinion of the three-judge court, the Court pointed out that Lasix is a diuretic and may in fact enhanced the performance of the animal. 
    Under the rules of the Racing and Wagering Board, no such drug may be given to the horse within 48 hours of a race. 
    As I indicated, this race was conducted on June the 22nd, two days later, the post race test results came back and Mr. Barchi, the plaintiff was called before the stewards. 
    He was given word of this test results and was asked for an explanation. 
    Subsequently, both at his initiative and at the initiative of the Racing and Wagering Board, two separate polygraph test were taken. 
    Apparently, the polygraph indicated that Mr. Barchi was being truthful in his statements and despite the efforts of the Board to find out exactly what happened to the horse an inconclusive investigation in sued. 
    On the 8th of July, the trainer's license was suspended on the basis of what is called the trainers responsibility rule as in the case of a ship's captain who is responsible for everything that goes on board, the trainer likewise is responsible for the health and condition of his horse. 
    Now, we had the opportunity as we indicated for an informal conference at the time he was originally confronted with the results of the test and we suggest that this would come within the Rule of Goss against Lopez. 
    Under the statute, Section 8022 of our unconsolidated laws, he could have had a full quasi judicial hearing within a few days, however, he did not avail himself of this opportunity to be heard and as a result, this case was brought. 
    Under Section 8022, a licensee is the prime mover of any hearing conducted as a result of disciplinary action taken against him. 
    Only he may demand the hearing and he must demand it within 10 days.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    General Hammer, could I just ask one question about when they find the drug -- evidence of drug in the horse and it's presumed that the drug affected the performance of the animal in the race as I understand your rules, does that mean that something is done with the race itself or the results change or is there anything to undo the harmful consequence to the public of the race itself?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="314.157" stopTime="322.389">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    Well, Your Honor, nothing can be done. 
    At that time, the pari-mutuel pay off is immediate and the results of the race are not affected.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="322.389" stopTime="327.810">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But is there any discipline against anyone other than the trainer if we held to that finding in that presumption.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="327.810" stopTime="345.861">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    The presumption is a rebuttable presumption which relates only to the trainer. 
    However, Mr. Justice Stevens, the -- if for example it were found that a third party a track tout or someone else's groom drug the horse then of course --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="345.861" stopTime="360.211">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I do mean supposing it's a mystery as to what really happened but just from the presumption itself which includes the presumption that performance of the animal was affected by it which of course would affect the owner's record and all the rest of it, nothing happens to anyone except to the trainer as a result of that presumption.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="360.211" stopTime="361.923">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    That's correct, Your Honor.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Sometimes you see the inquiry sign go up on the tote board, you know and then it stays on for about 20 minutes or half an hour and then it's replaced by an official sign and they put up the odds. 
    What's the -- do they have that at Monticello?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="376.836" stopTime="400.576">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    Yes, that would be a standard part of the tote board. 
    I'm advised by my colleague Mr. Dailey that where in fact it is determined that the race was affected by drugging and then it is within the power of the Racing and Wagering Board to take back the purse. 
    However, the pari-mutuel results aren't affected because of the immediate pay off of on the pari-mutuel bets.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="400.576" stopTime="421.175">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I think you may have been overbroad. 
    At least I should think you were in responding to Mr. Justice Stevens. 
    If it was demonstrated affirmatively that the owner and not the trainer had drugged the horse and that the owner had done this without the trainer's knowledge then surely, the trainer would not be punished, would he?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="421.175" stopTime="432.593">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    Yes, in fact I made that point to Mr. Justice Stevens that this relates where in fact it is found that a third person -- a third party or an outsider whether it would be from another owner --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="432.593" stopTime="438.471">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But this is a presumption to get the matter started and that can be rebutted by other evidence.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="438.471" stopTime="443.560">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    Absolutely, Your Honor. 
    This is a permissive presumption that it is a rule of evidence, nothing more.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="443.560" stopTime="457.038">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    General Hammer can I also clear up one thing. 
    Does the first automatically become forfeited with just on the basis of the presumption? 
    That you said he had power to forfeit the purse but is it the routine practice that for example in this case was the purse forfeit done?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="457.038" stopTime="459.025">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    No Your Honor, it was not.

    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please. 
    Just prior to the luncheon recess, Mr. Justice Stevens asked about what happens when a drug is found to be -- a horse is found to have been drugged and I took the opportunity to look up the rule of the Racing and Wagering Board and its Rule 4120.10 and it does provide for a mandatory forfeiture of the purse where a horse has in fact been drugged and the drugging could have affected the outcome of the race.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="519.839" stopTime="527.142">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But was the purse forfeited here?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="527.142" stopTime="527.837">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    I believe it was, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="527.837" stopTime="528.941">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    One can assume that it was.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="528.941" stopTime="529.900">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    I think we can so assume.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="529.900" stopTime="532.307">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In the law as you said it.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="532.307" stopTime="622.480">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    This was not in the case but I would assume that it was forfeited. 
    Now the statute in question is Section 8022 of the New York unconsolidated laws and it's reproduced at page 3 of the appellant's brief. 
    It provides that where the stewards imposed any sanction such as a fine or suspension, the licensee may demand a hearing within 10 days. 
    Thereafter, the Racing and Wagering Board must schedule a prompt hearing and must render a final decision within 30 days. 
    This administrative determination is reviewable in an action -- in a special proceeding under Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law rules which would be in the nature of certiorari. 
    The statute provides that pending the final determination, the suspension or revocation remains in effect, however, there is no specific prohibition upon the Racing and Wagering Board sua sponte in its own discretion granting a stay of its own punishment. 
    The statutory history of Section 8022 and the rest of the racing laws is a rather interesting one and we've set it out at pages 6 through --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="622.480" stopTime="625.603">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So I have it in mind, what was imposed here?

    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    A 15-day suspension Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="626.915" stopTime="628.696">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So that was the total punishment.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="628.696" stopTime="629.583">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    That's all, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="629.583" stopTime="631.199">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And it was not permanent.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="631.199" stopTime="631.994">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    Absolutely not.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="631.994" stopTime="637.884">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So by the time there could be any review, the suspension the entire punishment would have been over.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="637.884" stopTime="639.220">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    Not necessarily, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="639.220" stopTime="646.755">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well 15 days is 15 days but -- and you had 30 days. 
    There are 30 days for a review, I take it.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="646.755" stopTime="675.567">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    The statute grants the Board up to 30 days to render its decision. 
    What happens in practice in cases of this kind is that the process is accelerated to a much greater degree. 
    In this instance and there is a companion case Daniel which we refer to, he was offered a hearing within two days and turned it down. 
    The plaintiff here never even requested a hearing.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="675.567" stopTime="687.260">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me go back to your administrative proceedings. 
    If he had requested a hearing, he could have asked for and could have received a stay of the suspension until the decision was made. 
    Is that right? 
    Is that what you were talking?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="687.260" stopTime="692.582">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    It is our position Your Honor that although the statute itself is somewhat unclear --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="692.582" stopTime="696.775">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So it says -- it says that the suspensions will stay in effect, doesn't it?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="696.775" stopTime="724.956">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    That's what it says, however, in practice and there was an offer of proof on the record, Your Honor, which the District Court did not see fit to take us up on. 
    We were prepared to show and it is contained in part in the affidavit of John Dailey who at that time was chief counsel to the Racing and Wagering Board that in practice, the Board does in a proper case stay its own action.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="724.956" stopTime="732.741">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I suppose the Board could say -- to tell somebody that we're considering any suspension and just not impose it until there is a hearing.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="732.741" stopTime="751.148">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    Well, in harness racing, this doesn't work that way. 
    The sanction is imposed initially by the state steward. 
    At that point, the licensee has the right within 10 days to demand the hearing. 
    The statutory --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Hammer, it does seem to me that we do have a problem of New York law here that reading this language that some of my Brother have questioned you about pending such hearing and final determination there on the action the commission refusing to grant or evoking or suspending a license or on imposing a bunch of many full force and effect seems kind of incongruous with the Commission's initial determination. 
    Is it possible that pending since is directed to the courts of New York rather than to the commission?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="1000.793" stopTime="1013.345">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    It is a conceivably a possible interpretation of the statute. 
    There has -- simply has been relatively little case law on this point.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1013.345" stopTime="1032.445">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    General Hammer, could I ask you another question about this language. 
    You point out that the affidavit of John Dailey indicates there is a practice. 
    Now, the statute refers an action of the commission. 
    But Dailey's affidavit refers to a suspension of any penalty imposed by track judges pending administrative review. 
    What are track judge -- track judges?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="1032.445" stopTime="1041.333">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    The track -- the track judges are the state stewards who make the initial determination. 
    What the statute is referring to --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1041.333" stopTime="1042.491">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Are they the commission?
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="1042.491" stopTime="1048.791">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    No. 
    The statute refers to the determination of the Commission after a hearing.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1048.791" stopTime="1061.496">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, but what I'm suggesting is that there is no inconsistency between the statute and the affidavit because the affidavit talks about staying a penalty imposed by track judges whereas the statute refers to an order that the commission remaining in effect.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="1061.496" stopTime="1062.874">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    I think that's correct, Your Honor.

    Yeah.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="1208.034" stopTime="1336.525">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    The cases on point Pullman, Carey against Sugar layout a very simple and rather straightforward rule of law. 
    I don't think I could have added anything to it. 
    What I think is terribly important here really is the cornerstone of our argument is the fact that the astringent racing laws that prevail in New York were adopted after a legislative finding based upon its investigation and upon a governor's (Inaudible) investigation which demonstrated a need for the strictest kind of policing in supervision. 
    It is interesting to note that until 1940, there was no pari-mutuel betting on harness races. 
    It was a county fare pastime. 
    1940 pari-mutuel betting was legalized and within less than 15 years, the criminals had moved in, the labor rocketeers had moved in. 
    There were cases of kickbacks, there were number of homicides and in order to police the sport, in order to preserve public confidence in the sport, the legislature have to act and one of the ways in which they acted was to crackdown hard, to impose what to some may seem even a draconian form of regulation. 
    But we think it's justified as a matter of constitutional law. 
    We're not dealing with the common occupations or professions. 
    We're not dealing with the license of a plumber. 
    We're not dealing with the situation where -- we don't take pari-mutuel bets on the outcome of surgery or whether -- or the size of my colleagues next verdict but we do take bets on horses.

    Mr. Robert S. Hammer

    We would go so far although we don't rely upon it entirely. 
    We would go so far as to suggest that the plurality of this Court -- the plurality opinion of this Court in our Arnett against Kennedy provides a proper framework. 
    Racing -- pari-mutuel racing is an activity which would have been illegal but for legislative sanction. 
    The licensee didn't have to become a harness trainer. 
    He could have been a shoe salesman but he chose to be a harness trainer and he takes the limitations of his license when he applies for it.

    Thank you.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="1628.701" stopTime="1647.508">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    That while the trainer's responsibility rules are rules of law in practice and this was our intention before the three-judge court which appears in the transcript which is filed with Your Honors that the stewards nevertheless have discretion in enforcing it.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1647.508" stopTime="1662.749">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Does that mean to put it bluntly that if the track judges or the commissioners have decided to believe the lie detector results and thought this man was totally innocent, they could have not suspended him without violating any state law they could have had.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="1662.749" stopTime="1665.366">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1665.366" stopTime="1669.039">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But then does the record that tells us why they did suspend them.
speaker="robert_s_hammer" startTime="1669.039" stopTime="1836.014">
    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    The record does not so show. 
    It's something that would had a hearing been held and if the plaintiff had indeed requested a hearing, it could have been developed at that hearing. 
    I think what's important here is to remember that even though there is some possible element of a reparable injury and we don't deny it. 
    How much injury through loss of earnings we can of course not tell, not with any accuracy speculative but this Court in its decisions in the Bob Jones case and the Enochs case which we cite has laid down a rule that even where a reparable injury even total destruction of the enterprise may result. 
    You can establish a law here, in that case for mere administrative convenience, which would preclude pre-hearing stays or pre-hearing injunctions against a determination? 
    I just want to touch briefly upon the equal protection question. 
    It's our position that it should not even have been decided by the District Court since they'd already held the statute unconstitutional on other grounds. 
    This was a matter of constitutional overkill as it were. 
    It was unnecessary under the rule of Peters against Harvey. 
    As we've indicated in our brief, there is a rational basis for the statute in terms of its statutory history. 
    On the other hand, in practice, the -- both harness and thoroughbred trainers are treated alike. 
    In a section of the thoroughbred rules, the thoroughbred licensees are treated in the same way and that all penalties as the Section 4013.13 under the rules all penalties imposed by the stewards remain in effect pending judicial or administrative review. 
    If the Court please, I'll simply reserve the last few minutes for rebuttal. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Joseph A. Faraldo
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1836.014" stopTime="1844.793">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Alright, very well. 
    Mr. Faraldo.
speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="1844.793" stopTime="1965.761">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I represent John Barchi, the appellee in this case and seek the affirmance of the decision of the three-judge court constitutional court below which struck down New York Section 8022 of the unconsolidated laws as unconstitutional both as the deprivation of due process of law and equal protection of the law. 
    Mr. Barchi had a very substantial interest in continuing in his livelihood something which he had built up before a long period of time. 
    The race that we are talking about occurred on June the 22nd of 1976 and on June the 24th, Mr. Barchi was called to the track steward's office and the track steward as my brother has stated is an armor extension or agent of the Commission itself, the actions of that judge and the actions of the Commission for all in terms and purposes the same. 
    On the 24th he was called into the office and informed by the judge that he had have a positive Lasix, in other words, Lasix, a foreign substance was found in the horse's urine. 
    He denied any knowledge or participation in the event. 
    The next contact that we had in this case was on or about the 27th day of June when we were requested to take a polygraph exam. 
    We did take a polygraph exam. 
    I believe it was on the 29th day of June. 
    My client voluntarily took a polygraph exam in order to profess his innocence which he had professed from the very beginning. 
    He passed the polygraph exam that was given privately and on the following day at the request of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board, he took and passed the second polygraph exam.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1965.761" stopTime="1975.273">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say that he took a polygraph exam.

speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="1975.273" stopTime="1996.942">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    I believe that they are part of the appendix in this case -- he was asked to whether or not he had given Lasix to this horse. 
    Whether or not he had directed anyone to give Lasix to this horse, whether or not he knew if anyone indeed had given Lasix to this horse or if he knew any of the circumstances how this prohibited substance got into this particular horse.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1996.942" stopTime="2007.874">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If the Commission believed him as to all those answers, would that make Rule 4120.6 the trainer's responsibility rule inapplicable to him?
speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="2007.874" stopTime="2023.213">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    The way it has been interpreted by the New York State Racing and Wagering Board and some of the jurisdictions around the nation, the answer to that is no. 
    It has been my experience that this has been interpreted as an absolute rule of liability -- and some of the jurisdictions, not all.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2023.213" stopTime="2028.427">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Didn't the District Court which generally ruled in your favor say that that was a proper rule?
speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="2028.427" stopTime="2068.516">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    They said that it was a rebuttable presumption or at least some of them were rebuttable. 
    However, there is a presumption in one of the rules under which my client was suspended which says that he administered, it shall be presumed that the trainer administered the drug to the horse with the intent to affect the speed or outcome of a horse race. 
    In addition, it says that upon the mere finding of the presence of a drug in a horse's system, there is a presumption that it was given to the horse within 48 hours of his race. 
    Now, how anyone could rebut those presumptions behind me since we have never seen the sample. 
    We were never confronted by the sample that was taken from the horse.

    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    Well, we're not aware of the fact that they were going to suspend my client without any type of a hearing whatsoever at that point in time. 
    They led us to believe that they were continuing some sort of investigation and then in the latter part of the week we were hit with the notice of suspension. 
    We never sought or were confronted with how the sample was taken, what the analysis show.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2100.670" stopTime="2105.548">

    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    But at that point in time, I think the administrative remedy is meaningless if there is no stay and while there has been an illusion made to this Court that they do posses the discretion to grant a stay --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2119.362" stopTime="2135.529">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did you say that various -- very rapidly that how are we to know now but if you would ask for the administrative hearing that the statute provides for that you might not had your man cleared then there never would have been any lawsuit.
speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="2135.529" stopTime="2238.864">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    Well, Your Honor, since I stop grooming horses and became a lawyer, I've never seen one instance where a stay was granted by this Board. 
    After this case, this particular case was argued before the Honorable Mr. Justice Goettel in the District Court seeking the convocation of a three-judge court. 
    I had a client suspended for 15 days. 
    I requested a stay in that case that is then your case which my brother makes reference to, the stay was refused. 
    They did say to me on that occasion, we will give you a prompt hearing but if there is no stay and then you all had a 15-day suspension identical to Barchi and the question would be moved. 
    They're not providing my client with an opportunity -- for a meaningful opportunity to be heard in a meaningful time and that's all I ask for. 
    That was not given to Barchi, I agree we did not asked and then when we did asked two days after argument on Barchi, we were flatly refused again. 
    I have represented a number of harness horse trainers. 
    In the record before this Court in May of 1976, five trainers were suspended up at Monticello on the same facts. 
    Proof of the presence of a drug in the system is a suspension to the trainer. 
    Now, they hold out a writ of justice by saying to us, Come, file your notice of appeal within 10 days and we shall promptly schedule you a hearing.? 
    That has never happened. 
    None of the five trainers of Monticello Raceway suspended in May of 1976 and not a single solitary one of them avail themselves of the so-called meaningful opportunity to be heard because this is not a meaningful opportunity.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2238.864" stopTime="2279.369">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I'm not sure what that has to do with this case but let me ask you another question, neither of you as far as I observe have cited the case of Securities and Exchange Commission against Sloan which was decided in this Court in May of this year. 
    There, the federal statute in the Securities Act authorized a 10-day suspension summary proceeding for a violation of certain trading provisions and how would you distinguish what New York does here to -- in the racing area from the securities suspension procedure of 10 days.
speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="2279.369" stopTime="2296.959">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    Well, not having the case before me Your Honor, it makes it pretty difficult. 
    However, there is one thing in Barchi which is very significant and that is a irremediable loss to Mr. Barchi. 
    The fact that different from the cases in this Court such as --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2296.959" stopTime="2304.095">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- suspended from training for 10 days, that's quite of a loss tp him, isn't it, in the stock market?
speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="2304.095" stopTime="2337.896">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    Yes, I would agree but this bears upon an individual's right to earn a livelihood in the horse racing business as soon as you are suspended as the trainer, the owner automatically loses the purse. 
    If the owner wishes to continue with you, he is banned also from racing. 
    Barchi is banned from racing all throughout the United States of America. 
    He cannot earn his livelihood anywhere. 
    All of the owners that he has accumulated over a course of years as a result of his own expertise in this area are gone.

    I think that due process would require some kind of hearing. 
    What was given to my client was absolutely no hearing. 
    I've heard my brother refer to it as a conference type informal hearing but we were not given at that stage if we had -- if that is indeed what that was any evidence of the positive. 
    We still don't know whether or not this horse had the substance they claim in its system.

    Now, my brother has argued that as a matter of cause, these stays are given to trainers and the Board has the power in its discretion to grant stays. 
    I think that was in the response to a question of Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    In the cases that I have had with this Board, they have argued vigorously before state courts that the statute absolutely prohibited their granting a stay under any circumstances. 
    They have also argued to the courts of our state that the statute prohibited the courts from issuing a stay.

    In the instances of thoroughbred racing, the stays are commonly granted in New York. 
    And Section 401 of the State Administrative Procedure Act which became effective after this case says that summary suspensions are allowed in instances where there is a finding made that an emergency exists or that the health welfare of society commands a summary suspension. 
    So what we have been given in Barchi by the three-judge court below has now been codified in our state law. 
    My brother makes reference to a case, Gerard v. Barry which applied Section 401 to another racing incident. 
    That case, he notes in his brief was an application by the Appellate Division of that Section to this horse racing industry which was erroneous and he points to the fact to the Court of Appeals that there was an appeal pending in that case to the Court of Appeals. 
    That decision of the Court of Appeals, they have dismissed the application of the attorney general in that Court to construe that statute otherwise.

    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    Well, by legislative field, I don't think that they could deprive him of his constitutional rights. 
    In other words, if they establish such a presumption or enacted such a statement of strict liability, they still would have to show some control.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2872.947" stopTime="2879.322">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Of course, I understand that the District Court, it didn't say the presumptions were irrebuttable, it said they were rebuttable.

    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    Yes, I believe --

speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="2886.680" stopTime="2923.413">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    Yes it does but I think that the Section that the court below was taking into consideration was the one that says that the trainer is responsibility and must guide and care for his horse. 
    Upon oral argument when I was asked if that were rebuttable, I myself agreed that that rebuttable presumption but the presumptions that the drug just finding a foreign substance in the horse's urine was administered, raises a presumption that it was administered within 48 hours of a race. 
    I find no rational connection with that on the mere fact of the finding of foreign substance in the horse's urine.

speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="2989.457" stopTime="3055.382">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    No, I do not because I do not see a rational connection with the fact of his control. 
    All of these statutes are strict liability in my opinion based upon the fact that the person who is held liable or responsible has the control or has the control of the thing which caused the injury in a particular case. 
    Now, it maybe a little more remote in the case of an automobile but in the case of a harness racing trainer or any trainer of horses, the facts shows that many people have access, many people have control, many people for whatever reasons can in some way get some substance to a horse. 
    If a trainer slept with his horse for 24 hours a day the dissent in Sandstrom versus California which was a California Supreme Court decision. 
    If he slept with his horse 24 hours a day, I could see a rational basis to do it but it's not within human experience to do such a thing.

    And all that you ask for here was a declaratory judgment that the then the existing New York procedures were you know unconstitutional?
speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="3365.199" stopTime="3459.948">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    On the grounds of due process and on the grounds of violating the equal protection of law and I would like to address myself to that issue. 
    The Thoroughbred statute or the statute that governs thoroughbred racing is New York unconsolidated law 7915. 
    It is identical to the language of Section 8022 but in 7915, one very serious sentence is left out and that is pending a full review by the commission. 
    The action of the judges or the agents of the commission shall remain in full force and effect. 
    That section is completely omitted from that which governs thoroughbred racing in the State of New York. 
    Now, while the attorney general argues that they need the summary power while they waited 18 days in this case, the parallel section governing thoroughbred racing to which the state should have the same interest does not contain the statutory prohibition and on that basis in the equal protection argument was made on the grounds that it denied equal protection of law to people engaged in the harness racing. 
    It's the same industry. 
    The only difference is one man sits behind the horse and other sits the top. 
    It's gambling, it's pari-mutuel wagering, it's everything that is involved in thoroughbred racing. 
    To take one class of thoroughbred racing personnel and give them just about the rights that I feel are guaranteed under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and take another group in the same industry with all the same considerations and the same ramifications and say that they should not be given due process of law.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3459.948" stopTime="3470.084">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, is it there are some suggestions though that has been corruption around harness racing that is not been through of thoroughbred racing?
speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="3470.084" stopTime="3532.066">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    The statement made by the attorney general is that in 1954, there were some labor union disruptions or activities at Yonkers Raceway I believe it was or in harness racing in the State of New York. 
    What does has to do with trainers and owners who participated out the race track itself I cannot understand if it had some rational relationship if as they say harness racing were more corrupt than thoroughbred racing then I could see a need for some more severe modes of procedure vis-à-vis harness racing licensees but I don't see a rational connection between what is asserted to be labor union activities in the 1950s and the denial of a hearing to a harness racing trainer. 
    I cannot make that connection. 
    I believe that the equal protection argument is a substantial argument and --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3532.066" stopTime="3535.228">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Your statutes did develop separately, didn't they?
speaker="joseph_a_faraldo" startTime="3535.228" stopTime="3577.945">
    Mr. Joseph A. Faraldo 
    Yes they did and as a matter of fact, the state investigation commission in June of 1976 noted that there were procedural differences which did not have any rational basis and that once the State Racing and Wagering Board was consolidated, in other words, once the harness racing commission and thoroughbred commission were brought under one roof that the New York State Racing and Wagering Board ought to work to alleviate those reference where they appear but there is no factual, there is no factual basis for treating the harness racing personnel different than thoroughbred racing personnel. 
    And I think the equal protection argument is very substantial here.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3577.945" stopTime="3584.445">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I suppose the equal protection doesn't demand identity, does it all the way through.

    They have -- as a matter of fact, they have struck down as unconstitutional the strict liability provision holding that in Illinois versus -- Brennan versus Illinois Racing and Wagering Board in 19 -- I believe it's 69 case. 
    Illinois struck it down saying that the only thing that it protects against is something over which the trainer has no opportunity to guard against anyway and has left Illinois with a rule based upon the negligence of the trainer or his actual culpable conduct.

    Mr. Attorney General, before you start. 
    Let me ask you a question about Gerard. 
    You mentioned it and your opponent also mentioned it. 
    I understand that your opponent takes the view that Gerard has held in effect that Section 401(3) of the administrative procedure act and amended 1976 and as construed by the Court in Gerard qualifies 8022 so that the law in New York -- State Law in New York is now in agreement with the decision of the three-judge court in this case.

    I believe you have stated counsel's position correctly but I believe he has misconstrued what the New York Court of Appeals did. 
    The New York Court of Appeals simply dismissed an appeal and later denied leave to appeal on procedural grounds. 
    This was a decision of an intermediate appellate court.

    I think it would be clear from the examination of the New York statutes. 
    It would be Article 56 of the New York civil practice law and rules relating to the jurisdiction of the New York Court of Appeals. 
    I think Cohen and Karger powers of the New York Court of Appeals which is somewhat dated but it is the definitive treaties would also make this clear that just as a denial of certiorari is not the --

    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    No sir. 
    I would have to disagree because in our view, a drugged horse situation would automatically qualify as a ground for summary suspension of a licensee. 
    Even if indeed the New York State Administrative Procedure Act applies and I think there is still a substantial question whether it's a matter of New York law whether the Administrative Procedure Act would apply to this case notwithstanding Gerard.

    Mr. Robert S. Hammer 
    In this case, the appellate division involved the so-called the Gerstein case switching where the veterinarian was ultimately convicted on some violations and in fact sentenced to prison for a year. 
    I would simply say that counsel in his presentation has alluded toward many things which are to hold the record or which really raise the questions of fact. 
    This we feel as we had urged the three-judge court should have held further hearings. 
    Yes, there is a reparable injury perhaps when a trainer is summarily suspended but we would submit Your Honors that the decisions of this Court and more important the rationale of these decisions uphold such a suspension as a matter of due process and we would accordingly urge that the judgment below be reversed.
