Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatl.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in 479, Edmonds against Compagnie Generale Transatlantique. 
    Mr. Breit, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="70.635" stopTime="656.129">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This matter comes on out of the Fourth Circuit arising out of a decision which was then in conflict with the Ninth and now with the Second and Fifth Circuits as well concerning the rights of a longshoreman who was injured aboard the defendant's vessel as a result of the combined negligence of the longshoreman himself, the stevedore, and the shipowner. 
    The major issue before the Court is whether or not the longshoreman has a right to recover in full his damages under the longest established common law principal of joint and several liability from the various tortfeasors who caused his harm or whether that right has been abrogated by statute under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. 
    The history of the right in both maritime and land-based law is extensive. 
    This Court has ruled in Halcyon versus Haenn. 
    It is ruled in Pope and Talbot versus Hawn. 
    It is more recently ruled in Cooper versus Fritz Kopke. 
    In ACL versus Uri (ph), numerous other cases that the injured party has an indivisible right of recovery in full. 
    The question now posed is whether Congress intended to abrogate that rule when it amended the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Compensation Act in 1972. 
    Prior to 1972, it was clear that Halcyon and versus Haenn, Pope and Talbot versus Hawn, was the law on that particular issue. 
    Congress made no act which would suggest that it intended to change that law. 
    There is apparent but not actual discrepancy between two sentences in 905 (d) of the Act which has been taken to suggest that the Congress was intending proportionate fall. 
    Nothing could have been further from Congress' mind at the time. 
    Respondent in page 11 of his brief concedes that the purpose of the second sentence of 905 (b) was intended to preserve the doctrine established by this Court in Reed versus Yaka namely that a shipowner could not by hiring his own longshoreman and thus become the stevedore avoid the harm that he does of that stevedore. 
    It was in the context of Reed versus Yaka that the second sentence was passed in the 1972 Amendment and the purpose of it was solely to retain the doctrine as espoused by this Court in Reed versus Yaka. 
    On page 43 and 44 of respondent's brief, it is suggested that 933 of this same Act was passed so that the longshoreman could not effect a double recovery and received double compensation. 
    Well, it's inconceivable that he could have received double compensation unless in the first instance, he is compensated in full by the shipowner tortfeasor who has caused his harm. 
    An appellee in the Second Circuit, Anderson versus Iceland on the first both have stated that the purpose of that sentence in 905 (b) was to preserve the doctrine of Reed versus Yaka. 
    But more important than that Congress itself was not silent on the point. 
    Congress specifically stated that the longshoreman's right of action in negligence against the shipowner shall survive. 
    Now, that right of action against the shipowner is the right to recover 100% of his damages from the shipowner or any other person who independently or concurrently created the harm that he has suffered. 
    The congressional record is replete of literally dozens of cases that it intended to overrule that were in existence at the time. 
    This Court in an active role which it is permitted to do in matters of maritime under the doctrine of Seas Shipping versus Sieracki provided for the longshoreman a cause of action which created in effect an absolute right of recovery for any unseaworthy condition regardless of fault. 
    Interestingly enough, the seaworthy condition, the unseaworthy condition was almost always cause by the negligence of the stevedore. 
    The Court had held in Halcyon versus Haenn that there was no cause of action over against the stevedore for contribution in tort. 
    And this Court then went on to extend the Seas doctrine under a contract theory when in Ryan it held that there is not contribution but indemnity. 
    The Congress spent a great deal of time on those issues and in doing so in its reports, it clearly established when it was intending to do. 
    It set forth specifically the names of the cases that it intended to overrule particularly under the section of elimination of unseaworthiness remedy it cites Sea Shipping versus Sieracki as one of the cases. 
    It intended to overrule. 
    No longer does the longshoreman have a cause of action merely because he was injured and merely because there was a defective condition. 
    He now is reduced to the common law negligence action instead of an action under unseaworthiness. 
    The court went on, rather Congress went on further to suggest further and then reciting Ryan Stevedoring versus Pan-Atlantic. 
    The third party action, the tripartite cause of litigation which had burdened the courts and had expended large sums of money by the stevedore and his carrier ownership on alike is better put to use paying compensation. 
    And so Ryan was specifically overruled. 
    (Inaudible) Italia Society versus Oregon Stevedoring, all cases which had established the cause of action for unseaworthiness was specifically overruled. 
    And finally, under the same suggestion, elimination of unseaworthy remedy -- unseaworthiness remedy we finally come to the sentence which is the crux of this case. 
    The vessel will not be chargeable with the negligence of the stevedore or employees of the stevedore. 
    Respondent and the Fourth Circuit, I suggest erroneously have interpreted that statement to mean that a percentage of negligence requires only a percentage of payment when in fact what was intended here by the vessel not being chargeable with the negligence of the stevedore was to do away with Seas Shipping which said that in effect, the shipowner is vicariously responsible for the acts of the stevedore and thus becomes liable when the stevedore commits an acts on negligence. 
    Today, under the amendments, the Act of negligence must be committed by the shipowner himself. 
    But that does not mean that they cannot be more than one proximate cause of an injury and nowhere was it intended by Congress that the shipowner would become liable in tort if it were the sole and exclusive tortfeasor. 
    To suggest that is to defeat the purpose of the Act and as Congress has said to cause to the shipowner to remain responsible to his obligations in tort to the injured longshoreman.

    So, Mr. Breit supposing this case had originate had risen interstate common law tort situation and the trial court have mistakenly submitted interrogatories regarding comparative fault to the jury and they found 20% in one party, 7% on the other, it goes the highest court as the highest court of the state says the trial court was wrong we don't have comparative fault, we just have traditional, ordinary negligence. 
    Could it uphold a verdict against the 20% liable party for the entire amount?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="688.881" stopTime="742.018">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    If we are talking about comparative fault of others besides the injured person, clearly, under every case that has ever been decided, it must give that injured person 100% of the recovery with the exception of those states which have incorporated into a statute under the doctrine of comparative negligence, under the common law doctrine of ordinary negligence both land and maritime, the injured person always was entitled to the whole because his harm is indivisible even though two or three or four may have cause to contribute it. 
    The broken leg is the broken leg and if three people concurrently aided in breaking it, he still has one harm. 
    And so, my answer to you sir is that every case has always held that the injured party is entitled to the full recovery at common law.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="742.018" stopTime="754.629">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Do I get the feeling that in most of the maritime cases as one insurance may have to have to pay it all in their, so what that cause litigation? 
    That law had paid it anyway?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="754.629" stopTime="808.947">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Mr. Justice Marshall, I have argued in my brief that the ultimate economic loss is going to be shared between the stevedore and the shipowner somehow or other in any event. 
    But the sole purpose that we're here is because they are both in concert suggesting that the injured person suffered the economic loss and he is the least able to bear that loss. 
    You are correct sir, regardless of this Court's ruling provided it gives the injured longshoreman his full recovery. 
    Sooner or later in the course of dealing between the stevedore and the shipowner, the cost will be passed on to the shipowner and the ultimate consumer. 
    No question about that. 
    The issue then is, do we take it away from the injured party so that their respective losses are less. 
    Common law doesn't permit that.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Your submission Mr. Breit as I understand it is that the statutory language in question was intended to do no more than to preserve the rule of Reed against Yaka?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="826.304" stopTime="827.168">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Yes, sir.

    That's it?

    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    That is correct. 
    Preserve the rule of the -- the conflict in the statutory language. 
    The second sentence was intended solely to do away with Reed versus Yaka. 
    The issue of the vessel not being chargeable with the negligence of the stevedore referred to the unseaworthiness vicarious liability which had come as a result of Seas Shipping versus Sieracki.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="854.092" stopTime="855.169">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Would you state it for me again.
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="855.169" stopTime="855.639">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Yes, I --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="855.639" stopTime="859.721">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You were saying he was to preserve or to overrule Reed against Yaka?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="859.721" stopTime="870.038">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    To preserve -- well, let me modify that, Reed versus Yaka had two rules. 
    One rule was that the shipowner who is a stevedore --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="870.038" stopTime="870.864">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Is his own stevedore?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="870.864" stopTime="874.370">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    -- is his own stevedore, is responsible as a shipowner.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="874.370" stopTime="874.724">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Right.
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="874.724" stopTime="877.329">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    That rule was intended to be preserved.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="877.329" stopTime="879.772">
    Unknown Speaker 
    There the stevedore was the bearable charter, I think?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="879.772" stopTime="889.101">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Yes. 
    And the second portion of Reed versus Yaka which follows Seas Shipping which said that unseaworthiness is a cause of action.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="889.101" stopTime="889.618">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, that was --
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="889.618" stopTime="905.149">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    That was intended to be overruled. 
    So really they were modifying Reed v. Yaka but retaining the portion which said, “If you are a shipowner and the stevedore at the same time, you are responsible as a shipowner not as a stevedore.”
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="905.149" stopTime="906.581">
    Unknown Speaker 
    For unseaworthiness?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="906.581" stopTime="910.754">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    No, sir. 
    Only for negligence as a shipowner.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="910.754" stopTime="914.619">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Right. 
    But that was an -- wasn't Reed an unseaworthiness case?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="914.619" stopTime="935.104">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Reed versus Yaka was an unseaworthiness case. 
    And Reed versus Yaka was the case which held that the shipowner could not abort the law by hiring his own longshoreman. 
    It held that if he were a stevedore and a shipowner, he was responsible as a shipowner. 
    Now, ---
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="935.104" stopTime="936.702">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Of unseaworthiness?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="936.702" stopTime="938.857">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    For unseaworthiness or for negligence certainly.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="938.857" stopTime="945.914">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, but did the case -- I did sense that the thing that puzzled me is I didn't understand the case to decide any negligence issue.
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="945.914" stopTime="947.570">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Well, Reed versus Yaka did not.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="947.570" stopTime="957.037">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But it held that a -- when a stevedore was both stevedore and shipowner, you could sue him as shipowner despite of then statute?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="957.037" stopTime="960.039">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    That was the holding and that was the purpose of this --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="960.039" stopTime="971.981">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And his liability depended upon unseaworthiness or negligence was really not the issue in the Yaka case although it was an unseaworthiness claim. 
    Now, that unseaworthiness has now been eliminated by Congress.
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="971.981" stopTime="973.622">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    That is correct.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="973.622" stopTime="986.615">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But your contention at least is that this statutory language at issue in this case was to preserve the rule of Reed against Yaka with fundamental rule that when a person is both stevedore and shipowner, he can be sued as shipowner?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="986.615" stopTime="1022.997">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Yes, sir. 
    And I think every Court of Appeals that is ruled on that point has so held. 
    The Fourth Circuit did not touch the point in its argument and concluded only that the only way you could reconcile the two sentences was to come up with a rule of proportionate fall. 
    A rule of proportionate fault as between tortfeasors is really not a rule at all as to the injured person proportionate fault should speak to the degree of liability as between the tortfeasors.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1022.997" stopTime="1029.221">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And you concede that the damages should be reduced by the percentage of the plaintiff's fault, do you not?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="1029.221" stopTime="1031.518">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's specifically within the statute.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1031.518" stopTime="1033.416">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And no question, that's not at issue here?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="1033.416" stopTime="1044.237">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    That is not at issue here? 
    We concede there was $100,000.00 verdict here. 
    We concede that 10% of that is a reduction as a result of the longshoreman's own fault.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1044.237" stopTime="1066.034">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I hate to reveal my stupidity so frequently but the second sentence is what's critical here and it's your critical part of your argument as I understand and I just want to be sure I do catch it. 
    Because the sentence says if such person was employed by the vessel that provide stevedoring services, no such action shall be permitted if the injury and so forth. 
    Are you saying it was to preserve the action rather than to prevent it?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="1066.034" stopTime="1072.363">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    It is to preserve the action against the shipowner who was likewise a stevedore.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1072.363" stopTime="1076.727">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But it says no such action shall be permitted against him that's why I'm so fangled about it.
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="1076.727" stopTime="1077.071">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    Right.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1077.071" stopTime="1083.644">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That was the next sentence. 
    Maybe I'm reading the wrong sentence. 
    If such person was employed by the vessel --
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="1083.644" stopTime="1133.634">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    To provide stevedoring services, no such action shall be permitted if the injury was cause by the negligence of persons engaged in providing stevedoring services. 
    What they were saying is that the shipowner as a shipowner remains liable. 
    As a stevedore, he does not. 
    He's got two heads at that moment. 
    If it's the stevedoring services that are the sole cause of this man's injury or that create an unseaworthy condition aboard that vessel, then there is no right of recovery. 
    But if the shipowner as a shipowner for instance, bringing in grease and oil from another port and leaving it on the deck, or having a defect of which, which was not part of its stevedoring operation remains liable.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1133.634" stopTime="1139.459">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But you construed that sentence as primarily preserving a claim rather than destroying a claim.

    I think it was just a very simple matter for them to put in proportionate fall if they had intended. 
    And if they had intended it by this sentence, it is grossly inartfully drafted. 
    But I don't think that was the intendment of Congress because at the time, proportionate fault was not a doctrine known in maritime law. 
    At the time in 1972, when these amendments were passed and before this Court had ruled in reliable, the only proportionate fault that ever existed was the old 5050 Rule which later this Court amended. 
    But of course when the Court acted in reliable, it did so changing a common law doctrine and not a matter that had been heavily debated by the Congress.

    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    On page 11 of the committee report, the committee has recognized a need for special provisions to deal with the case where a longshoreman or shipowner or repairman is employed directly by the vessel. 
    In such case notwithstanding, the fact that the vessel is the employer, the Supreme Court in Reed versus Yaka and Jackson versus Lykes held that the unseaworthiness is available to the injured employee. 
    It then goes on to say that it wants to retain that right of action against the shipowner. 
    Throughout something like 1200 pages of testimony, there was never once the statement of proportionate fault propounded to the Congress. 
    One speaker, a gentleman by the name of Kaplan who spoke on behalf of a plaintiff's bar in passing mention that it may be a harsh rule to put all of the burden on either the shipowner or the stevedore and perhaps some proportionate fault would be appropriate and he was immediately shut down and that was the only time that was ever mentioned in the reports.

    His testimony is many pages long and he never wants throughout his entire testimony mentioned the issue of proportionate fault or anything that resembled it.

    The other issue which I'd like to bring out is this. 
    In effect what we are asking the Court to do is to legislate because the statute seems clear that it never intended a doctrine of proportionate fault. 
    In Section 933, it specifically said that when the stevedore file suit he is entitled as the first order of business to recover his expenses and every penny that he is paid. 
    And his suit is of course is derivative. 
    This Court in Higginbotham declined to legislate or go further when it was posed with a statutory interpretation. 
    This Court just a few weeks ago in (Inaudible), I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist wrote it, declined to go further in interpreting the Act. 
    It is suggested that this Court again should not attempt to legislate when it became clear what Congress had intended. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Charles F. Tucker
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1498.012" stopTime="1500.959">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Tucker.
speaker="charles_f_tucker" startTime="1500.959" stopTime="1828.652">
    Mr. Charles F. Tucker 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The question before the Court for determination, it seems to me is one of fairness inequity and as well or not a shipowner which has been found by jury to the only 20% at fault for an accident shall be required to pay full damages to the plaintiff while the stevedore employer found to be 70% at fault recovers the full amount of its compensation lien and thus shares none of the financial burden of the loss. 
    Now, I think it's important to understand or consider what the Congress was trying to do in adopting the 1972 amendments to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. 
    It's clear that they acted in order to correct the number of inequities which I developed over the years. 
    Primarily of course, it was to provide a liberal system of compensation for longshoreman, the injured parties. 
    But secondarily, it was certainly to more equally distribute the financial burden occasioned by an accident among the three parties involved, the longshoreman himself, the shipowner and the stevedore. 
    And I think here, it's important to recognize what had happened under litigation which had developed under the Longshoreman's Act. 
    And Mr. Breit has referred to the Sieracki case and the Ryan case. 
    And it had developed as you know that longshoreman were given the warranty of seaworthiness and could recover against the vessel owner not only for negligence but for unseaworthiness which in effect almost made the shipowner an insurer for the safety of the longshoreman. 
    In order to correct this inequity or in an attempt to the Ryan doctrine allowed the shipowner to claim back over against the stevedoring company for indemnity and the stevedore ended up in that type of three-party litigation by not only paying compensation but by paying full damages assessed by jury or the Court. 
    This was recognized by everyone as being quite inequitable. 
    If you adopt the position of the plaintiff petitioner in this case, we are going right back to the same old inequity except it now falls on the shipowner instead of on the stevedoring company and I don't believe as Judge Haynsworth stated in his opinion that it was ever the intent of the Congress while taking away on the one hand the right of the shipowner to recover any indemnity from the stevedoring company to then settle the shipowner with full liability for an accident when it may well have been only slightly at fault and the stevedoring company greatly at fault. 
    This was not the intent of the Congress as shown by the legislative history and could not have been we contend in light of the historical background of the 19 -- of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as existed prior to 1972. 
    Now, there was also one other intention of the Congress I believe in the 1972 Amendments and that was to provide a liberal compensation scheme whereby the longshoreman could look to the Act to compensation for full satisfaction for his injuries and would not have to file a third party action against anyone except on unusual circumstances in order to recover compensation. 
    The result as suggested by the petitioner would do away with this intention of the Congress. 
    Now, the decision of the Fourth Circuit, the en banc decision serves to further the proxies of the amendments by balancing the equities among the three parties. 
    As this decision has indicated, the shipowner will pay its proportionate fault. 
    In this case, the jury found there were 20% at fault for the accident. 
    The longshoreman recovers not only his statutory benefits under the Act which this case serves to show a quite liberal. 
    He's already received in excess of $50,000.00 in compensation payments. 
    But in addition, he will recover the 20% liability damages which the jury has said are attributable to the shipowner.

    The judge propounded interrogatories to the jury. 
    He first asked them, was there any fault, was any negligence on the part of the shipowner, and if so in what percentage? 
    The jury said, 20%. 
    He then said, was the stevedoring company negligent in any way, and if so, in what percentage? 
    And they answered, 70%. 
    And he then said, is the plaintiff himself negligent in any respect and if so, in what percentage? 
    And they answered 10% and then they answered in total damages $100,000. 
    The judge, the district judge entered judgment reluctantly for $90,000.00 and it then went to the Fourth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit reversed.

    Mr. Charles F. Tucker

    Mr. Charles F. Tucker 
    Yes, that's exactly right. 
    And that is our point, Your Honor that it is certainly most inequitable for the stevedoring company which is the party in this case most at fault which will come home free. 
    They will not pay money.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2026.724" stopTime="2045.132">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Is that true in the law and land-based negligence law if you have two joint tortfeasors and the plaintiff elects to sue only one of them and collects for all his damages even though that one is only 20% at fault and somebody else's who's not sued is 80% at fault. 
    The person not sued gets off scot-free if --
speaker="charles_f_tucker" startTime="2045.132" stopTime="2056.751">
    Mr. Charles F. Tucker 
    The difference here Mr. Justice is that this people, the stevedore and the shipowner are not joint tortfeasors. 
    They are not joint, they are not jointly liable.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2056.751" stopTime="2065.108">
    Unknown Speaker 
    No. 
    You acted so shocked at the inequity and I my question was directed as in their similar inequity in ordinary tort law, land-based.
speaker="charles_f_tucker" startTime="2065.108" stopTime="2077.192">
    Mr. Charles F. Tucker 
    Right. 
    But there is, the party Your Honor that does pay the entire amount is not restricted in any matter from recovering over if he can from one of the other parties.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2077.192" stopTime="2083.688">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But normally, I mean the common rule was there was no contribution on joint tortfeasors?
speaker="charles_f_tucker" startTime="2083.688" stopTime="2172.722">
    Mr. Charles F. Tucker 
    That is correct sir except and I would get to this. 
    We feel that the case law as it has developed in this Court has now modified that rule and we feel it no longer applies in this situation. 
    We think that in all fairness and equity, which we believe the Court has tried to do in many of its decisions, that affect this such as the Cooper Stevedoring in reliable transfer, certainly indicate that proportionate fault is what we should be aiming for and this is just the next step in this type of litigation which will take the burden and apportion it among the parties involved. 
    That, and just to finish up that statement as to how it would be apportioned, the shipowner would pay its proportionate shares now by the jury. 
    The longshoreman receives his compensation which in this case, exceeds $50,000.00 to date and he is still receiving it by the way plus he will still use the 20% from the shipowner and the stevedoring company never pays, never pays more than its statutory obligation under the Act and is protected by the Act from any claim of indemnity by the shipowner. 
    Now, to me that is the fairest --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2172.722" stopTime="2174.744">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I'll translate that Mr. Tucker --

    Yes.

    Alright, sir.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2176.364" stopTime="2181.687">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Under that approach, the shipowner would pay how much to the --
speaker="charles_f_tucker" startTime="2181.687" stopTime="2185.037">
    Mr. Charles F. Tucker 
    The shipowner would pay $20,000.00, Your Honor.

    Unknown Speaker 
    To the longshoreman?

    To the longshoreman.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2186.961" stopTime="2192.998">

    Unknown Speaker 
    And so the consequence with is that instead of under the District Court judgment where the stevedore pays nothing in effect --

speaker="charles_f_tucker" startTime="2842.930" stopTime="2987.957">
    Mr. Charles F. Tucker 
    Your Honors, I'd like to speak for a moment with regard to the issue of proportionate fault because I feel that that and along with the fairness and equitable argument in this case is the basis upon which the Fourth Circuit decided this case. 
    The legislative history contrary to what counsel for petition acclaimed clearly states that the vessel shall not be liable in damages for the acts or omissions of the stevedore. 
    They said it on page 4703 of the congressional reports “A vessel shall not be liable in damages for acts or omissions of stevedores.” 
    It could not be clearer. 
    This Court has stated in recent decisions in the Fourth Circuit is now in accord with the doctrine of comparative fault. 
    The Cooper Stevedoring case permitted contribution among joint tortfeasors in a situation, the admiralty situation and in non-collision cases which was done in order to correct the inequity of one bearing the entire loss though the other may have been equally or more to blame. 
    So they all rule against no contribution in non-collision cases was changed by this Court. 
    In reliable transfer, in collision cases, the all rule of equally divided damages was changed to one requiring allocation in proportion to fault. 
    And this Court said that this standard should be adopted allocating liability according to fault where other possible. 
    And this is exactly what the Fourth Circuit has done and which we contend is the fairest and most equitable rule for this Court to adopt.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2987.957" stopTime="2995.713">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Tucker, do you have a comment on your opponent's argument that the second sentence of the statute was merely intended to preserve the rule of the Yaka case?
speaker="charles_f_tucker" startTime="2995.713" stopTime="3147.026">
    Mr. Charles F. Tucker 
    Yes, sir. 
    Clearly it was intended to recognize the special situation where the longshoreman is employed by the vessel to run the stevedoring or ship repair services. 
    But we contend that that was not the only reason for placement in there. 
    That it was placed in there to emphasize what seem to be clear in the congressional intent that the shipowner should not be liable or for the act or missions of the stevedore and it says that quite clearly as I recall the Senate's involved if such person was employed by the vessel to provide stevedoring services. 
    No such action shall be permitted if the injury was cause by the negligence of persons engaged in providing stevedoring services to the vessel. 
    It seems perfectly clear. 
    We in our brief, we have commented on the fact that two sentences the first sentence and the second and the third if you read them literally cannot possibly mean what they seem to say. 
    Because if you read them literally, it would indicate that if the longshoreman is employed by independent contractor to provide stevedoring services and if there is any negligence on the part of the of the vessel owner then he recovers a 100% whereas if you read the second and third sentences that way, you find that if he's employed by the shipowner to run the stevedoring services in any fault of the stevedoring -- people providing stevedoring services cause the accident he recovers nothing and I don't think that anyone could contend that the Congress intended to do that and the only way to reconcile the two sentences is to read them to mean to the extent the injury was caused by the fault of the vessel or the fault of the stevedoring people employed to render stevedoring services and if you read it that way, it is entirely consistent and also consistent with the language of the Act in the legislative history which indicates that they shall not be responsible for acts or omission of the stevedore.

    And he certainly can sue the ship under the Act because he did hear and you don't say that he can.

    He can sue the Act -- the ship under the Act for negligence, yes, sir.

    Sure. 
    No question about that. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Calvin W. Breit

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have anything further, Mr. Breit?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="3286.966" stopTime="3414.509">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    One very brief comment, I realize it is beyond the normal time for the Court. 
    In Cooper versus Stevedoring in 1974, this Court held that Halcyon versus Haenn was still good law under the facts. 
    Those facts were identical in all respects with the case here, a stevedore who is immune from suit of by the injured party and sues the shipowner and recovers in full. 
    There is no contribution in tort from the immune employer. 
    The statute intended to keep that. 
    When the statute said that the employer shall not be liable to the vessel for such damages, directly or indirectly and in any agreements, the warrants of the contrary shall be void. 
    It was specifically intended by Congress regardless of the equities as argued here that the stevedore not play a part in the tort action or not suffer contribution by waiving what would normally be the lien that it should recover. 
    And in exchange for that, the stevedores have paid two, three, and sometimes four times as much in weekly compensation as they did before the Act. 
    They give what was a relatively small payment and tripartite litigation and got in exchange higher payments but absolutely no litigation. 
    That was the purpose of the statute. 
    And if we follow the Fourth Circuit, we must then implead the stevedore in this case and in every case to find out what is the percentage of their fault. 
    This was an ex parte determination of 70% in which they played no part or hearing and clearly if they were there, advocating their position, as they must do under the Fourth Circuit in every other case from hereon in. 
    They become a party to the litigation. 
    It's exactly what Congress was intending to avoid.

    What do have to say about whether this case might be back here could conceivably be back here after the District Court acts?
speaker="calvin_w_breit" startTime="3421.534" stopTime="3492.645">
    Mr. Calvin W. Breit 
    If the Court rules that the longshoreman is entitled to his common-law remedy of 100% recovery from the shipowner which we have espouse and which the other circuits have held then no one will ever be back here because he will be required to repay his lien to the stevedore and receive a credit against future compensation which may be payable. 
    We don't know now what the lien is. 
    We may never know what the lien is until this man dies because it's an ongoing lien and each year it's subject to change under a formula device by Congress geared to inflation. 
    So that each year, his formula changes. 
    We suggest that there would be no further litigation except if this Court says that the Fourth Circuit is correct and we have to go now under the District Court and fight over the distribution and then every case thereafter will have to be fought with the stevedore involved to determine whether they are 70, 60, 50 or 30% at fault and Congress did not intend it. 
    Thank you.
