    Justice Byron R. White 
    Section 632 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946 requires that all employees subject to the Foreign Service Retirement System retire at age 60. 
    In contrast, at the time the suit was brought, government employee is subject to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System, were not required to retire until age 70. 
    And now any retirement age has been removed. 
    A three-judge court held that this difference in retirement ages discriminated against foreign service personnel and that the discrimination was an invidious one that violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
    We noted probable jurisdiction and we reversed that judgment. 
    Our reasons are elaborated in the opinion that has been filed with the clerk. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.
