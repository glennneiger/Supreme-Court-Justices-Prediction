    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The case which I have the privilege of presenting to this Court began in Memphis, Tennessee in 1970. 
    As the Sixth Circuit opinion states, “This matter involves a sequence of events which have the flavor of the old West before the law crossed the Pecos. 
    The difference is that here, as the Sixth Circuit stated there are no real heroes and there was a trial.” 
    It seems that in July of 1970, a Las Vegas gambler by the name of William Douglas came to Memphis with a gun, an alias, and a device for marking cards. 
    Douglas sought through some local connections in Memphis, a card game. 
    He was introduced eventually to a Memphis gambler by the name of Robert Wood. 
    Wood apparently felt that through his skill at poker he would be relieved Douglas of his money. 
    However, Douglas opted for the advantages of marking the cards rather than the uncertainties of skill and in three head to head matches he relieved Wood, Robert Wood, of approximately $5,000.00. 
    And Wood apparently had some confidence in himself and in his game because he didn't blame the losses on his own incompetence and began to suspect that he was being cheated. 
    He became convinced that he was being cheated and together with his brother, Joe Wood, had formed a plan to recoup his losses. 
    That plan involved using Joe Wood and three respondents in this matter to rob a fourth poker game between Mr. Douglas and Robert Wood. 
    Thus, Robert Wood's plan in a nutshell was to recoup his gambling losses by the robbery proceeds. 
    Prior to the night of the fourth game, Mr. Joe Wood, his brother and two of the respondents here, Hamilton and Pickens, went to the scene of the fourth game, looked it over, plan their strategy and according to the evidence there was some discussion on how the proceeds would be split. 
    On that night of the game, there were four people in the room when the game began, Robert Wood, Joe Wood, Mr. Douglas, and an individual, by the name Tommy Thomas, who said to be a mutual acquaintance of Douglas and Robert Wood. 
    About 9 o'clock of that evening, Joe Wood began to unfold the robbery plan. 
    He got up and said he was going to the store to buy some beer. 
    He went outside and he met with the three respondents. 
    They did go to the store. 
    They did buy some beer but apparently they station their cars some place suitable to their plan. 
    And they approach the apartment together and Mr. Douglas became suspicious. 
    He heard noise outside. 
    He armed himself with a shotgun. 
    Now Joe Wood removed the three respondents from right outside the door of the apartment. 
    Before Douglas could see him and he was allowed to crawl backed into the apartment while being watched with Douglas who was on with a shotgun. 
    Once Joe Wood was back inside, the game continued. 
    The three respondents were outside. 
    Joe Wood then, short time later telling the people inside that he had to use the bathroom, entered the bathroom of the apartment and came out armed with a gun. 
    He apparently was a little nervous at that time because he gave the gun to his brother, Robert Wood, who was seated at the table playing cards with Douglas and Joe Wood left leaving the door to the apartment open. 
    Tommy Thomas at that time was lying on floor. 
    He got up, closed the door and attempted to mediate between Douglas and Robert Wood. 
    As the evidence shows, Douglas apparently reached for a gun that was in his belt at that time and Robert Wood killed by --

    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    This was in an apartment house in Memphis. 
    It was in --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In an apartment, is it?
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="346.156" stopTime="434.870">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Yes, sir. 
    Within seconds from the shot that eventually killed Mr. Douglas. 
    The door flew open and the three respondents came running in to carry out their plan of robbery. 
    They fired two shots within the apartment. 
    Rob Thomas of some $50.00 to $80.00, took the proceeds off the table, took a knife and then the five eventual defendants in this case, the two Wood brothers and the three respondents here, Hamilton, Pickens, and Randolph left. 
    Subsequently, they went from there according to the evidence over the Hamilton's apartment where they hid the weapons, divided up the money and went there separate ways. 
    Douglas of course died. 
    Subsequently, they were all either arrested or they turned themselves within to the Memphis Police Department. 
    Prior to their trial, four of these individuals gave statements to the Memphis Police Department. 
    Joe Wood never gave a statement and he did not testify at trial. 
    Robert Wood gave a detailed lengthy statement that was later introduced in a trial in a redacted form. 
    Robert Wood also testified at trial. 
    Mr. Hamilton --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What is the state's position on redaction? 
    Somewhere in the briefs, I had the impression the state conceded the redaction was not effectives, do you agree to that?
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="447.055" stopTime="492.906">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Mr. -- Mr. Justice, I think that the redaction process was admirable. 
    I do not concede that it wasn't effective. 
    What I -- what I mean by that is I don't think that redaction when there's two defendants sitting there and the references are the two others is ever a substitution for cross-examination or confrontation. 
    But I do think it's a factor to be considered when you get to the issue of the devastating effect of the co-defendants' statement. 
    In other words, I think it's better in this case that there was an attempted redaction. 
    For instance, in some of the cases here where this Court has found harmless error like Schneble and Brown. 
    There was no redaction so --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="492.906" stopTime="501.782">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So -- so it isn't a question of erroneous redaction where some words that should have gone off or left in?

    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    No, sir.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's not a matter of belief. 
    It's what happened with what --
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="528.979" stopTime="537.586">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    I -- I know. 
    I -- it is my understanding of the record that they were charged with murder and perpetuation of robbery and were convicted of that offense.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="537.586" stopTime="538.693">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Five co-defendants.
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="538.693" stopTime="538.759">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="538.759" stopTime="539.544">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In one trial.
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="539.544" stopTime="728.659">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, Hamilton gave two confessions. 
    One oral which was immediately reduce to writing and admitted in a redacted form. 
    He gave -- he went through a question and answer routine with the police department that was transcribed but not admitted. 
    Randolph gave two all statements was later admitted. 
    Both redacted and admitted. 
    Pickens went through the same question and answer, routine with the police department. 
    His question -- the questions and the answers were transcribed -- there was redaction and performed and there were admitted. 
    In Pickens case, he signed the transcription and initialed each page also. 
    The redaction process reduced any references to the -- to the other defendants either eliminated them, deleted them or changed them to they references, two other party references, we or guy. 
    The guy reference is the only indication of the sex of the people who were involved. 
    There is no indication of any other physical characteristics, no indication of race. 
    Now, it's the position of State of Tennessee here that the question before this Court is a Sixth Amendment question involving a right to confrontation? 
    We maintain that the error in this matter below stems from an inappropriate application of Bruton to the facts in this case. 
    We believe it is impossible to draw a logical analogy between these facts and the facts in the Bruton case. 
    To do that -- to draw that analogy ignores some very real distinctions in this case and also ignores the decisions of this Court in Schneble, Harrington, and more recently in Brown. 
    We think the most important distinction between this case and Bruton is that in this case the parties raising the Bruton objection had confess themselves that their confessions are internally consistent, that they corroborate each other and then they have been redacted. 
    We think that this -- these factors have an impact -- have an effect on the question of devastation. 
    The question that concern this Court very much in Bruton. 
    We think that the risk of prejudice to these people is eliminated because of the internal consistency, because of the redaction. 
    We think that the overall effect of the confession is simply cumulative. 
    I think another important distinction between this case and Bruton is a testimony of Robert Wood and the testimony of Tommy Thomas. 
    Robert --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="728.659" stopTime="735.445">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Terry, are you basically making a harmless error argument?
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="735.445" stopTime="741.560">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Mr. Justice, I think that it's fair to say that but I think that --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="741.560" stopTime="775.676">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The reason I'm asking. 
    Supposing one of these confessions had been very, very brief and really didn't -- didn't -- wasn't enough to cast a proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to him or just some kind of an inculpatory statement attended to hurt him in the trial. 
    Would he be disabled from making a Bruton objection if he didn't have enough -- if -- if there were not proof beyond reasonable doubt apart from the other confessions? 
    Now, as a -- you are -- as a matter of law that whenever you confess here. 
    You don't have the Bruton objection or you argue in this case it's harmless error?
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="775.676" stopTime="821.789">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    The problem I have of that Mr. Justice Stevens is -- is starting with Bruton as a starting point when you have more than one confession or when the objector is also a confessor. 
    I think at that point, you should go back to the Sixth Amendment and the question should be confrontation. 
    And what does confrontation require and whether the remedy has to be what occurred in Bruton. 
    In Bruton, I think under the facts of Bruton, George Bruton was convicted on hearsay. 
    There was very little else there. 
    Here, that's a different situation and that's why, I don't like to say harmless error because harmless error assumes a Bruton violation. 
    And I don't think there was a Bruton violation here. 
    If there's a violation, it's a Sixth Amendment --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="821.789" stopTime="830.848">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Or is it because the -- each defendant confessed or because the confession of each defendant was very, very probative against him?
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="830.848" stopTime="835.137">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    I think the most important distinction is that they confessed. 
    They incriminated themselves.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="835.137" stopTime="868.748">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You would make the same argument even if you didn't have -- what's the other Wood -- if you didn't have a confession from Robert Wood and if you didn't have a lot of detail in each of confession -- in -- just say -- say that for example, Pickens had a very short confession in which he just said, “Well, I met with these people but then I went home.” 
    He didn't really say for that. 
    And that's all he confessed to. 
    Would he be disqualified from raising the Bruton objection? 
    And you don't have a Wood's confession in there. 
    On the basically your proof consist of the -- what's in the Randolph confession and the Pickens confession?
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="868.748" stopTime="873.484">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Our -- no, I think that Mr. Pickens would be in much better situation because --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="873.484" stopTime="879.537">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well as a matter of law, would he be able to make a Bruton con -- Bruton objection? 
    He would have made a confession?
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="879.537" stopTime="887.619">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Again and I, you know, I don't want to appear to argue with you. 
    I think he should make a Sixth Amendment confession because a Sixth Amendment objection. 
    A right to confrontation objection --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="887.619" stopTime="888.209">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, yes.
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="888.209" stopTime="889.986">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    -- no cross-examination.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="889.986" stopTime="890.161">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Unless --
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="890.161" stopTime="913.815">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    I am being convicted on hearsay. 
    He would be saying. 
    Not Bruton, it's just not Bruton because Bruton there's one confession and it is in -- and the person raising it is sitting there silently. 
    Not testifying and not confessing. 
    And I think that you have different situation where you have corroborative confessions.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="913.815" stopTime="928.683">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You see, what I'm trying to find out is whether you're making a legal argument or factual argument? 
    Now, you make a very strong factual argument in your brief that the evidence is overwhelming against each of these people. 
    But is that because of this particular record or because as a matter of law. 
    None of them has the right to make this --
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="928.683" stopTime="1005.872">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    I think it's because of this particular record and I think that under harmless error. 
    I'm saying harmless error under Sixth Amendment. 
    Not harmless error under Bruton and that that -- I know its confusing but I'm not the only one confused if you read the circuits in this situation, a very much split and they -- and they go through a process of trying to figure out exactly what they're saying and some of them in the end say it doesn't make any difference what we're saying. 
    But I think the important thing is to go back to the right of confrontation and not stop it Bruton. 
    Go all the way back and say, what is confrontation require. 
    If confrontation requires cross-examination, then and there is no cross-examination. 
    Then what is the remedy? 
    In Bruton situation, he's convicted on hearsay, in this situation. 
    They're not. 
    So the remedy does not have to be reversal. 
    The remedy here it can be affirmance, even if -- even if you say that there is a technical violation of a right to cross-examine that is secured by the Sixth Amendment. 
    There's still does not have to be the drastic remedy that was necessary for Bruton.

    All I had was the confession of evident -- of Evans as reported by a third party.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The trial court say, you can't use that except against Evans and this court held that despite those instructions that was so damaging with respect to Bruton and violated so greatly his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation that that conviction was reverse, is that it? 
    But --
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="1185.879" stopTime="1185.940">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    That's accurate.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1185.940" stopTime="1187.709">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- neither of them would testify.

    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Neither one testified and there was no redaction.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="1191.187" stopTime="1205.533">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    And in an examination with this Court found in rendering the opinion that Evans confessing was just about it against Bruton. 
    As a matter of fact, later on Evans was -- Evans' conviction was reversed because --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1205.533" stopTime="1207.059">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What happened before the case got here --
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="1207.059" stopTime="1207.211">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1207.211" stopTime="1208.164">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- if you remember?
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="1208.164" stopTime="1210.448">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Correct, before it got here. 
    So --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1210.448" stopTime="1212.616">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    We must have Bruton's case here.
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="1212.616" stopTime="1220.145">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    That's correct. 
    And Bruton, the weight of the weight of the evidence in the record against Bruton was Evans' confession which was hearsay.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1220.145" stopTime="1225.141">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Although, it says right until by the trial judge to disregard with respect to Bruton.

    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Yes, they had. 
    And that's – that's what this Court said.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1227.295" stopTime="1234.346">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So the judge must have considered there was an evidence other than that confession to go -- to take a case to the jury.

    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    I don't think so.

    I think this Court found that there wasn't much other than that.

    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Yes, it was. 
    I think that if you go through the testimony in this record other than the confessions. 
    Put the confession aside and go through everything else. 
    Go through Robert Wood's testimony. 
    Go through Tommy Thomas' testimony. 
    Go through the police officers' ballistics report. 
    Go through the finding of the weapons at Hamilton. 
    At the end of that review, you -- there was also a number of witnesses outside the apartment who could not positively identify the people but could relate physical characteristics. 
    At the end of that review, there's only one question that you -- that is left and that is who were those three people who broke down that door and came in there, what was there names? 
    Who were they? 
    That's only thing left unanswered by the competent, admissible evidence in this record. 
    That question is answered by the people who broke down the door themselves. 
    They came in then one by one and say, “I did it. 
    That was me.” 
    And that's the only value, that's the only value of their confession. 
    That's the only thing that you get from there confession that you don't already have and you sort of have that, although you don't have it as well as any prosecutor would like to have it in Robert Wood's identification of them.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    You're going to deal with Mr. Pickens' case, differently from the other two or not?
speaker="walter_l_evans" startTime="1636.359" stopTime="1637.296">
    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1637.296" stopTime="1637.977">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Alright.
speaker="walter_l_evans" startTime="1637.977" stopTime="1909.400">
    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    Yes, if Your Honor please. 
    On the one hand and no in the other for purposes of clearing the error as far as the Bruton rule is concerned, I think that the Court should consider the whole picture of all the confessions. 
    But we would contend that the finding below that the Pickens' confession was inadmissible because of violation of rule of Miranda. 
    The Constitution file adjudication on that issue and his confession should be or his conviction should be reversed on that reason -- for that reason alone. 
    But in considering the whole Bruton issue and the question of harmless error, I think that it would be good to consider Pickens' confession along with the other three and this would support our contention that all three of these defendants including Pickens would not the right to confrontation and cross-examination based upon the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the past decision of this Court was has been rendered since the Bruton rule. 
    Now, the first issue involved in the matter of coming up from the Sixth Circuit was that involving the interpretation of Bruton, Schneble, and Harrington. 
    We maintain in our original response file in our position to the state's petition that the state has erroneously characterized the facts of this case to Schneble and Harrington, and more or less overlooked the significance of the Bruton Rule. 
    If you would notice in their briefs, they discount the importance of Bruton. 
    I think that in every decision of this Court has some constitutional significance and Bruton certainly stands as a landmark on the question of violation of right to a confrontation and right to a cross-examination. 
    As Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated and Davis versus Alaska, and also this Court in Pointer v. Texas and Douglas versus Alabama that the right to cross-examination is very much apart of the right of confrontation as stated in our Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
    This case in our opinion will present somewhat of a precedent in the sense it would clear the air on the question of harmless error. 
    The cases of Harrington and Schneble did not overrule Bruton which Mr. Justice Brennan wrote his rare reason argument on. 
    This case is a case as Mr. Justice Stevens indicated involving the question of harmless error. 
    Now, we talk about harmless error. 
    We must look at Chapman v. California, Fahy versus Connecticut, Schneble v. Florida, Harrington v. California, and the Court has consistently stated that harmless error means harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    And it is the federal standard which this Court should consider as indicated in the case of Fahy versus Connecticut. 
    Now, the crucial facts of this case as they relate to the respondent's convictions are probably to two basic theories. 
    The one promoted by the state and the theory of possible theories supported by us in our brief. 
    And the state has made a sum conclusory statements throughout these proceedings which have indicated the facts of this case show very clearly that these respondents were part of the plan to rob. 
    But a close examination and the view of the record in our opinion could lead this Court to conclude to the contrary are certain that lead this Court to conclude that the facts are not clear as to the respondents' involvement in these whole proceeding. 
    Now, the District Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals for purposes of ruling on Bruton accepted the theory most favorable to the state on the question of the respondents' involvement in these whole proceedings.

    He was the fellow lying on the floor?
speaker="walter_l_evans" startTime="1937.662" stopTime="1963.636">
    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    Right. 
    That the three -- the two or maybe three of them concocted the plan to and we deny that there was even in the plan to rob the poker game. 
    This is a theory promoted by the state. 
    But a close reading of the record that even a close examination of Robert Wood's testimony, of course the state relies upon so heavily, does not really support the theory in our contention about a plan to rob?

    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    That is not the evidence, if Your Honor please. 
    The evidence shows that Robert Wood took all the money off the table. 
    Some of which was his own. 
    In fact the theory of the robbery is contained in the latter part of Robert Wood statement where he stated that, “If I caught the game of cheating, then I may -- I was going to ask for my money back.” 
    He didn't say he was going to get any of the victim's money.

    A reasonable conclusion could be drawn that Hamilton worked for Joe Wood. 
    He was asked to bring a couple or bring some of his friends by this particular apartment. 
    He may not have even indicated the purpose of their coming back. 
    But assuming he indicated that my brother was involved in the poker game and that he felt that this other fellow was cheating him, and he might just need some physical bodies present when we asked for his money back.

    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    And the -- the entire episode carries a very interesting scenario and we have a situation here where the -- the evidence that was presented. 
    If you really examine the evidence presented before the jury and the state's theory is contained to a great extent of Justice Stevens' in that evidence which was not admitted into evidence before the jury. 
    And one of the questions of harmless error, the Court must consider what evidence was presented before the jury. 
    There were the facts --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2132.551" stopTime="2134.997">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Didn't we take this on one point only?
speaker="walter_l_evans" startTime="2134.997" stopTime="2136.236">

    Yes, if Your Honor please.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2136.236" stopTime="2140.476">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But how do we get to harmless error?
speaker="walter_l_evans" startTime="2140.476" stopTime="2180.414">
    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    Involved in the Harrington case. 
    Harrington the specific issue in the Harrington and Schneble assumed a violation of Bruton. 
    And the question was, was there harmless error in those cases? 
    In this particular case, the first issue or the only issue before the Court as framed by the state is whether the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has correctly interpreted the law as stated by this Court in Bruton versus United States, Schneble v. Florida, and Harrington versus California. 
    So, Harrington and Schneble were cases dealing specifically with or deal only with the question --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2180.414" stopTime="2187.262">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But why do you think Bruton is in there? 
    Bruton didn't have anything to harmless error, did it?
speaker="walter_l_evans" startTime="2187.262" stopTime="2205.280">
    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    Bruton stood for the proposition that the admission into evidence of statements of co-defendants which implicate each other and where these co-defendants do not take the stand to testify and be available for cross-examination violates the co-defendants right to confrontation and cross-examination.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2205.280" stopTime="2217.452">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But in this case -- in this case, going to the state's argument, the only people that didn't confess were those that weren't arrested?

    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    Joe Wood was the link between these three respondents and the one who actually fired the fatal blow.

    Trying to finish.

    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    -- there are certain facts in this case that are undisputed without any question. 
    Number one, Robert Wood was the person who fired the fatal shot. 
    The state does not contend to the contrary.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2247.710" stopTime="2249.180">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And he was the card player, wasn't he?

    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    Yes. 
    He was the card player. 
    Secondly, neither of these respondents participated in the game nor had they been in the room at anytime prior to the shooting. 
    The state does not contend to the contrary. 
    Neither of these respondents took any money from the game at all. 
    In their brief in fact they had -- they state that Robert Wood took all of the money. 
    Well, a closer reading of the record, in the case that he took some money from the table and stuffed it in his pocket. 
    Another theory might be Tommy Thomas took the rest after everybody had left. 
    But nevertheless the state admits that Robert Wood took all the money on the table and stuffed it in his pocket.

    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    No, but these respondents were convicted of murder in the perpetration of a robbery.

    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    If there was an attempt which was not consummated, I believe and you can correct me that that would be an offense of attempted robbery. 
    But in this case they were charged with murder in effect during a robbery.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2354.602" stopTime="2359.659">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So you have to actually succeed under Tennessee law in getting the money in order for it to be robbery?

    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    Oh, I understand -- we will not -- we will not go there far if you please Mr. Justice Rehnquist and saying that the robbery had to be consummated at the time of the murder in order for that to be a violation of the statute. 
    But what we would say is that at the time of the murder, there had been no attempted robbery. 
    And the murder took place and if you would read these Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals which is has a very interesting analysis of the felony murder doctrine. 
    The murder took place before, before any attempted robbery if there was in fact a robbery and before these three respondents came into the room, if they came into the room. 
    Now the state contends of the theory of harmless error that there is other evidence in the record of placing these particular respondents at the scene of the robbery or at the scene of the crime. 
    Assuming --

    Did -- the testimony was assumed that they were there and the record will show that three out Robert Wood's testimony.

    I -- he - he did not testify that they were there. 
    He testified -- I assume that they were there which in our opinion is far different. 
    He did not positively identify these three respondents as those three blacks who came into the room after the murder was committed. 
    But assuming he did. 
    The -- the only evidence that would be presented at that point is that these defendants came into a room after a murder. 
    But in order to convict them of murder in a perpetuates of a robbery, where it is quite clear that they did not do the shooting and they did not even do the robbery. 
    There must be a link and a plan, and that's what the Supreme Court of Tennessee considered in reversing the Court of Criminal Appeals. 
    The Court of Supreme Court of Tennessee felt that they will nevertheless a part of the plan to rob. 
    And as our contention that this part -- this plan in only contained in the confessions of these three respondents and a close examination of the record would present serious questions even considering all the evidence of this Court is not considering you know, the sufficiency of the evidence but --

    They say, this case presents two principle issues. 
    They don't say it presents only two issues, two principal issues, i.e. the sufficiency of the evidence under the felony murder and secondly, the Bruton point.

    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    Right. 
    For whatever reason, the court did not address that issue.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3076.496" stopTime="3080.312">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, when we granted certiorari. 
    We did not grant certiorari under Miranda issue --
speaker="walter_l_evans" startTime="3080.312" stopTime="3253.332">
    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    That is correct. 
    The issue that was before this Court is whether the Bruton rule was violated and more importantly in our position or opinion. 
    Whether the violation of the Bruton rule was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt and in considering the question of harmless error, the evidence presented before the Court is very much important. 
    The only evidence introduced were the testimonies of five supposedly impartial witnesses whose only test among was limited to their statements that they saw three blacks outside the door of the apartment. 
    One witness says they saw two blacks coming outside. 
    Another with two witnesses said, a white and three blacks but no way in the record could we find any testimony of these supposed impartial witnesses that these respondents had any weapons in their hands that they did anything of then either appear at the door and/or kicked the door in. 
    The crucial testimony in this case comes from Robert Wood, who gave an initial statement to the police before his indictment. 
    In which he stated very clearly, I cannot -- I cannot identify these blacks that came in and consistent with the original plan of Robert Wood, Joe Wood and Tommy Thomas to place all the blame on three unidentified blacks. 
    And the record will show in reading the statements of Tommy Thomas and also of Robert Wood that Joe Wood, Robert Wood and Tommy Thomas met after this incident to concoct the plan. 
    To put this whole murder on three unidentified blacks who supposedly came into the room, shot the victim, and left with all the money. 
    But after some investigation apparently the police did not believe that version and subsequently, indicted the Wood brothers along with three respondents. 
    Now I think that in considering the question of harmless error, the Court cannot turn his head to the complaint of coercion and as the Sixth Circuit said, that was a very vivid complaint of coercion and physical abuse as it relates to these three confessions. 
    And it would be our contention that this -- the existence of this kind of abuse, a word create a sort of tainted character to these confessions and we're not dealing with unchallenged confessions. 
    We're not --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that really before us Mr. Evans, on the petition that was granted?
speaker="walter_l_evans" startTime="3259.579" stopTime="3314.279">
    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    It -- in considering the tainted evidence against the untainted evidence. 
    And I think that Mr. Justice Brennan in Harrington raised the question about in weighing the harmless -- in fact in weighing harmless error, you must consider the quality of the evidence of both sides, the quality of the untainted evidence, the quality of the tainted and it's our position that there is very little untainted evidence in this case. 
    If there's any untainted evidence, it would be the testimony of the five witnesses outside the apartment who could not identify either of these three respondents as the three blacks or the three Negroes or the three colored men who are at the door. 
    And the testimony of Robert Wood is tainted.

    As I read the record Mr. Justice Marshall, the witnesses merely testified to what they observed outside the apartment. 
    They did not go inside the apartment.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3337.294" stopTime="3343.518">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Your client.
speaker="walter_l_evans" startTime="3351.480" stopTime="3433.920">
    Mr. Walter L. Evans 
    The state contends they went in and of course the Court could -- couldn't possibly conclude that they did or some of them did go into the apartment. 
    But the testimony of the confession of Hamilton which was admitted before the Court until -- it shows that he did not go into the apartment. 
    And that this consists of what the respondent's theory that once the door was kicked in primarily by Joe Wood. 
    They looked inside the door and saw a white figure lying on the floor. 
    They turned and went away. 
    But because Tommy Thomas, and Robert Wood, and Joe Wood had concocted this theory about the blacks' involvement, in order to maintain some credibility at court, it's our contention that Robert Wood, Tommy Thomas consisted to maintain that these blacks did in fact come into the apartment and they in fact fired some shots and robbed him and so forth. 
    But the record it very clear that the evidence of these three respondents involvement is very shady and that without these confessions. 
    There's no reasonable way these respondents could have been convicted of murder in the perpetuation of a robbery. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Michael E. Terry

    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    Yes. 
    May it please the Court. 
    On the issue of the Miranda, the rob that went, it was considered by the trial court outside the presence of the jury down in the states favor assigned as Error No. 5 to the Court of Criminal Appeals by the defendants considered by the Court of Criminal Appeals and found to be without merit. 
    Then the state appealed from that position --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3460.346" stopTime="3460.609">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="michael_e_terry" startTime="3460.609" stopTime="3513.483">
    Mr. Michael E. Terry 
    -- and it wasn't before the Supreme Court of Tennessee. 
    But we did not raise exhaustion. 
    We relied on 28 -- 2254 (d) and in the District Court, we figured there had been a fair hearing. 
    That issue is not here but that is throughout that it went. 
    The one important point I'd like to make and that is that Mr. -- as Mr. Evans says “untainted evidence”, very little untainted evidence. 
    It's very important to note in deciding this case in considering this record that each of these confessions is untainted evidence as to the confessor. 
    And when you are getting into a weighing of the proof that can make up that quantum of proof necessary to find harmless error, the confessor's confession should be considered against himself. 
    It is untainted in that respect.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3513.483" stopTime="3541.079">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But Mr. Evans -- isn't his argument if I understood it correctly that some confessions are more probative than others. 
    And one factor that tends to make a jury sometimes disbelieve a confession is if they think that there was some brutality attached to coercing the conviction. 
    But and I think his argument is that arguably this confession should not be -- would not have not been taken it face value if it stood alone. 
    But it was much more likely to believe when there were three or four confessions on the same offer.
