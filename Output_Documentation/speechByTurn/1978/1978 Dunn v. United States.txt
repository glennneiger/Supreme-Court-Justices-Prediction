    Case is submitted. 
    We'll hear arguments next in Dunn against the United States. 
    Mr. Sears, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready, if you don't mind the absence of an audience.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Petitioners before the Court today to present three primary questions: Whether a sworn statement taken in a private attorneys office may be deemed a proceeding ancillary to U.S. Court or grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1623? 
    Can immunized testimony be used against the witness to establish the corpus delicti of an inconsistent declarations prosecution without proof that the witness testified falsely under immunity? 
    And did the appellate court in this case adopt a proper theory in sustaining the conviction of Mr. Dunn? 
    Your Honor, petitioner submits that all three issues must be resolved against him before the conviction can stand. 
    The underlying case proceeded as follows. 
    Mr. Dunn appeared before federal grand jury in Denver, Colorado on June 16, 1976. 
    He claimed his right to remain silent and subsequently was ordered to appear before United States District Judge whereupon he was granted use immunity under 18 United States Code Section 6002. 
    He thereafter reappeared and testified the certain drug activities at the Colorado State Penitentiary implicating one Phillip Musgrave and several other co-defendants. 
    As a result, an indictment was returned against Musgrave and three other co-defendants. 
    On September 30, 1976, he appeared in the office of Musgrave's attorney, Michael Canges and proceeded to recant his grand jury testimony. 
    Present was a notary public who administered the oath and recorded Mr. Dunn's statement by virtue of a tape-recording. 
    It was subsequently reduced to writing and tendered to the U.S.District Court --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I take it he just didn't wander into the attorney's office that day?
speaker="daniel_j_sears" startTime="309.210" stopTime="354.825">
    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Your Honor, although the record is silent as to this, I believe the evidence would indicate that Mr. Dunn met Mr. Musgrave and then proceeded to strike a deal with him. 
    Subsequently, wound up in his attorney's office, Mr. Musgrave's attorney's office and recanted what he had told to -- what he had told to the grand jury. 
    The statement was reduced to writing and tendered to the Court as an exhibit in support of a motion to dismiss the indictment against Musgrave. 
    On October 21, 1976, a hearing on that motion was held in the United States District Court. 
    Dunn was called as a witness and once again reaffirmed the affidavit even though he'd indicated he had not totally reviewed it. 
    The charges against Musgrave were subsequently reduced.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, when he reaffirmed the affidavit, will you enlarge on that, he was under oath before a grand jury then?

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    He was under oath before U.S. District Judge, Your Honor.

    Yes. 
    Your Honor --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="366.619" stopTime="375.081">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And did he simply say he reaffirmed it in a conclusory way or did he restate the same facts?
speaker="daniel_j_sears" startTime="375.081" stopTime="399.776">
    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Your Honor, I believe the nature of the testimony went that he was asked to identify the affidavit, did identify it. 
    Asked him if it was the truth? 
    He said, yes, it was. 
    And he says, is it all the truth? 
    Then he said, possibly 10%. 
    Each declaration that he made before the grand jury was not proceeded through and it was the conclusory remark that 90% of it was false which we may infer.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="399.776" stopTime="406.444">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    When -- when you say 90% false, that was directed at what? 
    At the original grand jury testimony or at the affidavit?
speaker="daniel_j_sears" startTime="406.444" stopTime="441.444">
    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It was directed at the original grand jury testimony. 
    Now, that's one of our basic contentions in this case. 
    The October 21st proceeding in U.S. District Court was not alleged to be an ancillary proceeding in this inconsistent declarations prosecution. 
    And even though the appellate court affirmed the conviction by looking to that proceeding and indicating that Dunn by adopting that statement had somehow turned the September 30th proceeding into an ancillary proceeding, we submit that was outside the indictment and improper amendment or prejudicial variance from the indictment.

    I don't challenge that in the least regard. 
    The only thing I would question, Your Honor, is whether that proceeding -- whether a prosecution could be made out of that proceeding as well based upon our same objection that the immunized testimony could not be used. 
    But yes, it was a proceeding before the Court under 1623.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And as I remember the Solicitor General's brief, he agrees with you that they must establish that the September 30th affidavit was the proceeding in order to sustain that prosecution.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    That is correct.

    Yes.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Yes and that would be our position.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And the (Inaudible) does it in one way in contrast the way the Tenth Circuit did?
speaker="daniel_j_sears" startTime="587.707" stopTime="676.171">
    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    I believe that was part of our argument. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Your Honor, on December 15, 1976, Dunn was subsequently indicted on five counts of false declarations before a grand jury in violation of Section 1623. 
    Paragraph 1 of each count alleged that Dunn had made false declarations before the grand jury on June 16, 1976. 
    And in paragraph 4 of each respective count set out specific declarations relied upon. 
    Paragraph 5 of each count charged Dunn knowingly made declarations on September 30, 1976. 
    And then the sixth paragraph indicated that the declarations that have been made in September 30th proceeding in Canges' office and the June 16th proceeding were inconsistent to the degree that one of them was necessarily false. 
    Due to the confusion from the first paragraph, the charge that he had testified falsely before the grand jury on June 16th and the fourth and fifth paragraphs had indicated that he had testified falsely in the September 30th proceeding. 
    Defense moved for a Bill of Particulars to seek out the Government theory in which they relied to prove this case whether they were intending to use the September 30th statement as an admission that as declarations before the grand jury were false or conversely whether they were relying on the subsection (c) theory of inconsistent declarations. 
    In other words, submitting that the declaration were so inherently inconsistent that one of them have to be false.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="676.171" stopTime="680.698">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, isn't the Bill of Particulars to provide facts?

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Yes, Your Honor and --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="682.569" stopTime="691.188">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If the Government states facts in an indictment or an information which show that a crime has been committed, it doesn't have to tell you its legal theory, does it?
speaker="daniel_j_sears" startTime="691.188" stopTime="723.686">
    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    No, it doesn't have to state the legal theory, Your Honor, in so far as it need not further explain the indictment of the defense which the defense must meet. 
    My understanding of the Bill of Particulars has always been twofold. 
    The more adequately explain the charge and to protect against double jeopardy claim so that by considering the charge in the record, similar charge could not be made. 
    And I would submit that's exactly what we have in this case by looking not only the September 30th but October 21st for ancillariness.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Yes, we did. 
    Yet, not in the way of a form of Bill of Particulars but the Government did respond that it was going to rely on the 1623 (c) inconsistent declarations theory. 
    And that theory was submitted throughout the course of the case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="741.715" stopTime="744.169">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And that was the submission of the jury?
speaker="daniel_j_sears" startTime="744.169" stopTime="1045.723">
    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    That is correct and the Court so instructed the jury that the Government need not prove which of the declarations was false. 
    At trial, the September 30th transcription have Dunn statement which I'll refer to as the Canges' statement was introduced to the clerk of the District Court who testified that he have received as an exhibit on October 12, 1976 in the Musgrave case. 
    On cross-examination, the clerk was asked to identify the immunity order and application identify his defendant's exhibit F-1 and F-2 entered prior to Dunn's appearance and testimony before the grand jury. 
    The notary republic was then called to the stand and asked to identify the September 30th Kansas statement which had been rendered on September 30, 1976. 
    He indicated however on cross-examination that Dunn did not have counsel of his own choosing in the office of Musgrave's attorney. 
    He was not familiar with the criminal deposition procedures under 18 U.S.C. Section 3503, no court order had been obtained for the taking of this disposition, and there was no indication that Dunn would be unavailable for trial which we submit are necessary requirements for this document to qualify as deposition under 3503. 
    Upon the Government's office, the Kansas statement, the defense objected, it did not qualify his proceedings ancillary or before a U.S. Court of Grand Jury. 
    The Government next introduced Dunn's grand jury testimony through the Assistant United States Attorney who conducted the Musgrave grand jury investigation. 
    On cross-examination, however, the Assistant United States Attorney admitted that there was no independent evidence but for Dunn's recantations of September 30th and October 21st to disbelieve the grand jury testimony and that there was much evidence to corroborate the truth of it. 
    The defense objected to the use of the grand jury's testimony on the basis that was in violation of his immunity order. 
    Both of those objections were overruled and both exhibits were admitted into evidence. 
    Then the Government further offered the transcript of the October 21, 1976 evidentiary hearing in U.S. District Court. 
    The defense objected that these declarations were not outlined in the allegations of the indictment that it was beyond the proper scope of the indictment. 
    The Government did concede that prior to trial this evidence had not been submitted to the defense and was not intended as evidence in the case in chief. 
    His response was since we have cross-examined the Assistant U.S. Attorney as to the truthfulness of the grand jury testimony he wanted to offset that testimony by use of the subsequent reaffirmation to lend credence to the September 30th statement. 
    The Government rested then elected not to testify. 
    Defense then move for judgment of acquittal on two bases that the immunized grand jury testimony could not be used against him to establish the corpus delicti and in inconsistent declaration prosecution and that the Canges' statement was not an ancillary proceeding under Section 1623. 
    The trial court ruled that the Canges' statement if not originally ancillary “channels its way into being an ancillary proceeding” upon the confirmation in U.S. District Court on October 21st. 
    However, United States Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Dunn's position and said that the September 30th statement was not ancillary proceeding as the statute requires. 
    The Court however found that the October 21st proceeding was ancillary and affirmed the conviction on that basis even though that proceeding had not been set out in the indictment. 
    The Court found “it was a proceeding ancillary to the grand jury because of Dunn's subsequent affirmation and adoption of the earlier statement on October 21st. 
    In other words, look to the October 21st proceeding as an affirmation of the earlier September 30th proceeding. 
    The Court held that its admission, the October 21st statement into evidence was not a prejudicial variance because the defense would have contemplated. 
    Now, Your Honor, we submit that the -- since the indictment charge the June 16th and the September 30th statements as being proceedings either before or ancillary to U.S. Court or grand jury. 
    It set out the declarations in each of those two proceedings which were alleged to be consistent. 
    The only question for the jury was where the declarations in those two separate proceedings so inherently inconsistent that one of them had to be false. 
    We submit that the October 21st proceeding had no proper purpose in this hearing. 
    The Solicitor General argues that it could have all set any contention that the statements were a matter of mistake or inadvertence. 
    We submit that the only issue to the jury was whether the separate -- separately alleged declarations in the two separate proceedings charged in the indictment were so inherently inconsistent under --

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Your Honor, if I might address further response to his Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist questions with regard to whether or not defendant Dunn was prejudiced by the Government's action in this case. 
    I would submit that if the Court finds a constructive amendment to the indictment in this case under the reasoning of Stirone versus United States prejudiced need not be found. 
    However, if the Court feels that the proceedings in which the Government introduced evidence against Mr. Dunn particularly the October 21st proceedings were merely a variance in pleading and proof, then we submit that prejudice would have to be found under that reasoning. 
    Your Honor, with regard to this Stirone case I would submit that the prejudice against Dunn may be more grievous than Mr. Stirone realized in -- under the facts underlying that case, the Court recall in Stirone that the defendant was charged the Hobbs Act violation. 
    And the specific allegation in the indictment was the interstate commerce of particular portion of the allegation which concern shipping sand into the State of Pennsylvania to construct a steel plant. 
    However, trial the Government instead prove that steel was going to be shipped out of Pennsylvania and that was the interstate element of the jury you should look to. 
    And this Honorable Court in that particular proceeding found that while there was a variance in the sense of the variation between pleading and proof. 
    The variation here destroyed the defendant's substantial right to be tried only on those charges presented in an indictment returned by a grand jury. 
    For further stated deprivation of such a basic right is far too serious to be treated as nothing more than a variance and then dismiss this harmless error. 
    I would submit the Stirone case has been properly referred to as constructive amendment even though I would interpret the Court's language to proceed on a prejudicial variance basis. 
    Your Honor, the Tenth Circuit also determined aside from the ancillary issue that Dunn has immunized testimony could be used against him in an inconsistent declarations prosecution because his subsequent affirmation first of all is recantation in the September 30th proceeding in the subsequent affirmation in the October 20th proceeding contained the admission by him that his grand jury testimony was false and it was due to this possible conclusion that the defense on cross-examination of the Assistant United States Attorney at trial established that there was independent evidence to believe the truthfulness of the grand jury testimony. 
    Even though Dunn had subsequently recanted and that there was reasonably the subsequent recantations may in fact been false. 
    However, the theory throughout this case was inconsistent declarations and the Government never attempted to prove that his grand jury testimony was false under the 1623 --

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    That is correct, Your Honor and Your Honor the argument in the brief may be somewhat unclear. 
    We do not contend the false declarations under 1623 as not an exception to 6002. 
    We do argue, however, that the inconsistent declarations method of proof is precluded when part of the declarations relied upon are under an ordered immunity under 6002. 
    And the Government's method of proof inconsistent declarations in this case without proving that Dunn had violated his immunity order was accepted from use by the Government.

    Counsel, you -- you mentioned the Bane case, hasn't that case been primarily been notable for the fact that almost every court that has had to consider in last 10 to 15 years has distinguished it?

    I would call the Court's attention, however, to this Honorable Court's holdings in Kastigar and Murphy which I think are quite crucial to the consideration of the issues here and more recently in New Jersey versus Portash which was decided March 20th and that's that an individuals immunized testimony cannot be used against him in Portash for impeachment purposes it is compelled testimony and in Kastigar, deciding the extent of 6002 immunity the implication was there that it could not be used for any purpose, that the witness who had testified under immunity was insubstantially the same position if he had complained -- if he had --

    Yes, that's -- that's the issue and that really is the issue in the case but in terms of any past crime.

    Using his grand jury testimony to prove that he might have told the lie in the future, wouldn't it be?

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Your Honor, it didn't directly incriminate him but it certainly furnished derivative evidence which the Government relied upon him to subsequently convict him.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Well, Your Honor it really wasn't a future crime because it was testimony uttered in response to the ordered immunity. 
    The Government didn't prove that he lied in October 21st proceeding or even the September 21st proceeding. 
    It proves that he might say this before the grand jury --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let me ask you this. 
    Suppose -- suppose that the prosecution was that at this later -- in this later appearance in Court. 
    This later appearance in Court, suppose the prosecution was that he perjured himself there. 
    Suppose that was the charge. 
    It wasn't -- they didn't -- they didn't take the approach of an inconsistent statement. 
    But they were trying to prove that he perjured himself later. 
    Could they use his grand jury testimony then to -- as evidence to show that he later perjured himself?

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Yes. 
    But Your Honor, what I would submit to the Court is that when he was ordered to testify the Government in his application to the Court and the Court in its order upon that application promised that his testimony would not be used against him directly or indirectly and if criminal proceedings against him. 
    That is in essence what happened. 
    It was used directly more directly than the testimony was used against Portash. 
    This Court decided that it could not be used for impeachment purposes in the Portash case.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Your Honor, I submit that's were the Government is confusing transactional immunity and use immunity. 
    And I would -- I would submit that in the Kastigar ruling, if a witness testifies before grand jury to a certain subject matter and then later goes out and commits a crime which may pertain to that subject matter transactional immunity would protect him. 
    I would submit that would be a broader protection in the Fifth Amendment should offer him. 
    However, when the very testimony that is compelled from his lips is used to prove a crime against him as part of the corpus delicti of that crime, then we must examine whether that testimony falls within the exception to the immunity. 
    Unless he has violated his bargain with the Government and the court by testifying falsely or otherwise failing to comply with that order, failing to testify and committing contempt, then I submit that he must be protected by that immunity. 
    And I would submit the reasoning of that must be consistent with the Government's positions in several other cases that have come up one which is before the Court in which the Court has reasonably granted cert in Apfelbaum. 
    But more particularly in the Patrick and the Housand and Berardelli line of reasoning. 
    If the courts are going to continue to compel witnesses to testify under an order of immunity, on the promise that it will not be used against them in inconsistent declarations prosecution, regardless of whether there's prior to or subsequent to as long as it forms a part of the corpus delicti of an inconsistent prosecution. 
    You cannot subsequently use that testimony in convicting someone without establishing that he's violated his immunity bargain. 
    And we submit that it cannot be used against Mr. Dunn in this proceeding.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1741.288" stopTime="1746.500">

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Absolutely, and I submit that it is no broader by protecting Mr. Dunn from use of his very possibly and likely truthful testimony when he did compel when he did testify in compliance with court order.

    I don't even know that fellow." 
    But it turns out that in this grand jury testimony that we're talking about is where he was given immunity. 
    He can -- he in the course of his testimony was perfectly clear that he knew this fellow.And he had a lot of dealings with even the past.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    I would say the grand jury testimony could not be used against him but had he had transaction immunity it would have protected him but they -- the Government could establish by extrinsic evidence, the crime. 
    He's not protected from prosecution for the crime.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1828.518" stopTime="1838.922">

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    That's correct, Your Honor.

   Argument of Andrew L. Frey
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1859.429" stopTime="1861.764">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You may proceed.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="1861.764" stopTime="1949.753">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This is a case in which it is clear that the petitioner lied, either in his grand jury testimony or in his subsequent sworn recantation of that testimony. 
    This is also a case in which it is clear that the false swearing by the petitioner adversely affect that the administration of justice either by causing Mr. Musgrave to be wrongfully indicted of a felony or by forcing the Government to drop the felony charges against Mr. Musgrave although they were all well-founded. 
    Now, the question before this Court is whether petition is perjury palpable on its face from a comparison of the contradictory statements may be proved by placing those statements before the jury or whether the immunity granted in connection with the first of those statements preclude such a course of proof. 
    Now the case also involves an issue about whether the September 30th statement in Musgrave's lawyer's office was a proceeding ancillary to a court and if not whether that is fatal to the prosecution in this case. 
    I intend to rely on our brief on those points unless the Court has any questions and move on to the more important constitutional immunity point.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1949.753" stopTime="1961.570">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Do you concede that the -- that unless the what -- the transaction in the lawyer's office was ran by the statute and this conviction cannot stand.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="1961.570" stopTime="1999.545">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    We do. 
    But we say that it was proceeding ancillary to a court and I might point out in that connection that if the Court withhold that this kind of a proceeding which is essentially the preparation of an affidavit for submission to a court is not ancillary to a court. 
    It would have consequences beyond the rather unusual circumstances of this case because it would affect civil litigation where its common place to submit affidavits in connection with our opposition to summary judgment, motions and then the witness may get up at trial and after having forced the trial and give testimony that's completely contradictory --

    He conceded us with that as with a deposition.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Just one other point on that, Mr. Frey. 
    If instead of using the affidavit in the October 21st hearing, it merely put the man on the stand and had the affidavit there in order -- yes, you often do the witness had an affidavit would put you to get impeachment necessary. 
    Would you still say it was a proceeding?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2044.251" stopTime="2048.639">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I understand, would you still say the September 30th?

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Yes, we -- our position is that the September 30th proceeding at the -- when he made the statement then and there, that was a proceeding ancillary to a court.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2059.917" stopTime="2064.010">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    And you'd take the same position even if there have never been a proceeding on October 21st, yes.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2064.010" stopTime="2075.962">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    We would take that position but we have an alternative argument that if the Court is not satisfied with that that at least when the affidavit is in fact submitted to the Court, that it retroactively makes it --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2075.962" stopTime="2078.850">

    And he in effect takes his chances if he gives sworn testimony that he knows as for use in connection with the federal court case. 
    I don't think he can be heard to complain that later on it was submitted to the Court and he didn't expect it.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I would think your affidavit by itself contention is a good deal weaker than your deposition type of contention because of the word proceeding in the statute. 
    I think it's a common practice for people just to be handed affidavits and sure they're told they have to swear to him and there's a notary in the room but they may not read every word but that's not to say they may not -- the false statements may not be made punishable but it's kind of hard to envision the signing of an affidavit as a proceeding.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey

    I agree that it is not as formal as many proceedings ancillary to a court would be. 
    But I think that if the Court determines that it's not a proceeding ancillary to a court even though it was there after submitted to the Court, as I say it will create a significant gap in the covered 1623 which was designed to protect judicial proceedings basically and to give added protection that the perjury statute 1621 which covers all --

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey

speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2610.407" stopTime="2842.611">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    You would, yes. 
    Now turning to that issue, our position on the constitutionality of the use that we made of petitioner's immunized grand jury testimony in this case is the product that two propositions both of which we believe to be reasonably well-settled. 
    Now, the first proposition is that the immunity that must be granted to displace a valid claim of the privilege against self-incrimination has to be co-extensive with but need not be any broader than the scope of the privilege which was available to the witness at the time he invoked it. 
    In other words, when the Government seeks to make some use of compelled testimony against the witness who gave that testimony, the permissibility of making that use can be ascertained by asking yourself the question, could he have invoked the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination to refuse to answer to guard against this prospective use of his testimony? 
    Now, the second proposition on which we rests is that at the time petitioner was called to testify before the grand jury and invoked his privilege, he could not have validly invoked his privilege on the grounds that later on he might choose to give contradictory testimony and he did not want to create evidence now that could be used to show the falsity of subsequent non-immunized testimony. 
    Now, if those two propositions are accepted I think we win the case and I don't understand petitioner to contest the second of those that is that he could not have invoked the privilege solely on the ground of a possible future perjury. 
    He does stoutly maintain, however, that his immunity is sweeping regardless of the scope of his privilege at the time he acquired the immunity. 
    In other words, he says he invalidly invoked the privilege with regard to his drug dealings at the Colorado State Penitentiary, something that we don't dispute. 
    Consequently, he says the Government may not make any use of his immunized testimony but must leave him in the same position as if he had not been compelled to testify. 
    So the question before the Court is whether a valid claim of the privilege gives them immunity buff as to any criminal case used of immunized testimony. 
    Or as we argue, does it only provide immunity co-extensive with the privilege. 
    Now, the Court's prior decision looked our way on this issue. 
    Nearly 70 years ago, in Glickstein and in Heike, the Court stated the basic principle that is central to our constitutional analysis. 
    For instance in Glickstein, the Court said that the immunity of course is required to be complete. 
    That is to say, in all respects commensurate with the protection guaranteed by the constitutional limitation referring to the privilege against self-incrimination. 
    In Heike, the Court said that in order to avoid giving what it called a gratuity to crime, the immunity afforded under the statute that was there in question should be construed and I quote, “as co-terminus with what otherwise would have been the privilege of the person concerned.” 
    Now, this same theme of symmetry between the privilege and the immunity also underlie this Court's decisions in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission and in Kastigar. 
    I think that it is clear from those decisions that the Court has held that what the Constitution requires in the way of immunity is defined by the privilege that the witness has.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2842.611" stopTime="2846.304">

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I understand that but let me point out the fallacy in his position that he must be left in the same position as if he had not testified at all? 
    The first, --

    Refused to answer questions that are incriminating.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2900.849" stopTime="2908.014">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's not a privilege not to testify at all as I believe and understood it's a privilege not to compulsorily incriminate oneself.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2908.014" stopTime="2917.126">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I agree although as to the particular questions that were asked here, he had a right not to answer those questions because his answers would have been self-incriminatory.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2917.126" stopTime="2922.657">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well even in the trial courts, the privilege is not absolute to justify its assertion, is it?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2922.657" stopTime="2923.672">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That's true, it is not --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2923.672" stopTime="2928.011">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    It can be an inquiry by the Court to determine whether it's a validly assertion.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="2928.011" stopTime="3389.509">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    And the -- and the privilege exists only in the areas where he has exist only in the areas where he has a risk of current self-incrimination which of course is the point that we're saying here that he doesn't have. 
    Now, the fallacy and the notion that he should be in the same position as if he'd been allowed to remain silent is illustrated by the fact that he can prosecuted for perjury in making those statements. 
    He clearly is not in the same position as if he had remained silent and looking one step beyond that, why is it that he can be prosecuted for perjury? 
    Well, I think the reason why he can be prosecuted for perjury is that his privilege did not entitle him to commit perjury. 
    He couldn't invoke the privilege on the grounds that his statements might be false be used against him in perjury prosecution. 
    Now, we say the very same thing is true here. 
    He could not invoke his privilege on the guard against the use that we have made of his testimony in this case. 
    So therefore, I don't -- I don't think his argument is right. 
    Now, we also illustrate our point by looking at the situation with transactional immunity. 
    I think it was clear in Kastigar and the cases before Kastigar that transactional immunity satisfied the requirements of the privilege against self-incrimination. 
    If that statute no longer allows it but if petitioner had been given transaction immunity, as once was permitted, his statements could have been used against them to prove a subsequent perjury because the transactional immunity would have been with regard to the offenses about which he was being compelled to testify. 
    Now, his answer to this analysis is to invoke certain language in Kastigar and in Portash. 
    But we don't think that language was addressed to the problem that we have in this case at all. 
    The Court was not examining in that case the question of whether the immunity must exceed the scope of the privilege. 
    In both cases, what the Court was talking about was the uses that the witness would have been privileged to resist at the time testimony was compelled. 
    In Kastigar, the Court was concerned with whether use and derivative use immunity was sufficient to displace the privilege and in that respect the Court was comparing it with transaction immunity and the Court was saying that use and derivative use immunity since it protects use in any respect of his evidence is sufficient. 
    Clearly, they were focusing on use to prove the crime about which he was required to testify. 
    Now, Portash is exactly the same situation. 
    It's clear from the court's holding that Portash had a right to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination to guard against the use of compelled testimony to impeach and surely be prosecuted for the crimes about which he testified so that this case is completely different and you can't simply lift that language out of those cases and in effect, I think automatically are unthinkingly applied to this quite different situation. 
    Now, even if the Constitution permits the kind of use immunized testimony that was made in the present case, there does remain a question whether such use is brought by the immunity statute Section 6002. 
    Now, we of course contend that the statute does not bar this use. 
    Now at part, we rely on the explicit inclusion in the last clause of Section 6002 of false statement prosecutions. 
    But these are more fundamental point that shows that the statute is no bar to the kind of use made here so long as that use is constitutionally permissible. 
    This Court has construed immunity provisions like that in 6002 and a number of prior cases. 
    In Glickstein for instance, it was confronted with the statute which barred used of immunized testimony in any proceeding and it held that that statute that did not bar use in a perjury prosecution. 
    And in Bryan, the Court held that a statute which barred any use “except in a prosecution for perjury” did not bar use in a contempt case. 
    Now in both of those cases, the Court recognized that the kind of language that were dealing with the immunity statute here refers to use in connection with the prosecution for the offense that is disclosed by the testimony itself and not for future offenses such as contempt or perjury as to which the privilege was unavailable at the time of the compelled testimony. 
    Now, the Court in this case should analyze the proviso of the Section 6002 in precisely the same manner. 
    And if it does so, it will be giving to that statute the meaning that Congress intended. 
    The immunity statute was based on -- closely on the report of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws. 
    That Commission proposed that “the immunity conferred be confine to the scope required by the Fifth Amendment.” 
    And both the House and Senate Report stated explicitly, “this statutory immunity is intended to be as broad as but no broader than the privilege against self-incrimination.” 
    Now the last clause in Section 6002 which specifically list perjury false statement and the third clause which I think basically they had in mind, contempt cases was added not as a limitation on the use that could be made of immunized testimony but out of an abundance of caution to make sure that no court would prohibit as long as the constitutional allowed it but no court would prohibit the use in a perjury case or a false statement case or a contempt case. 
    Now, the same policy concerns that led the Court in Glickstein and in Bryan to refused to read limitation into the immunity statutes in those cases are also operative here. 
    In effect, what the Court said in Glickstein and in Bryan is Congress can't really have meant. 
    We can't believe that Congress meant to protect the defendant or the witness against a perjury or a contempt prosecution even though the Constitution doesn't require it because that would defeat in large part the purpose of giving him the immunity. 
    Now, the same is true in this case. 
    He is given the immunity. 
    He is compelled to testify and then he walks out of the grand jury and a couple of weeks later, he encounters the defendant who is now indicted and the defendant apparently by whatever means persuades him to recant his testimony. 
    The recantation has totally destroyed the value of the immunity that this witness was given. 
    It's -- it's undone the usefulness of the statutory scheme that Congress created. 
    And I think it would be very unfortunate and certainly not what Congress would have wanted if in the future when situations like this arise, an indicted defendant can say to a witness who gave immunized testimony, "Well, you can recant it, don't worry, look at Dunn against the United States. 
    They can't use your grand jury testimony to show that you're lying the second time around." 
    So in sum, we suggest that neither the Constitution nor the statute bars the use that we made of the immunize testimony in this case and accordingly the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3389.509" stopTime="3398.987">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You're really suggesting that the agreement on the immunity should be ignored for failure of consideration in effect.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3398.987" stopTime="3427.728">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, that is a secondary argument. 
    My first argument is that the agreement never encompassed the promise not to make the kind of use that the Government made in this case, that the Constitution doesn't require that kind of a promise and that it would be foolish for us as Justice White said in the concurrence in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission that it would be harmfully and wastefully broad construction of the immunity.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3427.728" stopTime="3438.791">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Wasn't -- wasn't this even more specifically said by my Brother Brennan in the Fried case in his --
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3438.791" stopTime="3527.938">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Yes, I think the Fried case of course is, it's a case on which we quite strongly rely on. 
    It's a case in which -- it didn't deal with immunity statute that was subject to the construction that there was a statutory bar to a particular use and I think that was what I was trying to address in answering the Chief Justice's question. 
    On the constitutional point, Fried has very strong support for us because of course in Fried there was a statute that gave only contemporaneous and past offense immunity and not future offense immunity and the Court unanimously held both the Court's opinion and Justice Brennan emphasized that he could not complain that his statement might be used against him in connection with the future offense. 
    So that is we've relied heavily on our brief in that point but there is an agreement here that the Constitution may allow the Government to do but the statute doesn't allow it. 
    And it's to that argument that I was addressing the Chief Justice's question and I was saying that first of all there was no bargain with him that we wouldn't make the kind of use that we made. 
    And secondly, I think the Chief Justice's right in suggesting that from a policy standpoint, he's robbed us of the -- of what we were entitled to. 
    Once he got that immunity, we were entitled to his truthful testimony and he's undone taken away the value of that by going out and giving sworn recantation of that testimony which destroyed the prosecution.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3527.938" stopTime="3542.615">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Mr. Frey, this is really an ancillary. 
    If I understand you correctly to the statutory argument based on the words or otherwise because you're in effect saying that by recanting he breaches the -- he violates the substance or just as much as if he have given false testimony in the first place.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3542.615" stopTime="3556.397">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I am saying that and it is (Voice Overlap) and obviously the problem only arises because the otherwise language is susceptible to a limiting construction.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if I may just have a few concluding remarks. 
    Your Honor, respondent's argument is preceded on the basis that if this Court rules that immunized testimony cannot be used in establishing the corpus delicti of an inconsistent declarations prosecution, that means anybody has a free license to commit perjury. 
    That is not what we're contending in this case. 
    We're merely contending that the Government is obliged once it offers immunity to prove that a man has perjured himself under testimony. 
    That was not established in this case. 
    To the contrary, the evidence in the record was that there was much to believe the truthfulness of Dunn's grand jury testimony under compulsion.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    No, Your Honor, that's not what we're asking. 
    We're asking that when there is reason to believe that the testimony is truthful under immunity that it not be subsequently use against him in a criminal proceeding which we submit is the very ruling of Kastigar.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And I hope so, it's just that the belief that he shall not recant.

    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Your Honor, I would submit that there would certainly be the hope.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, isn't that reason you put him under oath?

    Yes.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You don't want to cut that out, do you?
speaker="daniel_j_sears" startTime="3722.547" stopTime="3766.293">
    Mr. Daniel J. Sears 
    Your Honor, only if he recants in another ancillary proceeding. 
    But that is not what happened in this case. 
    And unless the Government is going to go that one additional step in providing extrinsic evidence to prove that one of his declarations was false under 1623, then no violation ensues. 
    And simply because he testifies inconsistently and it seems to me this is the proceeding on which Hockenberry and (Inaudible) and some of the other Third Circuit cases preceded which this Court need not accept. 
    But I think which was alluded to in the Portash ruling last week is that if he does testify truthfully, it should not be used against him for impeachment or in any criminal proceedings whatsoever and that's what we ask the Court to rule. 
    Thank you very much.
