    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This is a procedural due process case. 
    It arises from a Section 1983 class action challenge to the Massachusetts implied consent Highway Safety Law. 
    It comes to this Court on direct appeal from a decision of a three-judge District Court, holding that law unconstitutional on its face. 
    Implied consent laws enforced in all 50 states typically provide that a person arrested upon a charge of drunken driving must submit to a chemical or breath analysis test or else accept a temporary license suspension for his refusal of that test. 
    The general question presented today is whether the states must provide a driver with the hearing at which he can dispute the fact of his refusal prior to the suspension of his license. 
    After describing the operation of the Massachusetts law and the particular facts, --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="238.137" stopTime="241.717">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="244.530" stopTime="254.415">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It was my understanding from the record though I realize I may be wrong but the appellee in this case had actually requested the test himself.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="254.415" stopTime="262.522">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    He requested it subsequent to refusing it upon his arrival initially, at the station.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    That's correct, 52 minutes after the accident, 22 minutes after the arrival at the station. 
    The police did refuse it. 
    His attorney at the interim had arrived at the station and had consulted with a driver and apparently there was a change of mind.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    How much do you lose in 22 minutes making the effectiveness of the test?

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    It's hard to say, Your Honor. 
    Some states have suggested that 30 minutes is reasonable block of time from the arrival at the station house. 
    However, since that would vary according to the time that is taken to get to the station house from the scene of the accident, it's very difficult to say at least with any scientific knowledge what time spent renders the test ineffective or inaccurate.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="317.973" stopTime="330.519">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So what about any time spent from the time of the accident? 
    How soon would -- from the time of the accident must be taken to be effective? 
    Do you know?

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    I don't, Your Honor.

    I see.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="331.685" stopTime="339.151">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    I don't. 
    In this case it was as we've said, 52 minutes from the approximate time of the accident.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="339.151" stopTime="343.717">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In the second time, the State refuse to give him the test, is that right?

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    That's correct.

    Why?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="348.694" stopTime="362.386">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    The police officers apparently made a judgment that the time spent now between the moment of arrest and the moment of request had become too long for an accurate reading. 
    That at least was their subjective judgment.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="362.386" stopTime="369.916">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I thought my Brother Blackmun's question was as to how long is it before reading would not be any good?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="369.916" stopTime="386.073">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    I don't think we can say with any scientific objectivity to the Court that are with any information from the record that we know of a precise time. 
    It does appear that the police in this case in their judgment made a judgment call that 52 minutes was too long.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="386.073" stopTime="394.831">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So that the final judgment in this case were 52 minutes after the Government said, "We will give you the test."
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="394.831" stopTime="398.237">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    52 minutes after the accident, the police refused the test.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="398.237" stopTime="402.136">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    If he refused a test and as a result of that he lost his life.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="402.136" stopTime="408.915">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    They had originally offered it 30 minutes after the test and he refused.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="408.915" stopTime="416.474">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Does the record tell us whether the police will delay long enough to let the driver call an attorney and ask for advice?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="416.474" stopTime="431.834">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    The record does not, Your Honor. 
    I would think again that there's any irreducible amount of police discretion if an attorney arrives soon after an individual came to the station, chances might be better.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="431.834" stopTime="458.882">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, would it be a refusal for example for driver to say, "I'd like to call my lawyer before I take the test," then say maybe take 25 minutes talking with lawyer on the phone then come back and say, "Yes I'll take it" and could the police officer then say, "It's too late now, you've already refused? 
    What, what -- w ould that be refusal or not? 
    In -- I would say that that hypothetical would not be a refusal. 
    It would not be refusal. 
    I think it would be an accommodation.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="458.882" stopTime="461.245">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Pretty much what happened here, isn't it?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="461.245" stopTime="464.492">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    No, he outright refused the test at first.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="464.492" stopTime="469.062">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    If he just say, well, I don't want to do it till I talk to my lawyer, and it takes 25 minutes to get the legal advice.

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    I see. 
    I -- I think the key factor is always going to be the length of time between the accidents.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="476.147" stopTime="481.216">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So that if it takes 25 minutes to get legal advice that's a refusal? 
    I would think so.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="481.216" stopTime="494.156">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is it possible that it is a medical matter or scientific matter that it might make a difference not only in the lapse of time but rather even to have a plaintiff Bourbon or a quarter Bourbon or only two ounces of Bourbon?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="494.156" stopTime="494.240">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    I would --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="494.240" stopTime="505.579">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Two ounces reasonably might, the manifestations of two ounces might disappear from the bloodstream much more quickly than a plaintiff would?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="505.579" stopTime="534.531">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    My instinct is just to agree with that assessment, Your Honor. 
    And perhaps if that is one more good reason for a drawing heart and bright lines in this situation and perhaps having time limits, I must concede that the police here were operating without hard time limits and that they made a subjective judgment about the driver's condition in refusing the test when he requested after 52 minutes from the accident --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="534.531" stopTime="539.369">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is there anything that record where the police explained this?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="539.369" stopTime="540.542">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    There is --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="540.542" stopTime="544.290">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    He is not given the second time, isn't he? 
    Nothing in the record on that, I mean I couldn't find it?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="544.290" stopTime="787.469">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    And that bings me perhaps to one of the pervasive features of this case. 
    The case would be a very respectable as applied challenge to the statute because these facts showed that at least the administration of the status was not efficient. 
    However, the plaintiff has chosen and has actually forgone opportunities to present as applied argument and has chosen to attack the statute on its face saying that in all situations, the statute is unconstitutional. 
    The performance of the police and the Registrar here is not typical we submit. 
    The parties have washed out in a statement of agreed facts, many of the particular equities of the case and have decided to focus on the major issue of whether hearing must invariably be prior rather than subsequent. 
    After describing the operation of the Massachusetts law in the particular facts of this case, we argue that the statute does satisfy due process under the Court's three measurements for prior hearing. 
    Those are the value of the private interest taken by the Government, here a driver's license, the risk of the mistaken taking of the interests without a prior hearing, and the public purpose for which the Government is acting. 
    The Massachusetts law requires a police officer arresting a person for driving under the influence to offer that person a chemical breath -- chemical or breath analysis test. 
    The officer must inform the driver that the refusal of the test will result in a 90-day license suspension. 
    If the driver still refuses the test, the officer must immediately prepare a written report of refusal. 
    This is possibly not a factor in the police reluctance to give the driver second chance if they do immediately perform their paperwork. 
    They must at least throw it away or backup and do the paper work again. 
    The police officer receiving the refusal must sign it under the penalties of perjury and he must forward it to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles immediately. 
    In turn, the Registrar must impose the 90-day suspension by an immediate notice directing the driver to surrender his license at a local registry office. 
    There is no discretion left in the joints of the statute. 
    Each of these requirements is mandatory. 
    At the time of the surrender, the driver can request an immediate hearing to dispute his refusal of the test. 
    That hearing will begin on the same day as surrender if at all possible. 
    In this particular case, Donald Montrym's car collided with a motorcycle. 
    About 15 minutes after the accident, the police arrived, arrested him, charged him among other offenses with driving while intoxicated and they accompanied him to the station house and at this point, we have the initial refusal an officer executed the report of refusal. 
    Montrym claims that his refusal was not informed. 
    He says that he was not informed of the suspension penalty and refused on that ground. 
    The remaining facts are undisputed that the police did execute the report that the Registrar suspended Montrym, but subsequently a state trial court dismissed the drunken-driving charge on the ground that the police had refused his subsequent request. 
    Montrym's attorney informed the main office of the Registrar of the court result. 
    The Registrar answered that the license had already been suspended and must be surrendered. 
    Montrym did surrender the license but for some reason did not request a surrender day hearing. 
    Instead he took an administrative appeal from the suspension but before the completion of the administrative process filed the present class action.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="787.469" stopTime="790.602">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what sort of administrative appeal did he take?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="790.602" stopTime="814.894">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    Within 10 days from any action of the Registrar, a driver may appeal for a de novo evidentiary hearing before a board of appeal presiding over the Registrar's actions, that board in turn will schedule a hearing. 
    And here, Montrym would have had a hearing several weeks into his suspension, one was scheduled when he brought this out.

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    Conceptually, the license is suspended at the time the Registrar signs the notice of suspension and puts it in the mail.

    Yes, there was driving under the influence -- driving to endanger and driving without a license.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1074.104" stopTime="1091.384">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well, we just follow this up for a moment. 
    What you're telling me correctly reflects the state practice. 
    It means that a driver has a right when he comes to the station to refuse, wait 20 minutes and say, now I'd like to take the exculpatory test. 
    If they don't give it to him, he has a right, they can't suspend his license.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1091.384" stopTime="1092.200">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    Well, --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1092.200" stopTime="1094.733">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    That's what you're telling me. 
    It's the custom as I understand it.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1094.733" stopTime="1100.500">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    The custom, -- the custom, I think Your Honor, is that if a judge decides in the circumstances that a driver has been denied --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1100.500" stopTime="1104.286">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well, but he presumably is interpreting the law of your statement is so deciding.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1104.286" stopTime="1120.573">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    Well, we don't have -- we don't have an absolute time spent incorporated into a statute so that there is discretion deciding in the trial judge's judgment. 
    The trial judge here was he had evidence about this incident and decided that the individual --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1120.573" stopTime="1140.776">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Are you telling me that as a matter of Massachusetts law on this record, there was no refusal and that's why the statute is unconstitutional as applied in this case? 
    There was no refusal because there is a subsequent request for an exculpatory test if the police denied would vitiate it -- vitiated the initial refusal. 
    So on this record there would not be a refusal as a matter of Massachusetts law.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1140.776" stopTime="1147.170">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    Well, I hesitate to say as a matter of Massachusetts law, as a matter of the trial judge's application.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

    But it's your position that's all that's all before us, that's your position?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1332.891" stopTime="1481.527">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    The parties on the District Court have analyzed this case under the three prior hearing criteria announced in Mathews versus Eldridge and applied in Dixon versus Love. 
    The first factor is the magnitude of the private interest. 
    Since Bell versus Burson, it has been settled that a person's interests and a driver's license requires some kind of hearing for its deprivation. 
    However, the timing and the thoroughness of the hearing can vary according to the risk of error and the strength of the public purpose served by a license suspension. 
    In Dixon, the Court concluded that the license interests was not so great as to require as to depart from the ordinary principal established by our decisions that something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to an adverse administrative action. 
    The Court went on to weigh the chance of error and the public safety interests served by the Illinois habitual offender law and decided that a subsequent hearing typically one more than 20 days after suspension was constitutionally sufficient for the usual driver in Illinois. 
    By contrast, the Massachusetts system affords a hearing opportunity often able to begin on the same day as the license surrender. 
    Even if one takes a pessimistic view of the driver's brief that a complete hearing opportunity will consume 7 to 10 days of the suspension time, that figure is drastically less than the post-suspension time spent permitted in Dixon. 
    The second factor, in the court's decisions has been the risk of an erroneous license suspension. 
    The Massachusetts statute builds in a number of safeguards against this possibility. 
    An officer must offer the test and inform the driver of the 90-day suspension for its refusal in the presence of a witness. 
    Upon refusal, he must immediately execute under penalties of perjury the report of refusal which must in turn set out probable cause for the original arrest, the fact of the arrest and the driver's refusal of the test. 
    In addition, the witnessing officer and the superior officer to whom he is accountable must endorse the report before it's transmission to the Registrar.

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    There were four symptoms, Your Honor. 
    There was the odor of alcohol, glassy eyes, slurred speech, and one in particular, the final one was that his footing was so shaky that he had to hold on to a street sign to maintain his balance.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1509.685" stopTime="1516.999">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    That's correct.

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    The driver has criticized the report of refusal as a mechanical checklist but in particular this narrative description of the grounds constituting probable cause we think are against the kind of one-sided form of affidavit. 
    That would be suspect and of course it's again ties into an effort to prevent an erroneous taking.

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    But he can't get witnesses if it is going to take any time. 
    The surrender hearing does permit him to be represented by counsel to introduce evidence on any of the issues concerning refusal and to cross-examine witnesses. 
    Furthermore, the surrender hearing will be continued if he requested to be continued.

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    In the meantime. 
    Now, my brother criticizes the surrender hearing because it is by nature a post suspension hearing. 
    But he concedes that typically, and I believe he looks at the statute most pessimistically than typically, it is a 7 to 10-day process. 
    And we submit that if you compare this time spent with the time spent in Dixon versus Love which was at 20 days, it compares very favorably.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1777.251" stopTime="1784.186">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Of course the difference is in Dixon against Love, you'd already had your judicial determination that may have violated the loss over time?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1784.186" stopTime="1822.366">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    That is -- that is the main distinction of Dixon versus Love. 
    We think it's mitigated by at least three factors. 
    First, the relative speed and thoroughness of the surrender hearing we think that it comes usually more quickly than 7 to 10 days. 
    Secondly, we have the same kind of public safety purpose at work in this case as we did in Dixon versus Love. 
    And finally, the magnitude of the deprivation again is 7 to 10-day deprivation as against a 20 or more deprivation in Dixon versus Love.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1822.366" stopTime="1827.650">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Does the statute require to be completed in 7 to 10 days? 
    I don't find the statutory description on the same day hearing.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1827.650" stopTime="1842.214">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    It -- it does not, Your Honor. 
    The statute simply requires that there be a hearing. 
    It's stipulated by the parties that therein administering the statute the Registrar has set up this same day process.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1842.214" stopTime="1848.039">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    And the 7 to 10 days results from the fact that sometimes there's a lot time for the police officer to come in to tell the other side of the story.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1848.039" stopTime="1886.391">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    This -- the surrender hearing is particularly suited to correct obvious mistakes and we submit that this case was a paradigm example of an obvious mistake. 
    It is going to take a few extra days if there are serious issues about probable cause and police must be cross-examined. 
    But the process, the 7 to 10-day process, is practically an adjudicatory process and evidentiary process. 
    It is not simply an opportunity for the driver to tell his side of the story or ask for a break.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1886.391" stopTime="1912.422">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Can I ask you, rather basically. 
    What -- how would the state interest suffer if instead of this procedure is said, it made a rule to show cause so that you show up in five days or six days, whatever the hearing officer offers and unless you have good cause for saying there was no refusal or probable cause of your license to be suspended. 
    And then you have the same, everything else exactly the same. 
    How would the state interest suffer if you do it that way?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1912.422" stopTime="1930.885">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    We think that very few people would take the test and that everyone would seek the hearing when the statute was enforced approximately one out of three people arrested for drunken driving still resisted the test and we think that that presented to us --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1930.885" stopTime="1937.552">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Why -- do you mean they would refuse the test because of the fact they are going to keep the license for five days instead of having suspended forthwith?
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1937.552" stopTime="1957.062">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    No, I think there is a reflexive reaction to the inculpatory nature of the test. 
    If someone is marginally intoxicated and confronts the Breathalyzer, I think there is a reflexive resistance to it and hope that in some way with an intervening hearing they would be able to worn off any kind of suspension.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1957.062" stopTime="1964.274">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well, but you say that you've given that hope now. 
    You're given a hearing except that the only difference is that it's going to be suspended definitely for at least three or four days.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1964.274" stopTime="1966.003">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    That's right.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1966.003" stopTime="1979.086">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    But why wouldn't it be equally definite as far as the 90-day suspension? 
    If you just say well, we won't have the suspension to take effect until it's the same day hearing. 
    And most people I suppose don't have any real answer if they refuse a review.
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="1979.086" stopTime="1982.847">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    I think it's the immediacy and the certainty of the suspension.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1982.847" stopTime="1984.659">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Immediately in three days later?

    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    Well, hopefully three days later. 
    But I think the typical driver is going to feel that if he can avoid the test for the time being and it's incriminating evidence, and come up with some kind of help before he shows up for a hearing, he will somehow be able to avoid the drunken-driving charge.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2004.305" stopTime="2007.873">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Maybe -- the hearing officer may be more lenient to the police officer --
speaker="mitchell_j_sikora_jr" startTime="2007.873" stopTime="2016.225">
    Mr. Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr. 
    Possibly, but it's the immediacy, it's the fact that you are suspended immediately that we think is crucial.

    Mr. Hagopian, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="2044.733" stopTime="2095.125">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Good afternoon, Your Honor, may it please the Court. 
    I would like initially to straighten out some of the facts in this case before proceeding to my argument. 
    First of all, Mr. Montrym was stopped at 8:30 a.m. on the evening in question and he was brought to the police station at 8:45 at that time he refused the Breathalyzer. 
    His attorney showed up 5 or 10 minutes later and at 9:05, he alleges in his affidavit that he wanted to take the Breathalyzer test which was at the most 35 minutes from the time of the accident and approximately 20 minutes from his initial refusal. 
    Now, --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2095.125" stopTime="2099.527">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I calculated on the record, it is precisely 30 minutes but it doesn't make all that difference.
speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="2099.527" stopTime="2134.856">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But there was some talk about 52 minutes here when my brother was up here this morning and I want to clarify. 
    That clearly is out of question from the time of the accident not the time when he was first asked about the Breathalyzer test. 
    There are statutes and other jurisdictions that hold up to 30 minutes from the time that the person has read his rights and clearly, Montrym was within that because at least according to the findings of fact by the District Court judge. 
    That's the first point that I wanted to clarify.

    I mean it's conceivable to statute.

    Where did you reserve it?
speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="2157.972" stopTime="2206.192">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Well, when we brought our original motion for summary judgment, I believe we asked the Court to examine both questions the issue of constitutionality on its face because it was a class action and as applied to Mr. Montrym. 
    There was a case last term that was handed down by this Court that held, if the man doesn't at least colorably assert a claim of innocence, the fact that is procedural due process rights have violated is not an independent claim. 
    That was a per curiam opinion and I don't know what the implications are of that opinion but we want to clearly assert that Mr. Montrym was innocent. 
    He is asserting the claim of innocence here in this particular case. 
    He was an innocent man and that's what the due process clauses point.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2206.192" stopTime="2214.965">

    He initially refused.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2225.932" stopTime="2232.387">

    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian

    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Well, I think you have to decide as applied here. 
    Well, it's a motion for summary judgment so the worst that -- I mean conceivably you could say that the District Court made it a mistake on the issue of granting summary judgment and send it back that would not preclude Mr. Montrym from either going forward to trial even as unconstitutional as applied to him.

    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Right. 
    But I don't think Montrym's case, the District Court held in the findings of fact that Montrym's case was just a typical of the class and my brother's have not taken any appeal from that that order of the certifying the class action when they don't seem to challenge the fact that the District Court judge held that Montrym's case was typical of the class.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Now, I take it at the time you filed this action of the District Court, Montrym had already had an opportunity to have a hearing.
speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="2620.652" stopTime="2623.100">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian

    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Yes, yes that's correct.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Then how can this be a class in this action?
speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="2634.891" stopTime="2760.373">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Well, Your Honor, if the point is -- let me see if I can point to you. 
    Let me see if I can explain to you. 
    Let -- let me just give you just briefly two minutes of procedure so you can understand what the problem is here. 
    When the police officer takes its report, he sends it to the Registrar. 
    The Registrar automatically revokes his license and that's what happened to Montrym's case. 
    Montrym surrendered his license but he did not -- but he insisted that he always maintained that the Registrar could not -- that that suspension was illegal because of the fact that he was not granted a hearing prior. 
    And that's what the class constitutes. 
    All those people who the Registrar sends a notice to, suspends their license without giving him that hearing first. 
    And that's the central issue in this case. 
    He insists upon that hearing first. 
    As it turned out Your Honors, the Registrar was well-informed of the facts in this case. 
    The attorney that represented Mr. Montrym in the District Court, Mr. Harris who is here with me today, he sent the Registrar before the Registrar have sent the notice to Montrym as a copy of the District Court judgment and he said Mr. Montrym never refused to take the Breathalyzer. 
    Here's the finding of fact from the District Court when the District Court in Massachusetts criminal court has ruled that Montrym did not refuse to take the Breathalyzer test. 
    You should not take his license and I'm sending you this letter to avert his license revocation and the Registrar just totally ignored that. 
    And he says, as far as I'm concerned, I have no discretion under the statute, when I get this notice from the police department that's as Montrym refuses, as far as I'm concerned, I suspend the license and that's it. 
    I don't -- I'm not interested in anything else. 
    You want to come in and talk to me afterwards, I'll be very happy to talk to you about it. 
    This is so happens even after he suspended the license. 
    I sent him a demand and demanded the return of that license and sent him the District Court and I explained to him about the Breathalyzer so he well knew the facts even after that stage but he refused to return that license.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2760.373" stopTime="2760.431">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You also appealed --
speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="2760.431" stopTime="2766.529">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    The only time he returned to this when the United States District Court ordered him to and then it took him seven days to return after the date of the order.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2766.529" stopTime="2770.076">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You also appealed from the Registrar to the state administrative?
speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="2770.076" stopTime="2788.347">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    That was, -- that was -- that's right. 
    That was on the initial decision to suspend his license that was on appeal taken but it would take 30 days before we could even get a hearing and we worked around the clock to even get that which would mean that one-third of the 90 days suspension period would be completely expired before he could even get a hearing on that issue.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2788.347" stopTime="2793.585">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But why didn't you file your action in district court before you filed your notice of appeal to the state of administrative agency?

    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Yes, I understand that Your Honor but the going through the Board of Appeals was an exercise in futility. 
    On the initial decision, they have no discretion, they probably who have upheld the Registrar anyway because that's what the statute says whether they have the power to determine the constitutional challenge of that stage of the game is not clear on Massachusetts law.

    The statute says if the motorist refuses to take the Breathalyzer test and if he has been validly arrested if there was probable cause for his arrest and if in fact he refused to take the Breathalyzer, he must prove all three elements and they are complicated elements, Your Honor.

speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="2986.823" stopTime="3113.875">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    He sent and it's stipulated in the agreed statement of facts, Your Honor that the record in the District Court proceedings was sent to the Registrar before he revoked Mr. Montrym's license and the Registrar totally ignored it and in fact he wrote back -- well, Mr. Harris sent him a copy of the District Court record. 
    He wrote Mr. Harris back five days after he in fact had revoked Mr. Montrym's license and that letter is on page 46 of the -- 48, page 48 of the appendix in reference to a letter of June 2nd concerning the above-named, this is to advise you that his license has already been suspended and said license must be returned to this office immediately. 
    Registrar's position is quite clear, Your Honor, in this case that when he gets that letter from the police department saying that a motorist has refused to take the Breathalyzer, he has absolutely no discretion but to revoke the license upon receipt of that letter and that is the issue, the District Court's findings not binding upon the Registrar. 
    The District Court may have dismissed this case for number of reasons. 
    He happens to make those specifics findings of facts. 
    He may construe the statute different in the Registrar. 
    There's no Massachusetts case law on this particular issue. 
    He may construe the statute differently. 
    He may disagree with the District Court judge. 
    I don't know whether the District Court judge was right or whether in this case. 
    Now, I would like to point out to you, Your Honor, that this morning the notice of revocation that was sent to Mr. Montrym which was standard form by the Registrar says you must cease operating your motor vehicle immediately. 
    There's nothing in that notice which is in the appendix that advises the motorist that he has a right to an immediate hearing. 
    And I do concede as in the agreed statement that he can as a practical manner walk in the Registry and get an immediate hearing. 
    But he's not notified of that in the notice that goes out to the motorist and the copy of that notice is on page 44-45.

    Well, let me say in general Your Honor, the criminal proceedings do not come before the registry action. 
    This is an unusual case in that sense. 
    Usually, the criminal proceedings come after the registry revokes so this is a rare case to have a criminal proceeding before the Registrar takes his action.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Hagopian, let me ask the question. 
    Would you challenge the constitutionality of the statute if it worked in this way? 
    If the police sent a notice and simultaneously send it to the person arrested and also to the Registrar which said in substance in such and such a date, your license will be revoked, you may appear at that time to object if you with to it, if you don't you'd be automatically revoked. 
    Would you have any objection to that statute?
speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="3466.713" stopTime="3468.440">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    No, in fact that's a procedure that you can --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3468.440" stopTime="3482.511">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    All you're really talking about is the suspension that the fact that there's an automatic suspension for the interval of time between the notice to the magistrate and the time he can go in and demand hearing. 
    Do you say that would be alright if it was a notice of what they're proposed to do rather than the facts that was accorded?
speaker="robert_w_hagopian" startTime="3482.511" stopTime="3502.658">
    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    That's correct and that procedure is inexistence in Massachusetts by the registry in several other statutes. 
    And I pointed that out in my brief. 
    He sends a 14-day notice and he says I intend to revoke your license in 14 days and if you object to it, you can come in and have a hearing before the 14 days. 
    And that procedure is used in thousands of cases.

    Justice Byron R. White

    I don't take that position, Your Honor.

    Suppose you have all the hearings that you wanted before the suspension, do you suppose that? 
    And the Registrar says now you got all the hearing you want and you say yes to all the hearing, I now find there is probable cause to suspend your license.

    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    That's correct, Your Honor.

    No, because there's three other issues under the statutes before the registry can revoke. 
    He must show that there was probable cause for the initial arrest.

    That's -- that's correct Your Honor. 
    But that's not the issue. 
    The issue is, is there any immediate reason to take to impose that 90-day sanction.

    Well, the Massachusetts by enacting this legislation said there yes, there is. 
    Or else it would not have acted the legislation.

    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Well, I submit to you, Your Honor that they have enacted it because they feel that instant punishment. 
    The metering out of instant punishment --

    Suspension of license --

    Precisely, because they thought there was a need for it. 
    Presumably, they would have enacted the law.

    Mr. Robert W. Hagopian 
    Yes.

    That's what Judge Campbell said, wasn't it that purpose was to deter people from refusing to take the Breathalyzer.

    And I think that's important to our system of justice. 
    And it always has been. 
    I've never known why don't we do away with trials and we can insist, say we'll put you in jail before we give you a trial and you can stay in there and then you can have your trial.

    Maybe you should.

    I don't think that deters crime.

    Maybe we should do away with oral argument. 
    Thank you gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
