speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="22.142" stopTime="112.764">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    My name is Sana Shtasel appearing for the petitioner in the case this morning. 
    The case before you today arises on writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    The basic question is whether a cause of action from money damages may be implied under the Fifth Amendment to redress sex discrimination in federal employment. 
    If that question is answered in the affirmative, this Court then must determine whether respondent is nonetheless absolutely immune from suit by virtue of the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution. 
    The facts of this case are simple and stark. 
    Petitioner was employed by respondent then a United States Congressman for a six-month period in 1974. 
    Despite the fact that petitioner was an able, energetic, and extremely capable secretary as attested to by the respondent in his letter of dismissal, which appears in the appendix in this case at pages 6 and 7, respondent dismissed petitioner solely, explicitly, and expressly because he wanted a man rather than a woman to fill that position.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Do you mean as secretary that's the way he described her?
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="118.052" stopTime="154.949">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    The title of the petition -- of the position Mr. Justice Blackmun was deputy administrative assistant but it is the functions of the job that are in question here and no one has ever contended that the petitioner did anything other than secretarial functions. 
    That is exactly how her job was described in the letter terminating her employment which is the only thing we have on the record in this case. 
    Petitioner therefore brought suit allegedly --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="154.949" stopTime="165.290">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Do you think it would make a difference if her task were secretarial exclusively or administrative assistant at least impart?
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="165.290" stopTime="226.164">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    It might make a difference Mr. Justice when we get to the question of the operation of the Speech or Debate Clause. 
    It should not make a difference as to whether the petitioner has a cause of action under the Fifth Amendment. 
    Whether however, her job functions would be so integral to the congressmen's legislative functions that the employment relationship should nonetheless be covered with absolute immunity is a question which must be addressed there. 
    Our position however is that there is no way that the Speech or Debate Clause can apply to the -- to a low level non-policymaking clerical employee. 
    I might say that this case arises on a 12 (b) (6) motion to dismiss so that our contentions here for the -- in the procedural posture of this case must be taken to be the ones applicable.

    It sounds like it Your Honor but one when consults the report of the clerk of the house for that period in time, it's quite clear that some 75 other representatives had secretaries, personal secretaries, executive secretaries, all making that kind of salary and indeed there are other cases where members employed persons called secretaries who made more than the administrative assistant that they also employ.

    In some cases they level it off and divide the work among several people and another cases they have a very high salary of secretary, is that --
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="300.943" stopTime="310.499">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    My understanding is that they are allotted a maximum of 18 slots which can be filled at their discretion and with salaries at their discretion.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="310.499" stopTime="319.398">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, they're not allotted 18 positions and X thousands of dollars and they may spread the salaries as they wish, is that not?
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="319.398" stopTime="487.704">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    That is correct. 
    Petitioner, following her termination, brought suit a legend that she had been a victim of sex discrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment premising jurisdiction upon 28 U.S.C. Section 1331 (a). 
    The District Court dismissed this case holding that plaintiff had no private cause of action. 
    A panel of the Fifth Circuit of Appeals reversed on that issue and then proceeded to canvass all the related constitutional issues. 
    It held as had the District Court that no immunity doctrine would bar the suit. 
    Rehearing en banc was held to assess whether the doctrines of legislative immunity and political question which I might add had been raised for the first time by the panel were applicable to this case. 
    The en banc court however did not decide that question, rather it decided an issue that had not been briefed before the panel had been conceded by respondent at the panel and had neither been raised by the respondent on rehearing nor briefed by him in that proceeding. 
    The Court held that an implied cause of action does not arise under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and accordingly that petitioner should have no remedy whatever to vindicate her fundamental constitutional rights. 
    The validity of that decision is the first question for this Court's determination today. 
    For the reason stated in our briefs to this Court, this case is controlled by Bivens against Six Unknown named agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. 
    In Bivens, this Court held first that the petitioner had a private cause of action for damages arising directly under the Fourth Amendment. 
    Second, that the federal right was independent from any state right that might be implicated, and third that money damages were remedial mechanism normally available in the federal courts. 
    In the seven-and-half years since Bivens was decided, nine courts of appeals and countless district courts have applied Bivens to constitutional amendments other than the Fourth and to federal officials other than narcotics agents.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="487.704" stopTime="500.907">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Counsel, some of us were in dissent in Bivens and do you think that blocks us in and makes us necessarily unsympathetic to your posture here?
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="500.907" stopTime="540.382">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun, I'd be delighted if the dissents Bivens were persuaded by the cause of action should be applied under the facts of this case. 
    I think that the rational of the Bivens' majority and the rational of the courts that have applied Bivens in the succeeding years is sufficient to suggest that we can apply a cause of action under Bivens here. 
    Indeed as well, there are other factors in this case which make it perhaps a stronger case than Bivens for the implication of a cause of action from money damages under the Constitution.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="540.382" stopTime="551.358">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    You know, we do try to be individually consistent and what I'm asking is, is there any escape for those of us who were in dissent in Bivens?
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="551.358" stopTime="615.342">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    I would suggest one Mr. Justice Blackmun. 
    One of the concerns was that Congress had not expressly spoken on the question in the Fourth Amendment case. 
    In this case, Congress has a formatively declared in 5 U.S.C. 7151 that employees of members of Congress are not to be discriminated against. 
    Accordingly to the extent that this Court needs to look or wants to look the congressional declaration in the area is a path. 
    As a second possibility, Mr. Justice, there were some concern in by the Bivens' dissenters that the federal courts would be subjected to an avalanche of cases. 
    Indeed, there have been almost eight years of federal litigation in this area and known for it other than the en banc for prolong has suggested that there's a problem of judicial and manageability in this area.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="615.342" stopTime="628.142">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Yes, but you just made reference to a number of cases in this area whether the courts had gone in your favor. 
    So, there is some litigation.
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="628.142" stopTime="631.973">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    There's extensive litigation in the area.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="631.973" stopTime="670.581">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Doesn't some of your answer to Mr. Justice Blackmun cut the other way in the sense that although the statute is on the books the general kind of hortatory statute, Congress is quite carefully considered whether it wanted to make its members subject to say Title VI, the way the Executive Branch members are or whether it wanted to subject its members to any particular strictures in their hiring and firing and they simply have not done it. 
    They've considered it and rejected it.
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="670.581" stopTime="714.788">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    Our argument Mr. Chief Justice -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, pardon me, is that Congress cannot mandate no remedy for violations of constitutional rights and indeed in this case it is never suggested that there should be no juridical remedy for this kind of violation. 
    Indeed, it has not brought congressional employees under the ambit of Title VII and it could certainly enact legislation which would so provide and indeed even protect its own members from the possibility of personal liability which has been done in other context.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="714.788" stopTime="725.748">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, that proposition may be entirely some but it doesn't seem to me that it's really makes your case a stronger one than Bivens as you suggested to Mr. Justice Blackmun.
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="725.748" stopTime="864.447">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    In Bivens, there was no congressional policy stated in the area. 
    In this one, in this case, at most we have a congressional hortatory statute which declares what the policy of the United States is to be. 
    Moving along, I would suggest that the court below does stand alone in the face of this authority and in doing so in refusing to imply a constitutional cause of action the en banc court did erroneously look to the criteria enumerated in Cort against Ash for implication of remedies from federal statutes. 
    The respondent reaches the same result by different root. 
    He uses the proviso of Bivens that special factors might counsel hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress and argues that some seven special factors counsel hesitation here. 
    Each of the Court criteria and each of the special factors relied upon by the respondent are dressed in our brief. 
    None of them either alone or in combination justifies dismissal of petitioner's complaint in this case. 
    We would suggest that the respondent is correct to the extent that he acknowledges that it is Bivens that controls this case. 
    As I just mentioned in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we think the court below erred in relying on Cort against Ash because those criteria are irrelevant when a constitutional right rather than a right created by a federal statute is an issue. 
    For the reasons, we have outlined however at pages 26 to 36 of our opening brief application of the court criteria would require recognition of a private cause of action nonetheless on the facts of this case.

    That's correct, Mr. Justice White.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is it your view that the Equal Protection Clause even of the Fourteenth Amendment confers personal rights? 
    Doesn't it just have to do with classifications?
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="885.043" stopTime="893.012">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    I don't think that the analysis would be different under the Fourth Amendment as under the Fifth Amendment in the implication --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="893.012" stopTime="920.807">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, there are really provisions of the Constitution. 
    The First, Fourth and the Sixth Amendments among others that specifically and explicitly confer personal protections freedoms and sometimes rights, free press, free speech, free exercise or religion; the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment however just has to do with classifications, doesn't it?
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="920.807" stopTime="935.293">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    That is true Mr. Justice White but many classifications or at least several have been deemed to this Court to rise to the level of being constitutionally safeguarded and thus subject to the equal protections scrutiny.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="935.293" stopTime="947.946">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Invidiously discriminatory classifications but they -- there's nothing in Equal Protection Clause that confers personal rights by contrast to those provisions of the Constitution, examples to which I gave you.
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="947.946" stopTime="962.334">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    What the courts have held however and indeed this is the constitutional jurisprudence which has come down from Marbury against Madison is that when constitutional rights are invaded as opposed to other kinds of rights to federal courts --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="962.334" stopTime="985.782">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, whose constitutional rights -- the Equal Protection Clause just requires a state in the Fourteenth Amendment or insofar as it's component of the Fifth Amendment requires the federal government to grant everybody equal protection of the laws. 
    It doesn't confront individual's personal rights, does it?
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="985.782" stopTime="988.084">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    I believe the very purpose of the Bill of Rights --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="988.084" stopTime="1009.862">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    We have a personal right of the exercise of free speech against governmental interference or the one has a personal right if brought to trial in a criminal court to the assistance of counsel and so on. 
    Everybody has that each individual has a personal right but what is there in the Equal Protection Clause that confers any such comparable personal rights?
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="1009.862" stopTime="1014.112">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    Indeed, you're going to the heart of the case Mr. Justice Stewart in suggesting --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1014.112" stopTime="1014.123">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I do.
speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="1014.123" stopTime="1038.154">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    -- that constitutional rights, must be implied or remedies for them from the Constitution because without that implication of the cause of action those rights would be reduced to meaningless rhetoric. 
    There would be no enforcement mechanism for insuring those guarantees.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

speaker="sana_f_shtasel" startTime="1051.465" stopTime="1086.016">
    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    Again, I think the answer Mr. Justice Powell is yes as regards the cause of action aspect of the case before you this morning. 
    If there were to be any bar to trial on the merits it would have to come under any official immunity which might be invoked under the rules governing immunity in that area which are somewhat different from those at this point in time governing the operation of the Speech or Debate Clause in the legislative context.

    Ms. Shtasel let me add some variation, hypothetical; it's a variation of Mr. Justice Powell's question. 
    I don't know how many legislative assistants the president has but let's assume he has five of them and they are all men, and he calls one of the five in and says now you're doing splendid work, I have no complaints at all but in this modern day we've got to have a woman at least one woman and the legislative relations with Congress and therefore I'm sorry but I have to replace you with a woman.

    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    I think in that context Mr. Chief Justice other kinds of balancing factors come into play. 
    What you were talking about there are political concerns which might govern action in this area because indeed elective representatives having historical and constitutional function to represent sort of constituencies and to represent certain positions. 
    In that context, we are not talking about a case of invidious discrimination nor are we talking about a case where performance or job relatedness is the issue. 
    That is quite different from a case were based on nothing more and member of Congress explicitly stated that only a man could fill a position that without question has there typically been held by women.

    Title VII in the Executive Branch context applies to members of the civil service which have been defined under the appropriate statute to mean appointees of the executive, legislative and judicial branches.

    In that case Mr. Chief Justice, the question might be resolved by operation of separation of powers doctrine which would confer a textual commitment to another branch of the federal government. 
    That is not the case here where there is no such textual commitment to another branch of the government nor other any other of the political questions separation of powers kinds of formulations which can be brought to bear in the instant situation. 
    I think it appropriate to turn to the question of Speech or Debate immunity at this point in time.

    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    No, sir. 
    It was not. 
    It was only decided by the panel. 
    This Court has interpreted the parameters of the clause on nine separate occasions. 
    All of these are discussed in our brief. 
    I think it appropriate to suggest that the Court has with undeviating consistency articulated principles which have not waived almost over 100 years. 
    These are several. 
    First, that the clause has finite limits, second, that its scope is to be confined to activities which are within of legitimate, legislative sphere; and third, that the Speech or Debate Clause is not a grant of personal prerogative. 
    Instead, its purpose is to insure the independence of the legislative branch and as, as discussed a moment ago. 
    It is indeed the ultimate guarantor of separation of powers. 
    The Court has made clear that there are many cases, many activities regularly performed by a congressmen or somehow tangentially related to his performance which are nonetheless outside the scope of the clause. 
    It is our contention that firing a secretary who no one has ever contended had policymaking or legislative responsibilities is outside the scope of the protection conferred by that clause. 
    To hold otherwise, would be to violate the governing principles that I enunciated above.

    Ms. Sana F. Shtasel 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, our position is that the Court need not go so far in this particular case. 
    We -- it's our position that under no circumstance can a Speech or Debate Clause protect the low level employee. 
    There are two --

    There are two ways or two means of analysis that I suggest would be appropriate in devising limiting principles for the operation of the clause. 
    One of them would be on the basis of the kind of job functions at issue and this Court has often times made distinction based on the nature of job responsibilities. 
    A second analytical framework, indeed broader one, which the Court doesn't mean to reach today is to suggest that this kind of invidious discrimination is so egregious that under no circumstance could any employee of a congressman and thus the congressman himself be protected by virtue of the Speech or Debate Clause to that effect.

    Mr. A. Richard Gear 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    We submit that a Bivens cause of action should not be implied from the Fifth Amendment but that it should be limited to a Fourth Amendment search and seizure situation or physical intrusion situations. 
    This arrest and detention of search and seizure situations are situations were at the power of Government and its police power is clearly an abuse upon the private citizen. 
    In employment situation such as we have here, it's much more like an act between two private citizens rather than an act that has a greater effect upon the citizen because it is a power of Government. 
    We submit that further that in this case there are special factors which counsel hesitation in creating cause of action. 
    The first of those special factors is that we believe it a flood of new cases will overly burden the judiciary because the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause is broad and apparently is getting broader. 
    The Court is familiar that civil rights filings have risen from around 296 in 1961 to over 13,000 in 1977.

    But Congressman or I don't know you have to ask the plaintiff on that sir.

    There's no question about personal liability as I understand it, for federal employees who are covered by the Civil Rights Act. 
    The House of Representatives had no policy against any kind of discrimination until it passed the Clause 9 of its House Rule 43 in January of 1975, six months after the discharge of Miss Davis and either man have passed just an internal resolution prohibiting sex discrimination. 
    At no time, as I view it, has either House or Congress put before the judiciary a cause of action in the statute permitting the judiciary to consider cases against it on the basis of sex discrimination or Fifth Amendment problems.

    Mr. A. Richard Gear 
    Your Honor, I do want to get into the Speech or Debate Clause considerations here, if I may. 
    We consider that the legislative personal assistance, the personal staff employees of members of Congress are, and the relationships between Congress and these personal employees are within the legitimate sphere of legislative activity. 
    The aides of Congressmen and Congresswoman assist them in speech writing, they assist them in preparing for and discussing how to vote, they counsel them on how to vote. 
    They help them introduced material to committee hearings, they review transcripts of committee hearings, and they are really truly are involved in various stages of legislative decision making. 
    In the Gravel case, the importance of legislative personal staff was recognized that the Court said that that it was impossible for modern day legislator to perform legislative tasks without aids and assistance. 
    It went so far as to say that the day-to-day work of the legislative staff was so critical to the legislative performance that the staff members are alter egos of the members of Congress. 
    In Gravel, it was found that the aide even share the immunity of Senator Gravel. 
    We submit that the personal staffs of Congressmen very like the personal staff of the judges are selected for the purpose of assisting a legislator in performing the legislative tasks that when a legislator interviews an individual or considers whether to retain an individual from employment, what he's really asking is how can this person help me perform my legislative roles? 
    It's a careful decision because the person that is selected to be on the legislative staff may share that legislator's speech and debate immunity, that person may be immune as to third person.

    Mr. A. Richard Gear 
    That's right. 
    You know but of course the aides and the personal assistance of the legislators have themselves been found to share this immunity and so the employees of the Congressman must be considered in Speech and Debate Clause situation regardless of what the original make-up and function in Congress was at that time anyway. 
    But again the basic question that legislator asked when he hires one of these individuals is, how can this person help perform my legislative function? 
    And therefore, we submit that the personal staffs of Congressmen are assembled, they are brought together in a very broad legislative context which context should be immune. 
    It should be immune exclusive by the Court, it's not immune from scrutiny by the House's themselves and it's not immune from the voters. 
    I want to examine with you the effects of not conferring speech and debate immunity in this case and the effects of not considering the separation of powers. 
    We will have time consuming by burdens of lawsuits that will be inflicted on Congressmen. 
    They will be involved in extensive discovery procedures that case alone is four-and-half years old. 
    We feel that if Congressmen are made to answer before the judiciary, before the -- for the personnel decisions that is going to have a chilling effect on their personal decisions, that Congressmen will be forced to retain in competent aides when they would wish they can get rid of them but they're scared to for fear of lawsuits.

    Well, there are some Congressmen here who think otherwise, which they filed a new amicus brief on the other side.

    Mr. A. Richard Gear 
    That's true, Your Honor but we feel that their interests really are concern more on the fair employment practices aspects of the society problems today than they are on the true separation of powers problem which I think accord this, if you understand me on that. 
    If this cause of action is permitted and Speech and Debate Clause immunity doesn't apply we're going to have lawsuits of Congressmen for fees of a higher, the discharge of employees the failure to promote, failure to grant wage increases. 
    There may be hundreds of applicants. 
    We're not talking about a few discharges. 
    They were talking about hundreds of applicants who desire to work on the staffs of Congressman. 
    The employment decisions that will be potentially judiciable and which -- which cause of action would be created would be an immense number because this had might the Pentagon Papers episode or the criminal situation the (Inaudible) the everyday employment decisions that occur in Congress, and for this reason we feel that there would be a very improper injection of this Court into the judicial process. 
    It would mean that members of Congress would have to get familiar with statistical experts, industrial psychologists. 
    They'll have to worry about class actions every Congressman is going to need personnel expert and labor lawyer to operate. 
    We feel that this would impair the integrity of the legislative process and would be both unwarranted invasion of the principle separation of powers and they restrict the view of the Speech and Debate immunity. 
    That's all I have Your Honor unless there are questions. 
    Thank you very much.
