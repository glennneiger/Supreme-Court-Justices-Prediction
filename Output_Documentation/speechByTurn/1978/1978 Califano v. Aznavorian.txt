    Justice Potter Stewart 
    These are cross-appeals from the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. 
    In 1972, Congress enacted the Supplemental Security Income program to aid the needy who are aged, blind, or disabled. 
    The legislation creating the program provides that benefits are not to be paid for any month that the recipient spends entirely outside of the United States. 
    The primary issue in these cases is whether as the District Court held, this restriction is constitutionally impermissible burden on the asserted right of international travel. 
    For the reasons set out in the Court's written opinion filed today, we hold that this provision of the law does not violate the constitution. 
    Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is reversed. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Brennan have filed a statement concurring in the result.
