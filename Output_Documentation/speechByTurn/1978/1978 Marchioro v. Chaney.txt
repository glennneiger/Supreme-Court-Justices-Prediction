Marchioro v. Chaney
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="17.219">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 647, Marchioro against Chaney. 
    Mr. Goldmark, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="17.219" stopTime="74.602">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    A Washington statute Revised Code of Washington 29.42.020 regulates the State Committee of Washington's major political parties. 
    One requirement of this statute is that these State Committees be composed of two persons from each county in the state no more, no less and none other. 
    The issue presented here is whether this requirement that the State Committees be composed of two persons per county no more, no less and none other can be constitutionally applied to bar the Democratic party of Washington from establishing its State Committee composed of two persons from each county, plus one person from each legislative district in the state.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="74.602" stopTime="85.372">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Goldmark, as I understand it in the Supreme Court of Washington you also challenged the requirement that the composition of the committees be one man and one woman. 
    You don't renew that here?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="85.372" stopTime="88.995">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is correct we do not challenge that requirement here.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="88.995" stopTime="93.584">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And the last amendments didn't change that sex provision.
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="93.584" stopTime="189.075">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun, in my knowledge they did not. 
    Appellants challenge here only the two-person per county requirement and the court below ruled that this provision was severable from the remainder of the statute. 
    Appellants are eight members and officers of the Washington Democratic Party. 
    Four of them were persons elected as legislative district representatives to the Democratic State Committee and denied their seats on the basis of the challenge statute. 
    Appellees are the Democratic State Committee and its chairman at the time this suit was instituted. 
    The State of Washington was served, as required by state law, with a copy of the complaint when this litigation began and notified of the appeal for the Washington Supreme Court. 
    It has not appeared at any stage in this proceeding. 
    The Democratic State Committee is the governing body of the Washington Democratic Party. 
    In 1970, the Washington Supreme Court in the case of King County Republican Central Committee versus Republican State Committee interpreted the authority of State Committees regulated by RCW 29.42.020. 
    The court ruled there that these Party State Committees have the inherent power to govern the statewide operations of parties as political organizations subject --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Between conventions.
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="190.430" stopTime="199.711">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Between, subject only to the overriding authority of the party state convention. 
    That is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist they only govern between conventions.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="199.711" stopTime="210.219">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And they are defined and provided for by legislation enacted by the legislature of your state, are they?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="210.219" stopTime="211.457">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, that is correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="211.457" stopTime="215.008">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And how long has that been true?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="215.008" stopTime="228.116">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    I'm not aware, Your Honor. 
    The statute authorizes that Party State Committees to call conventions and to plan them. 
    It specifically precludes them from setting rules to govern the operations of the convention.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="228.116" stopTime="310.558">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They are creatures of statute, aren't they, the State Committee? 
    I tell you I'm asking these questions, this is for me a puzzling case and I'm sure you're going to be helpful in straightening me out. 
    But if a State Committee is a creature of statute and if it's -- performed some sort of statutory function in the State of Washington it's one thing. 
    If it's a private organization it's another. 
    In other words, I suppose the Federal Trade Commission to take the national government, which is a creature of statute couldn't all of a sudden have a meeting and say “We're going to expand our membership to 15.” 
    And then have an argument with the Government of the United States saying that their rights of association had been impaired because the statute provided for a lesser number. 
    On the other hand, I suppose that it's equally clear that a garden club could have a legitimate constitutional claim if the legislatures, federal or state said purported to begin to direct what its membership should be. 
    And this -- these committees are creatures of statute, aren't they?

    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Democratic Party has been characterized in the King County Republican Central Committee case as a voluntary political association. 
    That association has the right to establish a governing body. 
    Whether the statute that regulates what that governing body does actually creates it, regulates it or as I believe the Court also said in that case, gives it statutory body in being may only be matters of terminology because it seems clear that this is a voluntary association and this regulation regulates the way in which it can do certain functions.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="357.030" stopTime="362.088">

    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    To appellant's knowledge, they are regulated in approximately 32 states. 
    Twenty of those merely reference the existence of a State Committee and leave the composition to the party's choice. 
    Four of them establish a minimum number but allow the remainder to be added by the party. 
    Fourteen, mandate that the party State Committee shall be composed on the basis of one person one vote. 
    Twelve, like Washington, set an absolute figure.

    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, not to my knowledge. 
    In a number of instances, congressional district organizations for example, are entitled to elect the representatives to the State Committee, or legislative district organizations. 
    Not all are county based, but most have a constituency of some kind like a county.

    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Mr. Justice Brennan, yes I did.

    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    I would like to add in further response to the question from Mr. Justice Stewart that even if the statute is the sole power that gives this committee being, it is clear that the functions, the statute requires that committee to perform are protected by freedom of association. 
    The statute authorizes and requires that committee to call and plan state party conventions. 
    That is an activity protected by freedom of association.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="583.511" stopTime="586.505">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that's almost -- that's the question in this case.
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="586.505" stopTime="613.253">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    The statute requires the Democratic State Committee to provide for election of delegates to the Democratic national -- to a national party convention. 
    As this Court knows from the case of Cousins versus Wigoda, the power within a party to provide for the election of delegates to national convention is considered to be extraordinarily political and a vital matter within that party.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="613.253" stopTime="628.870">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now this statute which is quoted in your brief refers to the State Committee of each major political party. 
    I suppose elsewhere in the legislation, major political party is defined one way or the other isn't it?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="628.870" stopTime="638.366">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    A major political party is one that received 5% or more of the total vote cast in any proceeding statewide election.

    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="641.779" stopTime="642.967">

    That by definition.
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="642.967" stopTime="655.039">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    The major benefit of being a major political party is that you are allowed to participate in the state's primary system.

    Mr. Chief Justice --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Tell me, was it a purely voluntary organization like that Parent-Teachers Association or a Garden Club as Justice Stewart suggested? 
    Just a voluntary --
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="679.539" stopTime="713.241">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    That would be my assumption. 
    This statute, the State of Washington has had statutes regulating the composition of Party State Committees since 1907. 
    If the Democratic Party in Washington is like other political parties in American history, it was a voluntary political association up until the end of about the 1890's when as the Court will recall, there were abuses enough in primary election systems and other areas to cause states to gradually bring political parties within their regulatory power.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="713.241" stopTime="717.421">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But it's almost a definition first of all, isn't it?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="717.421" stopTime="717.609">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Mr. Justice Stewart --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="717.609" stopTime="741.533">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It states to me “of each major political party shall consist of”. 
    And there's nothing in there that says that some other Democratic political voluntary organization isn't entirely free to form itself and have whatever rules it wants to. 
    But the legislature has defined what a State Committee of each major political party is.
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="741.533" stopTime="801.747">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, perhaps I could explain further the ruling the Court in this case with respect to the charter enacted by the Democratic Party, which may further shed light on your concern. 
    That charter was adopted by the Democratic State Convention in 1976. 
    The charter is contained in the party's joint appendix, to establish the Democratic Party's permanent statewide organization. 
    Article 4 (g) of that charter states that the Democratic State Committee shall be the governing party -- body of the party while the convention is in adjournment. 
    In the decision below, the Washington Supreme Court held that the Democratic State Convention as the supreme party authority is implicitly empowered. 
    It did not say empowered by statute, but implicitly empowered to establish the party's permanent statewide political organization, and to delegate authority within that organization.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="801.747" stopTime="807.204">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is it that the Democratic State Party? 
    That was what you just said.
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="807.204" stopTime="827.181">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    The Democratic State Convention, meaning the 1976 adopted the charter. 
    Excuse me, Mr. Justice Rehnquist the Washington Supreme Court could've held that the Washington Democratic State Convention was implicitly empowered to establish the party's permanent statewide organization, and to delegate authority within that organization.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="827.181" stopTime="832.279">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And that is a relatively voluntary organization, I take it?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="832.279" stopTime="834.754">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    That is correct, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="834.754" stopTime="857.224">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What's an example supposing that the Democratic State Central Committee were on the outs with the Democratic State Party as represented by the state convention? 
    What sort of serious burdens could the Democratic State Committee put on the Democratic State Convention or party?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="857.224" stopTime="870.594">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    For example Your Honor, if the Democratic State Convention adopted a party platform which the State Committee then refused to implement that would be a very substantial burden on the party's freedom of association.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="870.594" stopTime="883.847">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well how would a Democratic State Committee, composed such as this one is by a statute play a role in implanting the platform of the state party?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="883.847" stopTime="926.956">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Because that is its inherent function. 
    It is as you'll notice clause 5 of this statute authorizes the State Committee to perform all inherent functions of such organization. 
    And in the court in the decision below, the court held that the Democratic Party State Convention is implicitly empowered to establish its permanent statewide party organization and delegate authority within it, and that was the Statutory State Committee. 
    The court below held that the Democratic Party charter is binding authority on the Democratic State Committee absent valid state law to the contrary.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="926.956" stopTime="945.437">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But nothing that the State Central Committee to do would prevent the members of the Democratic State Party, or the people who adhere to the platform without the convention from espousing their views as to how good a platform it was.
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="945.437" stopTime="987.028">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    A political party is an organization established to influence policy and to win elections. 
    The only permanent statewide organization that members of the Democratic Party have, the only organization to carry this out between conventions is the Democratic State Committee. 
    If this committee does not implement the party platforms, raise money as the record shows it does, raises money for Democratic candidates and distributes money to those candidates. 
    If the committee does not perform these functions as the convention desires, that would be a very substantial burden --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="987.028" stopTime="992.525">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well can't the party itself raise money quite apart from the activities of the State Central Committee?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="992.525" stopTime="1009.778">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    The State Central Committee is under the common law of the state under this statute, and under the party's charter its governing body. 
    If the Democratic Party attempted to establish some other organization, appellants have no doubt that it would be denounced as an illegal body.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1009.778" stopTime="1025.185">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Are you saying that the Supreme Court of Washington would tell you if the Democratic Party had a fund raising event in Seattle or Spokane and Tacoma that wasn't sanctioned by the State Central Committee that you couldn't have that event?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="1025.185" stopTime="1099.761">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I'm not suggesting that. 
    I'm suggesting that this is the party's permanent statewide organization. 
    It has the authority. 
    When the Democratic State Committee speaks on an issue, it speaks with the authority of the Democratic Party. 
    It elects the party's chairman or elects that state chairman. 
    When he speaks, he speaks with the authority of the Democratic Party. 
    For the convention to establish some other body would not only be contrary to state law, it would be extraordinarily divisive with the party. 
    This is the group that leads this party. 
    Party members have no other organization to look to for this function. 
    The record is clear that this State Committee raises and distributes money to party candidates, passes resolutions and performs all the normal functions of the governing body of a political party. 
    Four of appellants were elected as members to serve and participate in its decisions and have been denied from doing so on the basis of this statutory requirement. 
    And there is no evidence anywhere in the record of any compelling state interest of the State of Washington that justifies the implicitness of such a burden.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1099.761" stopTime="1157.508">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well isn't it that the legislature has defined what the State Committee is and what it shall consist of. 
    Now, it's not at all unusual for a legislature, state or federal, to set up advisory committees. 
    There's a committee a generation -- almost a generation ago set up by the federal government. 
    I don't know if it was by legislation or resolution or what antitrust study group of which my brother Stevens was a member. 
    And I'm sure whatever it was whether it was legislation or a resolution or an executive order whatever it was, set up put the membership of that should be. 
    And now could that organization passed a meeting and said “We want to double our membership and have a member from every state.” 
    Once the government, legislative or executive had set it up and defined it?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="1157.508" stopTime="1163.065">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    I do not believe that that organization had its genesis in a voluntary private association.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1163.065" stopTime="1175.188">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There's no indication that this one did either. 
    What we have before us is a legislative act defining what a State Committee is.
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="1175.188" stopTime="1209.658">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Your Honor, appellants believe as the Washington Supreme Court has said, and with the Court's indulgence, I'll read its statement that appears on page 5 of appellee's brief in which the Washington Supreme Court stated the powers of the state committees, and stated their role in under this statute. 
    Representative of a permanent state party organization, those subordinate to the overriding power of the Party State Convention.

    Intraparty rules governing statewide operations of the party as a political organization during the interval between conventions.

    To give you an example of something that occurred during the pendency of this case. 
    And I refer to a matter outside the record, something contained in the minutes of the Democratic State Committee meeting, and I believe the Court may take judicial notice of this under the case of Texas Railway v. Pottorff 291 U.S., simply for the fact that the State Committee took such an action. 
    The Democratic State Party platform for a number of years has espoused, repealed state sales taxes on food and drugs. 
    At a meeting prior to a general election to vote on an initiative which would've accomplished this repeal, the State Committee adopted a resolution opposing it.

    What if the Democratic State Convention, Mr. Goldmark, had said that the Democratic State Central Committee shall not be subject to any elections at all, but simply be appointed by the Democratic State Convention every two years. 
    And this Washington state legislature passed the statute saying “No, you're going to have some elections.” 
    Would you feel you had stronger case? 
    In other words, the Democratic State Party was asserting its authority over the central committee by saying that instead of having its -- the central committee having its members elected, they were going to be appointed by the state convention.

    Mr. Daniel P. Brink 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court. 
    I think to understand the question, we do have to go back into the background of the system, the political structure of the State of Washington and the governmental structure. 
    It's been of -- we're still fairly young state, but of some 70 years duration has there been this structure of 39 counties with 39 separate governments each having their own elected representatives, excuse me, legislative executive in judicial branches. 
    They elect their own county judges, the county commissioners and executives, prosecuting attorneys, county clerks and so on down the line. 
    The state has authorized by a section just one following this, and in the same basic enabling Act in 1907, the existence of county committees which are composed of precinct committee men elected in each county. 
    These organizations of course parallel the county governments. 
    Then the county committee of each county selects two members to the State Committee. 
    It originally was just one in 1907, and 1927 as I recall, they added the rights of one man or/and one woman from each county.

    Now, when you say “they” is that the state legislature?
speaker="daniel_p_brink" startTime="2011.138" stopTime="2107.614">
    Mr. Daniel P. Brink 
    The state legislature, yes Your Honor. 
    The powers of the county committee are not restricted by statute. 
    And when it is stated here that there can be no other organization speaking for the Democratic party, that is simply not true. 
    Each county speaks for itself and sometimes most vociferously and they're not always in concert. 
    However, the state charter attempted to put the counties in line a little bit and did say that they do have a limitation upon them, and that is that they should attempt at least to follow the policy set forth in the national charter, the state -- excuse me, the national platform, the state platform and the county platform. 
    The State Committee as I said was -- is elected by the -- composed of these people from the county committees, two from each, and just provides a skeleton of the state party and as an administrative, not an electoral and not a policy making body. 
    The policy making is reserved to the state convention. 
    The charter itself requires the State Committee to follow the policies set forth by the state convention and by the state charter. 
    It's important to understand that the functions of the State Committee are relatively limited. 
    We -- I'd like to talk to you about what it does and what it does not do. It does not do a lot of the things represented by counsel.

    Mr. Daniel P. Brink 
    That is not very broad in view of the King County Republican case in which the Washington State Supreme Court said that subject to the overriding power of the state convention. 
    So I suspect the legislature went and said inherent just saying “Well, do whatever you can.”

    Mr. Daniel P. Brink 
    Absolutely, that is the holding of the Washington State Supreme Court back at 1971 in King County Republican case.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So your -- you say that under this -- under the Washington law, the -- while there must be a central committee with two members from each county, the convention could remove -- could say if the committee has no functions?

    Mr. Daniel P. Brink 
    They could theoretically do that in our view.

    And will set up another committee to do all the things they want them to do, and will have this committee composed any way they wanted to?
speaker="daniel_p_brink" startTime="2404.328" stopTime="2629.247">
    Mr. Daniel P. Brink 
    Right, but they must allow the State Central Committee as set up by statute to exist to attempt to coordinate at least the election procedures of the 39 different counties and their own county committees. 
    And it does provide an element of stability between conventions. 
    It is there. 
    It is official. 
    The Secretary of State knows he can call up the State Chairman or the -- of either party and plan ahead for conventions. 
    This is the most important function, seems to me, of the State Committee. 
    And that is to initiate the election procedures by calling conventions, setting dates, heading the precinct committee men and their various precincts. 
    They set the dates for precinct caucuses, for county caucuses and then for the state convention. 
    But as also limited by statute, they can't tell the state convention what to do in its own convention. 
    The case that this Court has cited to of Kasper versus Pontikes and Cousins versus Wigoda are just so far and away from what we're involved in here. 
    Those were -- Cousins versus Wigoda involved a national political party convention and as to which delegation from the State of Illinois should be seated, the one that was elected under the state law or the one that was selected in accordance with rules of the national convention. 
    And the state did attempt to interfere and this Court said it was an interference. 
    But that was a national convention case. 
    The Court was very concerned and well it should be, it's of importance to all parties, all citizens that this convention be held without interference from 50 states. 
    It's also, in the case of Kasper versus Pontikes, that was a nomination case and a state little again from the State of Illinois, and where an Illinois statute prevented appellee from voting in the Democratic primary because she had within 23 months previous, voted in a Republican primary. 
    Now the Washington State Committee does not affect at all primary elections. 
    It does not permit, prevent, deprived anyone from participating in primary or general elections. 
    The Ripon Society case is simply not in point again. 
    A national convention case in which the Republican -- and an also was a Fourteenth Amendment case. 
    There's no Fourteenth Amendment issue here nor is there one raised here. 
    The -- assuming that there would be any kind of a burden upon the appellants, there is a state interest in maintaining the stability and integrity and continuity of the major political parties in the state. 
    To become a major political party in Washington State by getting 10% of the vote at the last general election, and then if the new party, new major party is still in being it can qualify for the primary ballot without a separate convention. 
    As a matter of fact, the only -- I think the only time we had a party that achieved this was the Progressive Party back in 1948, and then of course by the year 1950, nobody was interested to pick up the fact that they were a major party. 
    So they -- we have a lot of minor parties that come and go and a lot of them on the ballot.

    Mr. Daniel P. Brink 
    Didn't follow through. 
    The State Committee is not the policy maker, but it is important that it retain communications and maintain communications between these county organizations who are all out speaking for their selves -- themselves as well. 
    It has the same constituency as those county committees. 
    We suggest the statute is narrowly drawn and serves a state interest to maintain this continuity of the major parties. 
    It is our suggestion that the Court affirm the Washington State Supreme Court.

   Rebuttal of Charles A. Goldmark

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Brink. 
    Do you have anything further Mr. Goldmark? 
    You have about three minutes remaining.

    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    This case cannot be distinguished from Cousins versus Wigoda. 
    There, this Court held that a party's choice and the composition of its higher governing body was a choice protected by freedom of association. 
    The matter there was regulated by state law, yet the Court hold -- held that the State of Illinois could not interfere with the delegates chosen by the party to attend the Democratic National Convention, or more importantly a state caucus held to elect members to the Democratic National Committee. 
    And this Court said that that membership in that state caucus was protected by freedom of association because the representatives elected to the Democratic National Committee would be involved in planning the next Democratic National Convention.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2745.977" stopTime="2754.500">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Didn't the Illinois court there enjoin those representatives from presenting themselves as delegates to the national convention?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="2754.500" stopTime="2765.056">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and that is the effect of this statute. 
    It has prevented four of appellants from presenting themselves to the State Committee in participating in its deliberations.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2765.056" stopTime="2782.247">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So you must have to say that the State Central Committee created by a statue in Washington is of the same political and associational significance as the Democratic or Republican National Convention sitting every four years to choose a presidential candidate?
speaker="charles_a_goldmark" startTime="2782.247" stopTime="2825.711">
    Mr. Charles A. Goldmark 
    It is of the same significance for freedom of association. 
    The fact that a national party convention was involved in Cousins, means that states may have different interests in regulating. 
    A state may not have an interest in regulating a national party convention or its membership, whereas it may in regulating participation in state party matters, but both are protected. 
    The difference in the compelling interest does not relate that to strip away the First Amendment protection of the association of party members. 
    And Cousins did hold that stating or state interference in a state party caucus to choose representatives to the Democratic National Committee was protected.
