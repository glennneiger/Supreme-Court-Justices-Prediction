    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court. 
    This case had its origin, or its genesis in late October of 1972, when the respondents in this case were arrested for murder in Shelby County for a homicide committed in Tipton County, Tennessee. 
    They were indicted on November of 1972, before the Grand Jury of Tipton County which was chaired by an acting foreman who had been appointed by the Trial Judge under Tennessee System of appointing the foreman of the Grand Jury. 
    The acting foreman was accompanied on the Grand Jury by 12 other grand jurors selected from the general venire list of Tipton County. 
    There was a pro se plea in abatement to that indictment. 
    A hearing was held in the Trial Court and evidence was taken, the Trial Judge overruled the plea. 
    It went on to trial and the conviction was had against both respondents and each was sentenced to 60 years. 
    The respondents then perfected their appeal to the intermediate Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Court of Criminal Appeals considered the same assignments of error in their original plea which attacked the method of selecting the foreman of the Grand Jury and that the plea originally alleged systematic exclusion in the appointment of the acting Grand Jury by the Trial Judge. 
    The Court of Appeals ruled favorable for the state and against the plea, it then was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court certiorari was denied and a per curium opinion. 
    The Court found that the case had been adequately dealt with that the Court of Criminal Appeals. 
    Thereafter in 1975 petitions were filed by respondents and the District Court at Memphis for petitions of habeas corpus, writ of habeas corpus. 
    Thereafter the reference to the magistrate was had by Judge Bailey Brown on the bench and the magistrate did take proof, responses, the trial were filed, the trial record was filed and affidavits were submitted. 
    Subsequently the case was dismissed by the District Court and that the District Court found that the foreman of the Grand Jury had been selected for other reasons than racial. 
    In essence the proof before the Court at that time was the fact that the Trial Judge had selected the acting foreman of the Grand Jury because of his prior experience in the satisfactory manner in which he had performed that duty. 
    Petition to rehear was filed before the District Court which was further considered and overruled and then the appeal of course was taken to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the action of the Federal District Court at Memphis was reversed and the Sixth Circuit did find that there was a systematic exclusion in the selection of foreman of the Grand Jury. 
    Our arguments and contentions on behalf of the State of Tennessee basically are -- that Judge Brown’s finding was correct. 
    And that the foreman was selected for reasons other than racial and that the foreman had been selected acting foreman to fill the vacancy of the normal foreman who was unavailable during that term of court and the Trial Judge affidavits of the Trial Judge and the foreman of that grand jury both indicated that it was for prior experience and satisfactory work well done. 
    Further at that time it should be noted that the foreman of the Grand Jury did not vote in indictment. 
    The indictment can -- the voting of the indictment was by 12 grand jurors who were selected from the general venire list, raised further that the record indicates that the raise of the defendants who're respondents here was unknown to them at that time and that there was no mention or there was no alluding to the race of the respondent defendants.

    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir. 
    The record does show that the race of the victims was also Black, as was the race of the respondent defendants.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Can you challenge incidentally the conclusions of the Court below that the respondents made out a prima facie case?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="382.157" stopTime="408.166">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    No sir, Your Honor. 
    The Court below did hold that a prima facie case was made out by the statement of the prior Grand Jury foreman -- some three to four in number, who said that their recollection, there had never been black foreman of the Grand Jury in Tipton County. 
    And I think that did make -- we do not contest that, no sir.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="408.166" stopTime="416.253">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How about the judges of that Court, what's the history there, any Negroes ever been judges of that court? 
    Is that in the record?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="416.253" stopTime="422.474">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Mr. Chief Justice, it's not in the record and I have no personal recollection.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="422.474" stopTime="426.028">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Have no personal collection either way?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="426.028" stopTime="622.714">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    No sir, either way. 
    Frankly I'm not that familiar with Tipton County it's in upper West Tennessee across the Mississippi River from Missouri Land. 
    It's probably closer to the St. Louis than it is to Nashville. 
    The other -- I would also add one witness testified before this Grand Jury panel, that witness was the arresting officer, after that a boat was taken without -- although there were some 20 other witnesses subpoenaed before the Grand Jury at that term. 
    At the trial, there were some five eyewitnesses as to both defendants. 
    We contend that the Trial Court was correct in finding that it was based on pragmatic reasons and neutralized or was neutral to the race issue. 
    Second argument that we put forth is that even assuming that error existed and there was systematic exclusion in the selection of the foreman of the Grand Jury, that it would be harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt when the record is viewed on the whole with the evidence of guilt being overwhelming at trial, free of reversible constitutional error and free of any constitutional error as to the petit jury makeup or to the Grand Jury makeup as to the -- who were selected from the general venire list. 
    The third argument in position which the state puts forth is that the Federal habeas corpus should be limited when the -- when we have an issue involving the selection of the foreman of a Grand Juror who is one of 13 with 12 voting members and an opportunity has been had for a full and fair litigation in the state system which Tennessee has a three tired court system from the trial, actual trial before the jury of a criminal offense and further an extensive Post Conviction Relief Act, that further that if the trial is free from constitutional reversible error and no assignments are made to the petit jury or to the petit jury -- in essence an extension of the Stone, the Stone versus Powell case. 
    We say this knowing that this is the first time to our knowledge -- to my knowledge that squarely there's been any extension of the rationale in Neil from 1881 to extend to the foreman selection of a grand jury.

    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes the statutory prescription of the foreman's duty is in the record further the--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="638.568" stopTime="641.026">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is there anything beyond the statute?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="641.026" stopTime="680.428">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes, the foreman of the grand jury did submit an affidavit before the federal magistrate at the District Court level in which he stated in this case that he did not vote and that he did preside basically we contend that the foreman's chore is basically ministerial and administrative and that it assists in the organizing of the grand jury scheduling of witnesses. 
    He stated that since he had been serving his former, the grand jury which had been many years under Tennessee system, they are usually reappointed as for statement of trial, he had never voted except in one case.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="680.428" stopTime="684.657">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well I am not asking his reporting, what does he do? 
    Does he just sit there?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="684.657" stopTime="698.858">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    No sir, he schedules the witnesses, he schedules the witnesses who are to appear, he asks them questions and then he turns to the other members of the grand jury and ask them if they have any questions of the witness.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="698.858" stopTime="700.390">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So he does have something to do with.

    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir, he is Chairman of the grand jury.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="706.584" stopTime="716.434">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Can the juror A call a witness that he does more? 
    Does he determine who can testify and who does not?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="716.434" stopTime="718.726">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    No sir, under Tennessee law --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="718.726" stopTime="720.519">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You said he calls the witnesses.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="720.519" stopTime="726.248">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    He schedules them or does the ministerial function of calling them.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="726.248" stopTime="739.641">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well I mean if the -- formally the grand jury decides who will testify and who will not testify then that's just not a perfunctory position?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="739.641" stopTime="794.517">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Mr. Justice Marshall he does not make the -- he is not the solo arbiter of who testify -- any grand juror can insist on or ask to hear from a witness, as a practical matter, I think most District Attorney's General who have charge of the grand jury schedule and report on the indictment form who the witnesses are as a result of the investigation from the law enforcement officer. 
    The foreman does work closely with the District Attorney General during the, when the grand jury is not in session. 
    In many of Tennessee's counties the grand juries are not in continuous session. 
    Of course in the metropolitan areas such as Nashville, and Memphis, and Chattanooga, they are in continuous session and there are usually two grand juries operating continuously.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="794.517" stopTime="812.047">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Attorney General, you are saying there hasn't been any extension -- to a foreman. 
    But wouldn't your position on the Stone against Powell issue be the same with respect to challenging the composition of the entire grand jury?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="812.047" stopTime="827.520">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir on the grand jury, on the grand jury, we would on to the rationale encompassed in Stone and that Tennessee has a full and fair trial and appellate practice and is more --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="827.520" stopTime="833.656">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So that issue on the grand jury just wouldn't be open in federal collateral relief.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="833.656" stopTime="836.659">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Under habeas corpus, there is a collateral tag, yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="836.659" stopTime="857.447">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So your position does encompass that, that and so it really -- well I take it you are saying that even if Stone against Powell would pick up challenges to the grand jury in general, it shouldn't pick up challenges to the foreman is that it or --?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="857.447" stopTime="858.314">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="858.314" stopTime="861.257">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or should they both be treated the same?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="861.257" stopTime="917.387">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    I would say of course there is a line at some point in which we, there is a breaking point, obviously we haven't gone to the arresting officer, we haven't gone to the committing magistrate in the manner in which that individual is selected. 
    There must be a breaking point, our position is that that breaking point should be after the petit jury, for that relief. 
    I am candid to say that if the matter was brought before the Tennessee Appellate court and systematic exclusion was shown, systematic exclusions of Blacks to be, to serve as grand jurors, it should -- I maintain should be reversed by the court, but as a collateral attachment there is –
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="917.387" stopTime="924.300">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    A federal habeas corpuses has been available on the grand jury for a long time, isn't it?

    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="925.090" stopTime="948.682">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well as understood your position to be with respect to singling out the foreman of the grand jury, that not necessarily just under federal habeas but as a matter of federal constitutional law, in this particular case where the foreman does invoke the general rule applying in the presumption of prima facie case that grand jury shouldn't apply just because of this particular foreman.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="948.682" stopTime="950.451">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    In this particular case, yes.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I understand your position to be that too.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Attorney General just, so I'll be sure I understand your position, I had understood it to be that quite without regard to the foreman, let's assume that you didn't have any foreman, you had a 12-man jury that on, a grand jury that indicted the defendant and there after the defendant was tried before a petit jury, the composition of which was not questioned and the defendant was found guilty, and then the case went its way through direct review and ends up in federal habeas corpus. 
    And I understand your position to be that federal habeas corpus, the federal habeas corpus does not apply to that type situation, it cannot be invoked to review the question whether or not the grand jury was properly composed, is that your position?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1007.375" stopTime="1008.173">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1008.173" stopTime="1012.401">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well I wonder, why you talk so much about the foreman, I take it that's an alternative position.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1012.401" stopTime="1022.586">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes we just simply say that since it has never been extended to the foreman it has been extended as has been pointed out to grand jury composition--
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1022.586" stopTime="1033.855">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    But in how many cases was it extended to the grand jury and habeas corpus while the composition of the petit jury also had not been attacked.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1033.855" stopTime="1035.336">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    A number of --

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well how many?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1038.829" stopTime="1039.352">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    I really don't know --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1039.352" stopTime="1047.637">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This question ever raised in any of those cases. 
    Perhaps it was, I don't know, I am asking for information.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1047.637" stopTime="1055.647">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    I really don't know as to the numerical breakdown.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1055.647" stopTime="1068.408">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But your point I take it is that whatever maybe the law with respect to the membership of, the voting members of the grand jury that has no bearing on the selection of the foreman.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1068.408" stopTime="1111.974">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice that's correct. 
    We are saying first that federal habeas corpus should not be the writ available for a collateral attack on the grand jury composition itself in the absence of -- the other fact is that, that we discussed in Stone versus Powell or more particularly where there has been a full and fair and impartial trial and appellate review and we first say that but then we also say that we certainly assuming this certainly we should not depart an extended to include even the selection of a foreman.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1111.974" stopTime="1119.263">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now but that's on the basis and a constitutional issue, it isn't on the applicability of Stone against Powell.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1119.263" stopTime="1121.752">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    On the basis of constitutional issue.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1121.752" stopTime="1126.966">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well it's and on the basis of, it was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1126.966" stopTime="1144.966">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir. 
    Also that's other in addition to the federal district judge being correct in finding that the prima facie case was rebutted by neutral evidence, the decision was made for other reasons other than racial.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1144.966" stopTime="1159.583">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And harmless beyond a reasonable doubt argument would it not always be true that's any defect in the grand jury proceeding will be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if you got a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at the trial by the petit jury.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1159.583" stopTime="1163.929">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir in the absence of an actual showing of prejudice which I cannot --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1163.929" stopTime="1177.836">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How could there ever be one on the man that's proved beyond a reasonable doubt that'll be guilty. 
    So doesn't that position -- wouldn't that position effectively give the state a free hand in doing whatever it want to do with grand juries?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1177.836" stopTime="1181.853">

    In the absence of an actual showing of prejudice.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1181.853" stopTime="1192.650">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well even if there was prejudice would then still be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, that is prejudice at the grand jury stage because -- if the man had a fair trial, if we assume the man had a fair trial was found guilty.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1192.650" stopTime="1203.405">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In other words, isn't the petit jury that determines guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, doesn't that wash out any possible error in selection of the grand jury?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1203.405" stopTime="1213.382">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes Mr. Chief Justice, although I would hesitate saying it possible because I could envision some Grand Jury participation beyond their regular role or --.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1213.382" stopTime="1225.706">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, if that turned out that there are only ten grand jurors and the Tennessee Law requires 12, then maybe there wouldn't be any indictment, that's possible right?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1225.706" stopTime="1240.522">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Wouldn't that even be harmless beyond reasonable doubt because you've been proven guilty at a fair trial? 
    I don't see how you're ever going to have any error under your rationale. 
    Maybe that's right, but it seems to me we just eliminate the review of Grand Jury proceedings.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="1240.522" stopTime="1265.582">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Well, if indictment itself is faulty in Tennessee Law, whatever occurred in the trial is void because a defendant cannot stand trial in Tennessee without first being indicted and so if the indictment is faulty and it is shown that it is defective even in State Court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1265.582" stopTime="1267.913">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's a matter of state law is it not essentially?

    I would think then that Grand Jury could never be harmless error.

    Mr. William M. Leech 
    No sir, not in State Court.

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court. 
    This case involves simply I feel the enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment in Federal Courts. 
    The Court of Appeals found discrimination in the selection of the Grand Jury foreman of the Grand Jury that indicted the respondents and reversed their convictions. 
    The respondents are asking you to affirm that judgment. 
    I see the issues as being three. 
    One whether there was discrimination in the selection of the Grand Jury foreman. 
    If so, what is the proper remedy? 
    And then the third issue the Stone versus Powell issue is federal habeas corpus available in this kind of issue?

    The Attorney General has conceded that there was a prima facie case proven in the District Court. 
    The District Court judge found it to be a prima facie case and of course obviously the Court of Appeals agreed. 
    The District Court and the Court of Appeals however disagreed on whether the prima facie case was rebutted.

    Nobody has found there to be gaps, but I -- but there were three grand -- prior Grand Jury foreman testifying, one who would served in early ‘50s, all of them testified that it was in their memory they could not recall a black grand jury foreman. 
    I suppose it's possible that there was a Grand Jury foreman who served in that period of time not called and in that respect there maybe a gap, but I don't --

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Some Republicans there. 
    I will return to the state's efforts to rebut the prima facie case in the Federal District Court. 
    They submitted an affidavit from the State Trial Judge in which the State Trial Judge says that he had chosen the Grand Jury foreman that indicted the respondents because this individual had served before and his regular foreman was going to be out of the county. 
    Then he sums up in last sentence of his affidavit, quote, this in the appendix of page 113. 
    “I don't think I have really given any thought to appointing a black foreman, but I have no feeling against doing so.” 
    He'd never given any thought to the appointing of a black Grand Jury foreman. 
    The state also submitted the affidavit of the Grand Jury foreman who tells us that he did not vote on the indictment. 
    Now once a prima facie case is shown, I say the state has a much greater obligation then to just come into Court with an affidavit of the selecting officer saying that he didn't choose this person because of race. 
    As a matter of fact, the affidavit is much stronger than that because the affidavit indicates that he did not even consider blacks, but what didn't they show? 
    There was no proof that a black had ever been considered. 
    No proof that a black had ever served. 
    No proof as to what criteria was used. 
    No proof of any rational selection procedure like personal interviews etcetera, and there are absolutely certainly no proof that the Blacks in Tipton County were unqualified to serve.

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    But I do think that selection process there is certainly different. 
    Certainly susceptible to the exercise of racial prejudice, but nothing to which this court has ever entered into, and I don't believe that it would be proper for the court to enter into that to sort of political, almost a political judgment as to why voters are motivated to elect who they do. 
    Now the prima facie case is important and what the state failed to prove is important because the prima facie case shifts the burden of proof. 
    Now the judge did tell us that he did not consider blacks. 
    He gave them no thought. 
    A person who selects members of the grand jury has a duty to become familiar with persons eligible for duty, for jury service, a duty to refrain from a course of conduct that naturally gives –

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    No I guess I used that and it's sort of generic term Your Honor. 
    I am talking about the grand jury foreman. 
    But a duty to refrain from a course of conduct, and this court's cases had never allowed a simple protestation that I didn't mean to discriminate to be sufficient to over come a prima facie case. 
    And in this case we have far more than a simple protestation that I didn't mean to discriminate, we have a statement that I did not consider Blacks, I didn't give them any thought although I don't have anything against it.

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Commissioners chose the master jury list, but then as I recall the clerk administers a system by which names are put in a pot and until recently a 10 year old child was brought in and drew out names at random. 
    They went to serve the grand jury, they went to serve the criminal court juries, the civil court juries. 
    But then completely outside of that is the judges' personal sort of selection procedure where he can reach out into the general population and choose anybody he or she wants as a foreman or a fore person of the grand jury.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Kurtz I am little bit concerned about the same point that Mr. Justice Blackmun raised with you earlier about the actual existence of a prima facie case. 
    As I understand the magistrate to whom the district court referred this matter decided that you had made out a prima facie case. 
    The district court then without opinion denied relief and the Court of Appeals reversed the district court. 
    Now what standard does the Court of Appeals review that sort of a, is that a clearly erroneous test?

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Well I don't believe it's a clearly erroneous test Your Honor, because for one thing there is no evidentiary hearing in the district court, none whatsoever it was based solely upon the statistical information available that there hadn't been any blacks, the judge, and the judges' affidavit. 
    So I don't think a clearly erroneous rule applies for an additional reason. 
    Also in that we have mixed questions of law in fact here obviously and clearly erroneous rule does not apply to that.

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes Your Honor and I do disagree with you that the district court did not find a prima facie case. 
    I would refer Your Honor to the district courts decision on page 99 of the appendix the first paragraph, this is a district court judge saying it would appear that a prima facie case has been made with respect to discrimination in the selection of a foreman of the grand jury. 
    Only then that the district judge allowed the state an opportunity to file affidavits and only then did the state file the affidavit of the district court judge or excuse me, the affidavit of the state court judge and the affidavit of the foreman of the grand jury.

speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2112.573" stopTime="2248.288">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes Your Honor. 
    Now let me turn quickly to the issue of relief, which I think is one of the key issues in this case, obviously and I suppose what legitimately, the legitimate questions about the fact that the foreman did not vote in this matter. 
    The traditional remedy has always been avoiding the indictment for discrimination in grand jury cases as well as petit jury. 
    But many of this court's cases have involved solely grand juries. 
    Bush versus Kentucky the first one that involved solely a grand jury 1883 and then through more recent cases Alexander versus Louisiana, Peters versus Kiff and then Castaneda. 
    What are the importances of the grand, the foremen in this case? 
    The record in that regard does not contain many facts, the only thing we know on page 23 of the Appendix is the foreman who served at the -- at this particular grand jury panel is -- I usually question the witness first to get basic information to the attention of the members of the grand jury and then I ask each witness has been examined if there is anyone in the room that wants to ask further question to the witness. 
    They are -- each and everyone given an opportunity to question the witness, so he controls the availability of the witness and when to break off the giving of evidence. 
    But what more does he or she do? 
    Under Tennessee law, the grand jury is an entity made up of 13 members the foreman is the presiding officer and leader of the grand jury. 
    Small group studies and small group dynamics would certainly indicate the force that a leader of such a small group can exercise and all of us who practiced criminal law and have some knowledge of grand juries and petit juries realize that the tremendous influence of the foreman --

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    I just -- further more the grand jury foreman must sign indictment in Tennessee or the indictment is void even if the Grand Jury foreman does not vote and of course the Grand Jury foreman has certain statutory duties even out of term. 
    I think all these things are outlined in great detail in the briefs of this case. 
    Why the voiding of the indictment?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2418.231" stopTime="2427.149">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2428.032" stopTime="2435.549">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So if the foreman were the 13th and he disagreed with the action of that 12th, he would nonetheless be require to sign it, is that correct?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2435.549" stopTime="2585.996">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes Your Honor. 
    That the foreman is the spokesperson of the Grand Jury. 
    The Grand Jury can only act vis-à-vis the Court through the foreman, but I don't suggest that the foreman could somehow refuse to sign. 
    He would have to sign or I assume he'd subject to mandamus. 
    This Court has always supported the remedy of the voiding of indictments by two theories, both used I think, the presumption of prejudice. 
    Certain circumstances are so susceptible to abuse that the Court will assume prejudice. 
    I think it is the recognition of the evidentiary problems that are present and if you had to prove actual discriminations in Court. 
    Grand Jury secrecy, most difficult. 
    In the Castaneda case for instance, I don't believe that there is proof of actual prejudice. 
    This Court has always assumed that to be a legitimate rationale in support of that rule. 
    Then the rule of judicial integrity. 
    While the rationale of judicial integrity has fallen in -- well bad times in the Fourth Amendment area, it has not fallen in bad times in this area. 
    For instance, in Your Honor's case Peters versus Kiff, you allowed a White defendant standing to challenge Grand Jury discrimination because Blacks have been excluded. 
    I think that, that is a strong statement that this Court adheres to the rationale of judicial integrity. 
    Chief Justice Stone said in an older case Hill versus Texas, the conviction cannot stand because the constitution prohibits the procedure by which it was obtained. 
    Equal protection of the law is something more than an abstract right, it is a command which the state must respect the benefits of which every person may demand. 
    Not the least of our constitutional system is that its safeguards extent to all, the lease deserving as well as the most virtuous.

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2634.771" stopTime="2644.361">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    And again I ask you how was your client injured if he was tried and convicted by a jury properly selected?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2644.361" stopTime="2654.967">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Well, again I must say because their personal Fourteenth Amendments rights were violated.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2654.967" stopTime="2669.268">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Were your clients rights violated in terms of judicial integrity as you use that term anymore than the public generally?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2669.268" stopTime="2672.257">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Well, I think they were both violated Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2672.257" stopTime="2681.697">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    You concede your client had fair trial and he was found guilty, that guilt has been affirmed by at least three courts.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2681.697" stopTime="2682.344">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    For purposes --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2682.344" stopTime="2684.037">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    You're not challenging that?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2684.037" stopTime="2687.971">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    For purpose of this hearing I do not challenge that Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2687.971" stopTime="2692.969">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    And what is the purpose, the historical purpose of habeas corpus?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2692.969" stopTime="2703.638">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Well, I believe the historical purpose of habeas corpus prior --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2703.638" stopTime="2707.107">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    It had something to do with innocence, didn't it?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2707.107" stopTime="2709.276">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes Your Honor, it had something to do with innocence and --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2709.276" stopTime="2714.083">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Is innocence involved in this case at all?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2714.083" stopTime="2716.218">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    No Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2716.218" stopTime="2716.880">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Alright.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2716.880" stopTime="2730.640">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    But habeas corpus law has changed considerably since it had something to do with the innocence as you say and also it has to do with the jurisdiction of the Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2730.640" stopTime="2738.627">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well habeas corpus has to do with release from unlawful confinement that may or may not have something to do with innocence in your case?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2738.627" stopTime="2739.920">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2739.920" stopTime="2743.075">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's released from unlawful confinement isn't it?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2743.075" stopTime="2745.044">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes, and Congress is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2745.044" stopTime="2747.773">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Sometime it has to do with the innocence, sometimes it doesn't.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2747.773" stopTime="2749.231">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2749.231" stopTime="2752.910">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    But is there any unlawful confinement in this case?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2752.910" stopTime="2772.001">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    If you -- if we look back over 100 years of this Court's decisions enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment, I think there is no doubt that this conviction was obtained in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and therefore under the Federal habeas statute --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2772.001" stopTime="2775.274">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    The indictment.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Which is the first case you rely upon?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2779.862" stopTime="2783.317">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    I would start with Strauder versus West Virginia Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2783.317" stopTime="2786.239">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    The attack that was on the petty jury as well as the Grand Jury.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2786.239" stopTime="2787.035">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    That's correct Your Honor.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    What was the next case?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2788.552" stopTime="2795.271">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Bush versus Kentucky, which as an 1883 case, in which the attack was solely on the Grand Jury.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2795.271" stopTime="2798.939">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Was the issue you're arguing here today argued in that case?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2798.939" stopTime="2803.432">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    No, Your Honor but there is a case in which the issue that interests Your Honor was argued.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2803.432" stopTime="2804.111">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Which case was that?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2804.111" stopTime="2808.417">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    And that is Cassell versus Texas. 
    A 1950 case.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2808.417" stopTime="2810.206">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Was that a habeas corpus case?

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    No, it is not Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2811.135" stopTime="2813.204">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well, that's a very different case then.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2813.204" stopTime="2817.143">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    The issue on habeas corpus has never been addressed by Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2817.143" stopTime="2820.391">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well, this is a novel case in that respect.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2820.391" stopTime="2821.427">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    It is Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2821.427" stopTime="2823.371">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    That's my point.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2823.371" stopTime="2885.071">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    But I would like to submit that there are tremendous differences in this case and Stone versus Powell, which should not lead to the same result. 
    They are the differences between the exclusionary rule and the remedy in this case. 
    The rationales are different. 
    The rationale of voiding the indictment in this case is supported by presumed prejudice, judicial integrity and maybe deterrence, but only maybe possibly deterrence. 
    Now, this Court's decisions have never rested on that. 
    The exclusionary rule is based on deterrence alone and the recognition that deterrence -- the deterrent effect is attenuated so greatly on Federal habeas corpus that in a balancing procedure, this Court recognizes that there are certain interests more important than the deterrent effects in enforcement --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2885.071" stopTime="2890.672">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Your read Mr. Justice Stewart's opinions for the Court in Elkins against United States?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2890.672" stopTime="2891.719">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    No, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2891.719" stopTime="2902.107">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That came out a number of years ago. 
    I think it spoke quite substantially about judicial integrity in connection with the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2902.107" stopTime="2921.502">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes, but as I read Stone versus Powell, Your Honor's have rejected such irrational in the area of the Fourth Amendment or if not rejecting it certainly entered into a balancing test, a balancing test that has never been used by this Court in Grand Jury discrimination cases.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2921.502" stopTime="2936.573">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that had to do with the exclusionary rule and it did as my brother Rehnquist correctly recollects, emphasize the interest of juridical integrity in connection with the exclusionary rule.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2936.573" stopTime="2937.078">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2937.078" stopTime="2941.939">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which is, I would corollary to the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="2941.939" stopTime="2952.936">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Well I certainly recognize that and support it, but I don't think that, that rationale is supported by this Court's decision in Stone versus Powell.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2952.936" stopTime="2966.471">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What did -- you said in response to question from Mr. Justice Stewart early that indictment can be only 12 votes of a Grand Jury and not by information as in some states.

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2966.845" stopTime="3010.877">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Suppose Tennessee law allowed a charge to be instituted in -- even on a homicide case by information from the prosecutor and it appeared the prosecutors for -- ever since Tennessee had been member of the union had been white males appointed by the governor since you don't want to get into the election process, by appointed by the governor. 
    Your arguments would be same, if the uncharged had been instituted by that particular prosecutor.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="3010.877" stopTime="3040.699">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    I think that that could raise substantial questions as to the validity of the charges if it was shown that the racial discrimination had been exercised in the selection of the prosecutors. 
    I would admit that that would raise tremendous difficulties in our system of justice, that obviously would not be as easy to administer as this rule is in the grand jury.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3040.699" stopTime="3051.892">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    First you try out the prosecutor before you can try the defendant. 
    As here you want to try out the grand jury before you try the defendant.

    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    That's possible.

    May I ask a question, obviously the integrity of the grand jury is important to society no one questions that, what other ways may the grand jury integrity be protected legally apart from the type of action that you have here today?
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="3076.087" stopTime="3084.492">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Well of course the grand jury integrity could be protected by federal criminal statute, there is such statute 18 U.S. code 243.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3084.492" stopTime="3085.057">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    That's right.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="3085.057" stopTime="3089.252">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    Class action law suits as used in Carter versus the Jury Commissioner.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    And Turner against Fouche.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Right and of course they can be direct attack on direct appeal.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="3099.662" stopTime="3100.856">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    In the state court.

    Yes Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3105.619" stopTime="3111.249">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    So at least three other ways without resorting to habeas corpus.
speaker="walter_c_kurtz" startTime="3111.249" stopTime="3133.652">
    Mr. Walter C. Kurtz 
    That's correct, there are alternatives available but I think that there are legitimate differences between the exclusionary rule and the rule in this case it does not appear that we are going to be able to get and my time is up now, thank you very much. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of William M. Leech
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3133.652" stopTime="3140.693">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have anything further Mr. Attorney General.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3140.693" stopTime="3228.342">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please court. 
    Just very briefly I would conclude that the Fourteenth Amendment rights have not always universally, uniformly been protected by vehicle of habeas corpus such as where a state law requires that the plea be filed in advance and if it isn't done, then the individual will be barred from raising it for not having raised it timely. 
    Another is in a case where there is a guilty plea as in Pollock (ph) and where guilty plea some 20 years later the defendant could not come back to be heard and I would simply say that there are other means for attacking discrimination in the systematic exclusions of members of recognized classes from participation in society whether it be the appointee, whether or not it's a school board appointment or whether it affects the judiciary, if it affects the judiciary, then the Supreme Court of the state involved may by its inherent rule making power promulgate guidelines and procedures to follow for the trial bench and the functioning through its appointed powers. 
    In addition to the class action in the traditional legal note--
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3228.342" stopTime="3233.111">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Attorney General, you are not suggesting this court to promulgate rules for the Tennessee courts to follow, are you?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3233.111" stopTime="3253.885">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Oh no sir I said the state court, if the Supreme Court of the State of Tennessee perceives that, this is a state wide system we have, and perceives that there have been numerous violations or its not working as a system because the --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3253.885" stopTime="3265.168">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What if as in this case where the Supreme Court of Tennessee perceived there was no problem and federal judges thought there was a problem. 
    Then would, doesn't that -- the heart of the matter?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3265.168" stopTime="3292.216">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    That's the heart of the matter, yes sir I would say that as opposes the deterrent factor under which the rationale of federal habeas corpus has been used here for in Fourteenth Amendment question. 
    We are simply saying in modern context today that ample remedy is available and that -- in this kind of case where a full and fair, impartial hearing has already transpired that should be limited.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3292.216" stopTime="3308.620">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well is it, it is generally considered a full fair and impartial hearing when the judge who's conduct in under review is the judge who is reviewing that conduct, which is what we had here. 
    The trial judge was passing on the sufficiency of his own handling of the matter, wasn't he?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3308.620" stopTime="3313.916">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    He was passing on the plea in abatement which went to the selection of the foreman juror --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3313.916" stopTime="3314.189">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which he had --
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3314.189" stopTime="3316.568">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    -- which would be his appointment, yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3316.568" stopTime="3325.637">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is that normally that a fair and adequate -- full and fair hearing of the issue when you have this -- the judge trying himself in effect?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3325.637" stopTime="3332.335">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Your Honor, he would be trying the issue presented to him as to whether or not there was, and he did submit --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3332.335" stopTime="3340.720">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The challenge was that he had not followed a proper procedure, that was the challenge and then he is the one who decided whether or not he followed a proper procedure?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3340.720" stopTime="3368.995">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Once much -- if Your Honor please once it might fall in the proper procedures so much it was the charge of being discriminating by intentionally and excluding black and I don't think that when his affidavit is read as a whole submitted into the record is what he said, simply said he seldom ever appointed people and when he did he simply reappointed those who had been there and then he had to consider.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3368.995" stopTime="3373.129">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And then he reviewed his own affidavit and decided that that didn't show discrimination?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3373.129" stopTime="3387.316">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir and then he also presided to go further as a trial judge for the petit jury but then that was reviewed by Criminal Court of Appeals in reviewing the entire record and the Supreme Court in reviewing the record.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3387.316" stopTime="3408.939">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    But the issue as to full and fair trail as I have understood it didn't relate to whether or not foreman of the grand jury had been properly selected, the issue so far has habeas corpus being a proper remedy it relates to whether or not there was a full and fair trial of the defendant by the petit jury and the judge who presided over it.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3408.939" stopTime="3414.882">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    On the merits of the indictment --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3414.882" stopTime="3427.207">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well that's a different test in the Stone against Powell test, on the Stone against Powell, the issue on the full and fair hearing isn't just a trial it's whether there was a hearing on the issue whether or not the evidence had been illegally seized, isn't that right?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3427.207" stopTime="3428.760">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir and I think it --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3428.760" stopTime="3434.510">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is that what you are asking for or you are just saying whenever there is a fair trial that's the end of the matter, it's kind of an extension as Stone against Powell?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3434.510" stopTime="3448.893">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    No sir, I am not saying that at all. 
    I am saying that it does involve. 
    We say there was a full and fair hearing on the plea in abatement itself, but that did not go to the trial of the case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3448.893" stopTime="3464.233">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yeah, but in order for your theory of Stone against Powell to apply, we would have to decide if there was a full and fair hearing by the judge on the issue of discrimination in picking the grand jury foreman. 
    Isn't that right?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3464.233" stopTime="3480.961">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    I don't know maybe I missed it but I was under the impression that we were -- that our theory is that there was a full and fair hearing on every aspect of the -- in the accusatory spectrum including a full appellate review and post conviction --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3480.961" stopTime="3482.879">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well let's make it precise.
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3482.879" stopTime="3483.554">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    -- as a system.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3483.554" stopTime="3501.551">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If there was a not a full and fair hearing at the trial court level in the state system on the question whether the grand jury foreman had been picked improperly. 
    If there was not a full and fair hearing by the trial judge in Tennessee, would or would not Stone against Powell bar review, in your view?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3501.551" stopTime="3506.433">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    Yes sir it would be reviewable in the state court, if the state court felt that he, that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3506.433" stopTime="3510.939">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, no, I say would it be reviewed on the federal court on that hypothesis?
speaker="william_m_leech" startTime="3510.939" stopTime="3517.552">
    Mr. William M. Leech 
    No sir under our, under our contention that that it should be expanded to include this as a --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3517.552" stopTime="3526.977">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And you would say Stone against Powell would bar it even if there was not a fair hearing by the State trial judge on the issue raised in the federal habeas corpus proceeding?
