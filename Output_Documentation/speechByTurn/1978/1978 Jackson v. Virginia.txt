    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The issue before the Court today is whether a federal district court should issue a writ of habeas corpus when there is insufficient evidence in the state court record to convince a rational trier of fact of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    A statement of the relevant proceedings is as follows. 
    The petitioner, James A. Jackson, who was tried and convicted of first-degree murder in the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
    Briefly, the evidence indicated that he had shot the deceased, Mrs. Mary Cole twice, that several shots were fired at the scene. 
    That he engaged in target practice that day. 
    However, there was an extensive evidence indicating he consumed a large amount of alcohol, and shortly before the death of Mrs. Cole, the two of them had drank two-fifths of whiskey, a fifth of some other alcoholic beverage, it was not divulged in the record, and an undetermined amount of beer. 
    He admitted to the shooting in the statement made to the police but indicated it was in self-defense. 
    He then unsuccessfully appealed this case to the Virginia Supreme Court. 
    He thereupon filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. 
    In which he made numerous allegations, including an allegation that his conviction for first-degree murder was unsupported by evidence of premeditation. 
    The District Court judge thereupon searched the record and determined that he could find no evidence of premeditation to be found.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have the impression from your earlier remarks that the case was being tried by a federal court.
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="227.124" stopTime="229.529">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    No, no. 
    The District Court judge --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="229.529" stopTime="230.997">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    There's federal difference, isn't there?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="230.997" stopTime="322.574">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Yes, yes there is Your Honor. 
    The District Court judge searched the state court record, and determined that he could not find evidence of premeditation. 
    He then dismissed the other allegations for failure to exhaust the court remedies. 
    The State of Virginia thereupon filed a timely notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    The Fourth Circuit in a per curium opinion reversed the findings of the District Court judge and held that it could find some evidence of premeditation and need not search the record any further then just say -- need not search the record in any further to see if a rational trier of fact could've found guilt beyond the reasonable doubt, whereupon, we filed petition for writ of certiorari to this Court. 
    Both the District Court and the Federal Court of Appeals applied Virginia law, whereupon one may be so intoxicated as to be incapable of deliberation. 
    In addition, both courts applied the holding of the 1960 case of Thompson versus City of Louisville, which held that it was a violation of due process to convict and punish a person without some evidence of guilt. 
    It is our contention that it is also a violation of due process to convict and punish a person when no rational trier of fact could've found guilt beyond the reasonable doubt.

    I think the --

    This was a question of degree.
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="352.901" stopTime="357.308">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Certainly it is a question of degree. 
    We personally have no --

    They have no difference in Thompson and Louisville.
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="360.282" stopTime="377.843">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Well I think the holdings of this Court after Thompson in at least four years after about 1974, indicated that there has to be some evidence of every element of the offense. 
    We're indicating that there is no evidence of premeditation.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="377.843" stopTime="381.785">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well do you think -- do you think he should go free?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="381.785" stopTime="420.648">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The respondents have addressed the issue of what can be done even if this Court found that there was insufficient evidence. 
    I think the common belief is that he could not be retried for first-degree murder due to the double jeopardy cause of the Constitution. 
    However, we would agree that he could either be sent back to the state courts for re-sentencing for second degree or for a retrial, because the only issue has been premeditation, a necessary element of first-degree murder not second degree.

    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="431.938" stopTime="446.775">

    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- a conviction that is for in a state court, or only that the jury be instructed that they must find guilt beyond the reasonable doubt. 
    That's the real question, isn't it?

    Yes, well --

    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Your Honor, it's our contention that In re Winship, which held the due process clause as a Fourteenth Amendment requires that there be proof beyond the reasonable doubt. 
    Certainly, a jury instruction to the effect that the jury can not convict unless there is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    It is insufficient if in fact that jury has found guilt beyond the reasonable doubt.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="498.948" stopTime="513.486">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mrs. Colville, the facts of Winship, were that the trial judge stated that he could find these particular defendant's guilty by a preponderance of the evidence, but he couldn't bring himself to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="513.486" stopTime="514.205">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's right.
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="514.205" stopTime="554.050">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Certainly, yes, Your Honor. 
    I believe that this Court in addressing the issue with the juvenile indicated that in a juvenile proceeding that there can not be a conviction unless the tragedy has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    Now arguably, the federal courts have said that this is only a jury instruction. 
    However, at least four courts and at least two appeals courts in the context of a direct appeal have indicated that In re Winship requires that there would be proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="554.050" stopTime="559.838">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How do you define -- where do you get your definition of beyond a reasonable doubt from?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="559.838" stopTime="571.212">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    From In re Winship, which held that the Due Process Clause requires this in a criminal setting that there must be -- that you could not convict a person unless there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="571.212" stopTime="590.567">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I realize that, but I presume that if your argument were accepted by this Court, other courts would have to decide was there or was there not proof “beyond a reasonable doubt.”

    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Your Honor, that's not an easy question.

    No, it isn't.
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="595.488" stopTime="605.662">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    -- that in -- that it has been a standard. 
    This has been generally accepted in both the federal and state courts for some time. 
    And I think --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="605.662" stopTime="608.534">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    For some time, it was accepted before the Constitution was developed, wasn't it?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="608.534" stopTime="633.459">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    It has been accepted for some time and I think that the courts are far more familiar with that standard than the “no evidence” standard of Thompson, which I submit is a far more difficult standard for our court to apply than beyond the reasonable doubt. 
    The courts are familiar with beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    They have not been with the “no evidence” rule of Thompson.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="633.459" stopTime="646.500">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But you are not prepared at least now to expand on simply the phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” in offering guidances to how courts would analyze transcripts under situations like this?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="646.500" stopTime="651.448">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Well certainly, well, Your Honor, if you mean by can we offer a definition?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="651.448" stopTime="651.548">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes.
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="651.548" stopTime="697.710">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    No. 
    I think what we can offer is that if this Court adopted our position, does the Due Process Clause requires this? 
    And that it is something that is cognizable in a writ of habeas corpus. 
    What we would be suggesting is that the federal district court would give great deference to the findings of the state. 
    We're not suggesting that there would be a great overruling on the state court cases. 
    What we're saying is, if there's conflict of testimony, the conflict should in most cases be favoring the state. 
    We're not asking a second guessing. 
    We were asking if there is a clear issue of innocence here then the federal courts should intervene.

    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    In Virginia, there has not been a ruling indicating that In re Winship requires a proof beyond a reasonable doubt for this state to overrule the lower court findings.

    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, we've realized that initial years, this Court has been cutting back the scope of habeas corpus out of considerations of committee and federalism, particularly in cases where someone did not exhaust their state court remedies or someone didn't object, or in particularly the Stone versus Powell which have put great emphasis on in our brief, where the exclusionary rule was involved which this Court held that frustrated the criminal process. 
    However, we would urge the court to particularly look at footnote 31 of that case where it was indicated that innocence is at the heart of habeas corpus cause what we are in fact arguing here that if the evidence was not sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact then that person was technically innocent of that offense. 
    Now, in that footnote, the Court discussed various states rights interest, including federalism, state autonomy fiction. 
    However, the clear implication of it is that innocence should be of overriding importance, and I think that's basically what it boils down to here. 
    That innocence should be of importance to the writ of habeas corpus and that considerations of committee and federalism should of secondary importance.

    Mrs. Colville, could I ask you a question about your theory as to why there -- rather why the judgment is arbitrary of premeditation issue. 
    Is it because you think no rational judge could conclude that the defendant was not intoxicated, or is it because you argue that no rational judge could find that shooting twice and reloading the gun and shooting from only a half an inch away and so forth, could be evidence of premeditation?

    No, Your Honor we would not agree that that would be some evidence.

    But apparently, he felt embarrassed by them coming up swaggering, bloodshot eyes and he wanted them out. 
    I think he also indicated that he wanted badly to get back inside the café. 
    He went outside with him but wanted to get back in the copy with his -- the other police officers.

    Really, that's what I thought your argument was Mrs. Colville, not what their result should be in this case, on the facts of this case, but rather that the federal courts and federal habeas corpus since the Winship case which came in after the Thompson case are obligated by the Constitution to apply a different test and a different rule than was applied here.

    And that we feel that the innocence of the person should be of overwriting importance in looking at other state considerations, but the overall, yes. 
    We're asking the federal writ of habeas corpus be issued if no rational trier of fact could've found guilt beyond the reasonable doubt for that particular offense.

    I don't know whether you mean to suggest that that is the only conceivable factor to be considered.

    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    No, but I think when -- I think in granting writ of habeas corpus, we have to look at if there is been a deprivation to due process rights then I think other principles can come into play. 
    This Court has, in the last few years, indicated comity and federalism in Francis versus Henderson, Estelle versus Williams, and Wainwright versus Sykes that these other things would come into play. 
    But that when innocence is at the heart of the argument, the innocence is at the heart of the right involved then that should be of overwriting importance.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But Patterson against New York was a direct appeal here from the state court, so there wasn't any problem of comity on federal habeas. 
    And it was in that case that the Court said that punishment of those found guilty by a jury is not forbidden merely because there is a remote possibility in some instances that an innocent person might go to jail.
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="1504.693" stopTime="1518.203">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1518.203" stopTime="1537.311">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes well but that was on exclusionary sense, in the sense that if you -- if there was no -- if the claim made had no bearing on innocence, perhaps it couldn't be treated in federal habeas. 
    But there's never been any suggestion that any federal constitutional claim couldn't be treated on direct review here as was the case in Patterson.
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="1537.311" stopTime="1548.669">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Certainly, Your Honor.

   Argument of Marshall Coleman
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1548.669" stopTime="1561.825">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Attorney General.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1561.825" stopTime="1639.169">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and if it may please the Court. 
    This case does present the narrow legal issue of whether or not the some evidence standard that was established in the Thompson against City of Louisville case should be overturned in favor of a rule of proof beyond a reasonable doubt upon a collateral attack by writ of habeas corpus of a Virginia or state judgment. 
    And it is our position that those two cases are thoroughly consistent one with the other, and that as the Chief Justice has suggested, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been employed in the several states for time out of mind. 
    And in fact, is the standard in Virginia and upon review by the Virginia Supreme Court, the test is whether a rational juror could decide and hold that proof had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    We have review by transcript already in Virginia. 
    When someone files a petition for writ to our Virginia Supreme Court, he is not entitled to a hearing, but he is entitled to a review of the record to determine on the question of sufficiency of the evidence whether that is shown in the transcript.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1639.169" stopTime="1658.864">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But not -- despite your practice since time in memorial in the State of Virginia, not until the Winship case was it squarely decided that the federal constitution required that a state prove a person guilty beyond a reasonable doubt before it could convict them, isn't it?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1658.864" stopTime="1681.759">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    My reading of Winship is that the Court was sitting in that case that as to a juvenile trial, the proof had to be beyond a reasonable doubt if the preponderance of the evidence was not sufficient, and that less there be any doubt it would say as a matter of constitutional law, that was the rule. 
    But I have cited some cases here that I think suggested that that was not a new rule, whether it was one that was applicable.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1681.759" stopTime="1688.181">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well certainly not a new rule in the common law, but I -- it's my understanding that not until the Winship case had it been squarely decided by this Court that it's constitutional --
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1688.181" stopTime="1691.145">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    I think that's right, it was constitutionalized at that point clearly.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1691.145" stopTime="1711.113">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right and since it was constitutionalized at that point and since it's been the practice since time almost in memorial, a federal courts on federal habeas corpus to apply constitutional test to state criminal convictions. 
    Why shouldn't the rule of Winship be the applicable test now that Winship's been decided which came after Thompson?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1711.113" stopTime="1719.286">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well I think for several reasons. 
    I think the reasons that have already been alluded to of the effective use of resources, federalism, comity, avoiding friction --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1719.286" stopTime="1724.824">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well on that basis we could just not consider First Amendment questions, for example.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1724.824" stopTime="1725.703">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well that's certainly correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1725.703" stopTime="1727.497">

    That will save some time.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1727.497" stopTime="1736.458">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    It would save some time, but in this case you see there is never -- the case is tried first in the state court then it's taken on appeal.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.

    Yes.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1739.912" stopTime="1741.457">

    And then the question there becomes --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1741.457" stopTime="1743.231">

    And that's true on any federal habeas corpus.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1743.231" stopTime="1743.870">

    It is, except --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1743.870" stopTime="1745.726">

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    That's right, but with respect to sufficiency of the evidence first. 
    That is an objection that any defendant can make. 
    So that the resources of the court, if it has to go through and have another trial by transcript would be monumental and it would engage the resources of the federal courts to the extent that it would be using up the time of the courts that could better be focused to --

    But it seems to me that the Court could consider in this case that since there is an interest in cutting back on these cases and the rule of Stone against Powell is that if there has been an opportunity for a full and fair hearing in the state court that there is no need to redo that in the federal court and that --

    Now surely that's a federal question which could've reviewed?

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    That's right and --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1875.660" stopTime="1879.650">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And we might have disagreed with your Supreme Court and reversed this conviction?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1879.650" stopTime="1880.339">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    That's right.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1880.339" stopTime="1890.272">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And now your suggestion is that we ought -- litigants ought to be limited to come in to us directly and review from state courts rather than go into federal habeas?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1890.272" stopTime="1894.710">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well I'm making -- I'm making that suggestion to the Court. 
    First --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Why, don't we have enough to do up here?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1898.101" stopTime="1905.206">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    I'm suggesting to the Court if they come up on direct review that's sufficient to protection and check and supervision over what's happening to peoples --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1905.206" stopTime="1912.685">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Oh now, you know what's -- you know something about the happenstance of certiorari grants, don't you?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1912.685" stopTime="1923.382">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    I do. 
    I realize that and I'm suggesting that habeas corpus could still exist for the purpose of determining whether there had been an opportunity for a full and fair hearing, but once there has been given that --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1923.382" stopTime="1937.872">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But as I understand your argument, perhaps I misunderstand it, you suggest we ought to foreclose habeas review in cases like this and limit the review if there's to be any federal review to direct review by this Court of your higher state court?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1937.872" stopTime="1957.030">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    I'm suggesting to the Court to consider that as a possibility. 
    We have urged in this case first of all that the Thompson rule should be maintained, we think that's very important. 
    But in view of the cases that have occurred recently, the Wainwright case and Estelle and Francis and Stone against Powell that would certainly be consistent with our line.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1957.030" stopTime="1959.912">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That's no secret to you, I didn't agree with any of those.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1959.912" stopTime="1967.756">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    I read that. 
    Your Honor, as I would say simply that in this case that could change --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1967.756" stopTime="1972.405">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well surely Stone against Powell is different form this case, isn't it?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1972.405" stopTime="1972.862">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well in Stone --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1972.862" stopTime="1985.206">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Of course you adversary's argument has in his substance that innocence is involved and is at the heart of federal habeas.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="1985.206" stopTime="2005.605">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    That was not true in Stone against Powell. 
    I think it is different but it seems to me that the principle makes sense across the board, because Stone against Powell is saying “if there's an opportunity for a full and fair hearing, there needs to be an end” and has been said in one of the cases that if a thing could be done well once there's no need to do it twice.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2005.605" stopTime="2012.240">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Of course we haven't pursued Stone against Powell every time we've been asked to.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2012.240" stopTime="2012.338">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    I understand that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2012.338" stopTime="2025.071">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Your argument would lead, I should think inexorably to the conclusion that if there has been a valid conviction in the state court, that's the end of the matter. 
    There can never be habeas corpus.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2025.071" stopTime="2025.990">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well as far as sufficiency of evidence is concerned.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2025.990" stopTime="2037.034">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I mean that would've denied review in Thompson against Louisville. 
    Obviously the police court in Louisville there thought that there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt or it would not have convicted Thompson.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2037.034" stopTime="2041.414">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well there've always be the opportunity for direct review, and there've always be I think Your Honor --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I know but -- that of course there's opportunity for discretionary direct review, the petition for certiorari here. 
    But we're talking here about federal habeas corpus and it seems to me that your argument leads ineluctably to the conclusion that federal habeas corpus is never available if there's been a valid state court conviction.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2062.411" stopTime="2064.844">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well I think it is available for the Court to determine --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    For what?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2065.204" stopTime="2070.751">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    -- the question of the opportunity of the full and fair hearing, I don't think that's been completely flushed out I don't think we know exactly what the confines were of.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2070.751" stopTime="2075.320">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But when there's been a full and fair hearing that's the end of the matter. 
    There's no federal habeas corpus ever.

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    For sufficiency of the evidence.

speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2080.136" stopTime="2087.219">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well I think what the effect of habeas corpus would be is to see still if constitutional rights are being violated. 
    If there's not in fact a full and fair --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2087.219" stopTime="2096.859">
    Justice Potter Stewart

speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2096.859" stopTime="2102.736">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    I think that under Winship, the only test would be had that -- has that standard of proof been applied in the case.

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well there couldn't be argument about what standard they were supposed to apply but the law in Virginia is that the judge is supposed to apply the same standard that the trier of fact does.

    I think that as long as the standard --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I'm just being helpful that's all.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But what if, to go a little further with my brother Marshall's suggestion and this had been a jury trial and there had been absolutely perfect instructions on the duty of a jury not to convict until it found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and on the presumption of innocence and all the rest of it. 
    But that in fact the evidence was no stronger than it was in Thompson against Louisville and the Court of Appeals had the state appellant system erroneously, let's assume, had held the instructions were fine and we think the evidence was sufficient under that standard. 
    Now is a federal district court absolutely foreclosed from examining it?

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    If you adopt the standard, I think that you're in the same position that you're in with Wainwright that you are cut off because of procedural default there.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, there's no procedural default at all. 
    There'd been pursuit of state remedies and --

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    I think you're right, as long as there's the ability to raise that question and get a full and fair hearing under those standards that's the end of it.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's the end of federal habeas corpus. 
    That's what I thought you argued.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2245.739" stopTime="2276.171">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Now, my point on that Your Honor is simply that there is I think in this Court a greater sensitivity to the integrity and capacities of the state courts. 
    There's a growing recognition that the state courts are well able to apply federal law, to administer their state criminal laws and that as long as they are doing that, that there's no reason to retry cases, to duplicate effort and to expand the time between when someone is charged and when the case is over.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2276.171" stopTime="2283.114">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well that I argument I think leads to overruling Thompson against Louisville at least in so far as its applicability to collateral attack goes?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2283.114" stopTime="2283.851">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    I think that's right.

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2286.163" stopTime="2289.654">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Not that it's -- I don't agree that it's necessarily right.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2289.654" stopTime="2320.074">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well obviously, in order to uphold the judgment of the Fourth Circuit. 
    It's not necessary for the Court to go this far, and the chief thrust of my brief obviously is simply that the standard of Louisville against Thompson is still the correct application, except that the court wants to go further and break out and into a new area and say “As far as sufficiency as the evidence is concerned we're satisfied the state courts can do it and do it well.” 
    And that's been the experience in the past. 
    I think that the --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2320.074" stopTime="2322.719">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well that would be of an expansion of Stone against Powell, wouldn't it?

    Through this kind of --

    And where you have a judge trial without a jury trial, why can he do the same thing? 
    He's a former state judge.

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well it be true in people that had gone before a jury in a different manner --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2406.719" stopTime="2406.827">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Yes.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2406.827" stopTime="2510.418">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    -- I suppose because you'd be cutting off, you'd be chilling somewhat, I suppose, their interest in taking the jury trial. 
    But I think that he would be just as capable. 
    The question that all of this raises in my mind is that who is to say what is a correct verdict? 
    A judge is -- disagree on points that are very particularized and very slight in many cases, it's been said by Justice Jackson that this Court is infallible because it's final and it's not final because it's infallible. 
    There could be a different disposition if we had another level of appellate courts. 
    We have one judge in Chesterfield agreeing and thinking its proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and we have the District Court disagreeing that Fourth Circuit comes back and says “Well it takes another view, it's okay.” 
    This Court might have a third or fourth view and then there might be, if it were tried in a different form. 
    So the point is, it seems to me that is a very important consideration not to be dismissed out of hand that the finality of these proceedings and the dignity and integrity of the state courts is of such a level now that the Court might consider departing and in fact contracting the expansion of habeas corpus. 
    This would give the Court, it seems to me, the ability to look very carefully at the fewer needles in the haystack, because in looking for all those needles sometimes I think it almost comes to the point is it worth finding and will we recognize when we see them? 
    Hundreds of pages of transcripts gone through, I think even for applying the some evidence standard, obviously it's much easier but it's still a tremendous job. 
    And so I would simply suggest to the Court that the state courts know how to administer the criminal laws --

    You had a full canvas by the state procedures of the facts. 
    It's going to the appellate review. 
    You've got judges that are experienced and practiced in these matters and that that could be the end of it consistent with the constitutional obligation.

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    It's not and I think when you take weigh all these habeas corpus petitions you're going to have an ability to render more suits.

    -- you think the habeas -- federal habeas statute was intended as a substitute or an additional layer of review in the conventional sense of review?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2700.432" stopTime="2726.714">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well the habeas statute has of course been a changing thing over the years. 
    It seems to me that its idea was the vindication of fairness, of due process, the constitutional rights that all people in the country have. 
    And I think its expansion has grown, it was originally thought, I believe, to contest only matters of jurisdiction. 
    There's a historical disagreement of --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2726.714" stopTime="2734.918">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The scope of the federal judge in Virginia then is not the same as the scope of the highest court in the State of Virginia.

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well I don't think it is.

    General Coleman, I don't know whether you are in on the initial habeas proceedings or not, but I notice on page 25 of the appendix that the case not only has a civil number, it has a magistrate number. 
    Do you know whether this case was originally referred by the habeas judge to a magistrate?

    No, it wasn't.

    Mr. Attorney General, another easy one. 
    It's true that according to this record, nobody who has made a decision in this case has shown any expertise in when the man is too drunk to know what he has done, up until now, isn't that right?

    Yes, I mean we don't know how he knows when a man is too drunk.

    Yes, exactly.

    You could.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2828.187" stopTime="2829.532">

    Instructs himself.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2833.540" stopTime="2836.475">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I said but there's nothing in the record to show it.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2836.475" stopTime="2837.033">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well the point that I would --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2837.033" stopTime="2848.997">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The composition is that he has trained as a Virginia judge to do the same thing a jury does, and he does it that way --
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2848.997" stopTime="2912.380">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    He does it and he's familiar with the law. 
    The question of finality that is being raised here I think is an important one because in so many other issues a person is not set free if we find ten years later that somebody didn't commit the crime because another person confesses to its remedy as executive clemency. 
    It seems to me that in a state trial when a person has gone through the trial and has appealed the matter and found guilty that that should be the end of it. 
    And so I would like to conclude by saying that all I would urge the Court to consider the application of Stone against Powell, drawing the line as I have suggested on these questions of sufficiency of the evidence on the theory that if a job can be done once well there's no reason to do it twice. 
    If the Court does not feel that it wants to do -- make that departure, clearly the rule of Thompson against City of Louisville is applicable and is not inconsistent with In re Winship. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Carolyn J. Colville

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have anything further, Mrs. Colville?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="2915.752" stopTime="2956.769">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Your Honor, just a very brief statement about what exactly we are seeking. 
    We are seeking that there be a standard in habeas corpus that no -- if no rational trier of fact could've found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, then the writ of habeas corpus should issue. 
    In this particular case, we would ask either that the Court decide as to the facts of the case or that be remanded to the Fourth Circuit, who had already indicated that it had some doubts in its mind about the applicable law without further guidance felt they had to apply to Thompson. 
    We've either ask that the Court apply to the facts of the case or remand it for the Fourth Circuit to apply. 
    Thank you.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2956.769" stopTime="2981.093">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mrs. Colville, let me ask you one question if I might? 
    I suppose one could apply your standard to a trial that took 20 days and had 80 witnesses and a transcript of many thousands of pages. 
    And is the procedure you contemplate that would just simply be submitted to the habeas judge for his perusal or referral by him to a magistrate if that was his inclination?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="2981.093" stopTime="2998.314">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Well, my basic inclination is that the transcript would go to the federal district judge. 
    He would then have the benefit of the wisdom of the state court, plus the -- any pleadings found on behalf of the state. 
    He could then look at those in order to swiftly review that particular transcript.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2998.314" stopTime="3001.479">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How would you swiftly review several thousand pages?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="3001.479" stopTime="3022.708">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Well I think what I'm saying is that it would be far more easier if the state says “This is where we say that there's reasonable doubt.” 
    I think the court could then look at it to see if indeed this does create reasonable doubt. 
    I think it would be an easier process if they are being guided somewhat as to what the state says the reasonable doubt exists.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3022.708" stopTime="3027.073">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Like a sufficiency of evidence argument on appeal, say the Supreme Court of Virginia?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="3027.073" stopTime="3028.456">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    Certainly.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mrs. Colville, you just gave me an answer that I know but I'm just little confused. 
    Is the standard you proposed the same as the standard that's applied in direct review in Virginia?
speaker="carolyn_j_colville" startTime="3038.125" stopTime="3044.152">
    Ms. Carolyn J. Colville 
    No, Your Honor, I could not find that reasonable doubt was the rule applied in Virginia, no.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3044.152" stopTime="3046.259">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So it's somewhat narrower standard I would presume then?
