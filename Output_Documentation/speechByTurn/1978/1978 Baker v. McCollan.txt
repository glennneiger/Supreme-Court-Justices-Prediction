Baker v. McCollan

    The case is submitted. 
    We'll hear arguments next in 752, Baker against McCollan. 
    Mr. SoRelle, I think you may proceed now.

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Respondent brought this Section 1983 action alleging a violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. 
    The facts are basically uncontroverted. 
    Respondent was born December 8, 1949 and originally given the name Linny spelled L-I-N-N-Y, C-A-R-R-O-L-L, McCollon with an O-N. 
    He informally adopted the name in which he uses today in this proceeding with the different spelling of Linnie, middle name Carl, and McCollan with an A-N. 
    The date of birth significant only because later in by 1972 respondent had a Texas driver's license identifying him as Linnie Carl McCollan and through error the birth date of December 8, 1948 was inserted and even though he knew of it did not correct it and therefore it became part of his assumed identity.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="139.382" stopTime="144.081">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And whose date of birth was that?
speaker="a_w_sorelle_iii" startTime="144.081" stopTime="206.784">
    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    No one that we know of, Your Honor. 
    These facts would not be particularly significant except for the remarkable coincidence and I say a coincidence because that's all the record will support that respondent's older brother whose true name was Leonard decided in 1972 to adopt the identical assumed name and went so far as to seek a duplicate driver's license in the name of Linnie Carl McCollan. 
    Unfortunate, through some error of Department of Public Safety the same was issued and older brother Leonard had a driver's license but identified him as Linnie Carl McCollan date of birth December 8, 1948. 
    All information is the same including the driver's license number being identical but the only difference in the two driver's license is being the photographs on the license themselves. 
    Then unfortunately, Leonard posing his --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="206.784" stopTime="209.244">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Did (Inaudible) save him?
speaker="a_w_sorelle_iii" startTime="209.244" stopTime="376.517">
    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Yes, sir. 
    Probably, I think you're absolutely correct. 
    It would've said that duplicate on the one that Leonard had in any case, that you're right, it would have (Inaudible) it. 
    But other than the duplicate words and the photograph, the identifying information was identical. 
    Leonard acting as Linnie was then arrested in October of 1972 on a drug violation was booked as Linnie Carl McCollan was released on bail as Linnie Carl McCollan signed all the papers that he signed as Linnie McCollan and then left to town presumably because his bonds been later surrendered the bond in sought to have a warrant issued for the missing Linnie Carl McCollan. 
    The Justice of the Peace dutifully issued a warrant for the arrest of Linnie Carl McCollan, a copy of which is in the appendix. 
    One significant item in this point, the warrant was issued on November 3, 1972. 
    This suit is against petitioner Baker who was sheriff of Potter County but he was not sheriff of Potter County up till this time. 
    In fact, certain events happened one in this case, one being the death of Sheriff Gaither, his predecessor. 
    Sheriff Baker was then appointed on November 28, 1972, newly in office. 
    Then the respondent becomes involved when on December 26, 1972,a Dallas police officer stopped the respondent for traffic violation reported the name and identifying information through their central office and was informed that there was a Potter County warrant outstanding for Linnie Carl McCollan. 
    He dutifully arrested him, took him to the station, a respondent protested that he wasn't the man wanted and there's no evidence of whether this was a unique statement but in any case the police officer did ask his superior to contact Potter County. 
    They compared the identifying information and as you might expect said no, this is the man, that's the man we want with a warrant. 
    In December 30th, Potter County Deputy with a warrant went to Dallas, picked up respondent, returned him to the Potter County Jail, evening of December 30th. 
    Sheriff Baker against doing this action was brought -- was not present at the jail at that time, had left the evening and was going to be gone over the New Year's holidays and even though he had contact with his office received no notice of any protest by respondent that he was not the right man wanted.

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well then and by what? 
    Did the respondent Linnie Carl McCollan give it to his brother?
speaker="a_w_sorelle_iii" startTime="405.622" stopTime="448.699">
    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Mr. McCollan said in the trial that he didn't know how his older brother came by the information. 
    It was demonstrated that the applicant for the duplicate license himself the applicant which would've been Leonard gave the specific identifying information. 
    Respondent admitted that his brother would have no way of knowing that he had an erroneous birth date on his driver's license that he had not told him and he didn't know how he knew this. 
    But in any case, there is no evidence in the record to support precisely how brother Leonard obtained the information.

    The --

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    No, sir, Your Honor, and this is the point that it's being raised by respondents in this case. 
    When Leonard was arrested as Linnie Carl McCollan, he was fingerprinted and photographed. 
    He was arrested and both to answer the police -- City Police Department then transferred to Potter County but Potter County also photographed and finger printed Leonard. 
    At the time they did not take and this is one of the points that respondent makes, they did not take fingerprints and photographs with them to Dallas when they picked him up. 
    They returned him and apparently did not compare the photographs at that time. 
    Immediately, on January 2nd, when Sheriff Baker arrived back to jail was informed that a man was contending that he was not the correct Linnie Carl McCollan. 
    He immediately investigated, compared the photographs and they had the arresting officer had kept the duplicate driver's license that had been issued to Leonard for some reason or there was some problem with it and they brought respondent down from the jail. 
    The sheriff discussed it where the -- asking whose picture was on there. 
    He said it was his brother Leonard. 
    The sheriff acted on his own to release him, arranged transportation back to Dallas.

    But if they sent that to Dallas, that's all that have been avoided.

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    This is the assumption that it's made. 
    We don't know whether the photographs have been sent to Dallas certainly someone would have known sooner that the contention was real, he possibly wasn't the person. 
    Our question personally whether -- I don't know whether police office in general has the authority to make this determination but in fact they were not since, so there was no comparison made until the second --

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="619.903" stopTime="621.796">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    There were none to stop them from doing that one?
speaker="a_w_sorelle_iii" startTime="621.796" stopTime="919.189">
    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    No, sir and we're not -- we're certainly not contending there was. 
    Our initial position in this case is simply that we have not stated a violation of due process where there is arrest pursuant to a warrant that describes the individual in the warrant. 
    That the respondent's position on this would be tantamount to suggesting that due process not only requires identification to a warrant but that the most efficient means of identification must be used or one cannot rely upon the warrant and it is our position that in this case, there's the police officer has traditionally been held to the stand that he must have either a valid warrant and there's no contention this warrant is not valid or rely upon probable cause. 
    Here, the arrest was supported arrest and confinement by a valid warrant in the name of respondent. 
    That respondent as in the case of anyone who is arrested and later acquitted was determined not to be the one who should've been arrested. 
    He was released in due course through the investigation. 
    So, the threshold question we believe the Fifth Circuit overlooked was whether there was in fact a violation of due process because there was in fact a warrant for their arrest. 
    The Fifth Circuit reasoned from the reversed side of the case by concluding that being demonstrated after the fact that he should not have been arrested therefore it was a false imprisonment, that false imprisonment is an intentional tort and under their own case of Bryan versus Jones, it can be read to suggest that the only thing necessary for this tort is that someone was in fact confined. 
    He was aware of his confinement and suffered injury by it. 
    However, even under Bryan versus Jones, there was a preliminary finding and that is that there was a confinement without any process and it may be that under Monroe versus Pape, we can presume intent to confine without process when there is in fact no process. 
    But it seems a little farfetched to presume intent to confine without process when there was in fact process naming the person arrested. 
    Second difficulty with the Fifth Circuit's initial approach to the case is that they concluded that Sheriff Baker could be held responsible for the acts of his deputies and because it was necessary in this case to attribute the acts of the deputies to Sheriff Baker if he was to have liability. 
    They did so by simply suggesting that he is responsible for the acts of his deputies. 
    He authorized them to go so then in fact, he committed the confinement. 
    Again, we find it rather difficult to conclude that Sheriff Baker intended to confine the man when his first action upon learning that this particular man was confined was to investigate and release him. 
    And the only way we can get to Sheriff Baker on the confinement is to apply the doctrine of respondeat superior which we believe this Court should as well as in the city cases in Monell should extend your conclusion there that doctrine of respondeat superior should not apply to sheriffs either. 
    Respondents would take one further step and say that the sheriff in Texas is responsible for the acts of his deputies. 
    And he is statutory responsible for supervising his deputies and can be held as a surety for them but it would not be reasonable to use this is a basis for extending respondeat superior to the sheriff because then it would tend to make 1983 a variable statute depending on what state statutes happen to apply in any given jurisdiction. 
    The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that there might be some question here on respondeat superior so they then shifted their analysis to the sheriff and suggested that it should be the sheriff's own acts or conduct. 
    The sheriff did not act affirmably in any way to confine or restrain respondent. 
    Therefore, they suggested that it was a failure to act, a failure to have implemented a policy of transmitting photographs and fingerprints which he himself said after the fact as a result of this, he investigated and determined that this would be a good policy.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="919.189" stopTime="949.178">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    When you talk about respondeat superior, Mr. SoRelle, aren't you ordinarily talking about the liability of the supervisor for the negligence of his employees and here as I understand it the deputies were simply carrying out the instructions of the sheriff, that wouldn't be respondeat superior to say that the sheriff is liable if he directs one of his deputies to go and arrest somebody, would it?
speaker="a_w_sorelle_iii" startTime="949.178" stopTime="1016.780">
    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    No, Your Honor. 
    If he in fact he directed him to go arrest this particular person to what he authorized them to do to execute the warrant and I think it would be a little farfetched to suggest that he intended that they arrest the wrong man and that in authorizing a deputy to execute a warrant that he has then authorized them to misapply the process. 
    I understand your question and it's probably so but we're dealing here with the question of whether someone has committed intentional conduct and we -- it appears to me that we are taking a question of whether intentional conduct has been committed and presuming that the conduct has been. 
    I understand fully the position or I think I do that specific intent to violate the statute may not be required but it always has seemed to it in the past that this Court has required at least there be some intentional conduct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1016.780" stopTime="1028.869">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That's the point I'm worrying about. 
    If the sheriff said, it's my policy, don't check behind these warrants, go pick up whoever he is. 
    But that's not this case here.
speaker="a_w_sorelle_iii" startTime="1028.869" stopTime="1081.967">
    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    No, sir. 
    The sheriff certainly didn't suggest that in all the evidence in this case indicates the sheriff, number one, was displeased with it. 
    He acted the only affirmative conduct shown in this case by sheriff has all been in ultimate good faith. 
    The moment he had noticed he acted to release him. 
    The moment he investigated, determined what caused it he acted to change the policy. 
    We raised also in our briefs the evidentiary question that this in effect should not in any circumstance be evidence of negligence because of the federal rule or procedure that states that you don't use corrective action to prove the negligence of the initial action. 
    But our feeling is there is no intentional conduct directed toward depriving respondent of a federally protected right.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Suppose -- I think it's your position here is though that even no matter how negligent the sheriff might have been and then you say he wasn't negligent at all, no matter how negligent he might've been 1983 just doesn't reach that kind of conduct.

    The complete review, they were talking about crimes of deliberate failures to enforce the law, deliberate violations of person's rights.

    Mr. Douglas R. Larson 
    Your Honor, I don't know and I don't believe my client knows. 
    It's quite possible the record has several situations under which my client obtained driver's license. 
    It's quite possible that his brother may have stolen a copy of one of his several driver's license. 
    In fact, if you read the cross-examination by them you'll find that the plaintiff in this case and the trial court had several driver's licenses and he'd prone as he was to lose them. 
    He applied for more and it's quite possible, I would think that brother Leonard stole one of them but we don't know and we have no way of knowing and my client has insisted from the very beginning that he doesn't know how Leonard got his driver' license. 
    I want to say one other thing. 
    This isn't in the record but my client's parents were functionally illiterate and the mistakes on his birth certificate were due to their illiteracy and nothing else. 
    He was told all during his life that his birthday was the date that's on the driver's license. 
    At least that's my understanding of it and in addition to that, his name was misspelled because of mother then didn't know how to spell very well.

speaker="douglas_r_larson" startTime="1727.249" stopTime="1780.526">
    Mr. Douglas R. Larson 
    Yes, sir. 
    When Congress passes the statute, this was not done in a vacuum. 
    It was done with the idea that there were some causes of action that were automatically going to be engrafted because of the development of the common law, we're going to be automatically engrafted in 1983. 
    Now, this Court has already recognized in couple of cases in Pierson versus Ray, in Monroe versus Pape, false arrest case but I don't think this Court has ever had before it a false imprisonment case and it issues and or a little different in that -- in a false arrest case, you can use the defense of good faith. 
    But I don't think that applies in a false imprisonment case.

    Mr. Douglas R. Larson 
    That's correct and I also believe that the Constitution requires that the sheriff in this case arrest only the persons that are actually warranted pursuant to the warrant just because he has a warrant it says, “Arrest Linnie McCollan.” 
    That doesn't get him off the hook because he had the information which would've corrected the situation. 
    He had the fingerprints and the photographs --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1814.611" stopTime="1819.177">

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that's what I'm trying to ask you. 
    I mean, either -- is every single official or false arrest or false imprisonment a violation of the person's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights?
speaker="douglas_r_larson" startTime="1874.574" stopTime="1972.952">
    Mr. Douglas R. Larson 
    Yes. 
    Alright, I think it's helpful that if we -- when we study this case if we look at the law of torts because the law of torts gives us some guidance on how to establish these cases. 
    Pierson versus Ray and Monroe both teach us that the background of tort liability is to be used in helping to decide 1983 cases. 
    Now, as I understand it he's saying that there's no intent here under the common law false imprisonment. 
    The only intent that was required is the intent to imprison. 
    Well, there's certainly is an intent to imprison here because the plaintiff was imprinted -- imprison. 
    In addition to that, the common law and his -- in a restatement of tort says that a warrant can be relied on to a certain point but the sheriff or the jailer has to use due diligence to determine whether or not a person he is arresting is the person he actually wants. 
    In this case, the sheriff had the fingerprints and the photographs of the right person but he made no effort until several days later to compare it. 
    And this is not clear in the record as to how the sheriff finally came around to -- but in the plaintiff's deposition --

    They checked the Department of Public Safety and they've realized that it was a phony driver's license but they made no effort to change anything. 
    They knew he was operating under some wrong name and they knew that one has driver's license.

    The burden that someone is in jail and wants to get out shouldn't be place upon the person who is in the jail, It was to be placed upon the person who's causing to be there and that person is one who should be the person who has the duty to determine whether or not he is the one that he's suppose to have.

    Now, he may not be able to ascertain that until he gets him to the penitentiary or jail and checks out his records, or he may not have any way to check him out. 
    But he's got to use all the information at his hand to be sure he's got the right one. 
    You just can't arrest somebody, anybody because their name have to be the same.

    The sheriff said there is also a duty on the deputies who left Potter County and came to Dallas to take the fingerprints and mug shots with him but they didn't do it.

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Respondent's position boils down to this that the Due Process Clause now has a new recognized federal right and that being that if a man who's been previously arrested, no warrant for that man may be issued or exercise without using finger prints and photographs to identify the subsequent man.

    Not for the original arrest as I understood Mr. Larson.

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Well, Your Honor may I submit that due process then should not require that at any stage in this proceedings during this period of time simply because if plaintiff respondent in this case is going to demonstrate a -- an unreasonable method of identification then he should've approach it by showing that the method used was unreasonable. 
    I'm not suggesting that the corrective action instituted by the sheriff should have been used.

    Your brother Mr. Larson, we're not really talking about the arrest anymore and it seems to me that the complaint is rather the procedure is eradicate and you change the procedure but if your man is set up being over the weekend had been in Mexico for two weeks presumably the man would stay in jail for two weeks until the sheriff get back and you made precisely the same argument as long as he found out he let him out.

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Well, the point is that some place in here, this is a personal action against Sheriff Baker.

speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3392.835" stopTime="3396.071">
    Justice William O. Douglas

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Acted erroneously yes, sir. 
    But I -- it is my position that the procedures examined should be the procedures used and not the procedures not used if we're going to treat it as a tort.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3407.159" stopTime="3414.593">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, that's right and those procedures if the sheriff had been gone for three weeks under those procedures, this man ought to stay in jail for three weeks.

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    I don't believe so. 
    I think the evidence also shows that on coming back they would've also routinely process his -- the new photographs and ID made at the time (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3424.662" stopTime="3428.595">

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Well, I think the only testimony was that the ID man was not on duty during that period himself. 
    It was a matter that they were apparently shorthanded and didn't have a man on duty during that weekend. 
    And I believe that's the answer in those. 
    Our position is that there were procedures. 
    They in fact worked in this case, the problem being that there was a short delay.

    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    The Court of Appeals, yes sir, they finally determined that it should go back to determine whether the sheriff was unreasonable in failing to have previously instituted this policy.

speaker="a_w_sorelle_iii" startTime="3472.891" stopTime="3487.084">
    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    That would be a question fact and it was our position of course that this is a pure negligence issue and that if this Court affirms that holding that it would be extending 1983 to Simple Negligence Act.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3487.084" stopTime="3497.734">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So, under the Court of Appeals' holding the procedures used by the sheriff would be a question of facts for the jury in every case as to whether they confer to the Constitution?
speaker="a_w_sorelle_iii" startTime="3497.734" stopTime="3579.551">
    Mr. A. W. Sorelle III 
    Yes, sir. 
    So that in any allegation if a man was arrested confined later determined that he should not have been confined whether accorded by a jury or not presumably he would have a cause of action against the jailer to determine whether the jailer should've had investigated and determined earlier that he was the wrong man. 
    I submit, Your Honors, that in this case had Sheriff Baker or he would have been better-off had he done nothing taken this respondent before the magistrate having bound over for trial and ignored the -- any change have been -- his procedure then it would have been left up to the jury to determine his innocence because Sheriff Baker acted affirmatively to determine that this was the wrong man in releasing and then acted affirmatively to investigate and determine the better procedure by his own good faith acts created the sole evidence on which they Fifth Circuit determine to submit a cause to the jury. 
    The trial court considered that there was no violation of due process and direct the verdict. 
    The Fifth Circuit I believe erroneously placed it in contact with Royal versus Kautzky.
