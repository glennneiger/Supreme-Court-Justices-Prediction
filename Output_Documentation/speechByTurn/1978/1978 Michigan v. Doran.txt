    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have the judgment and opinion of the Court to announce in State of Michigan against Doran which involves the Extradition Clause of the Constitution and the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act. 
    And for reasons stated in an opinion for the Court filed with the clerk this morning, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan is reversed. 
    The case is remanded to that Court for further proceedings not in consistent with our opinion. Mr. Justice Blackmun with whom Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall joined filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.
