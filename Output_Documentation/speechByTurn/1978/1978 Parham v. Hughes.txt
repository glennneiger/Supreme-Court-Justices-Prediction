    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
    Under Georgia law, the mother of an illegitimate child can sue for the wrongful death of that child. 
    A father who has legitimated the child can also sue for the wrongful death of the child if there is no mother. 
    A father who has not legitimated a child however is precluded from maintaining a wrongful death action. 
    The question presented in this case is whether this statutory scheme violates the equal protection or Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying a father of an illegitimate child who has not legitimated the child the right to sue for the childâ€™s wrongful death. 
    The Supreme Court of Georgia held that the Georgia law does not violate the constitution. 
    For the reasons set out in an opinion I have filed this morning, which has been joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Justice Stevens, as well as the reasons set out in a concurring opinion filed by Mr. Justice Powell, the judgment is affirmed. 
    Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr. Justice Blackmun, have joined.
