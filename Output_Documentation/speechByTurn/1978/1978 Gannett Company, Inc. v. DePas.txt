    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 1301, Gannett Company against DePasquale. 
    Mr. Bernius you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="11.716" stopTime="35.443">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Thank Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I represent petitioner Gannett Company, Incorporated which seeks reversal of the judgment of the New York State Court of Appeals. 
    The question presented by this case is what restrictions to the First and Sixth Amendments placed upon a trial judge, rejects the public and press from a traditionally public suppression hearing in order to prevent press publication concerning that hearing.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="35.443" stopTime="42.782">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Do you place your argument principally on one amendment as against the other or on both?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="42.782" stopTime="54.986">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Your Honor, I believe our argument is based first on the First Amendment, secondly on the public trial clause of the Sixth Amendment. 
    They are two separate grounds --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="54.986" stopTime="56.396">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Which do you prefer?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="56.396" stopTime="121.755">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    I prefer neither Your Honor. 
    I think they're birth -- both equally important. 
    I think the damages in the First Amendment aspect are clear as are they in the Sixth Amendment. 
    The facts in this case are very brief. 
    Case arises out of the disappearance in mid-July 1976 of a Rochester man while fishing on the Finger Lakes in New York State. 
    Respondents Greathouse and Jones were subsequently arrested for his murder and in November 1976, a suppression hearing in the case was commenced before Judge DePasquale in Seneca County Court which is located approximately 40 miles from Rochester. 
    At the beginning of the hearing the defense attorney has requested that the public and press be ejected saying that evidence which might or may not be admitted at trial would be heard at the hearing. 
    Judge DePasquale with no inquiry or argument and without hearing any evidence whatsoever in -- or making any findings of fact ejected the public, ejected the press.

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    At the initial ejection, there was no colloquy at all concerning the availability of a transcript in the future. 
    During the hearing, the reporter, the Rochester newspaper reporter who had been excluded asked for postponement in order that attorneys might appear and argue that. 
    The postponement was denied and the hearing finished in secret on Friday afternoon. 
    On Monday morning, attorneys appeared for Gannett sought vacator of the order of closure and at that point since the hearing was over, we asked for access to the transcript. 
    Judge DePasquale heard argument on our motion but denied vacator of the order and also denied access to the transcript in perpetuity. 
    After the plea of guilty, he had a change of heart and released the transcript to the public which was --

speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="301.230" stopTime="347.636">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Yes Your Honor. 
    What happened were essentially two things. 
    We were notified about the situation immediately or shortly before the suppression hearing in the criminal case ended. 
    That was on a Friday afternoon and this is an outlying county. 
    On Monday morning, I essentially appeared as an interested party or as an amicus in the criminal case. 
    I went back to Judge DePasquale to ask him if he would change his mind. 
    He did not and he denied our motion. 
    The next day, we started a separate distinct civil proceeding of prohibition and mandamus in the Appellate Division. 
    So this is an appeal from --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="347.636" stopTime="352.303">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And the case we have is Gannett, it has -- the title of this case is Gannett?

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Well, what has happened with this appendix Your Honor is that things have been put in a chronological order. 
    The transcripts of the --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="426.018" stopTime="433.478">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I mean, is there other -- any thing or -- of what happened at the motion other than what is on the 13?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="433.478" stopTime="526.874">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    No. 
    At the time we started this that was still secret and it was sealed. 
    When Gannett commenced the separate civil proceeding and mandamus in the Appellate Division, next to that -- those papers were the newspaper articles which had appeared prior to the closure. 
    Now those articles are irrelevant to justify the closure because they were not before Judge DePasquale. 
    He did not consider them and indeed, no reference was ever made by any of the respondents to those articles. 
    But I would submit that those articles are directly relevant to the issue before this Court because they demonstrate and put in a factual context to the opinion of the Court of Appeals. 
    The articles appeared over a course of approximately two and a half weeks from the time of the disappearance of this man until the time the defendants were arraigned on the murder indictment. 
    They appeared on seven days out of that 18-day period and they appeared contemporaneously with the major events in the criminal investigation. 
    There are articles in the morning and evening paper when this man disappeared. 
    There were --and then there were articles when the defendants were arrested, when they were indicted, arraigned and so on. 
    The last articles appeared at the time of the defendants' arraignment which was 91 days before the commencement of the suppression hearing. 
    There was no further publicity in that interim period.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Suppose in a criminal trial Mr. Bernius, the -- either the prosecution or the defense wants to take a deposition of an absent witness either out of the United States or situated in someway where attendance, personal attendance can't be compelled. 
    Would you think the Sixth Amendment and your other arguments would require that the taking of the testimony of that witness be a public open hearing?

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Well, that is I think irrelevant at the time of the proceeding, that that deposition has all the characteristics of a criminal trial. 
    I would assume that a witness is going to testify. 
    The parties are present. 
    There is an oath. 
    There is cross-examination. 
    The defendant has a right to be present. 
    All the characteristics of the criminal trial itself, the post jury criminal trial.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    s it not common that in pretrial depositions both in civil and criminal cases that particularly if no judge is present and that's usually the case that there are many question which you're asked and answered with the reserved right to challenge their admissibility at the -- when asked and if the deposition is offered, is that not so?

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Well it -- Your Honor, it is an important stage in the process and there is a development, an adversary proceeding to develop a factual record upon which a subsequent determination will be made.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    What will there be for the Court to rule on?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="665.346" stopTime="710.144">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Well, it won't be made based on that but there is no guarantee and I think it's -- the analogy to a suppression hearing is clear that at the time of the suppression hearing there's no guarantee at all or no -- that the evidence will in fact be admitted a trial. 
    In fact, there is no guarantee that there will be a trial but nevertheless that is -- could well be the critical stage in the process but if the testimony of the suppression hearing transcript is not to be offered or the evidence that is given in the hearing is not to be offered at trial, the reason for that is because a judge makes a determination that that evidence is not admissible.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="710.144" stopTime="721.473">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that the only circumstance?

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Suppose that the prosecution takes this pretrial testimony in an abundance of caution and when they put their case in they find they approved -- established the same facts by other witnesses and they never bothered to put the deposition in evidence.

    Well, the --

    Is it part of the trial then?

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Not in a strict sense but in a generic sense, yes Your Honor. 
    I don't think that the fact that a jury is selected is a mystical concept that precludes the public's right to attend and to observe and be aware of the entire gamut of the proceedings where there is testimony, where there is cross-examination, where there is an attempt to establish either the prosecution's point or the defense point.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="780.362" stopTime="785.457">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, does the Sixth Amendment speak in terms of proceedings or does it speak in terms of trial?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="785.457" stopTime="810.604">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Well Your Honor, it speaks in terms obviously of a trial but it's our position that a suppression hearing is clearly for the constitutional purpose as part of the trial. 
    In fact, the statistics are that 90% of all criminal cases and 100% of criminal cases in Seneca County for two and a half years were completed at the pretrial stage.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="810.604" stopTime="830.897">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what -- whoa! Counsel, what if the statistic show that 90% of the complaints of the prosecuting attorney were never even prosecuted by information or indictment by him, would that make the prosecuting attorney's conference among his colleagues part of the trial because that was the way so many cases were disposed of?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="830.897" stopTime="887.368">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Well Your Honor, I'd -- there is a distinction obviously between that situation and the situation where there is a formal proceeding and adversary proceeding, witnesses are sworn and a judge is going to make a determination based on that testimony, a determination of fact. 
    I think that really the answer to the question of when does a trial commence is to be found in the purposes that are served by the public trial clause. 
    One of those purposes obviously is to protect the defendant and see that his interests are not abused by the prosecuting authorities but it goes beyond that. 
    There are interests in the public, specifically third parties may have a direct interest in the case but the interest of the public in seeing that the --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="887.368" stopTime="897.756">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why then that the framers cast the language of the Sixth Amendment in saying the accused shall enjoy the right of a public trial. 
    Why didn't they say the press shall have access to the trial?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="897.756" stopTime="955.698">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Your Honor, I think that based on the prior history and which is developed at -- to a certain extent in our brief but in the -- at the amicus brief for the National Association of Broadcasters more extensively, there was really no indication that a common law, the right of a public trial accrued to the defendant at all. 
    There were broader purposes behind it but the codification was in the constitution I think recognizes that the defendant should specifically be guaranteed a fair trial, a public trial but the part -- inherent in that clause, the public trial clause is a recognition I would submit that the public has an equal interest. 
    I think that the purposes that are served by the clause mean that it should not be read literally.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="955.698" stopTime="962.534">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well the framers shouldn't have taken an odd way of expressing it if they meant to adopt your view.
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="962.534" stopTime="980.314">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Your Honor, I don't think so because it is again inherent in that phrase, public trial is a notion, a concept that the public has an interest in it and based on the prior history of common law and based on the purpose it served by the public trial clause --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="980.314" stopTime="985.247">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, how can you tell what the purposes served are except by reading the clause?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="985.247" stopTime="1029.559">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    I think Your Honor by looking at the history and really analyzing it in the terms of the essential nature of the guarantee and what it does. 
    The overwhelming purpose served is as far as I can tell, the insurance of the confidence of the public, I mean in the judicial system, in the criminal justice system, the public nature of trials is in effect necessary to the vitality of that system and its viability. 
    I don't think that our criminal justice system would long last if proceedings of this nature were held in secret and I think that --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Your Honor the -- I believe I have an analogous case history. 
    First, there was no -- there's no question in this case that the public and the press had a right to be present prior to the motion to exclude them. 
    The Court of Appeals indicated that in its opinion, the respondents concede that. 
    It's -- the right to be present I think derives primarily from the right to gather information which was recognized by this Court in Branzburg and I know that the right to gather information is not without limits but I would submit that if there is any sort of right to gather information, it must exist at trials, it must exist in the streets and other public forums and I think that for the purposes of the right to gather information, the public forum test which was developed in most specifically articulated in the Grayned case gives very pertinent guidance.

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    That's right but it's not unli -- it's clearly not unlimited Your Honor and I think that the Court has answered that in some of the present cases that's answered that to a certain extent in the public forum cases, Marsh against Alabama, Adderly against Florida that was -- the cases where there is an asserted right to be present to exercise First Amendment freedoms.

    Mr. Bernius, what is the primary function of the suppression hearing?

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    The primary function of the suppression hearing is to determine Your Honor whether a jury should hear specific evidence whether it is sufficiently reliable.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1199.599" stopTime="1210.262">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And if the Court determines that it should not be heard and if the press has heard that evidence, is there any restriction on the press publishing it so it will come to the attention of the jury?

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    The -- no, (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1212.345" stopTime="1236.251">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So how could the primary function of the suppression hearing be performed if you're correct?Well, Your Honor there is -- that is really I believe the -- one of the principle faults in the Court of Appeals' opinion, the assumption that publication by definition means a -- that the jury will be affected by this information.
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="1236.251" stopTime="1256.527">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    The orders in this case were aimed directly at publication. 
    They're aimed at keeping the public ignorant of the facts of this hearing. 
    And their -- that the basis of the orders is public ignorance with the hope that somehow an indirect benefit will filter back to the trial.

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Yes there is Your Honor. 
    I think that this Court in Nebraska Press very much dealt at length with the problems in delaying publication of news concerning the criminal justice system. 
    Secondly, the --

    Nebraska didn't --
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="1292.897" stopTime="1341.821">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    -- was a pretrial situation Your Honor. 
    The delay in this case is just as serious. 
    Secondly, its -- if the order in this case is in a sense more dramatic than in Nebraska Press because not only is there a delay but there is an absolute denial of the public's knowledge of what went on in the suppression hearing. 
    As an appellate court, this Court is well aware of the inadequacies of a transcript but the tones, inflections, gestures, everything that makes a presence of a -- of the trier of facts so necessary into a determination, none of those things can be recaptured in the transcript. 
    And finally --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But if you -- but if (Inaudible) as Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, if the interest of justice and fairness require that the jury not here change of the evidence, how is that purpose served?

speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="1363.561" stopTime="1411.794">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Your Honor, we make no argument at all that suppression hearings must be open under all circumstances. 
    We simply say that the damage done to both First Amendment interest and to the public trial interest of the public are serious and that if closure is to take place, it should take place only as the last resort. 
    What has happened in this case is that the Court of Appeals has said that closure secret proceedings are preferable to change of venue to continuance to an extended voir dire, all those separate alternatives that this Court has on -- repeatedly said and would have been effective to mitigate the effects of pretrial publicity.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1411.794" stopTime="1421.016">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If you were in a federal court, you would have some difficulty using change of venue as an alternative if the defendant objected, wouldn't you?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="1421.016" stopTime="1437.386">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Your Honor, I -- that is -- it's clear that when if there is a continuance or a change of venue or of voir dire, to some extent it's going to inconvenience a defendant.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1437.386" stopTime="1439.584">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What about the vicinage requirement?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="1439.584" stopTime="1479.908">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    The vicinage requirement Your Honor deals with the source of a jury. 
    It doesn't really deal with the venue of the case and I think that the history of the vicinage clause indicates that in -- at the time of the enactment of the Sixth Amendment, there were -- the districts, the federal judicial districts were the equivalent of the states with the exception of Massachusetts and Virginia which had two districts. 
    So I don't think that the vicinage clause is of any pertinence here since it's number one outdated and number two, it requires a jury from -- essentially from the state and --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1479.908" stopTime="1497.183">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, do you think the Government could have said in -- if this case had been pending in federal court, don't worry about supra -- the opening the suppression hearing to the Court because we're going to move for a change of venue down to Tennessee.
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="1497.183" stopTime="1562.116">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Well Your Honor, I think that at that point, the defendants would have to make a choice and the fact that a venue may be laid in a certain specific area, the fact that continuance would somehow interfere with a speedy trial. 
    Those are considerations that all must be weighed but I don't think that in this situation where there are important First Amendment rights and press and public rights that one -- anyone guarantee can be deemed to be absolute. 
    What we're seeking here is an accommodation of all these potentially conflicting values. 
    What -- there is Your Honor, no conflict in this case. 
    There was no showing that publication would -- in any sense have prejudice of the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
    And there's also been no showing in this case that ejection or closure of this hearing would have help to mitigate that prejudice. 
    In fact, I think --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1562.116" stopTime="1571.925">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course Mr. Bernius, both defense lawyers move for the closure on the very ground that they thought they'd be prejudiced. 
    Wasn't that the ground the reason it was closed?
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="1571.925" stopTime="1598.960">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    They moved on the basis that evidence which may or may not be admissible at trial was to be admitted in a suppression hearing and ask for it to be closed. 
    I don't really know what that is. 
    I have -- we assume that they were concerned with the effects of pretrial publicity but the concern is not enough Your Honor. 
    There must be some sort of showing to justify this unusual and we submit unconstitutional procedure.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1598.960" stopTime="1603.918">

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Well Your Honor, first, the most dramatic example always is a suppression of a confession.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.
speaker="robert_c_bernius" startTime="1613.009" stopTime="1619.856">
    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    In many cases, that the confession is not admitted at a suppression hearing. 
    It's not really the issue at a suppression --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1619.856" stopTime="1623.975">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That the fact that a confession had been made would have to be disclosed, wouldn't it?

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius

    Mr. Robert C. Bernius 
    Well, the press would know Your Honor that there was an illegal search and seizure of evidence that there was -- or there was a confession or there was an illegal wiretap. 
    They would know generically what was going on at that hearing and it seems to me Your Honor and I -- and that the fact that a hearing was closed would not diminish the prejudicial impact of a case.

    We do not say that the defendants' right should be and should not be paramount. 
    But it's important to require the New York State Court of Appeals and trial courts throughout the country not to abrogate the rights of the press and public unless it's absolutely necessary.

   Argument of Bernard Kobroff

    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The right to a public trial is neither an absolute right of the public nor of the press. 
    Pretrial hearings and portions of trials had been closed to the public including the media for such situations as preventing disclosure of skyjack profile testimony insuring the emotional and physical health of the pregnant witness protecting the identity of an undercover agent permitting a prosecutrix to testify uninhibitedly at a trial. 
    Respondent submit that the need to preserve an accused constitutional right to an impartial jury in the County of venue is as important as any of these other interest which have been held to justify closure of criminal proceedings. 
    Respondents call Edwin Greathouse and David Ray Jones challenged the admissibility of confessions that they had given to Michigan police and physical fruits that these confessions had led the police to seize. 
    Respondent Judge DePasquale was required to resolve that this evidence had not been obtained in violation of the accused constitutional rights. 
    The admission of this evidence, this full confessions to the alleged murder and robbery were undoubtedly had been prejudicial to these defendants at their trial and widespread dissemination of these confessions prior to trial could nonetheless have predetermined their guilt in Seneca County.

    What you've got here though which make it different I think then what these alternatives, the Sheppard alternatives will do -- is here, the actual the actual poison had not been put out into the community. 
    We're not in a situation where we're mitigating damage that's already being done, that's already out. 
    We've got a situation where the damage isn't yet been done.

    The gun and that's true and for that, we might well -- this isn't the only alternative available to a Court to deal with prejudicial publicity. 
    I mean we have in fact the Sheppard measures that they might also have to be used. 
    I'm (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2441.842" stopTime="2448.578">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, but the money -- must the exclusion however be the last alternative or --
speaker="bernard_kobroff" startTime="2448.578" stopTime="2576.812">
    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    Well, the difficulty with exclusion is the last alternative is that if you wait till the voir dire or if you wait till change of venue can be done, the hearing is already over. 
    It's too late. 
    Exclusion is a prophylactic and in a certain situation, unusual situation and there's no denying, this is an unusual case. 
    It is effective and it should be available to a trial court. 
    It is a fundamental tenant of due process that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court and not by any outside influence whether of private talk or public print. 
    Judge DePasquale had the obligation to prevent suppressed evidence from determining the guilt of Greathouse and Jones and certainly from determining their guilt prior to trial. 
    To prevent the jury from learning of a coerced confession during trial yet all along needlessly making it available to them to read or hear of it before trial, knocks the claim that our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness. 
    For Judge DePasquale to have allowed public disclosure of potentially tainted evidence which he had the constitutional duty to exclude would involve the Court itself in this taint and illegality. 
    Respondent Greathouse and Jones were out of state transience, they're accused to the murder and robbery of a local area resident Wayne Clapp, a former police officer with roots in the community. 
    They have fled -- the respondent and Jones had fled Seneca County sooner after Clapp's disappearance and they were arrested in Michigan several days later. 
    There they allegedly gave these confessions which were the object to this motion. 
    If they had prevailed at this hearing, they had a triable defense. 
    The People's case was entirely circumstantial. 
    Three men leave on a boat to return. 
    Gunshots are heard, anchors are missing but there is no body, there is no decease, no corpse and no eyewitnesses to any crime.

    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    Never, never found. 
    However, if they're unsuccessful at the suppression motion, the defense is almost hopeless. 
    The full confessions to the crime plus the murder weapon itself is in evidence. 
    This case had already generated extensive media publicity throughout Seneca County.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2597.653" stopTime="2602.868">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    Oh, Your Honor, I -- they might -- they claim it to be factual reports but as a defense attorney trying this case I mean you would not want to accept that as factual reports. 
    These are untested, unreliable rumors.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2631.930" stopTime="2637.749">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

speaker="bernard_kobroff" startTime="2637.749" stopTime="2675.962">
    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    Alright. 
    The thing with Murphy is when there was no confession that was confronting that or would possibly have been testified and it report in the press. 
    I think that's a major distinction from what we had in Murphy. 
    On the day of the suppression motion, we had three reporters in the courtroom that we know of. 
    Petitioner's reporter, a reporter from the Geneva Times and a reporter from the Syracuse Post. 
    Together, these papers accounted from us the 85% of the daily newspaper circulation in Seneca County.

    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    No, no. 
    I just want to state them to make the point that in fact what would have occurred at this hearing would have been widely and immediately disseminated. 
    I think that three newspapers, well, not with three reporters in Seneca County courthouse unless they feel there's a new story and unless they're going to use it. 
    That's the only reason and the fact that they do have the circulation in that county. 
    Greathouse and Jones moved for the exclusion of these media representatives. 
    They argued that the deleterious effects of disclosures of the evidence they sought to suppress, sought to be suppressed would outweigh their right to a public trial.

    What was the judge's decision in this case on admissibility?
speaker="bernard_kobroff" startTime="3404.606" stopTime="3641.593">
    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    Certain confessions, certain statements were suppressed, the others were not. 
    Apparently, certain statements were made and then he requested the attorneys then more statements were made and so on. 
    What is involved in this case is the constitutional right of an accused to a trial by an impartial jury in the County of venue and the right of the public including potential jurors and media representatives have immediate access to pretrial evidentiary suppression hearings. 
    The case does not concern the right of the press to publish free from prior restraints. 
    There were no restraints on press publication in this case. 
    No injunctions restraining the press from publishing anything it wanted to. 
    No contempt citations punishing the press for having published anything. 
    Petitioner's error is in equating a temporary denial of public access to potentially inadmissible evidence where the Court ordered direct restraint on publication. 
    The press was at all time free to publish anything it wanted to about the case at People v.Greathouse and Jones. 
    Yet the press had learned that what transpired at this in camera proceeding, their publication of this evidence would've been unrestrained. 
    Petitioner nonetheless argues that the public including prospective jurors' right to immediate access to this testimony, testimony untested by constitutional standards as to reliability, admissibility, testimony found to be probably destructive of an accused constitutional right to an impartial jury that this right to immediate access is entitled with the same constitutional protection as the press' right to publish free from governmental censorship. 
    Respondent submit that there is no basis in law or reason for this equation. 
    This has never been the requirement. 
    This has never been the standard of -- to deny used in instances where courtrooms had been closed and none of the instances to protect the identity of an undercover agent to allow witness to testify uninhibitedly. 
    This has never been the standard used. 
    And such a standard would severely undermine an accused constitutional right to an impartial jury. 
    And without an impartial jury, any other right granted to an accused is meaningless. 
    An important value in our society, a value embodied in the constitution is of the trial by an impartial jury in the county where the crime was allegedly committed. 
    This requirement of a fair trial has been interpreted to me not only the absence of actual bias but even the absence of a probability of unfairness. 
    To further protect the rights of an accused, our society extends reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence and other burdens in favor of an accused. 
    Before a confession could be offered in evidence against an accused, he must first have been determined by at the least a preponderance of the evidence to have been knowingly voluntarily and intelligently given. 
    If it is determined that a jury even considered a coerced confession, it is automatic reversal, can never be a harmless error. 
    Yet petitioner insist that before a Court can exclude the public including prospective jurors from the hearing involving a coerced confession that the accuse must in open court and in an adversarial proceeding satisfy the awesome standard necessary to justify governmental censorship. 
    Respondent submit that the standard certainly gives an accused far less than he has a right to expect in our society and under the constitution. 
    Petitioner bases his argument on the public and potential jurors' right to immediate access to suppression hearing testimony on the fact that the flow of information to the public concerning pretrial suppression hearings is vital to public understanding of the judicial system. 
    There is no claim here that the press' right to publish is being restrained.

    In a different -- any differently from the written transcript. 
    Television would be different, radio perhaps.

    I will tell you, I'm not a newspaper reporter and perhaps --

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    But you read the newspaper every now and then, don't you?

    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    Yes. 
    I didn't -- I've also read some novels back you know --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, then how do you explain why they sent three reporters and didn't just wait for the transcript?

    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    Well, I think they wanted it immediately.

    Mr. Bernard Kobroff 
    It's their business decision. 
    I don't think the Gannett Newspapers does badly making business decisions. 
    The right of the -- the right to the access -- right of access to this transcript has not been denied and is not being denied. 
    This transcript will enable the public to continue to monitor the criminal justice system. 
    It will enable it to assure itself that the accused is in fact being treated fairly to assure itself that public officials are correctly performing their duties to assure itself that no judicial or prosecutorial irregularities have occurred. 
    If there is any absolute in our constitutional system is that an accused must receive a fair trial before it can be lawfully convicted. 
    Of primary consideration is the public's interest in avoiding anything that would truncate this right. 
    To maintain an accused right to an impartial jury as the arbiter of guilt or innocence, the hearing judge must have the means to ensure their perspective endearment to not hear him out as which by law they are to be insolated from. 
    Respondents submit that the decision of the New York Court of Appeals reaches a wise balancing between the right of the press to publish free from governmental restraint and the right of an accused to an impartial jury in the County of venue. 
    Respondents submit that the decision of the New York Court of Appeals should be affirmed. 
    Thank you.
