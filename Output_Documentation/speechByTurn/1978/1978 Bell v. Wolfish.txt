    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review certain aspects of its decision relating to conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federally operated short-term custodial facility in New York City. 
    There are five issues presented to you for decision. 
    The first and perhaps potentially the most significant from the standpoint of constitutional doctrine, involves the constitutionality of double-bunking pretrial detainees in rooms designed for single occupancy.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Frey when you say pretrial detainees I take it you are excluding those who are confined other than in a status as pretrial detainees?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="125.874" stopTime="171.340">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That's right. 
    There are various classifications of inmates that are kept at a facility like the MCC in addition to persons who are being held in lieu of bail or awaiting trial in criminal charges. 
    There is a significant group of inmates who are -- have been brought in on ad testificandum or ad prosequendum writs to appear in Federal Court proceedings who are prisoners serving other state or federal sentences. 
    There are persons awaiting parole and probation revocation hearings, and there are sentenced inmates whose sentences are such a short duration that it is deemed desirable to have them serve their sentence in New York.

    So we have the whole population?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="495.536" stopTime="543.762">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    You have the whole population, but not as to every issue. 
    The double-bunking issue, the disposition in the Court of Appeals was that it reversed the District Court's ban as applied to sentenced inmates and remanded for further proceedings. 
    It affirmed as applied to pretrial detainees because it perceived that a different legal standard was appropriate to judge the claim in that context. 
    There are also four rules or practices that are before this Court that are justified on security grounds, the right to receive packages, the so called publisher only rule, the validity of visual inspection of body cavities after contact visits and the right to be present or the inmate to present and observe room searches. 
    Now --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="543.762" stopTime="545.627">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And issues concern the whole --
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="545.627" stopTime="943.121">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    With the exception of the room search issue which applies only to pretrial detainees, no distinction was drawn on the other three issues between sentenced inmates and pretrial detainees, arguably one might be but none has been. 
    Now these five issues are the rump contingent of a veritable army of complaints about the operation of the MCC that marched into the United States District Court in November 1975, less than four months after the MCC opened. 
    The issues raised covered such diverse subjects as housing, food, clothing of inmates, visiting, library facilities, staffing, educational and job opportunities, grievance procedures, mail, telephone service, noise levels, various aspects of the treatment of personal property and many others, they're numerous to name here. 
    After initially resolving a few of the issues on summary judgment including the double-bunking and the publisher only issue, the District Court conducted hearings and issued an extensive opinion granting much of the relief respondents sought and denying others of their claims. 
    The court relied on both constitutional and statutory grounds for its decision. 
    Some of its rulings, the government acquiesced and others were appealed to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals in turn affirmed in part and reversed in part. 
    It rejected any statutory basis for the District Court's orders prohibiting various MCC practices and conditions, finding that the case generally involved matters committed to agency discretion by law, and accordingly rested it's own ruling solely on constitutional grounds. 
    And as I've said in setting forth the constitutional standards that distinguish between sentenced inmates and pretrial detainees. 
    As to the former challenged conditions were to be judged by the Eighth Amendment, Cruel and Unusual Punishment Standard, the detainees -- the Court relied on the presumption of innocence to set a much higher standard. 
    It stated that pretrial detainees maybe subject to “Only those restrictions and privations which inhere in their confinement itself or which are justified by compelling necessities of jail administration.” 
    And it made quite clear that challenges to conditions of confinement for detainees are to be adjudicated without consideration of either physical or administrative justifications for the particular practice. 
    It applied these standards for the double-bunking issue by in affect adopting a per se rule that two inmates may not be housed in the room designed for one. 
    With regard to the other issues that are before this Court, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the maintenance of security and order is a compelling necessity of jail administration, but it nevertheless concluded that the government had failed to establish sufficient justification for the practices or rules in question. 
    Now as I indicated at the beginning the case breaks down into two different types of issues. 
    The first involves the standards by which the due process rights of pretrial detainees are to be evaluated in the context of a challenged or alleged overcrowding at the MCC. 
    The second involves the security related issues. 
    Now since the first issue was potentially the more novel and substantial constitutional issue, I intend to devote most or all of my limited time to that question and to rely on the briefs for the other issues. 
    I'd like to say a brief word about the MCC itself before getting into legal arguments. 
    It is one of a very limited number of Federal facilities, specifically designed to house pretrial detainees and other short-term inmates. 
    As the Court of Appeals described that the MCC represented the architectural embodiment of the best and most progressive penological planning. 
    The key design element of the MCC that's relevant to the double-bunking issue and that indeed is the central element of the facility, is the modular unit concept. 
    In this concept there are self contained residential units in lieu of the traditional cell block. 
    Typical unit contains 48 rooms, which would join large multipurpose rooms with facilities for recreation, education, exercise, and dining. 
    The common areas are carpeted, sleeping rooms have doors rather than bars and for the virtually the entire day except seven sleeping hours between 11 in night and 6 in the morning the inmates are free to move about their unit without restriction. 
    Also visiting facilities are attached to each of these units rather than having a central facility for the institution. 
    I understand that there are slides in the record with photographs of the institution if you deem it useful to get a look at what it's like. 
    The MCC was designed to house 449 inmates, however contemporaneous with its opening in August 1975, there was a sharp and unexpected increase in the number of persons committed to the Bureau of Prisoners Custody, who the Bureau determined had to be or should be housed at the MCC. 
    Because the number of inmates exceeded the designed capacity of the institution, the Bureau determined in order to meet its custodial obligations that a number of the rooms should be used to house two inmates and that bunk bed should replace single beds in the dormitory areas. 
    Accordingly, bunk beds were installed in place of single beds in 73 of the 389 residential rooms at the MCC. 
    Now the respondents have invoked and the Court of Appeals has relied upon the Due Process Clause for striking down the double bunking in this case. 
    The focus of the issue therefore concerns the substantive content of that clause. 
    The Court of Appeals held that the Due Process Clause by its own force and without the aid of any other constitutional provision, confers upon pretrial detainees the right to be free of cramped housing conditions in the absence of a governmental showing of compelling necessity.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="943.121" stopTime="946.086">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Was that a liberty interest or a property interest?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="946.086" stopTime="1041.752">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I believe they viewed it as a liberty interest and we do not dispute in this case the pretrial detainees retain those liberty interests that are not inconsistent with the fact of confinement itself. 
    We simply dispute that the standard that was applied by the Court of Appeals in evaluating the practices that arguably impinged upon those liberty interests was the right standard. 
    Now we think that the Court of Appeals Standard lacks any basis in the constitutional decisions of this Court dealing with the subject of substantive due process and we think that the proper resolution of the issue that was before the Court of Appeals required that the government be afforded an opportunity to adduce the factors that brought about the challenged conditions and the propriety of the government's action having to be assessed by its reasonableness in relation to the legitimate governmental objectives at stake. 
    Now two aspects of the constitutional backdrop to this issue are worth highlighting. First, there is no dispute that the conditions of confinement for both pretrial detainees and sentenced inmates must meet minimum levels of decency with regard to such consideration as housing, food, sanitation, and medical care and we have spelled out in our brief the reasons for our contention that these standards have been fully satisfied at the MCC.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well the detention involves an impairment of a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause and the standard that the Court of Appeals applied to double-bunking is clearly inappropriate standard to apply to pretrial commitment, and indeed the both the Constitution and the statutes require a kind of least restrictive alternative test so that detention is the last step after you've excluded any other reasonable measure to assure presence at trial.

    Well, we don't -- I agree with that I am not sure what the bearing of -- I don't know what the bearing of that is in the context of this case because no one is contesting the validity of the institutional pretrial detention. 
    No one is contesting -- we're not contesting that a compelling necessity standard is appropriate and the respondents are not contesting that these people can be detained. 
    It's the subsidiary conditions of confinement incidental to this massive restriction on liberty that's involved in the detention that are at issue.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1351.859" stopTime="1365.646">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But the purpose of the detention must have some bearing on the standard of review. 
    If it's punishment, it's one thing. 
    If it's simply assuring that they will show up for trial because there is no other way that you can assure their appearance is may be another.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="1365.646" stopTime="1524.788">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, let me explain the role that I think punishment properly plays in this. 
    When a challenge is presented to a condition of confinement, the government is obliged assuming the challenge crosses some constitutional threshold of presenting some kind of claim of liberty interest, the government is obliged to show in some fashion and by some standard a justification for the action that it has taken, which has impaired this interest. 
    Now the -- in the case of a pretrial detainee, the government cannot say, one of the reasons we're doing this is to punish them; or one of the reasons that justifies this practice is to rehabilitate them, or to deter others from committing the offense. 
    Those are -- those are governmental objectives that can only be invoked to support a condition of confinement in the case of convicted inmates. 
    In the case of pretrial detainees, there must be other kinds of considerations invoked. 
    Our concern in this case is that the very real and substantial physical and administrative considerations that made it necessary to resort to a degree of double-bunking were totally foreclosed from consideration by the Court under a standard which in effect said per se, “You just can't put two people in a room that was designed for one. 
    We don't want to hear why you're doing it.” 
    Now in this connection there is a lot of suggestion that physical considerations and administrative convenience are some how insubstantial excuses that the government makes up to justify its practices, and that it's something -- administrative convenience is something like not having to work overtime or not having to make modifications and establish routines and we think administrate convenience is much more in this context. 
    The Bureau of Prisons has as a certain population of inmates committed to its custody. 
    It has no control over the number of these inmates. 
    It has to house them. 
    The kinds of considerations of administrative convenience which are included in this, in this concept involve, where are you going to put these people? 
    If you can't double-bunk in the MCC, then a number of people who perhaps should be in New York City, including and it didn't happen in this case but it could, pretrial detainees will be moved way from their family and friends, away from their lawyers --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1524.788" stopTime="1527.267">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You can move them to state facility in New York, they're --
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="1527.267" stopTime="1573.004">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    No there too, we could not, but this is the kind of issue that would have explored at a trial, and it is not simply administrative convenience of the administrators but encompassed within this rubric is the welfare of the people committed to their custody as a group and when the MCC was told, you can't double-bunk anymore, what happened was that 90 inmates who the Bureau of Prisons judged ought to be housed at the MCC were sent off to other facilities, possibly more crowded or for other reasons less suitable for them. 
    Now I do want to I think save the balance of my time for a rebuttal, if I may.

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Thank you Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The government's application of the compelling interest test as the appropriate standard for determining the rights of pretrial detainees ignores the historically legal context of that standard and indeed the very facts of this case. 
    Furthermore the government misconstrues the Second Circuit's test. 
    What we are dealing with here is the fundamental right of a pretrial detainee not to be punished. 
    This right persists even though the pretrial detainee is placed in custody to assure his appearance in court at the time of trial. 
    This fact of detention has not constitutionally been considered punishment, because the Eighth Amendment permits bail and by inference permits custody in lieu of bail in order to assure the appearance of the defendant for trial.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="1642.546" stopTime="1667.583">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Double-bunking as the District Judge saw it and found it, it's an incentive punishment because it is not necessary in order to assure the appearance of the defendant at trial and for the security of the institution, which are the only two factors which can be considered in determining whether or not a condition of confinement that is above and beyond the fact of incarceration is punishment.

    No, well there would have been no overcrowding if there had been no double-bunking. 
    The government has never indicated on the facts of this case inability to comply with the District Court's order. 
    They have been in compliance for two years without a single request for a stay, without returning to the court for relief from the order prohibiting double bunking.

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Okay, we defined it, for purposes of this case, as the District Court saw it and as he made findings, we have two people housing a cell, which the Judge found was built for one. 
    The results of this housing of two people in a cell built for one was that there was a very small space for movement of the two people. 
    He looked at it and he saw there was very narrow aisle. 
    Secondly, it requires urination and defecation in the close presence of the other person with the resulting discomforts which the Judge described in his opinion.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1772.243" stopTime="1787.818">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I don't mean to be anecdotal but the troopship I came back from the Second World War had bunked stacks six high in the hold of a ship and I don't think the common view then was that was form of punishment or that it was necessarily overcrowding given the circumstance.
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="1787.818" stopTime="1809.873">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Well I think, I think Your Honor that is a point which can be easily explained. 
    The government's compelling interest in wartime is far different from the government's compelling interest as it exists with a detention of presumptively innocent detainees. 
    The purpose of the war time confinement was to create a fighting unit which could defend the government which could defend this country.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1809.873" stopTime="1817.496">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well if you go into some military camps right today and when we are in no war, you will find a considerable amount of double bunking.
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="1817.496" stopTime="1862.299">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Indeed Your Honor and the conditions of confinement in a military camp even in normal times can be justified by the government because of the government's need to create a unified fighting force, capable of taking orders and directions and indeed in wartime conditions leaving under a very severe restrictions and conditions. 
    That's not true here. 
    The government's compelling interest is limited to making sure that the individual shows up for court and for protecting the security of the institution and the government does not claim and indeed it never has that overcrowding by double-bunking in this case is justified by anything other than cost and convenience.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mrs. Bamberger that leads me to ask questions beyond on my mind. 
    I got it some where in these briefs which I read it, good time to go, Christmas time, that there is been a change in the situation since this litigation was commenced and that there is no considerably less if indeed any overcrowding in this facility? 
    Am I mistaken about that?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2272.177" stopTime="2291.595">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Well that the government has been in compliance with the court's full order on overcrowding since August 28 1978. 
    And they have never returned to the court with proof, with assertions, with facts which would indicate that they are incapable of maintaining that and in fact they conceded in their briefs that they are capable of maintaining --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2291.595" stopTime="2296.400">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In fact there is no overcrowding of the kind about what your complaining, is that right?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2296.400" stopTime="2297.441">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    As far as I understand, that has to be --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2297.441" stopTime="2300.297">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And is the case moot?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2300.297" stopTime="2307.543">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Well the government says that they should be relieved of the obligations because the situation may come up again.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2307.543" stopTime="2316.621">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well it may, but it's disappeared now hasn't it, haven't they changed their policy? 
    Don't they, no longer keep in custody here for the workforce?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2316.621" stopTime="2317.444">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    They are no longer keeping custody --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2317.444" stopTime="2319.206">

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Well I think Your Honor with all due respect has to ask the government, whether their statement in their brief that they intent overcrowded if --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well if you comply with an injunction presumably to avoid contempt you can nonetheless appeal?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2334.901" stopTime="2342.710">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Exactly Your Honor but the point is that is the government didn't seek a stay of the double-selling or the overcrowding double-selling order they never have.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2342.710" stopTime="2345.452">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's in the prerequisite to avoidance of mootness?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2345.452" stopTime="2358.246">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    There are two more factors involved here. 
    First they have never returned to the district court claiming impossibility or that they have to construct a new institution or that there has been a substantial change in facts which requires them to be relieved of their obligations under the order.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2358.246" stopTime="2378.716">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well those may support your contention here that the order was proper but I don't see how they support their contention that the case is moot because the court ordered the government to do something but it didn't want to do voluntarily, the court -- the government complied with that order under the threat of contempt sanction and appeal.
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2378.716" stopTime="2379.578">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Yes what.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2379.578" stopTime="2387.592">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's conceivable that the case could become -- this place had burned down and there were no more MCA, then the case would probably been moved, wouldn't it?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2387.592" stopTime="2403.776">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Yes that's correct but it's the government position here that leaves it open to, because they say that if they need, if they say if they are, if they have a lot of prisoners again that they would put them in any institution convicted, non-convicted, pre trail whatever it may be. 
    The other fact is that --

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    I'm urging Your Honor is that we have a situation here which the government claims as capable of repetition and we are urging that this order is proper on that assertion. 
    To return to the question of the government's compliance the district court included in its order a provision which would permit the warden of the institution to certify that he needed to overcrowd because of an emergency or immediate severe overcrowding. 
    The government has never availed itself of that portion of the order.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2449.250" stopTime="2457.628">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I think that the government's position as a matter of law, that it is entitled to act on its own without going to the district court and asking it for a certificate?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2457.628" stopTime="2463.097">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    It doesn't have to go to the court. 
    It just has to file a copy of it own certification with the court.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well isn't its position that it doesn't have to be subjected to that sort of requirement?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2468.197" stopTime="2481.722">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Its position is that but even though that order is in effect now. 
    The prohibition on overcrowding is in effect now. 
    While the case is before this Court they haven't used that remedy.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2481.722" stopTime="2496.647">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well but if they feel the remedy is improperly imposes a matter of constitutional law, I suppose they have a right to appeal even though you suggest they have perhaps an easier out by simply complying with the order, but that doesn't moot the case?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2496.647" stopTime="2517.688">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    No, no we are not asserting that the case is moot. 
    We are just saying that there is no factual assertion in this record for the government's justification that caused an inconvenience, permit the overcrowded housing that existed in this facility at the time that this case was tried. 
    That those conditions, those justifications --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Before you move on to that, will you tell me please, what authority the District Court or the Court of Appeals relied upon to say that the ancient remedy of habeas corpus is a class action, could be used under a class action umbrella?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2563.566" stopTime="2581.902">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    There have been decisions which I don't have in my head at this moment Your Honor in the Florida and California Federal courts involving capital punishment sanction in which those cases decided the issues based upon class action status.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2581.902" stopTime="2583.860">

    It was with the habeas -- with the habeas.

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    I believe Your Honor that they were habeas corpus proceedings. 
    Habeas corpus has been used by the courts and the Second Circuit. 
    For instance, I cite saw Sostre against McGinnis, to release an individual not necessarily from full custody, but from those conditions which are unconstitutional.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2599.933" stopTime="2603.623">

    Well but in a class action that's all I am addressing myself to now?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2603.623" stopTime="2648.630">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    I say I believe that there are cases which I will be happy to supply to the court with. 
    One additional fact which the court considered in the over crowding issue which was the entire set up of the functional unit system where inmates had to spend virtually 23 hours of every day in that one functional unit and Mr. Frey described for the Court that it meant that the inmates were confined to this area for virtually all activities. 
    Now what the judge found was that the institution couldn't supply the activities which these multi-purpose functional unit rooms were supposed to supply because of the overcrowding and this resulted in a rate down in the functioning of the institution.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2648.630" stopTime="2673.767">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Ms. Bamberger what if the place have been designed originally so that the sleeping rooms were to house two people in exactly the way that the government ultimately ended up housing them, but the other facilities had met the standards that you think they are to mean. 
    So there wasn't a question later putting in more people they were designed for, but just designing of close, more closely confined sleeping room. 
    Do you think that would be unconstitutional?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2673.767" stopTime="2676.033">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2676.920" stopTime="2686.809">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Well because the conditions in the room, the denial of privacy, the cold air blowing into the vent, the presence of the exposed toilet would still exist.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2686.809" stopTime="2698.678">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well supposing that was all present, but it was simply designed that way. 
    The government just decided they put twice as many people, but that was of the architect's plan?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2698.678" stopTime="2711.853">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Well if that was the architects plan I would submit that the Court could disregard the architects plan just as though just as the Court could consider it as an element in deciding whether the room was appropriate for housing more than one person.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2711.853" stopTime="2726.703">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So it isn't a question about going beyond what the capacity of prison was originally supposed to house? 
    It's a question of some standard that a court gets from somewhere as to how many square feet each prisoner should have regardless of what the architect plans?
speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="2726.703" stopTime="2757.959">
    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    That's correct and indeed the bureau of prisons has itself has presented testimony in cases which would indicate that 50 square feet is the minimum required per inmate in a cell in order to give him adequate movement space, adequate psychological space. 
    That testimony is cited in Campbell against McGruder by the DC Circuit. 
    The draft standards proposed by the justice department indicate that the space which was provided per inmate in this double-celling overcrowded situation is inadequate.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think those are absorbed in the Constitution?

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    I don't think that they are absorbed into the Constitution, but I suggest to the Court that they are valid evidence which can be considered, expert evidence from, in the case of the government drafted standards it's own correctional officials, which would indicate what they believe to be adequate and I think that is evidence which the district court considered and which is appropriate to consider in making an evaluation. 
    It's the same ways in the medical case, doctor's assertions are not constitutional principles, but they are valid evidence in determining what is the proper legal standard to apply.

    Are the rooms rectangular in shape, I think some these facilities have triangular rooms, is that correct?

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    They are -- no they are not triangular, they're irregular because of the way the fixtures for plumbing and electricity cut into the room. 
    These are all in an exhibit one to the government's 9(g) statement and they are exhibits before the court. 
    And so the scheme of the room with the placement of the articles it's in there. 
    The government also relies upon a distortion of the Second Circuit's case to make its argument here. 
    The Second Circuit said, “ that even though there was a compelling interest not to be punished by conditions which were more severe than necessary in order to justify appearance in court and the security of the institution, the particular intrusion imposed by the government had to effect -- had to be a substantial intrusion, so that even the application of the Second Circuit's compelling interest test would leave the government enormous amounts of room in which to function without returning to the Court each time it had to make a decision. 
    And indeed that is what Judge Kaufman said in his opinion on page 2A of the petition, Certiorari Petition Appendix. 
    Judge Kaufman says twice that the intrusions must be substantial ones and I think that that the government fears about a returning to court for every time they have something to do which is simply unfounded.

    No, Your Honor and in fact the District Court completely disowned that responsibility as did the Court of Appeals.

    You regard it as an extreme measure to prohibit books being handed to the prisoners without inspection?

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Oh! 
    Yes, but the Court said they could inspect. 
    What the government was doing here is that they were totally prohibiting it. 
    We assured it that they could search, they could limit the quantity. 
    They could limit the amount that comes in each month. 
    They could say only one, only two, but they couldn't totally prohibit. 
    That was what the courts were getting at, that the restrictions which the government imposed were way beyond what was needed to protect a security interest. 
    And based on the evidence in large part from the government's own witnesses, the courts below found that their restrictions on First, Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights were far more than was necessary to protect the interest and intermediate interests or intermediate regulations with which involved less restrictions, but could nevertheless protect the government's security interest could be imposed and this did not prevent the government from using reasonable means. 
    The choice was theirs. 
    They could do whatever they chose to do to protect their interest as long as the restriction that was ultimately found to be used by the government was not so over broad that it went beyond what was necessary to protect the interest.

    May I ask two related questions? 
    First I am not clear, the regulations that are challenged here, were they just for the New York Institution or are they the nationwide regulation for the Bureau of Prison, that was my first question. 
    Let me give you the second you can answer both together. 
    The second question is the strip search problem; does the record show that every time there is a visit to an inmate there is a strip search or is it done --?

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    Yes, now with respect to the nationality or the nationwide application of the rules; the government's publisher only rule has national application and indeed the government has indicated here that they don't even need that board rule, that they're going to – now the rule.

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    I am not aware of the general applicability of strip search or of the other two. 
    The government drafted standards by the way indicate that observed visits need not result in anal and genital perusals in every situation without cause and our assertion here is that and the record establishes beyond any doubt that these visits are observed. 
    There is a guard, a guard takes the inmates into the visiting room. 
    There is a guard that constantly observes the visiting room, the lavatories are not available to inmates, a visitor using the lavatory needs to have a key, there is a door in the lavatory room, the inmates wear jumpsuits and the testimony was uncontradicted that contraband could not be inserted while wearing those jumpsuits.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3336.224" stopTime="3340.749">

    Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger 
    No well, the government and we apparently have disputed to the significance of that testimony. 
    However, the District Court did make a finding that these perusals were not necessary and that they were alternative means and that therefore I think we can infer that every fact which was not found against us was found for us. 
    The government does not claim that our interpretation was clearly erroneous. 
    What their witness was talking about was the ability to hide things orally and swallow them which certainly wouldn't be covered by anal and genital inspections. 
    The question of the total prohibition on property from outside the institution is not nationally applied. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Andrew L. Frey
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3398.453" stopTime="3403.308">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mrs. Bamberger. 
    You have about five minutes.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3403.308" stopTime="3556.048">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    First of all with regard to the testimony of government experts in other cases about the amount of space that's necessary, the other case was a case that involved a cell in which people were locked for substantial portions of the day. 
    The central to the concept of the MCC and if there is repeating that people are not locked into their rooms except during sleeping hours. 
    So the inconveniences that we are talking about in this case of two people being in cramped quarters and we don't deny that the quarters are cramped, is an inconvenience in terms of forced togetherness that exist for a period of relatively brief period and in fact none of, essentially none of the waking hours except when there were certain times when everybody has to go to their rooms for a cell count. 
    Now there was no hearing in this case, not only to hear the government's justifications for resorting to double-bunking, but also no hearing to examine the effect of double-bunking on the inmates. 
    The only evidence that was before the District Court in this case was affidavit of the government psychiatrist who had examined the facility and who concluded that there was no substantial evidence that this was emotionally detrimental under the conditions that existed at the MCC. 
    Now the response to this is on the part of both the District Court and the Court of Appeals in large part was we already settled this in another case. 
    The other case in which they already settled it and the Court of Appeals made a revealing error in their original opinion, at page 18 A of the Appendix, they stated “Inmate testimony revealed that double celling had produced numerous disagreements over the choice of activities within the room, had spawned fights, charges of theft, frequent involuntary contact,” that was testimony as they later amended the opinion in another case. 
    The other case was a case in which there were 40 square feet for two inmates instead of 76 or 77 as in this case. 
    The other case was a case in which the inmates were locked in their room for approximately twice the time that they were in this case. 
    The other case was the conventional cell block kind of jail.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3556.048" stopTime="3562.050">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr Frey, were the government denied the right to put on testimony?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3562.050" stopTime="3647.500">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    A summary judgment was granted against us. 
    We submitted affidavits. 
    The District Court went to the jail, visited it and said as, as people have been known to say about obscenity, it's unconstitutional I know when I see it. 
    This we consider to be an unsatisfactory way of dealing with this issue and I would like at this point to get back to the question of punishment. 
    One thing that's very important you ask why are we inquiring into physical and administrative reasons for the double-bunking. 
    Nobody in the lower courts has based any decision on the grounds of what happened here was punishment, that was not the basis of the decision. 
    That is the argument of the respondents in an effort to surmount the lack of authority to support the Court of Appeals' conclusion that a compelling necessity standard was appropriate to judge the restriction on the liberty of the inmates that was involved. 
    The Court of Appeals did not say this was punishment. 
    Now, they say it's punishment, but they do not analyze the concept in the way this Court has analyzed it, that is they do not look to the standards in Mendoza-Martinez that suggest how you go about the inquiry of determining whether or not something is punishment. 
    And we think if you apply that inquiry in this case, you would not conclude that what happened here was punishment. 
    So I come back to the point that, Your Honor --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3647.500" stopTime="3656.340">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's your submission that unless or until there's a finding that this amounts to punishment, the Due Process Clause is not implicated?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3656.340" stopTime="3678.488">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, our argument is that unless or until there is a finding that there is a lack of a reasonable relationship under whatever level of judicial scrutiny might be given to government's justification between the practice of double-bunking and the government – legitimate governmental objectives that might support that practice, the practice stands –-
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3678.488" stopTime="3687.824">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In other words you don't accept my, the series suggested in my question.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    We think that it could, but that is because we don't think the concept of punishment has a useful role to play in an analyzing the due process plan.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3695.412" stopTime="3714.964">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Then how was the Due Process Clause implicated? 
    Obviously, I think everybody would agree that government cannot punish somebody until or unless he's convicted of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore you can't take a pretrial detainee and put him or do anything else, that's obviously punishment.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3714.964" stopTime="3715.393">

    Right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3715.393" stopTime="3727.677">
    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, that now depends upon what view you take.

    Well, I understood the Moore case to suggest that there were five votes on this Court at least for the proposition that the due process concept is a rational continuum in Justice Harlan's words and that is not include just a series of points that are picked out. 
    In our view of course it doesn't matter for the disposition of this case.

    But it is our position that an injunction has been issued against us that we believe is improper and unauthorized and without constitutional basis and that we would if the need arose again and it may, resort to double-bunking --
