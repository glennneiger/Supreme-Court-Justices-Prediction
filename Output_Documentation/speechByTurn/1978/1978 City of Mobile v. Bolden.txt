    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    The City of Mobile, Alabama has since 1911 been governed by a city commission consisting of three members elected by the voters of the city at large. 
    The question in this case is whether this at large system of municipal elections violates the rights of Mobile's Negro voters in contravention of federal statutory or constitutional law as held by the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    For the reasons expressed in an opinion filed today, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Powell, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I have concluded that Mobile's electoral and governmental system does not on the record in this case violate the United States constitution or federal law. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion explaining why he has reached the same conclusion. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun has also filed an opinion concurring in the result. 
    Accordingly, the judgment before us is reversed. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting statement. 
    Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Brennan has joined. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has also filed a dissenting opinion almost all of which Mr. Justice Brennan has also joined.
