Torres v. Puerto Rico

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in Torres against Puerto Rico. 
    I think we will wait a moment for the audience to clear. 
    They seem to have a lot of interest in broadcasting today. 
    Mr. Remcho, I think you may now proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This case presents the question whether the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may constitutionally enact and enforce a statute authorizing its police to conduct indiscriminate warrantless searches of the luggage, packages, bundles and bags of persons arriving in Puerto Rico from the mainland United States.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="108.656" stopTime="125.408">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now in that you include I take it the power to examine everything that comes in, just the way customs agents do at Mexican border or anywhere else, is that what you mean to embrace by indiscriminate?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="125.408" stopTime="138.499">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    What I mean to embrace by indiscriminate is as the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico found, the statute Public Law 22 authorizes the individual police officer, not a customs official, but the individual police officer.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="138.499" stopTime="144.350">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Does it make any difference whether it is a police officer or a customs official or what name you give the person?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="144.350" stopTime="154.326">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Well, I think it makes a substantial difference. 
    That goes to the whole question of whether Puerto Rico may in the first place, setup any kind of a customs search.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="154.326" stopTime="157.610">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's what I am trying to get at.
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="157.610" stopTime="229.298">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    So let me get to that question then directly and take up the others later. 
    The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was created by the Commonwealth Compact, but nothing in that Compact reserved to Puerto Rico the right in any fashion to setup its own border between the United States and Puerto Rico. 
    In fact, with respect to customs, 19 US Code Section 1202(a) specifically includes Puerto Rico within United States customs territory. 
    The Commonwealth Compact itself and the additional Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act, includes a carefully considered set of regulations and a compact between the United States Congress and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with respect to how those two parties will relate to each other and there is nothing in that compact, which I find which specifically or implicitly authorizes Puerto Rico to setup any kind of a border between itself and the United States.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="229.298" stopTime="235.279">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You are limiting that of course to travelers from the United States, aren't you?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="235.279" stopTime="342.191">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Well, that is great, that is what the statute says, but that is what a border is all about; people coming from one place to the other regardless of whether they are residents of Puerto Rico or the United States mainland. 
    The Commonwealth has taken the position with respect to the border not that they have the power or have indeed created anything like an international border. 
    The position they took below at least was that they had the power to create a functional equivalent of a border. 
    And I think that misconstrues this Court's cases with respect to what a functional equivalent of a border is. 
    As the Court held in Almeida-Sanchez, the functional equivalent of a border is basically the same thing as a border only for practical necessary reasons that border has been moved. 
    So for example, St. Louis is the functional equivalent of the United States border for a person arriving for the first time in United States and the confluence of two or three roads right near the Mexican-United States border is the functional equivalent of the border and that is the only practical place where US customs officials can conduct their duties. 
    The defect here is in going back to your initial question is that the border search cases, which allowed even certain exceptions, which setup the functional equivalent system and allowed certain exceptions to normal probable cause, excuse me, to normal search and stop procedures, where search is conducted by customs officials and persons authorized to do that, and that by its very nature, limited the type of the search.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="342.191" stopTime="347.406">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Couldn't the United States put policemen on the border between Mexico and the United States?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="347.406" stopTime="348.424">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Absolutely.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="348.424" stopTime="352.894">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    As such, there is no magic in the word customs, is there?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="352.894" stopTime="360.371">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    There is no magic in the word customs. 
    You can clearly put one there if there is in fact an international border, but I think the --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="360.371" stopTime="363.756">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    There is and I am talking about the Mexican border right now.
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="363.756" stopTime="364.396">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Absolutely, you can put â€“-
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="364.396" stopTime="369.183">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    They are customs agents. Could they change their title to policemen?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="369.183" stopTime="369.838">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Absolutely.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="369.838" stopTime="371.251">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And do the same thing?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="371.251" stopTime="423.957">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Absolutely. 
    But the analogy I think as to when you can put a policeman there and when you put someone else there, applies more to what is sometimes used as inspection searches that is where State of California may setup an inspection point for pest and plant material coming in from Arizona. 
    In a situation like that, clearly they can't setup and have never tried to setup police officers to search people coming from Arizona to California, but they have had a very limited scope of authority covered by regulatory discretion for health officials to examine matter coming in. 
    And so, there is a distinction in that thing between a police officer and a customs type official.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Remcho, you are arguing the Fourth Amendment here I take it. 
    Does the Fourth Amendment plane out so to speak limit the authority of the Puerto Rican legislature?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="454.698" stopTime="465.482">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    The Fourth Amendment in my view clearly limits the authority of the Puerto Rican legislature, that is correct, and I would say in any one of the four rationale that we set forth in our brief.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="465.482" stopTime="474.552">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Either because it is analogous to a state and the Fourth Amendment is incorporated by the Fourteenth?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="474.552" stopTime="499.434">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    No. 
    I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I was persuaded by your dissent in Otero that in passing the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments, clearly distinction was made between a state and something, which is not a state. 
    So, I am not arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment in and off itself carries the Fourth Amendment into Puerto Rico in the traditional incorporation doctrine.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="499.434" stopTime="509.211">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We are on pretty thin ground, if you are persuaded by my dissent in Otero, since you presumably have eight people versus one person?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="509.211" stopTime="564.307">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Well, I am persuaded only by the point that the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply directly in the same fashion as if Puerto Rico were a state. 
    I am not saying that that is what does it. 
    What I am saying is that what I take it the majority meant in that case was that when Congress pursuant to its territorial power created this compact with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and said that all the constitutional provisions not inapplicable will apply, that the Fourth Amendment applies in that manner, and through that way, but I do not -- So that is how it applies as a state. 
    Congress said it will apply as if it were a state. 
    I do not read the opinion to say anything other than it applies just like the Fourteenth Amendment by necessarily it comes directly from it.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="564.307" stopTime="568.694">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So, and the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="568.694" stopTime="570.022">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    That is correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="570.022" stopTime="582.779">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Now, I take it in times of emergency, a city or a particular area can declare a curfew that it couldn't declare it other times without violating the Fourth Amendment?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="582.779" stopTime="590.140">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    I suppose that would depend very much on the facts of the situation but I concede that is possible at some point.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="590.140" stopTime="631.430">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So supposing that Puerto Rican legislature here had decided that there was, and I gather from the opinions of the three justices in the minority in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that there was a real crime wave and a drug wave in Puerto Rico and that a great deal of it was the result of people coming into Puerto Rico from the United States. 
    Do you think it is wholly beyond reason to think that the Fourth Amendment would permit airport searches of luggages where you do not have homes involved or you can perhaps stop all that traffic in one public area?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="631.430" stopTime="674.229">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    I do think it is wholly unreasonable. 
    I think that in the first place, there are absolutely no facts in any offered by the government or in the legislative finding that there is a danger from these guns, which supports anything other than a generalized statement that there is a danger. 
    When I spoke of a curfew, I could see it in a narrow situation when perhaps you know, if there is an earthquake in San Francisco, you can impose a curfew, but to say that you could impose a curfew at any time because of a non-differentiated, generalized concern about the con problem is to just totally ignore the 200 centuries of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, which you said --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="674.229" stopTime="674.775">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Two centuries.

speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="709.860" stopTime="719.279">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    I think that is probably correct.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Oh! 
    Yes, but then he says that, that leaves only the issue, which you want to argue about the failure of the court below to give you relief because of the four-three rule or the majority rule, the "super-majority" rule?

    Mr. Joseph Remcho

    We are in the same position in this Court, I take it, as if we had lost seven-nothing below. 
    We did not lose seven-nothing below. 
    We lost four-three to below pursuant to that particular Puerto Rico constitutional provision. 
    A judgment was entered against us. 
    We made a timely appeal to this Court. 
    The judgment upheld the validity of the conviction. 
    What we are asking this Court to do is to reverse that conviction; to say that the Fourth Amendment prohibits that search and judgment for the appellant has to be entered.

    Mr. Joseph Remcho

    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    I think you can and the reason is this. 
    The government appealed at the time; both two things. 
    We appealed; the government contended at that time and continued to contend until recently that, that Fourth Amendment judgment was wrong. 
    If this Court, which is a final arbitrator of the Fourth Amendment says to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, we tell you that that you were right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="911.200" stopTime="912.135">

    That you were right --

    That you were quite right.
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="913.637" stopTime="919.943">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho

    Justice Byron R. White 
    They have already declared it, but they say we have no power under the Puerto Rican Law to reverse this judgment; we just do not have that power?

    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    I understand that. 
    They do not have the power. 
    If it is they who say that the statute is unconstitutional. 
    If this Court says that the statute is unconstitutional, there is nothing in the Puerto Rico constitution, which prohibits that Court from entering judgment favoring the appellant.

    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    No, I am not saying that the Akron versus Bryant may be inadequate state ground at all. 
    What I am saying, I am saying that the decision in Akron is wrong, excuse me, that the decision below upholding that judgment while they thought the statute was not constitutional, is incorrect. 
    I am saying, you do not necessarily have to reach the issue of whether Akron was wrong, because I think you can just go back to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court with a declaration that that statute is unconstitutional and that Court --

    There is no more controversy over that then it would be after a court entered judgment, if anyone anywhere along the line gave up on that issue.

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I want to make a few comments about what was raised in the â€“ giving before the lunch hour. First this Court is not bound by the concessions of a government. 
    In Sibron versus New York for example, the Kings County prosecutor conceded that, that statute had been violated. 
    And this Court pointed out that concessions by the parties do not relieve it from what it called the obligation to perform a judicial function, where federal constitutional rights in state courts are decided and where this Court is already had the benefit of full briefing and argument on that Fourth Amendment claim, it seems to me that the concession of the government would not bind this Court.

    Fourâ€“toâ€“two, that is right. 
    If Puerto Rico had a rule that there was no appeal allowed at all from a decision by a lower court, we would be -- and the lower court had upheld the statute, this Court would have full authority to decide that statute. 
    The fact that there was no appellate review at least putting aside the question of whether it is required, at least would not be considered in independent state ground to uphold the judgment of the lower court. 
    And what is happened is that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has taken Article V, Section 4 and said that renders it powerless in a sense to decide this appeal. 
    And if that is true, it is no different then if we directly here from the judgment of the Superior Court, which is a judgment in question.

    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    No, it does not because if that is a valid rule, the effect of upholding that rule is to leave a statute which the government of Puerto Rico itself concedes is not constitutional in full place and in full effect.

    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    I think the adequate state ground thing is somewhat different. 
    The adequate state ground in the classic sense is when there is a constitutional provision gives more rights than the federal constitution allows. 
    This Court has said in the past that a local procedural rule which this is of the state cannot be used to foreclose federal constitutional right, you did that in Chambers --

    What if it had happened that your Fourth Amendment issue had not been properly raised in the lower court and the Puerto Rican Supreme Court said, we just will not rule on that, because you did not raise it as our rules require and so we affirm the judgment. 
    Now if you came here, we would say that we would deny or dismiss because of an adequate state ground, but it would not foreclose you from federal -- would not necessarily foreclose you from federal habeas?

    With respect to this habeas corpus relief --

    On the habeas corpus issue, under Stone against Powell, is habeas corpus is available?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="1516.029" stopTime="1557.673">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    I think that is an open question. 
    Either it is not available because there was a full and fair hearing in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court or if there was not a full and fair hearing in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, then it seems to we should prevail on our due process ground. 
    So I would say that, habeas is only available if we have that full and fair hearing. 
    If a court says ultimately that it will not entertain on habeas corpus and if the Puerto Rico Supreme Court on remand says, it is still powerless to enter the judgment, then in fact this statute, this Public Law 22 will remain on the books. 
    Even the government thinks it is unconstitutional and hopefully some members of this Court think it is unconstitutional.

    If the supreme Court of Puerto Rico -- if the constituent act said in so many words that the supreme Court of Puerto Rico will not consider any United States constitutional claims in hearing an appeal from a conviction.

   Argument of Roberto Armstrong, Jr.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1720.546" stopTime="1723.380">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Can you get us out of this Mr. Armstrong?
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="1723.380" stopTime="2091.342">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    I will try, Chief Justice, and thank you and may it please the Court. 
    I believe that the main issue before this Court is whether the appellant properly raised before the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico the issue that there was a conflict meeting federal law and the non-reversal of the conviction on account of the Puerto Rican constitutional section that binds probably on the decisions based on local rule. 
    In this case the four justices, the four judges who decided in favor of reversal, they did not decide only on the local grounds. 
    They decided on Fourth Amendment, of Fourth Amendment and local Article 10 rights. 
    There is no question in my mind that on the Ohio versus Akron Park decision, the more than simple majority requirement for wiping out a law, a statute is reasonable. 
    So as far as the local law is concerned, I believe that the decision is a final and there is nothing more toward the audit and nothing that can be brought to this Court. 
    It was only apparently a decision on local rule. 
    However, we recognize that there is a conflict opened here. 
    It was a conflict between the Fourth Amendment right on which the four judges' decision is based. 
    The federal basis of that decision is the one that probably opens a supremacy clause issue that properly raised before by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico could give jurisdiction to this Court to adjudicate this case. 
    In other words, the case was not that -- the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico was never apprised of the existence of a supremacy clause conflict. 
    In fact, our rationale thinking is that we want to make clear. 
    The appellate procedure in Puerto Rico gives appellant ten days after entering of judgment to file a motion for reconsideration. 
    We agree we grant that, that was the first opportunity that the appellant had to raise the federal issue. 
    That was the first opportunity he had to raise the supremacy clause effect on that constitutional provision that says that no presumably local law can be ruled unconstitutional except by the absolute majority of the judges, composing the Supreme Court. 
    We believe that there is a possibility of the supremacy clause conflict because that obviously refers to local law issues, not to cases where, as in this one, the ruling is based on federal grounds besides the local ground. 
    So I believe that the failing to put to timely raise the issue before the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, appellant waived the right to bring the case here. 
    Later 121 days, say he had first ten working days to file his motion for reconsideration. 
    In 121 days of that appeal had been proceeded here, -- appeal is already in process. 
    They filed a motion for rehearing, there is something lurking in background there, of all the constitutional supremacy's, federal supremacy's. 
    Well they believe that the -- these are cases and appealed cases, these Ohio cases, Slayer versus Ohio, Riley versus Ohio they state that they were on issue, these will be raised. 
    It shall be raised explicitly with timeliness and in a way that there would be no question that, that issue is being raised. 
    On implication of a federal issue is not enough to put the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in a position to rule on whether or not the constitutional Article V, Section 4 conflicts insofar as this case, it conflicts with the Fourth Amendment right of appellant and the matter of refrain from original resurges. 
    The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico never said nobody --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Let me see if I understand you Mr. Armstrong. 
    Are you saying this that within the 10 days after this decision came down in the Supreme Court, he should have applied or should have made an allegation, petition for rehearing or whatever it may be, that as applied to a case where four thought the federal question constitutional question should be decided in favor of the accused, that not therefore to reverse the judgment of conviction, somehow violated some provision of the federal constitution, is that it?

    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr.

    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    The probable or reasonableness of the statute, of the evidences of the search, on what the evidence was. 
    That was what the four judges found to be in conflict.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2166.430" stopTime="2183.023">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well I know, but I thought what you told me was that what you should have done was file a petition for rehearing and say that it could not apply the state constitutional provision requiring five votes, because this was a federal constitutional determination by four that the statute was unconstitutional.
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="2183.023" stopTime="2183.974">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    On federal grounds.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2183.974" stopTime="2197.671">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    On federal grounds and therefore that they could not affirm the judgment of conviction under the state constitutional, Puerto Rico constitutional provision, but had to reverse it. 
    Now, what is the federal ground for that claim?
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="2197.671" stopTime="2199.259">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    The supremacy clause.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2199.259" stopTime="2200.329">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The supremacy clause.
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="2200.329" stopTime="2254.567">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    Because the judges were bound by the supremacy clause which says that they shall rule on the federal law notwithstanding any provision in the constitution or the laws of the state to be contrary. 
    If the man had a four-to-three acquittal on federal grounds; on federal grounds that was enough for acquittal, but the point was that, that issue was never raised. 
    The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico never had the opportunity to decide on that issue and that is why we believe that remand is now the appropriate remedy. 
    I believe that this means something because there is no federal issue properly raised; there is no federal question before this Court.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2254.567" stopTime="2256.890">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And therefore you say the appeal should be dismissed?
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="2256.890" stopTime="2257.328">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    The appeal should be --

    The appeal to this Court be dismissed?

    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    The appeal in this Court should be dismissed, probably as they are consolidated them on a reasonable grounds for a federal habeas because he has been has got that four-to-three decision there. 
    Well, as far as this appeal, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has not passed on the question that this brought to this Court at this time. 
    So only Court decides that the issue, only court decides whether or not that absolute majority principle is binding in our cases, and with our laws whether federal or commonwealth. 
    I believe the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has not entered any decision with the federal provision, sufficiently substantial to come before this Court.

    Then that could have been done by the seven people involved.

    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    They could listen to the argument on federal supremacy.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What could they have done said that statute was â€“ that constitution was unconstitutional?

    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    No, not necessarily but they have to say --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What could they have said?
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="2453.989" stopTime="2474.372">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    They could have said that when the statute conflicts with federal law, the rule because Puerto Rican constitutional rule does not apply, that it only applies to unconstitutionality base.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2474.372" stopTime="2480.294">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And therefore is the man released or still here?

    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    We will be releasing in that case, we have problem.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2482.084" stopTime="2483.252">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    He would be released.

    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    He will be released if they found that there was a conflict that rendered, that they eliminated the bar, that these are raised by this Puerto Rican constitutional provision against the clearing along constitutional except [Inaudible]
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2501.831" stopTime="2505.935">

    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    They should have known what that â€“ the point was not there specifically raised then. 
    They were looking at it from the local law standpoint.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2517.070" stopTime="2531.300">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But Mr. Armstrong, you are saying that the defendant is in a worse position because three of the justices disagreed with him than he would have been if all seven justices disagreed with him?
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="2531.300" stopTime="2532.318">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    Why he will be in a worse?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2532.318" stopTime="2551.807">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, if all seven justices had rejected his constitutional claim, the judgment would have been affirmed and the statute would have been upheld. 
    And he certainly could have brought that claim here for independent decision by this Court on the federal constitutional question, could he not?
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="2551.807" stopTime="2620.769">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    Well, it would be the same situation again. 
    The point is that unless he raises the point in the state, the commonwealth, highest Court of Appeal level, he cannot bring it to this Court. 
    See, we are dealing with the appellate process. 
    Say what you have exactly what the state provides. 
    It is a matter of the state deciding what is going to be done in there for appellant review of the criminal provision. 
    It is not a matter of right. 
    We will, if they will agree that they -- whatever you can do in on appeal is a matter that depends on what the state grants you an appeal and the Puerto Rican appellate procedure includes that constitutional requirement that to declare it unconstitutional absolute majority of the members composing the court must vote for a constitutionality of the statute.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2620.769" stopTime="2651.893">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Supposing the Puerto Rican constitution went even further than it does now and said that no court in Puerto Rico shall ever have a right to upset a conviction of a criminal defendant on a federal constitutional ground, couldn't a defendant who asserted a federal constitutional ground that was not heard by any of the Puerto Rican courts for that reason, nonetheless bring that case here?
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="2651.893" stopTime="2689.052">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    Well, an absolute prohibition like that is I believe that the -- on the certain circumstances may raise a compelled -- some kind of appellant review. 
    Well, it will be on the federal question, not on local law, because on local law, he will not have a right to an appeal, but as a matter of federal law, even if they were no longer in those circumstances, he may have a federal question that he could bring to this Court.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Armstrong, do you have some cases in this Court by any chance with respect to this? 
    Suppose as in this case, there is a federal issue that does not emerge or does not appear until after the highest Court of the state has decided the case, which is true here I gather. 
    And under the state procedure that new issue that has emerged could be presented by a petitioner for rehearing to the highest Court of the state. 
    Are there some cases here that say that before the looser can bring the case here, he must file a petition for rehearing? 
    Is there some cases here in our Courts that say that he has not presented the issue to the state court?
speaker="roberto_armstrong_jr" startTime="2849.221" stopTime="2862.774">
    Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr. 
    I know that at least in the Akron case, the Ohio case, they mention that the petition was not timely filed and there are other cases where they said that the --

    Yeah, you have about three minutes left.
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="2936.941" stopTime="2971.849">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Thank you. 
    With respect to the timely raising the petition, Rule 45 (d), the rules in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico says that if you file a petition beyond the ten-day period, then that will be not be granted unless it will have no effect on the -- will not be acted unless it has no effect on the mandate and in fact this late petition was acted on by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. 
    They did not say they were denying it as untimely. 
    They made en banc and they acted on that late petition. 
    I am also not certain that there are any decisions of this --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2971.849" stopTime="2972.848">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And denied it?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="2972.848" stopTime="2974.214">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    And denied it; that is correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2974.214" stopTime="2986.726">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And you presented the claim that this constitutional provision was invalid under the federal constitution?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="2986.726" stopTime="2990.904">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    That is correct. 
    We relied there on the due process clause and we pointed out the difficulty --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2990.904" stopTime="2994.108">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And your petition for rehearing is in the record here or not?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="2994.108" stopTime="3033.645">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Yes it is. 
    It is reprinted in the motion to dismiss or affirm appendix there at pages 3A to 4A of the relevant sections, where it was raised on due process and also the Stine versus Powell ground and of course that carries with it, the supremacy clause grounds for example in Chapman versus California, the basis for decision there obviously was one of the supremacy of federal rights over local constitutional procedures, and the court there did not even mention the supremacy clause as it is often does not mention it, because it is the underpinning of everything there is with respect to this Court's actions over local rules.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3033.645" stopTime="3037.146">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And the Supreme Court en banc simply denied the motion, was that it?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="3037.146" stopTime="3038.268">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    That is correct; there was nothing about this being untimely.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3038.268" stopTime="3042.186">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now, we do not know they denied it as out of time or --
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="3042.186" stopTime="3061.255">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    We do not know that. 
    We do know that there is an appellate procedure, which suggests that the court should not file one, which is out of time and it may very well be that the court directed to file this one, fully considered it, denied it on the merits. 
    But I think the inference is that it was heard on the merits, it was heard en banc.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3061.255" stopTime="3066.893">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why is that the inference?
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="3066.893" stopTime="3077.580">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Because of the Section of 45 (b), which states that a petition for rehearing ought not to be filed if it is late by the clerk and then there is a certain inconsistency between that and 45 (d).

    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    I do not think it is necessary, because the Ohio had two things this case does not. 
    First of all, it was a civil case and second, there was already intermediate full appellate review in the Ohio court, so that case can certainly be distinguished.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3158.046" stopTime="3166.269">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Well, I think that bond approval matters and those were to civil matters have historically been treated very, very differently from the enforcement of federal constitutions rights.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3175.582" stopTime="3195.474">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Remcho, I must say, wasn't this rule 45 or rather [Inaudible] any motion for reconsideration must, if the aforementioned term of ten working days and then in the last sentence, the clerk shall deny outright any petition for extension to file a motion for reconsideration.
speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="3195.474" stopTime="3215.042">
    Mr. Joseph Remcho 
    Well, I think there is a certain inconsistency between that and between 45(d), which appears on page 7, which says any motion for reconsideration filed out of the aforementioned terms shall be considered by the court only to the extent that it does not effect the mandate and here of course the mandate had already been stayed. 
    Frankly it appears --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3215.042" stopTime="3217.966">
