Secretary of Public Welfare of Pennsylvania v. Institutionalized Juveniles

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in 1715, Secretary of Public Welfare of Pennsylvania. 
    Mr. Noble, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready. 
    Excuse me, Mr. Watkins, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="65.539" stopTime="274.161">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from a three-judge court determination that two of Pennsylvania statutes, which provide that parents may voluntarily admit their children to mental health or mental retardation treatment in Pennsylvania facilities are unconstitutional. 
    The statutes involved, are first, a 1966 Act that provides that parents of a mentally retarded child under the age of 18 may apply for voluntary admission of that child to treatment upon acceptance and the determination that the child is in fact in need of mental retardation therapy. 
    The child may then be admitted upon the application of the child. 
    The 1976 Act provides that parents of a mentally-ill child under the age of 14, upon the application of the parent and upon the determination of a psychiatrist or physician of the need for treatment may consent to the voluntary treatment of that child. 
    Furthermore, under the 1966 Act, Pennsylvania promulgated regulations that require -- and this deals with the mentally retarded again that require not one but two independent medical determinations that the child is in fact retarded and requires the treatment which has been recommended. 
    The plaintiffs in this case and there are 12 of them, nine of whom are mentally ill and three mentally retarded, all were admitted upon application of their parent or guardian or one standing in loco parentis. 
    Eight were in fact admitted by their parents and four were admitted by childcare agencies in as much as they were for one reason or another words of the state. 
    Each of these children, and this is typical, have had, and the record shows this, a minimum of three independent medical evaluations indicating the need for the treatment for which about which they were receiving. 
    Furthermore, not one of these appellees nor any members of the class involved -- strike that. 
    Not one of these appellees sought to terminate that treatment by way of any of existing court procedures of which they may avail themselves from moment one after the admission. 
    Furthermore, as we stand here, some of the appellees remain in the treatment setting and there is no proceed -- there are no proceedings underway in state court to terminate that treatment. 
    Nevertheless, the plaintiff's brought this challenge primarily and exclusively on the Due Process Clause asserting that prior to the effectuation of the admission, the children had a right to counsel and the full panoply of due process. 
    The lower court agreeing with the plaintiff's ordered essentially two hearings. 
    First, what was called a probable cause hearing at which it would be determined if in fact the child -- if in fact there was probable cause in the courts or the tribunals view to believe that the child was mentally ill or retarded and whether or not the medically recommended treatment was in fact advisable. 
    Within two weeks of that hearing, assuming affirmative findings on both counts, the tribunal would convene a full adversary proceeding at which the findings required are whether in fact the child is mentally ill or retarded and whether in fact the treatment which has been medically recommended is approved by the court or tribunal.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You say or tribunal, what's the alternative court?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="278.496" stopTime="313.670">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Initially, this case has been here before. 
    Initially the lower court required judicial hearings. 
    This order was slightly amended to allow the state to provide neutral trib -- an independent neutral tribunal. 
    However, it should be noted that this tribunal must have the authority to protect the child's rights which are specified by the order to cross-examination to present testimony and furthermore to approve a waiver of this significant constitutional right which the child has been given by the lower court's order. 
    So, I would --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="313.670" stopTime="316.425">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Did the Pennsylvania legislature created such a tribunal?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="316.425" stopTime="345.605">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Not at this time, Your Honor. 
    I would suggest also that the Court's modifications as to the tribunal and counsel, that the requirement of counsel has been substituted by a requirement for a trained advocate. 
    However, once again, this trained advocate must be able to vouchsafe the child's rights to cross-examine, confront witnesses, to present testimony and in fact must be able to make the legal determination of whether or not the child should waive his rights to --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="345.605" stopTime="350.389">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, what's the source of these supplemental standards?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="350.389" stopTime="351.078">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    The source --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="351.078" stopTime="353.084">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Where did they come from?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="353.084" stopTime="355.958">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    The lower court modified the original word that was here.

speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="357.269" stopTime="370.078">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    After the remand. 
    And those are two significant modifications. 
    However, as I relate my brief the practical effect of them is probably not very significant in as much as the lawyer and a judge would talk --

    Mr. Norman J. Watkins

    But did the District Court --

    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    There was no elucidation on that point, presumably --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="384.011" stopTime="388.915">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Presuming the District Court, the source is the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="388.915" stopTime="392.622">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Oh! 
    Absolutely, the entire order is predicated upon that.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="392.622" stopTime="394.598">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Frankly, it couldn't be anywhere else.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="394.598" stopTime="401.419">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I didn't ask my question clearly enough by source. 
    I simply meant, where is this pool of trained advocates?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="401.419" stopTime="452.743">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Not exist presently, Mr. Justice Brennan other than the bar. 
    And as I -- again, in order to waive this right, which the trained advocate would have the right to do, I would suspect that a lawyer would be required. 
    There are two threshold questions in this case as in the previous. 
    The first is of course whether or not these children in these context posses a liberty interest which cognizable under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It is my position that the lower court in finding such a liberty interest made essentially for analytical errors. 
    First, without any evidence whatsoever, the lower court presumed that in this context, parents maybe presumptively assumed to act contrary to the interest of their children. 
    Moreover, the Court presumed without any evidence bearing this out that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="452.743" stopTime="459.150">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that doesn't really have anything to do with whether or not there's a deprivation of liberty, does it?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="459.150" stopTime="467.294">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Well, I think to the extent that the lower court relied on this Court's analysis In re Gault, it certainly does because clearly --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="467.294" stopTime="476.870">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    A voluntary commitment results in a deprivation of liberty, doesn't it? 
    A voluntary commitment by an adult results in a deprivation of liberty.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="476.870" stopTime="478.241">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    A voluntary or involuntary?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="478.241" stopTime="479.349">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Voluntary.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="479.349" stopTime="481.475">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    A deprivation of liberty, absolutely --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="481.475" stopTime="481.738">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're correct.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="481.738" stopTime="483.475">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    But it's not of constitutional significance --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="483.475" stopTime="486.170">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But it better does reads all in a deprivation of liberty.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="486.170" stopTime="487.990">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    That is correct. 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="487.990" stopTime="500.729">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So, therefore I would think this view of the District Court which you're attacking has nothing to do with basically, or is irrelevant to the question of whether or not there's a deprivation of liberty.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="500.729" stopTime="565.194">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Well, the point is that the lower court by relying on this court's decision In re Gault, I think misperceived the relationships at stake in this case. 
    For example, the lower court would like in the relationship of a doctor, parent and child to the relationship of prosecutor and defendant. 
    Obviously when one looks at the relationship between prosecutor and defendant in the criminal context, there is a conflict of interest from inherent in that relationship and it should be presumed. 
    That is not so in the relationship between a parent and child and between a doctor and patient and the lower court's presumptions to this effect on a barren record should be overturned. 
    Finally and has been discussed at great length in the prior argument, the lower court's order ignores entirely the traditional role of the family in these decisions. 
    Obviously, these are very difficult decisions. 
    Nevertheless, it's just these type of decisions that we entrust the family, entrust to the family and entrust to the family in conjunction with a physician in the medical context.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="565.194" stopTime="571.982">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    None of these things you've been talking about has anything to do with whether or not there's a deprivation of liberty, does it?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="571.982" stopTime="579.641">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    I believe it does Mr. Justice Stewart in the sense that when a parent acts on behalf of his child, he is normally presumed to act on behalf of the child.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="579.641" stopTime="585.952">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right, but when an adult acts on behalf of himself, he's presumed to be acting on behalf on himself.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="585.952" stopTime="586.312">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="586.312" stopTime="594.863">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In his best interest. 
    And when he voluntarily commits himself to a hospital, there is a deprivation of liberty. 
    Whatever else there maybe, there is that.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="594.863" stopTime="599.085">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    That's correct, that's correct, but in as much as it voluntary, no additional proceedings are required.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="599.085" stopTime="607.103">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So in other words, even if you're right in all of your submissions on what you've just been telling us, there still remains a deprivation of liberty.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="607.103" stopTime="619.552">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    To the -- that's correct. 
    As a factual matter, the question which first must be addressed though is whether or not as a constitutional matter, when parents act on behalf of their children in this context --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="619.552" stopTime="622.157">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Whether it's the equivalent of a voluntary admission.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="622.157" stopTime="623.289">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    That's correct, that's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="623.289" stopTime="626.427">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's the point isn't it?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="626.427" stopTime="676.321">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    The analysis that we would urge upon this Court is of course the Court's analysis that was used in Mathews versus Eldridge whether or not in Pennsylvania, the children have been adequately protected throughout the process. 
    In Pennsylvania, before a child can be admitted upon the application of his parent, there must be at least one and most times to medical determination independent indicating the need for treatment. 
    Moreover, from the moment the admission begins, the child has the right to initiate judicial proceedings, to test the validity of the treatment, to test the validity of the decision of the physicians and the parents and to test whether or not in fact the entire procedure was constitutional, if you will. 
    Every issue is presented in this case could well have presented and presented through habeas corpus proceedings in state court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="676.321" stopTime="678.531">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How does the child initiate that?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="678.531" stopTime="698.328">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    The child may initiate that in a number of ways. 
    Obviously, the child can initiate it himself if competent enough to do so in sufficient maturity. 
    The child may also do so through a friend, through a next friend, through -- it is not institutionalized by way of statute that the child is automatically appointed and advocate. 
    He is --

    Justice John Paul Stevens

speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="704.190" stopTime="708.202">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    The Pennsylvania law is very clear that any person confined --

    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    I'm not aware of any decisions on that point, but I think the statute is so clear that it would not be (Voice Overlap).
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="717.412" stopTime="724.607">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, what if the parent can waive any -- if the parent can waive all the child's rights, why couldn't the parent waive the right to bring this proceeding?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="724.607" stopTime="739.921">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Because as I say, in contra distinction to the statute which provides that a parent may apply for admission, the statute regarding habeas corpus indicates very clearly that any person who is institutionalized or in a facility may challenge the basis.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="739.921" stopTime="750.692">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, but a child under ordinary -- quite apart from this particular context or setting, generally in Pennsylvania, a parent speaks for his child, doesn't it?

    That's correct.

    I would assume that if a child initiated such a proceeding, the parent's voice would be given heavy credence by the court, but I don't think it will be --

    The purposes of that confinement are manifestly different, however, than the purposes of the confinement in this case. 
    And I should point out that the confinement which has been attacked and adjoined in this case. 
    The treatment runs the gambit not only from institutions but all the way down to group homes and small family-like setting. 
    So that many of the arguments which may or may not exist indicating that their need be safeguards against such treatment really do not apply with respect to this Court's order. 
    I would also urge that one of the primary reasons that we import or place importance on these procedures is to minimize the child's admitted interest in not being erroneously admitted to a mental health and mental retardation facility. 
    I would suggest that the record in this case as well as Pennsylvania statutes indicate very clearly that rigorous safeguards are in placed to assure that in fact this medical determination of the need for treatment is appropriate and that the admission and the treatment undertaken is appropriate. 
    It's important to know that in Pennsylvania there are required by law periodic reviews of the child's treatment program. 
    So, that if it turns up that the child no longer needs treatment, by law the child must be discharge from treatment.

    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Pennsylvania, the law with respect to the mentally ill is very specific that they must be provided the least restrictive setting upon which treatment may be -- where a treatment maybe afforded. 
    The law is not that clear with respect to the mentally retarded that is the older statute.

    Not only because of the legal mandate but the state has an interest in keeping the roles of its facilities down.

speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="1149.058" stopTime="1176.226">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Pennsylvania -- Mr. Justice Blackmun, Pennsylvania is making a strong effort at lowering the population of its facilities and has done a great deal toward that. 
    The fact of the matter is that resources are not being placed in institutions but rather diverted to community resources. 
    It's a long and arduous task but at present time with that effort in mind, it's simply is very difficult to gain admission to a facility of Pennsylvania.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1176.226" stopTime="1183.891">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, I'm merely saying that I question the accuracy of your statement because I know states where there is surplus room in state institutions.
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="1183.891" stopTime="1306.702">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    I may have taken -- I may have taken liberty. 
    I know that it generally referred to in studies as a common national problem the overuse and over utilization and under staffing of facilities throughout the country. 
    However, there're maybe states in far better shape than Pennsylvania in that respect. 
    The point that I was making is that lower court's finding and central to the plaintiff's case I think is a presumptive mistrust of medical determinations in this area. 
    And I suppose that the mistrust brings a large part from the nature of the treatment that often follows a medical determination in this area. 
    I would suggest first and foremost that the evidence in this record does not indicate that any of the medical evaluations and recommendations for treatment were in fact erroneous, were in fact inadvisable. 
    I would further suggest that the Court made no findings to that effect and I would suggest that that if indeed it is difficult for psychiatrist and psychologist to make these difficult determinations, it probably would be equally as difficult for lawyers and judges to do so who were completely untrained in the field. 
    It's this lack of merit for the adversary proceedings that is most troubling to me. 
    We are going to inject into the diagnostic process a procedure which had best is going to prove to probably ratify any unchecked medical opinions that are offered at the trial and if not it's going to prove as a debating ground for professionals in the field and I question whether or not the tribunal would be qualified to determine the final result accurately. 
    It's important to note that Pennsylvania if there is disagreement with respect to the retarded. 
    If there is disagreement with between professionals as to the admission, the admission simply does not take place and may not take place.

    Mr. Watkins, I think we were told that in Georgia if the institution determines that the child could better be treated at home but the parents say, “No!” 
    We simply can't take care of the child at home.

    The institution will take the child.

    That is not the case as far as I know. 
    The determination must be made by the institution independently of any recommendations that come to it that the child is in fact retarded and in fact needs the treatment at that facility. 
    So, that absent those findings by the state, there could be no admission.

speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="1394.670" stopTime="1458.422">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    In Pennsylvania, the mental and retarded may not be admitted to any state or private facility without two independent determinations that that admission is required. 
    Furthermore, the children 13 years of age and older under the regulations are provided if they object in any way orally and writing to the continuation of the treatment they automatically provided counsel and automatically provided what amounts to an involuntary commitment proceeding. 
    That's for children 13 and over -- children 13 and under is presumed that they cannot competently object. 
    A presumption which I might add carries throughout medicine in Pennsylvania. 
    Children under the age of 18 in Pennsylvania unless they are married or pregnant or seeking pregnancy services simply may not consent to or withdraw from treatment absent parental consent. 
    And thus, the program with respect to mental illnesses is very similar.

    The same arguments plus the assertion that I've made in my brief that with respect to admissions to private facilities, there's simply is no state action. 
    The state employees are not involved, state employees don't provide the examinations, state employees in fact play no part at the admission process and in fact, the state receives no notice necessarily of these admissions. 
    The only contact the state has with respect to these and they're probably over 350 private facilities involved. 
    The only contact that it would have is the fact that the legislature has provided the rules under which they are suppose to provide these admissions.

    I suggest that that is not the test this Court has set down in cases such as Flagg Brothers and Metropolitan Edison and similar cases. 
    So, that what we have involved here so that we're entirely clear are not only the mentally ill but the mentally retarded and not only state institutions but private as well and not only institutions but group homes and community based treatment facilities as well. 
    Any time, any parent seeks in-patient psychiatric or mental retardation habilitation services for his child in Pennsylvania there must be that full panoply of due process unless those procedures are waived.

    There is no regulatory body to approve each admission or to see that in fact that is followed. 
    One presumes that these facilities are following state law. 
    The fact of the matter is that in Pennsylvania and involved in this case are a number of facilities that bear no relationship whatsoever to what we normally have in mind when we talk about mental institutions. 
    Facilities that may indeed be private schools or the like that have been because of some special cadre of professionals that they employ have been approved by the state to provide these services when necessary. 
    The fact of the matter is that the lower court's order would require treatment of all of those children as prospective mental patients. 
    I think that this clearly is going to be injurious to the children, it certainly not going to be conducive to the undertaking to serious undertakings, the serious undertakings that area taken place in those facilities.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I'd like to begin by correcting a number of errors in Mr. Watkins presentation. 
    First, the habeas corpus statute in Pennsylvania page 6 of his brief indicates that the courts have jurisdiction over habeas cases only when the person has been committed by a court or by a two-doctor medical certificate but that statute has been declared unconstitutional. 
    If a child could get into court under habeas, I believe the statute would require the court to reject that petition. 
    Secondly, under the states --

    No. 
    For the mentally retarded, the recommendation for commitment can be made by any psychologist, by any physician, by any pediatrician regardless of the knowledge of that person of the needs of the mentally retarded. 
    For the mentally ill, there is no requirement in the commitment statute that there'd be any referral, any outside examination, any separate examination by anyone except the institutions and the psychiatrists. 
    Mr. Watkins is incorrect that the District Court or the plaintiffs have presumed anything about parents, children, the conflicts between parents and children, or between the institutions and the children. 
    The District Court found as a matter of fact that conflicts frequently arise with regard to mental institutionalization of children.

    As the District Court found, page 1077 in the appendix of the opinion, what we have here is not only the stigma of mental illness, not only the chance of error, not only the greater potential for long term loss of liberty. 
    But we also have the conflict or divergence of interest between the parents and the child that is not present when there are other medical treatments going on. 
    We also have the need here to consider a vast variety of non-medical considerations.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, let me interrupt you for a moment. 
    If your critical element is the potential conflict of interest, and that's what distinguishes it from physical treatment, why shouldn't the factual inquiry that you proposed under the lower court said was referred by a counsel be limited to the issue of whether or not there is in fact a conflict of interest between the parents and the children rather than this elaborate findings whether the child is or is not mentally treatable, that sort of thing?

    Mr. David Ferleger 
    The full hearing that the lower court described, the right to confrontation and presence of personal unless waive those rights even the right to counsel would not come into place unless the advocate for the child is independent party who could look at that issue, decided not to waive the hearing or unless the child would confidently decide not to waive.

    Mr. David Ferleger 
    In our case the neutral decision maker would have to accept of reject the waiver.

    Mr. David Ferleger 
    The reason is a very important one that the advocate is not becoming a medical officer. 
    Medical officers are not presumptively mistrusted in my view and the District Court's view. 
    In a commitment to a mental hospital, there are important non-medical considerations that have to be taken into account. 
    The recommendation of a psychiatrist even if the company by the kind of detailed report that was required in Specht versus Patterson does not take care of the social interest consideration of the school, the community, the child's friends, the child's relatives, all the kind of background that is non-medical that must be considered, that the Court held must be considered in Gagnon, in the parole or probationers verification. 
    The doctor can make a recommendation for the medical factors, psychologists perhaps for the retarded because a doctor is not required in retardation because it's not a medical problem. 
    But the doctor cannot make the kinds of social judgments. 
    It's about depriving a person liberty. 
    And in my view and in the tradition of American Law and Pennsylvania Law in particular, commitments to mental hospitals are very different from other kinds of medically recommended treatment.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2894.562" stopTime="2899.173">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How long historically had there been state mental hospitals?
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="2899.173" stopTime="2943.198">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    The earliest institution I believe was built in 1751 in United States but there were very few until the mid-1800s. 
    And as the payment of being, the courts in Pennsylvania as I indicate in my brief made it very clear that whether it's commitment to a private or public institution, a guardian does not have that power. 
    And a number of early cases, people who have been appointed guardians of mentally ill or mentally retarded individuals attempted to commit their wards to a mental hospital. 
    And the Court said, “You cannot do that. 
    The power of a guardian does not extend to confinement in an institution.”
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2943.198" stopTime="2960.318">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But I suppose that before there were mental hospitals, power of the guardian to lock somebody up in an attic was unquestioned because that didn't involve any action by the state then therefore didn't implicate the Constitution.

    Mr. David Ferleger 
    Actually the first commitment in 1676 which occurred in Pennsylvania, the first commitment on record that I know of involved the father petitioning to colonial court in Pennsylvania for the commitment of his son. 
    And the court ordered that a blockhouse be built and that his son be confined in that blockhouse. 
    In Pennsylvania, it wasn't until 1966 when the statute challenge and this case was passed. 
    The parents had the right to indefinitely commit their children to mental institutions.

    Excuse me.
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="2994.107" stopTime="3008.143">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    Certainly. 
    Not until 1966 when the statute challenged before and today and this case was passed, that parents have the power to indefinitely sign their children into mental institutions.

speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3008.886" stopTime="3016.425">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    In Pennsylvania. 
    Pennsylvania from the beginning treated mental commitment as far different from any other kind.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3016.425" stopTime="3027.257">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And prior to 1966, what was the procedure for the so-called voluntary admission of somebody who would not reach --
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3027.257" stopTime="3074.953">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    For the mentally retarded, sworn affidavits were required and there was an application procedure that required doctors to submit something to a magistrate or a judge for the mentally ill back a while that the procedures changed over the years. 
    The first hint of the voluntary commitment by parents came in 1961 when the legislature allowed parents to sign their children in for up to 30 days after which a court commitment was required. 
    So, there has always been in Pennsylvania a balancing between the individual's interest and the parent's interest, with the parent only getting this awesome power not more than 12 years ago.

speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3098.321" stopTime="3154.615">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    May it please the Court. 
    I'd like to speak to two issues that came up earlier then refer briefly to several other issues that I believe are important. 
    First, the general issue in this case is how to protect children, people who were likely not be able to protect themselves when their parents maybe unable either by inclination or by information or lack of information to protect them. 
    It's my view that that the procedures ordered by the lower court are a process for determining whether the parents interest, the parents decision coincides with what the needs of the children are. 
    So, in effect we do have a process by which that determination weeding out the proper decisions by parents from the improper decisions, a process by which that can be done.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3154.615" stopTime="3192.358">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You haven't talked yet counsel about whether the net effect, the ultimate effect of this might be more damaging the children to take them through this gaunt of an adversary proceeding in which the very procedure itself puts them in opposition to their parents. 
    And of course where the serious emotional condition, they may already be in that posture. 
    Question is what evidences are here if any in the record about whether that would be a good thing for the children?
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3192.358" stopTime="3197.538">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    The District Court found as a fact in its opinion at page 1081 to 1082.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3197.538" stopTime="3207.083">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What's the evidence? 
    I know that the finding was. 
    I'm wondering, I want to know what the evidences to support that finding or whether that's just conjecture on the part of the Court.
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3207.083" stopTime="3235.123">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    It's not conjecture on the part of the Court. 
    It's based on the testimony of eight psychiatrists, four for each side in the first case and the testimony on the retarded uncontradicted of Commissioner Glenn. 
    That a hearing would not be traumatizing, that there'd be little trauma if at all and if there would be any trauma of course the presence of the hearing can be waived. 
    The tribunal can approve a waiver of the presence --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3235.123" stopTime="3237.033">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Presence of the child by the hearing.
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3237.033" stopTime="3239.758">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    That's correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3239.758" stopTime="3251.369">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Just within this context as a child what capacity does the child got to evaluate whether he or she should take part from this affair or should not?
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3251.369" stopTime="3297.677">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    If the child is able, the decision would be the child. 
    If the child is unable within the confines of the canons of ethics as Mr. Cromarty referred to, the waiver would be made by the counsel or advocate with the approval of the tribunal. 
    The other question Mr. Chief Justice you raised earlier on the role of counsel in this hearings, over the lunch break we read the opinion of the lower court and the lower court opinion makes it very clear in footnote 47, page 1079, that the advocate has to protect the child's interest rather than the all or nothing get the child out of the institution. 
    The function of the advocate according to the lower court is to advance the child's best interest.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3297.677" stopTime="3306.162">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But if the potential for deprivation of liberty that calls into existence the right to have an advocate in the first place, isn't it?
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3306.162" stopTime="3332.028">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    Yes it is. 
    The experts indicate and I believe the record is clear that when you're thinking about institutionalizing someone, you end up weighing the risks and the harms that are inherent in every institutionalization against the potential benefits. 
    And the advocate would have a responsibility for advocating whatever the best interest the child would be and that's --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3332.028" stopTime="3345.345">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But is that all and much different than to defend a lawyer for a defendant and a criminal case advised and the client to plead guilty?
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3345.345" stopTime="3378.037">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    I think a lawyer in certain criminal case probably has the obligation to advise the client to plead guilty or not. 
    However, in the criminal area I think that there is more of an obligation to avoid the criminal sanctions than the lower court put on the advocate here. 
    The responsibilities placed on the advocate here I think the fact that the lower court isn't required in counsel indicates that it's more of a best interest test rather than looking one way advocacy kind of thing.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3378.037" stopTime="3394.816">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, when you get to this point in this kind of another premise, you would have decided that the parents are not to make the decision. 
    That's a given factor here, isn't it. 
    But the parents are not to make this decision unilaterally.
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3394.816" stopTime="3395.714">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    Not unilaterally.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3395.714" stopTime="3422.988">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's no. 
    Having taken the parents out of the decision-making process then some doctors have presumably advise certain treatment and certain procedures. 
    And to go to a hearing, we're taking them out at least temporarily. 
    Taking them out until it has been subjected to an advisory proceeding of inquiry.
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3422.988" stopTime="3428.809">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    No, we're not taking the parents out. 
    We're not taking the doctor's out. 
    We're bringing them together.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3428.809" stopTime="3433.623">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Their decision isn't going to control, the decision of the parents is out.
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3433.623" stopTime="3434.701">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    Not.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3434.701" stopTime="3458.642">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I don't mean the physical presence obviously. 
    The parents are not going to be able to decide this. 
    Now then the doctors who'd been counseling the family. 
    They aren't going to be able to decide that alone. 
    Now you appoint on advocates. 
    And let's say the advocate looks at the whole situation over and then he decides what's best for the children, isn't that making the advocate virtually the judge on the many aspects?
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3458.642" stopTime="3476.600">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    The case would be presented to the neutral tribunal which would have to approve any waiver of the hearing. 
    That could be if anyone agreed, if the child, parents, doctors, advocate and all agreed that it was best for the child to be institutionalized, there wouldn't be a need for any full-time hearing at all.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3476.600" stopTime="3482.139">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Aren't you giving the advocate here a greater role and you're giving either the parents or the medical advisor?
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3482.139" stopTime="3489.504">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    No, because the unbiased tribunal has to confirm any waiver of any rights.

    Mr. David Ferleger 
    No, I don't think it would. 
    Two other points first. 
    The District Court's opinion is very clear as its order and a record in the case that this case only involves commitment to institutions not to group homes, not to community care. 
    It came up in the May 10, 1973 hearing. 
    It came up in our motion for a class action which said that facilities means institutions for residential treatment. 
    It came up in the courts order specifying that only evidence relating to institutional confinement was admissible and that is absolutely clear. 
    We're only talking about in-patient institutions for residential care.One other matter --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3584.741" stopTime="3590.759">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I take it you do agree that the advocate becomes in this setting a very important factor?
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3590.759" stopTime="3604.378">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    Yes. 
    And I think that the responsibilities of the advocate spelled out in the District Court's opinion along with the waiver provisions and the neutral tribunal's oversight of the whole processes --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3604.378" stopTime="3610.839">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is there anything in these standards to assure that he knows something about the subject?
speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3610.839" stopTime="3635.199">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    Yes. 
    The Court requires that -- the Court says that maybe sufficient to appoint a guardian trained in the mental health field who would advocate the child's interest or alternatively have the power to obtain a lawyer to do so. 
    That way, you have the best of both worlds. 
    You have a lawyer available if it's necessary and you have a trained mental health advocate for the situations where you don't need to get lawyers involved.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3635.199" stopTime="3639.534">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, the advocate then is a different fellow from this trained mental health person?

    Mr. David Ferleger 
    The advocate is the trained mental health person.

    You've lost me.

speaker="david_ferleger" startTime="3649.523" stopTime="3670.804">
    Mr. David Ferleger 
    That's right. 
    The Court said that it may not always be necessary to appoint a lawyer then it might be sufficient if the state came up with a procedure to appoint a guardian, a person trained in the mental health field who could advocate for the child's rights or alternatively have the power to obtain a lawyer.

    Mr. David Ferleger 
    The federal law under the Developmental Disabilities Act requires every state to have protection and advocacy system for the retarded. 
    For the mentally ill, many states such as New Jersey which filed in amicus brief here. 
    New York has the mental health information service.

    Nationally, 60% of commitments of children are children from 15 to 17 so we're probably talking about a rate of relatively few commitments. 
    For the retarded, many institutions in Pennsylvania no longer accept new commitments, institution where plaintiff George S. has not accepted any commitments since 1971 except under court order.

    First, in response to two questions I believe delivered by Mr. Justice White, Flagg Brothers. 
    This Court's opinion in Flagg Brothers was decided on May 15th and the opinion of the lower court was rendered on May 25th so that --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Was that -- do you know where the Flagg Brothers was brought to their attention?

    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    Unfortunately, my brief was filed well before this Court's decision in Flagg Brothers and I don't recall whether or not my opponent brought it to the Court's attention, I know --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4039.690" stopTime="4041.157">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What do you think have brought Flagg Brothers?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="4041.157" stopTime="4048.043">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    I think Flagg Brothers would respect to private license facilities indicates that there is no state action involved.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean that in this case?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="4049.930" stopTime="4050.912">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    In this case.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, you think that the District Court was wrong?
speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="4053.277" stopTime="4153.206">
    Mr. Norman J. Watkins 
    That's correct. 
    Secondly, I believe, Mr. Justice White you inquired us to whether or not Pennsylvania inspects these private facilities and Pennsylvanian all requires at 62 pertinent statutes 911 that an inspection be conducted at least annually as to the conditions in the facility. 
    The third point I wish to make is a clarification of a question addressed by Mr. Chief Justice Burger on whether or not any of or what the basis of Commissioner Glenn's testimony or conclusions was with respect to the erroneous submissions of children in Pennsylvania. 
    The fact of the matter is that not one of the experts that testified in this case examined any of the children involved in this case. 
    And the record reflects this very clearly. 
    For example I cite 2495 (a) of the appendix where Dr. Finder candidly admits that he was not familiar with any of the conditions in Pennsylvania. 
    635 (a), Dr. Messenger admits that the only thing that he was familiar with at the time of his testimony was that which was provided by counsel dealing with the legal process involved. 
    And finally 1030 (a), where Commissioner Glenn indicated that her only familiarity was with the regulations that was provided to her prior to her testimony. 
    Finally, I would only submit that the coverage of a lower court's order with respect to community-based facilities is clearly addressed in my reply brief, the green-covered reply brief and I defer to that. 
    Thank you very much.
