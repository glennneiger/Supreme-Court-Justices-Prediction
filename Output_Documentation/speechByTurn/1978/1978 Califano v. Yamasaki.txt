Califano v. Yamasaki

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in 1511, Califano against Elliot. 
    Mr. Buscemi, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="18.037" stopTime="187.423">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case involves a challenge to the procedures employed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in recovering overpayments to the beneficiaries of social security, old age, survivors, and disability insurance. 
    The principal question presented is whether a beneficiary is entitled to an evidentiary hearing before, rather than after, his monthly benefits are reduced to recover a previous overpayment. 
    The case is here for the second time on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    In 1976, in response to the Secretary's petition for review, this Court vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded for reconsideration in light of the decision in Mathews against Eldridge. 
    The Court of Appeals adhered to its initial result and the Secretary, again, sought certiorari. 
    There were two suits consolidated in the Court of Appeals: One, from the Western District of Washington, Buffington case and, the other, from the District of Hawaii, Elliot. 
    Buffington is a nationwide class action on behalf of recipients of old age and survivors benefits. 
    Elliot is limited to persons living in Hawaii but it includes disability beneficiaries as well as old age beneficiaries. 
    The procedures attacked by respondents begin with the Secretary's determination that an overpayment has occurred. 
    In many cases, this determination is based on an annual earnings report filed by the beneficiary himself. 
    Other times, the initial determination is based on the Secretary's independent discovery of some administrative error or a fact or event that affects a recipient's continuing eligibility for benefits. 
    When the Secretary concludes that an overpayment has occurred, he notifies the beneficiary of his determination. 
    Respondents' complaints in the District Courts challenge the adequacy of the notice provided, and the District Courts ordered that the Secretary provide a more detailed information about the reasons for the overpayment and the availability of administrative review. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed and the Secretary did not seek further review of this aspect of the Court's decision. 
    Instead, he has developed more elaborate notice forms that the Social Security Administration is now using in notifying beneficiaries that they've received overpayments. 
    There's apparently still some squabbling in the Court of Appeals over whether the new forms comply with the Court of Appeals' decision, but that question is not presented here.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="206.220" stopTime="210.909">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- appeals are now being controverted in the Court of Appeals.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="210.909" stopTime="332.054">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Right. 
    The Secretary's notice informs the beneficiary of the date and the amount of the overpayment and the way in which it occurred. 
    The local Social Security officers are instructed to make sure that the explanation is kept in simple and non-technical terms. 
    The notice also informs the beneficiary of the Secretary's proposed method of recovery. 
    The date of the first monthly payment to be reduced at the amount of the reduction, and the month in which full benefits will be resumed after the overpayment has been recovered. 
    In addition, the beneficiary is told that his right to request reconsideration of the overpayment determination or waiver of recovery or both. 
    And, standards for waiver are set forth in the notice and the procedures for requesting reconsideration or waiver are described. 
    They are-- the notice identifies the forms that must be completed in connection with an application for reconsideration or waiver, and volunteers the assistance of employees at local Social Security Offices in filling out the forms. 
    Finally, the beneficiary is advised that if he does request reconsideration or waiver within 30 days, his benefits will not be reduced until after the Secretary has acted on his request. 
    Even if no request is made within 30 days of the notice, a reconsideration request made within two months or a waiver request whenever made halts the reduction of benefits and results in the resumption of full benefits until after the Secretary has acted on the request. 
    The statutory provision that gives rise to all these procedures is Section 204 of the Social Security Act. 
    Section 204 (a) provides that whenever the Secretary find that more than the correct amount of payment has been made, proper adjustment or recovery shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, but Section 203 (b) adds a qualification. 
    It says that there shall be no recovery--

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    They are set out in the appendix to the certiorari petition at pages 155 (a) and 156 (a). 
    The qualification Section 204 (b) provides that there shall be no recovery in any case where the overpaid person is without fault in receiving the overpayment and where the recovery would defeat the purpose of the Social Security Insurance Program or would be against equity and good conscience.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="368.692" stopTime="388.111">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What do you take to mean by that, “without fault?” 
    Suppose there's a $5-increase by the state and the recipient cashes the check. 
    How does the “without fault” clause apply to that?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="388.111" stopTime="405.493">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the “without fault” language is described in the-- or is defined, I should say, in the Secretary's regulations in 20 CFR 404.507, I believe.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="405.493" stopTime="405.832">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How does what--
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="405.832" stopTime="406.601">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    And there --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="406.601" stopTime="407.946">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- people matter?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="407.946" stopTime="443.290">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    And there, the Secretary states that the critical consideration is whether the beneficiary should have known that he was receiving or had received an overpayment. 
    Now, in the case of a difference as small as the one that you suggest, it may well be that the average beneficiary should not have known that he was receiving an overpayment. 
    And, in any event, a difference of that size is not likely to be recovered by the Secretary because his own Claims Manual provisions require that there'd be at least a $10-a month reduction benefits, otherwise, recovery is simply waived.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="443.290" stopTime="447.742">

    The $10-limit merely binds the staff of the Social Security.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="453.864" stopTime="464.838">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Yes, that's included in the Claims Manual. 
    It's not included in the regulations, but the regulations do include the definition or the Secretary's view of the meaning of the words “without fault” in the statute.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Whose the -- what is the practice as to the burden? 
    In order to recoup, must the Secretary prove fault? 
    I mean, fault seems to be a-- if the person is without fault, there can be no recovery.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="481.652" stopTime="482.755">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    That's right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="482.755" stopTime="489.921">

    And that who -- what is the procedure for determining, if you or do you know?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="489.921" stopTime="522.816">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Yes. 
    The waiver procedure is that the beneficiary who believes that he is without fault and that recovery would defeat the purpose of the Social Security program files a prepared form with the Secretary, it's form no. SSA-632, and that is divided by into several parts, the first part of which, addresses the question of “without fault” and it asked -- I think, the question says to the beneficiary, “state why you believe that you were not overpaid or why you believe that you were not at fault in receiving the overpayment.”
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="522.816" stopTime="533.219">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And then, I suppose there is-- whichever way the Secret -- if the Secretary decides on recoupment, there's review, I take it.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Oh, definitely. 
    If the Secretary receives the form --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="535.758" stopTime="544.924">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if the reviewing Court decided that the evidence was absolutely equally balanced, who wins?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="544.924" stopTime="546.971">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, I -- I mean, I don't know because I don't know what the cases have held but I think --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="546.971" stopTime="550.652">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's why I asked you -- that's why i asked you a while ago what -- who's got the burden.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="550.652" stopTime="555.571">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    I think, in a closed case like that, the Secretary would waive recovery.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="555.571" stopTime="560.318">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, he then undertakes to prove fault.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="560.318" stopTime="568.635">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Before the administrative review, I suppose that the Secretary would have to show that the beneficiary should have known --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="568.635" stopTime="581.808">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In -- in deciding whether to insist on recoupment, the Secretary then assumes that at whatever procedures he uses must prove fault. 
    He undertakes to prove fault.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="581.808" stopTime="597.812">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    That's right. 
    He then takes to determine whether the beneficiary should have known that he was receiving an overpayment, and that's the standard that he uses in acting on the waiver application and if the sa -- and I assume that the same standard would apply in the later administrative review proceedings.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="597.812" stopTime="612.587">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So that, if the person from whom recoupment might be sought, if he's completely silent, the Secretary must still come forward with proof of fault. 
    Is that it?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="612.587" stopTime="624.696">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    No, that's not so. 
    I think that the Secretary's regulations are perfectly reasonable implementation of the statutory scheme. 
    If the person does not request waiver --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="624.696" stopTime="625.103">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Right.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="625.103" stopTime="634.861">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    If the person does not suggest that he was not at fault, I think the Secretary is justified in proceeding with recovery.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="634.861" stopTime="649.697">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If the check normally was $152 and the recipient gets a check for $1,152 because the computer has stripped its gears or something, that would be a clear case, wouldn't it, that he was at fault in accepting it?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="649.697" stopTime="709.410">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    That's precisely the case and, as a matter of fact, there are a substantial number of cases that are exactly like that. 
    I think, for example, the case of Mrs. Biner, one of the respondents in the Buffington suit, is similar to that. 
    It does not involve a computer error, but involves a report to the local Social Security Office that employment -- that earnings will be discontinued and Social Security benefits would have begun. 
    Earnings continued at the same level, but -- and the Social Security benefit payments were accepted by Mrs. Biner. 
    She had told the Social Security Office that she would be earning -- she would not be earning any money and, therefore, the benefits should begin. 
    When she did earn the same amount of money that she'd been earning for the previous two years, she should have known that the benefits could not be paid at that level. 
    And, that's in fact what has been found not only by the Secretary on his initial review of the waiver application, but also by the administrative law judge at the evidentiary hearing that was provided for.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="709.410" stopTime="721.954">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, there are at least two different kinds of errors that can be made, are there not, at least two? 
    That is, one where there's a change in status and entitlement and, the other, where it's simply a mechanical error, is that not?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="721.954" stopTime="725.839">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    That's right. 
    There are many possibilities.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="725.839" stopTime="738.047">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Buscemi, do I correctly understand that the mere fact that the beneficiary proves that he or she was without fault is not enough to establish the right to retain the money?
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="738.047" stopTime="738.971">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's absolutely right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="738.971" stopTime="740.835">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I just want to be sure.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="740.835" stopTime="759.466">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The beneficiary must also -- the Secretary must also determine that recovery would defeat the purpose of the Social Security Insurance Program or would be against equity in good conscience. 
    And, he has defined those phrases to include such factors as financial hardship or detrimental reliance.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="759.466" stopTime="782.329">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    So that even if there is no financial hardship if the regulations provide, 20 CFR 404.509, that if the beneficiary has relied to his detriment on an overpayment which he was without fault in receiving, then there's no recovery even if it could be recovered without any -- imposing any financial hardship.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="782.329" stopTime="803.845">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Does this record show or do we have to rely, if we need it on Social Security, on HEW reports as to how much a year in each fiscal year is overpaid for one reason or another and how much is -- that is, how much is the area of recoupment?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="803.845" stopTime="836.830">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, the record does show the number of overpayments made in a year. 
    It's a rather extraordinary number, approximately one-and-a quarter million overpayments a year. 
    I don't believe that the record shows the average amount of those overpayments, although we have obtained the Social Security Administration's latest figures on that and they suggest that the average amount of an overpayment is in the vicinity of $500, so that we are talking about something like $600 million a year. 
    It's the total amount that's overpaid.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="836.830" stopTime="843.678">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    When you use the 1.25 million, does that mean that many persons or that many checks?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="843.678" stopTime="926.473">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    That's a little bit unclear, but I think that means that many persons. 
    Now, respondents contend that Section 204 (b) of the Social Security Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment require that they'd be afforded an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing before their benefits are reduced to recover an overpayment. 
    They devoted little attention to the statutory argument in the Courts below and neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Courts addressed it. 
    Rather, the Courts held that, under this Court's decision in Goldberg against Kelly, the Due Process Clause requires a pre-recoupment hearing. 
    The Court of Appeals relied heavily on an earlier decision by the Third Circuit, Mattern against Weinberg, that it reached the same result. 
    The Secretary has petitioned for review the Third Circuit's ruling, no. 78-699 from that appendix. 
    Five months after the Court of Appeals decision, this Court decided Eldridge. 
    Eldridge held that due process does not require a hearing before the Secretary may terminate Social Security disability benefits on the basis of a finding that disability has seized. 
    When the Court remanded the present case for reconsideration in light of Eldridge, the Court of Appeals distinguished Eldridge and adhered to its earlier conclusion. 
    The Court ruled --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="926.473" stopTime="931.748">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Eldridge involved primarily a medical expert opinion evidence, didn't it?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="931.748" stopTime="946.669">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    That's right. 
    In the Court's opinion in Eldridge, the Court emphasized that the question of whether or not a disability continued could be resolved on the basis of written submissions because the bulk of the evidence would be medical, but the Court did note --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="946.669" stopTime="947.980">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Expert medical opinion.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="947.980" stopTime="970.245">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    That's right, but the Court did note in Eldridge that credibility of the claimant might well be relevant in the ultimate disability assessment. 
    For example, where the question of disability turns on the extent of pain or discomfort in performing certain operations, the claimant's disability might well be involved, and the Court did recognize that in the Eldridge opinion.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Buscemi, I realize it's difficult when you're peppered with questions from nine people to know exactly what your oral argument will cover. 
    Do you plan to cover in your oral argument the preclusive effect of 205 (g) and the availability of mandamus or do you intend to leave that to the briefs?1
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="988.000" stopTime="992.822">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi

speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="996.317" stopTime="1027.584">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, just to be very brief about it, the argument that the Secretary has made in his brief is that this Court in the Salfi case held that 205 (h) -- Section 205 (h) of the Social Security Act precludes other basis of District Court jurisdiction and limits District Court jurisdiction to that provided in Section 205 (g) of the Act. 
    On the basis of the statute and this Court's interpretation in Salfi, we've argued that there is no possibility for mandamus jurisdiction under Section 1361. 
    That's the argument.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I would not prevent us from reaching, in the government's view, the constitutional questions raised by a couple of the named parties, but it would prevent na -- kind of a nationwide class action designated in the Western District of Washington.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="1042.944" stopTime="1072.245">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    That is our view of the matter. 
    There is -- there is jurisdiction over the claims of the individual named respondents because of this Court's interpretation of Section 205 (g) in the Eldridge case. 
    There has not been a final decision of the Secretary at the end of the full administrative review procedure, but this Court held in Eldridge that such a final decision was not necessary where there is a constitutional right asserted and the claim was collateral to the entitlement to benefits.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1072.245" stopTime="1099.732">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Your brief does not ar -- deal or at least it does -- it dealt very briefly with Section 204, the statutory issue inherent in this case, and neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals treated it. 
    Why -- do you care to suggest hypothesis as to why neither of those Courts undertook to treat the statutory question?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="1099.732" stopTime="1106.717">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Yes, I think the answer is quite clear. 
    I think the answer is that respondents made very little of the statutory issue in the Court of Appeals.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1106.717" stopTime="1112.381">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And that doesn't give the Court a license -- any Court a license to ignore the statutory issue though, does it?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="1112.381" stopTime="1284.093">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but I do think that the Court's view of the case is inevitably colored by the briefs that are filed by the parties, and I think that where the claim of the respondents was almost exclusively addressed to the constitutional point, it's not surprising that the Court viewed the case in that light. 
    In any event, as we suggest in our reply brief, there is nothing to the statutory argument in the Secretary's view. 
    The respondent contends that unless the Secretary undertakes a very exacting inquiry in his words concerning fault in the equitable considerations involved, in each case, he violates the statute. 
    The idea is that the Secretary cannot recover any overpayment unless he determines that the criteria of Section 204 (b) are not met. 
    But, the point of the Secretary's procedures is that he determines that the criteria of 204 (b) are not met by asking the individual beneficiary whether he wishes to request reconsideration or waiver. 
    If the beneficiary does not wish to request either of those forms of administrative relief but, instead, is willing to allow the overpayment to be recovered, then the Secretary goes ahead. 
    And, this is an-- it seems to me, a reasonable procedure to affect the purposes of the statute. 
    Now, Eldridge applied three considerations that guide the Court in determining what process is due in a particular situation. 
    The Court of Appeals discussed this but, we think, reached the wrong result. 
    The first of the considerations is the private interest that would be affected by the deprivation. 
    The respondents' attempt to analogize the interest in keeping overpayments to the interest in the continued payment of welfare benefits that was at issue in Goldberg against Kelly, but there are important distinctions between the two. 
    Goldberg is the only case in which this Court has held that the Due Process Clause requires an evidentiary hearing before an interruption in government payments. 
    The situation that prompted this application of the Due Process Clause was very different from that involved here. 
    The disputed benefits there were granted on the basis of need and, by definition, they were the only means by which the recipients could pay for food and clothing, shelter and medical care. 
    Here, the Social Security insurance benefits are not based on need. 
    They-- the average Social Security beneficiary well have independent assets. 
    He may well be able to earn money by working and he may well be eligible for welfare payments if a reduction in Social Security payments renders him unable to meet his current expenses.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, not necessarily, Mr. Justice Stevens.

speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="1316.476" stopTime="1461.298">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, that's a -- the regulations apparently say that he would. 
    The regulations say that if there has been detrimental reliance. 
    Now, the Secretary might try to avoid allowing him to keep it by saying that it has not been detrimental, but I think that he probably would, under the regulations properly construed. 
    In addition, the deprivation here is not as serious as the one in Goldberg because it only involves a reduction in the amount of benefits, not a complete termination. 
    The only time in which benefits will be completely terminated under the Secretary's overpayment recovery program is when the beneficiary was at fault. 
    I mean, when the overpayment was received as the result of fraud or when the beneficiary has sufficient income that his entire Social Security check can be withheld and he will still be able to meet current expenses. 
    In no other situation under the Secretary's program will all the benefits be withheld. 
    Finally, the third factor that the Eldridge Court addressed was the government's interest in the efficient functioning of its program and the administrative burden that additional procedures would entail. 
    It's difficult to make precise predictions about the amount of cost that would be involved in the kind of evidentiary hearing requested by respondents, but the Court in Eldridge said that the additional cost were likely to be substantial and any time the additional procedures were required, and I think that that is equally valid here. 
    We've cited in our brief several of the ways in which the requirements of the Court of Appeals decision could -- will affect the Social Security Program. 
    And, I don't think it's necessary to go into further detail here. 
    If the final thing that I'd like to say is that the Secretary's procedures have been shown to be reliable on the basis of the experience not only before the Court of Appeals decision, but after. 
    The-- out of the one-and-a quarter million overpayments each year, there are only approximately 40,000 people who asked for reconsideration or waiver. 
    And, of those, approximately half are granted waiver on the basis of the written submissions.

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, I think the figures are relevant because they do indicate that the evidentiary hearing sought by respondents is not required in order to make sure that payments are made to those people who deserve them and that overpayments are only recovered from those people who can-- who are supposed to pay them back.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1493.507" stopTime="1502.035">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Buscemi, on those figures, are you giving us figures under the revised regulations or are those that were in effect before the litigation began?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="1502.035" stopTime="1559.868">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, the 40,000-figure is a figure that comes from years more recent than those covered by those figures before the District Court. 
    The -- if you look in the petition-- the appendix of the petition at pages 99 (a) and 100 (a), you'll see the figures that were presented to the District Court and they are very incomplete. 
    They have an accurate figure on the number of overpayments, but they have a very -- they have a much too small figure on the number of request for reconsideration or waiver. 
    They list only about 12,000 requests. 
    It's not clear whether that 12,000-figure includes only requests for reconsideration or also request for waiver. 
    The Secretary now reports that the number of times he gets a request for reconsideration that's not accompanied by request for waiver is very small. 
    Most beneficiaries are-- do not contest the fact that they have received an overpayment or, if they do, they also ask for waiver. 
    And, that number is about 40,000 now.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1559.868" stopTime="1577.818">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    A related question, I suppose, what do you perceive the issue to be, the constitutionality of the regulations before they were amended or the constitutionality of the regulations after the amendment which would mean, I guess, that we don't have the benefit of the views of the lower Courts on the latter question? 
    Which -- which are we suppose to decide?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="1577.818" stopTime="1615.305">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, I think that the question is the constitutionality of the regulations before they were amended, but the only thing that's been amended is the Claims Manual which deals with the partial adjustment system. 
    And, that's what we described in our brief. 
    That has allowed the Secretary to defer recovery and extend it over a longer period of time, and it also means that the Secretary no longer proposes a complete termination of benefits. 
    He only proposes a 25% reduction of monthly benefits. 
    Now, that particular provision of the Claims Manual was not before the Courts below. 
    But, with respect to the remainder of these provis --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1615.305" stopTime="1622.067">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's quite a difference in terms of the impact on the beneficiaries. 
    It's quite a difference whether they lose their entire benefits or just a reduction, isn't it?
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="1622.067" stopTime="1646.628">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    That's true, but in practical effect, under the partial adjustment system that was in effect before the Courts below, the Secretary as a general rule did grant partial adjustments that were requested. 
    The difference was more in the form of the initial notice to the beneficiary. 
    It said “we will stop your monthly benefits unless you request waiver or reconsideration or unless you request some other adjustment.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1646.628" stopTime="1658.096">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, if the issue is the regulations that are no longer in effect, why should we really decide that, if the government no longer has an interest in defending those regulations if it's got an amended regulation in effect now?

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    The issue is whether the respondents are entitled to an oral hearing before recoupment begins.

    And, according to at least one amicus brief here, the -- it's the understanding of that amicus that the respondents aren't even -- aren't defending the Court of Appeals decision on the overpayment issue.
speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="1691.053" stopTime="1710.738">
    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, that's also a little bit unclear. 
    I think respondents are defending the decision on the overpayment issue if a particular request for reconsideration raises an issue of credibility. 
    They are not -- they are not saying that, in the average case, a request for reconsideration requires a prior hearing. 
    I may be wrong about that, but that's the way I read --

    Mr. Peter Buscemi 
    Well, what's been happening is that there have been personal conferences set up before the recoupment begins, and then the full LAJ hearing has been kept at the time after the beginning of a hearing.

    Before you today are elderly, infirmed and minor recipients of Social Security benefits who've been operating under a system which the Secretary has had an operation for two-and-a half years which has successfully and satisfactory provided them with a very flexible administrative procedure which did not yet exist prior to this Court of Appeals judgment, which allows them to -- and meets their capabilities as elderly, infirmed, and minor recipients to assert and -- their right to waiver under the statute.

    The system for two-and-a half years, in answer to Mr. Justice Stevens' question, has been one which allows three choices: (a) one of written submissions, which exis -- which was the only choice under the earlier system, and for the very small number of recipients who are before you today for whom that is a meaningful and effective means of asserting the waiver question, that's still retained. 
    The other two choices are informal and personal conferences, and these allow the recipient the vital and crucial element of a personal confrontation, of an opportunity to be heard, not a full evidentiary hearing. 
    The restrictions are -- the requirements are far less rigid than in Goldberg, and the Court of Appeals recognize this and allowed for this imbalance for this. 
    So, the system has been in operation for two-and-half years satisfactorily. 
    The Court of Appeals decision properly acquired this kind of system and we believe it is consistent with both the statutory 204 (b) rights and with the constitution.

    Contrary to counsel's statement, the burden the Secretary has placed is totally on the recipient to come forward and show that he is not at fault and that either the recovery would be against equity in good conscience or contrary to the purposes of Title 2. 
    So, in answer to Mr. Justice Stevens' question regard -- and for the other questions regarding the million-dollar situation, if you are not in need, if you are not poor, you're not entitled to waiver.

    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    That is what Congress has said, Your Honor, under 204 (b).

    She cashed the check, not knowing what the check was for, and she put in her request for waiver that she had no idea that if she was wrong to keep the money or accept the money. 
    Obviously for her, the only way to effectively present her case as to whether or not she was wrong to accept or retain that money is for her to meet person-to-person with the decision maker and for him or her to assess Mrs. Yamasaki's credibility and motivation.

    If we accept the figure and for the moment, for hypothetical purposes at least, let's accept it that there's $600 million a year being paid out that should not be paid out. 
    Do you mean to suggest that Congress had any notion that there should not be recoupment for the vast part of that, the overwhelming mat -- portion of it?

    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    Congress said, Your Honor, in 1939 when it enacted this statute and 1967 when it affirmed it again, that persons who are without fault and against whom recovery calls a hardship will be able to keep the money. 
    Now, that $600 -- $600million figure is consistent with the other statistics which the Secretary has just revealed -- unveiled lately and which were never proved at the District Court level or the Circuit Court level in terms of an evidentiary hearing. 
    If that is a correct figure, I think it's basically irrelevant at a disposition in this case today. 
    You must look to the congressional intent and the congressional purpose and language at 204 (b).

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2594.356" stopTime="2612.925">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    This would depend to a certain amount on the -- to a certain established amount of the overpayment. 
    If your ordinary check is $200 and you get a check one month for $2,200, I suppose that finding a fault could be inferred. 
    Where it -- if it's a $10 or $20 difference, it couldn't be.
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="2612.925" stopTime="2641.888">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    Well, some of those factual situations do arise, Your Honor. 
    The Secretary does make certain move -- take certain steps to move recipients from various programs: from the disability program to the retirement program, from the survivor's program to the retirement program. 
    And, when he does that, he sends out checks in recipient's -- correctly sends out checks. 
    So those, you often could not presume the mere sending of a check which is large is automatically an error.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2641.888" stopTime="2655.014">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But if you're used to getting a check for, say, $200 a month and you -- suppose you get a check for $2,200 a m -- the following month, would that support a finding of fault under the regulation?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2655.014" stopTime="2694.316">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I think that would be one element to be considered at a personal confrontation. 
    Of course, you'd have to assess the credibility of that witness when the witness said, as in any credibility situation, that he or she did not know that what he or she was doing was incorrect. 
    What the Secretary's regulations require, Your Honor, in response to your question, they require a very detailed assessment not only of that fact that you just articulated, but also the recipient's age, intelligence, physical and mental condition, and a range of other factors to determine whether the recipient knew, should have known, or could have known that the retention or acceptance of the overpayment was wrong.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    But it doesn't say without knowledge. 
    It says without fault.

speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="2711.438" stopTime="2724.503">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    That has generally been our position, Your Honor, and we believe that the certain statute has made that determination because of using the language “fault,” but all I'm saying is that one factor to be considered, we think it should be given very little, if no weight.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2724.503" stopTime="2733.834">

    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    What is important to note, in response to your question, is that Congress knew that there were going to be many people overpaid and knew that there'd be many people -- that, I mean, most of the errors we do the Secretary's own errors and not the recipient's generated errors.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2749.139" stopTime="2754.600">

    Enough, enough. 
    The overpayment is a result of misrepresentations on the part of the beneficiary, that's clearly his fault.

    No matter whose -- let's assume, obviously, that this is the error of the Secretary. 
    Are you telling us that that's what the statute means, that the recipient could keep the $2,200 even though, for three or four years before, the check had been $200 a month?

    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    I was just going to get to that. 
    Not only must he satisfy that, but it also must -- if he has the money to be recovered, then the fault criteria will fall to the wayside. 
    You must be either be at-- must be both be at fault -- not at fault and you must be poor. 
    Under those two situations, you will get waiver. 
    If you don't meet either those criteria, you do not get waiver.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2850.812" stopTime="2888.560">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But, then let me try to apply that. 
    Suppose the showing before the response was that, on receipt of the $2,200 instead of $200, he went out and lost the $2,000 gambling. 
    So that, when they come for the recoupment, he hasn't got it. 
    Then, are you telling us that, under this statute, it would be inequitable and defeat the purposes of the Act to make him pay back the $2,200 over a period of time?

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Just -- just the facts I've suggested in the hypothetical.

    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    I think gambling is actually irrelevant, Your Honor. 
    The question becomes one, again, if he was at fault or not at fault. 
    And, if he has the money, he may have other resources to recover from, the Secretary's regulation require an in-depth financial evaluation of all pertinent circumstances and assets or resources of that particular recipient. 
    If that were the case, in fact, whether he gambled it away or lost it or it was stolen or he was robbed is absolutely irrelevant. 
    The question is whether he has these assets to satisfy the recoupment.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2931.194" stopTime="2946.189">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But if he squandered them away and has no other assets, you say then, under this statute, it would be inequitable. 
    The equity aspect of the statute, the second leg, would come into play and he should not have to return that money.

    And, in the oral hearing, I had thought there was just the hearing before the LAJ, but it's been made clear today that there are two different oral hearings that we're talking about: an informal hearing and then there's a later hearing before the LAJ.

    I think it could, Your Honor, normally. 
    It's not a matter of ruling the statute unconstitutional. 
    It's if the Secretary's procedure is pursuant to the statute. 
    The problem is, Your Honor, that the reason the class action and the injunction and relief are needed is been the Secretary's conduct in a series of other litigations that he has not in fact followed rulings of the Courts of Appeals. 
    For example, in the decision of Califano versus White where there had been a spate of lawsuits filed in the same issue that the Court of Appeals in Califano versus White made in its determination.

    But this is by no means peculiar to the Secretary of HEW. 
    The Commissioner of Internal Revenue struggles year after year to develop a conflict in the circuits, even though circuit after circuit will go against him. 
    And, the same is true of the other administrative agencies. 
    I don't think any agency is held bound and take the opinion of one Court of Appeals out of 11 as the final arbiter of the constitution.
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3213.671" stopTime="3219.508">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    Your Honor, first of all, there are two Courts of Appeals who ruled consistently here, the Third Circuit in Mattern versus Califano, and the Ninth Circuit.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3219.508" stopTime="3220.835">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's out of 11.
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3220.835" stopTime="3281.633">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    And there's only two Courts in which the issue has been presented. 
    Secondly, the Secretary has only raised this issue about conflicts in the Circuits as a means of claiming that he would never be able to get review by this Court. 
    We are very confident that this Court can control its docket, and it's calendar, and it's -- the matters which come before it. 
    And, we'll see that if a matter is that impressing and important in the Courts rules and to Rule 19, that this Court will indeed review that issue and take appropriate action. 
    I think setting a decision or authorizing or -- that there'd be no nationwide class actions in a situation like the case before you, we're saying that the Secretary is correct in saying that the class actions under 1361 or under 205 (g) are inappropriate is an absolutely unworkable and unjust result to occur for this group of recipients. 
    It essentially makes Social Security recipients, Your Honor, second-class citizens. 
    Essentially says that they cannot get full relief in Federal Court on constitutional challenges to illegal procedures of the Secretary.

    You mean, we will take appropriate action to that Your Honor, yes. 
    There are several more --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You have not prosecuted?
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3311.256" stopTime="3382.987">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    No, sir. 
    There are several more points which I'd like to make in my remaining time. 
    As I was indicating earlier, the Secretary has made certain changes in his regula -- in his procedures, his Claims Manual procedures which are not non-binding and are not part of the administrative regulations, and those procedures he claims are material to the disposition of the constitutional issue in balancing of the private interest in this case. 
    We believe that those changes are absolutely regressive and do not enhance a situation whatsoever because, actually, affirmatively discouraged persons and recipients concerning their right to waiver. 
    I can explain that in a moment, but what is important to us, Your Honor, is that if this Court in any way believes these changes are material to the disposition of this case. 
    We believe the case ought to be remanded back to the Courts -- the District Courts which issued the injunctions in this case for them to prove the effect of any of those injunctions of those procedural changes. 
    We now think of this the way we should be discussing de novo these changed procedures in December of 1978, after six-and-a half years litigation, based on a particular system of recoupment.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3382.987" stopTime="3387.785">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, do you think, Mr. Levin, that the changes are -- change the issues in this case?
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3387.785" stopTime="3394.595">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    They certainly not provide the pre-recoupment opportunity to be heard, not the evidentiary hearing but the opportunity to be heard as required by the Court of Appeals.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3394.595" stopTime="3395.639">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that is the issue.
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3395.639" stopTime="3396.375">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    That is the issue.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3396.375" stopTime="3397.785">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that remains the same issue even though --
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3397.785" stopTime="3398.072">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3398.072" stopTime="3398.877">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    even if it changes, doesn't it?
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3398.877" stopTime="3454.159">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    That's correct. 
    That issue is still there, but what these procedural changes do, Your Honor, unfortunately is a discouraged waiver assertions by clients because they actually ensure that clients who seek waiver will not get the maximum 25% partial adjustment protection. 
    A recovery against them is open-ended. 
    So, obviously, if I know that I can get a 25% maximum recovery, I'll do that and I'll forgo my statutory and perhaps constitutional right to have the case decided. 
    And, that is a direct and affirmative discouragement to its statutory right to waiver. 
    And it is because of that we're -- this certainly is a justiciable controversy, but we think the effect of that shall be litigated if the Court thinks that's material in the lower Courts where it probably belongs. 
    To that end, we made a motion to dismiss or remand in this case in January, but it was denied. 
    We renew that request now, if the Court deems these procedures material.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3454.159" stopTime="3469.247">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What's -- if you say that everybody but the named plaintiffs have been getting recoupment hearings in accordance with the decision of the Court of Appeals for two-and-a half years, what's left of the class?
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3469.247" stopTime="3475.171">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    Well, people who come forward on an ongoing basis, Your Honor. 
    If this Court were not to rule on our f --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3475.171" stopTime="3477.112">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    This is a constantly revolving class.
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3477.112" stopTime="3546.129">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    That's -- yes, sir, it is because the Secretary issues these recoupment notices daily. 
    He issues 1.25 million of them a year, most of which are his errors. 
    In that vein, therefore, there are people who are regularly trying to assert their right to waiver. 
    I would like to make a point here though, Mr. Justice White. 
    The point is that the notice aspect of this case which counsel indicated was not before this Court is an important thing to keep in mind because both the lower Courts and the Ninth Circuit found that people were not properly informed of the right to waiver. 
    Because of that, many of them did not exercise certain statutory and constitutional rights they would've certainly otherwise done. 
    The Secretary has not appealed that and that's res adjudicada. 
    And, that is an essential difference between this case and certain other cases where you would require exhaustion of administrative remedies and be concerned about the class definition because, in this case, there are fundamentally constitutionally defect of notice where persons could not have exhausted, could not have asserted their rights because they didn't know what their rights were and I think the maneuver by the Secretary not to appeal that decision, I do not want that to relieve this Court of --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3546.129" stopTime="3563.680">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    If we agreed with you and said, on behalf of the named plaintiffs, the named plaintiffs were entitled to a declaratory judgment that whatever that's attacked here was unconstitutional. 
    Do you need anything else than that?
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3563.680" stopTime="3582.906">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    Your Honor, again, I go back to my answer to a question of Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    The problem with that, to the extent that you authorize or approve of or acquiesce in the Secretary's position that Social Security recipients are not entitled to class actions in a Federal Court for procedural constitutional attacks or statutory attacks like Califano versus--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3582.906" stopTime="3596.226">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Like the -- sort of a general, it may or may not be involved in this case. 
    If the very provision you're attacking here is declared to be unconstitutional, what more do you need?
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3596.226" stopTime="3604.436">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    I assume the Secretary would abide by the decision of this Court and, if he did that, we would not need anything further, Your Honor.

    So ten million or more who received checks every year, several millions perhaps, culminate some of the check act.

    It goes to the statutory --
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3645.133" stopTime="3655.766">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    Absolutely, Your Honor. 
    It was six years and we raised it in the lower Courts, in the complaints. 
    We raised it in the Appellate Court. 
    We've briefed it, and the Secretary has ignored it and treated as though it did not exist because he has --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3655.766" stopTime="3657.809">

    Also the Court of Appeals?
speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3657.809" stopTime="3666.709">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    The Court of Appeals recognized it, Your Honor, for the importance of balancing the private interest in this case, recognizing that it was a congressional mandate that there shall be no recoupments only in these certain limited situations.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3666.709" stopTime="3672.630">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, the Court of Appeals ignored the claim that the statute itself requires a prior hearing.

    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    Well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3673.487" stopTime="3676.569">

speaker="stanley_e_levin" startTime="3676.569" stopTime="3704.095">
    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    We -- we would be -- we would take the position that we believe an affirmance is absolutely appropriate in this case, but that if the Court believes it necessary, we could go back to the Court of Appeals and litigate the statutory issue because we believe it's an essential issue in this case. 
    As this Court has indicated in many occasions, it's the first duty of any reviewing Court to try to dispose of any constitutional issue without reaching the constitutional issue and first disposing on the statutory grounds, which can be done in this case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3704.095" stopTime="3707.994">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if we affirmed on the statute, would that change your relief?

    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    I don't think so, Your Honor.

    So, I suppose, you could say you're entitled to urge the statutory ground now, here.

    Mr. Stanley E. Levin 
    Well, that's what we're doing, Your Honor, and we briefed it thoroughly.
