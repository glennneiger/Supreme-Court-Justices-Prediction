Southeastern Community College v. Davis

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 711, Southeastern Community College against Davis. 
    Mr. Gressman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="10.388" stopTime="139.694">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This is a case of first impression as far as this Court is concerned. 
    It is a case involving the interpretation and application of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which establishes a broad duty on recipients of federal aid and assistance. 
    Not to discriminate against handicapped persons, against qualified handicapped persons solely because of their handicap. 
    I think it essential at the outset to note that this is not a case of discrimination against a handicapped person. 
    This is a case rather of a handicapped person who has been found not qualified to participate in the program or activity to which she sought admission. 
    The uncontested facts as found by the District Court after an evidentiary hearing, facts and findings which have not been challenged in the lower courts or essentially before this Court established that the respondent, Frances Davis, by concession had a severe hearing handicap which made it impossible for her to communicate with other people other than with the use of a hearing aid and the ability and necessity to read the lips of the person to whom she is talking. 
    And she must apparently be face to face with the talker.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="139.694" stopTime="148.154">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well are you telling us that the hearing aid did not compensate fully or substantially for the handicap?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="148.154" stopTime="174.730">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That is essentially the finding implicit in the District Court's opinion, yes. 
    It was a combination though of the hearing handicap -- of I mean the hearing aid plus the necessity to read lips, and even then that was found to be an inadequate compensation for the severity of a hearing handicap. 
    Now --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="174.730" stopTime="179.005">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Gressman, she was a licensed practical nurse, was she not for some years?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="179.005" stopTime="181.664">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That is true. 
    Apparently about 10 years previously.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="181.664" stopTime="190.963">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And is there anything in the record which indicates that she was unable to perform those duties or that she did so with hazard to the patients?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="190.963" stopTime="202.490">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    There is nothing in the record one way or the other on that. 
    We do not know for example even whether her hearing handicap was that severe at the time she acquired the LPN license.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="202.490" stopTime="220.127">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well that brings me to my next question. 
    Is there anything in the record that protects the public when a licensed registered nurse becomes handicapped as this respondent was after her licensure had been obtained?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="220.127" stopTime="255.825">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, yes. 
    Under the North Carolina statutes, the state licensing bureau is authorize to revoke any license it has previously granted because of incompetent or inadequate nursing practice under any license, whether it be an LPN license or an RN license. 
    That is very clearly set forth in the statutes. 
    That's a -- I would assume that's a fairly universal provision with respect to any licensing activity.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="255.825" stopTime="261.358">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Are they fulfilled in actual practice? Does the record show that?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="261.358" stopTime="263.605">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    You mean if they have lifted licenses --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="263.605" stopTime="267.090">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Say that licenses have been terminated or revoked.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="267.090" stopTime="404.570">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    There's nothing in this record, no. 
    This is solely a, you might say an ad hoc factual development solely related to this particular individual. 
    We have no evidence as to the general practices of the licensing authorities. 
    Now the court made the critical determinations, in terms of this respondent's lack of qualifications either to participate in the training program or in her ultimate profession as a registered nurse. 
    The court specifically found that her hearing handicap actually prevents her from safely performing in both her training program and her proposed registered nurse profession. 
    And the court found and concluded that there are numerous situations where her hearing disability would render her unable to function properly in a clinical situation, in a nurse-patient relationship. 
    And finally, the court emphasized that was a particular concern to this Court was the potential danger to the patients in the hospitals who would be unable to in many situations communicate effectively with this particular nurse-trainee or ultimately the professional nurse. 
    Many patients obviously are not incapable of addressing the nurse face to face so that their lips could be read, or there might be situations where various crises develop that could only be -- that could not be heard by the nurse who had her back turned to in a particular situation.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="404.570" stopTime="418.210">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Gressman, you spoke of the nurse's activities in terms of a hospital. 
    There are some nurses who function in private homes taking care of patients too, are there not?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="418.210" stopTime="425.356">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That is true. 
    But in the nurses training program, they only have this clinical programs in the hospital.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="425.356" stopTime="444.035">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is there any statute giving a cause of action against an individual who would refuse to employ a nurse, a registered nurse on the grounds that the registered nurse had a handicap of this kind?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="444.035" stopTime="444.607">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="444.607" stopTime="447.304">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would that be discriminatory under any federal statute?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="447.304" stopTime="465.354">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    It could be discriminatory under 504 even in that employment relationship, if you decline to employ a qualified handicapped person solely because of his handicap.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="465.354" stopTime="467.629">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well if you're receiving a federal financial assistance.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="467.629" stopTime="470.810">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Federal financial aid, that's right. 
    Now there are other --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="470.810" stopTime="483.645">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If an individual, I was addressing my question to an individual patient in a private home.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="483.645" stopTime="484.185">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    You mean the individual --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="484.185" stopTime="501.816">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Any restriction or is it just -- does it violate any statute civil rights or otherwise for a person who is ill, or the family of that person who refused to hire a registered nurse on the ground that she's hard of hearing?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="501.816" stopTime="516.135">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    I would assume not that that's no form of state action which any kind of a statute could reach as essential basis for imposing any kind of anti-discrimination policy.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="516.135" stopTime="522.503">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But there are statutes about employments that do not involve state action, are there not?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="522.503" stopTime="583.287">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, there are yes. 
    In employment situations where the employer has a contractual relationship with the federal government and -- or with the state. 
    And as a condition to the maintenance of that contractual relationship, they may be prohibited from refusing to employ a handicapped person who is qualified solely because of his handicap. 
    But you would have to have some relationship with a government agency or program either through contract or through expressed coverage. 
    But as far as a purely private individual who's ill at home, I would assume that there is nothing to prohibit that person from discriminating as to whom he wants to employ as a nurse.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="583.287" stopTime="591.896">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Gressman, does Section 504 apply to hospitals as well as schools if they receive federal --
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="591.896" stopTime="596.994">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    If it's a federally funded program of some sort, yes. 
    Now, --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="596.994" stopTime="618.404">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think the result of 504 and the valid regulations promulgated person to it would be to prevent a hospital from saying we will hire only registered nurses who have become registered under the North Carolina laws?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="618.404" stopTime="659.830">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well you have something of that problem, I understand, in the pending petition for certiorari in the (Inaudible) case where the -- a private hospital allegedly discriminated and refused to hire a handicapped nurse. 
    Now there are cases of that nature where the -- if the hospital is in some way related to a federally funded program for employment purposes, that hospital would be subject to 504.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="659.830" stopTime="670.421">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But there's nothing in 504 that would in any way require North Carolina to alter its standards for licensing registered or licensed nurses?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="670.421" stopTime="730.873">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Not in a bit, not in one -- in any way Your Honor. 
    I think that the 504 is a very broad in scope and it makes no pretense at revising or altering or conditioning state licensing laws that may be appropriate for certain professions that happened to involve handicapped persons. 
    But the -- there is no -- not a word on the face of the statute or its intent or purpose that would indicate that Congress meant to revise or alter the reasonable and necessary state licensing laws with respect to the practice of nursing by registered nurses who are qualified and capable of fully performing safe nursing practices.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="730.873" stopTime="751.063">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Gressman, could I ask you a question? 
    There are two separate things that she might not be qualified to do. 
    One is to be a registered nurse because it might be dangerous for her if she couldn't hear properly, and secondly she might not be able to do this study program adequately. 
    Now, I understood you to say that the District Court found that she could not do either?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="751.063" stopTime="751.738">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That's right.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="751.738" stopTime="777.789">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    And some of the findings are ambiguous but my interpretation of it was that they -- the District Court found that she could not progress satisfactorily with the training because when upon completion of the program, she could not safely perform her duties as a nurse. 
    Do you also read the finding as saying if you put to one side how she perform as a nurse, she still wouldn't be able to do the -- to complete the program because she was unable to hear?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="777.789" stopTime="779.301">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    To complete the training program?
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="779.301" stopTime="780.450">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="780.450" stopTime="983.580">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Yes, she could not effectively complete the training program because of her handicap. 
    The state licensing bureau head who wrote a letter, it's in the record, said that she could not exactly predict what would be the situation two or three years hence when this person, if she got through the training program, would then be eligible to take a licensing examination. 
    But she said that on the basis of her present knowledge, she assumed that it would be improper and perhaps run undue risk to permit her to participate in the training program. 
    And the likelihood was that if this condition remained the same after she were to have completed her training program, there would be a serious question whether they would let her take the licensing examination. 
    You see, the licensing authorities do not have any independent sifting out process. 
    They simply take the graduates of the nursing schools that have been certified to them as fully competent, fully qualified nurses -- nurse candidates who are completely able to fulfill all the requirements that a registered nurse must have. 
    And they simply take that and allow them on basis to that certification from an accredited nursing program to take the licensing exam, and if they -- which is simply a written examination, there is no physical test made by the licensing authorities, then that person if she passes the written examination is given a RN license. 
    Now, I think it's essential to see how the structure of Section 504 comes into play at this point. 
    It's a very simple proposition. 
    The opening words of 504 say that “No otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall solely by reason of his handicap be excluded from participation or otherwise discriminated against in any federally funded program or activity.” 
    Now, the essential predicate in other words for 504 coming into operation at all is that the person be otherwise qualified. 
    Those are the predicate words that bring 504 into operation. 
    Unless you have a qualified handicapped person, you can never have the kind of discrimination against that person that 504 is talking about.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="983.580" stopTime="987.931">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, except that 504 is talking about not a qualified but an otherwise qualified, isn't it?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="987.931" stopTime="1014.084">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That is true Your Honor and that is really the problem but in this case. 
    But I think however you view the words otherwise qualified, it is essential to understand that 504 is not talking about the unqualified handicapped person, otherwise or not. 
    The qualification --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1014.084" stopTime="1032.111">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, one could read is as saying the person and indeed it's a natural reading that a person who is qualified except for his handicap shall not be excluded because of his handicap. 
    And that but I gather none of the parties here suggest that it should be that way.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="1032.111" stopTime="1033.667">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Nobody not with that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1033.667" stopTime="1035.476">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The blind bus driver and the moronic graduate student --
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="1035.476" stopTime="1039.871">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That's right. 
    That's what we call the absurd reading --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1039.871" stopTime="1040.477">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="1040.477" stopTime="1048.819">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    -- the literal reading of that language produces the impossible situation, and that is that you have to disregard all kinds of handicaps.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1048.819" stopTime="1049.529">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="1049.529" stopTime="1060.083">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    And in terms -- and omit them to perform the most physically demanding jobs or activities known to man. 
    Now this cannot be.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1060.083" stopTime="1066.134">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well to disqualify a person, it must be a job related handicap must it not?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="1066.134" stopTime="1068.524">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Of course Your Honor. 
    Now, I think this --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1068.524" stopTime="1078.018">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    This blind person might be -- would be obviously disqualified from being a bus driver or a taxi driver but not necessarily from being an elevator operator perhaps.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="1078.018" stopTime="1224.157">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That's true and I always like to think of the example of a law school who freely admits blind people, deaf people, paraplegics primarily because there is no physical qualification for entering into an academic type program of that nature. 
    Now therefore, you have to approach this whole problem on an ad hoc basis. 
    You have to look at the qualifications for a particular activity. 
    You have to look at the particular nature of the handicap and see whether that is relevant to the qualifications, and you have to look at -- determine whether ultimately there's been discrimination against the person once he has been determined he is qualified. 
    We never get to that point in this case because we never got above -- beyond the predicate requirement that the person be otherwise qualified. 
    Now, the pro problem in this case is one of confusion, and I think as Mr. Justice Stewart said, these words otherwise qualified had a rather ambiguous note to them. 
    But I think the whole thing becomes crystal clear if you understand that there are two basic kinds of programs or activities that may be funded by the federal government. 
    The broad type of programs that are covered are the academic type programs running from preschool education to primary schools, secondary schools and post graduates -- and post secondary schools, the great mass of the undergraduate collegiate programs, 95% of which I assume would be largely academic in nature. 
    In those types of programs which are the great mass that are covered by 504, there ordinarily are not any physical qualifications.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1224.157" stopTime="1243.608">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But there surely a person who is blind in a program that require a substantial amount of reading which I assume most academic programs do, or writing -- and/or writing, or listening. 
    A person who is deaf would hardly be qualified in the absence of affirmative special assistance to that person, isn't it?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="1243.608" stopTime="1253.576">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That is exactly true and 504 regulations issued by HEW do require that certain kinds of auxiliary aids and assistance be given --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1253.576" stopTime="1256.417">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Under this statute as so worded as --

    You mean?

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    It's referred to in the opinion of the Fourth Circuit of the law here that on remand of this case, the court should give consideration to certain HEW regulations which required; one, auxiliary aids to be provided for the handicapped person, or two, to make modifications in the academic programs.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1287.538" stopTime="1290.536">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And those regulations have been promulgated under the authority of this statute?

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    They were promulgated in 1977.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1294.023" stopTime="1300.816">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Certainly the statute itself gives no indication of a duty to undertake affirmative action?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="1300.816" stopTime="1335.508">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    No, it does not Your Honor, and this is in direct contrast with the preceding two Sections, 501 and 503. 
    501 relates to federal employees, 503 relates to government contractors who employ individuals that may be handicapped, and both of those cases Congress specifically says that affirmative action and accommodation shall be made in the course of enforcing that non-discrimination policy.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Not at this point, Your Honor. 
    I think that we don't arrive at that point yet in this case. 
    That you would make affirmative accommodation if at all only if you have an otherwise qualified individual, in a program or activity where no physical qualifications are at issue and where the handicap does not affect his qualification.

    I would say one final word as to the interpretation of 504. 
    It simply does not apply in my judgment to any a cause of action which involves a person who is found not to be qualified. 
    And I think that the person who is not qualified in a -- for a participation in a clinical program raises a most serious policy considerations, because once you leave the academic area where physical qualifications are no longer an issue, indeed they do be -- go into the clinical areas where physical qualifications may be important to the public safety, health and welfare. 
    Then it seems to me you are outside the intended scope of the language and the purpose of 504. 
    Now, we have in this situation a reflection of this concern by the District Court for the safety of the patients. 
    And I think that a person who is unqualified to provide safe nursing care for the great mass of individuals who are ill and sick raises a serious question as to whether this 504 duty should be imposed indiscriminately upon that kind of program or activity. 
    Congress has from the very beginning established a policy that is very much in point here, and I refer to the statutes in my reply brief that under the Nurse Training Act of 1964 which provides for financial assistance to nursing schools, and which is the very assistance that was given to Southeastern Community College in this case. 
    That is why it is federally funded. 
    It was federally funded to provide safe nursing practice and training. 
    But Congress in that Act said that in no event shall there be any condition or imposition by the federal authorities of any changes in the curriculum. 
    In other words, any kind of affirmative accommodation that Your Honor spoke of a few minutes ago. 
    They were concerned that you maintain the quality and the safety of nurse training programs, and there was to be no interference with changing the curricular or the administration of this highly important and high risk type of clinical training programs in the nursing school. 
    And Congress has also told us in another statute in the education amendments of 1974 that if the handicapped people want to participate in these kinds of clinical programs, Congress authorizes grants and expenditures to community colleges and other institutions to establish specially designed programs for the seriously handicapped who can not be qualified in terms of the ordinary program.

    You're not leaving yourself much time for the implied cause of action.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    I would say as to the implied cause of action, Your Honor, that not only has it been fully briefed but I would emphasize what I think is the conclusive factor in that respect. 
    In 1978 the Rehabilitation Act was amended to provide for two specific kinds of private causes of action with respect to it the federal employees and those who are employed by the a recipient funds in a narrow employment context where the primary purpose of the grant is to foster and provide for creating employment relationships. 
    Now, it seems to me that the very specificity with which it authorized private causes of action in those two instances by necessary implication reads out any kind of private cause of action for other situations such as we have here. 
    Since we do have a federal employee or do we have an employment type situation, Congress has said as clearly as it can, I assume that there are to be no other types of private causes of action. 
    Otherwise, there is absolutely nothing in the language -- in the history of 504 that permits the standards of the -- that permits and implication of a private cause of action. 
    There are a few isolated statements by Senators and perhaps by a committee or two unrelated in time to the original enactment of this statute and --

    Now, I think this is a highly dangerous or questionable doctrine, because that would mean that you could create -- under 1983 assuming some kind of state action, you could create causes of action under the -- all the provisions of the United States Code, regardless of whether courts had held that there is no right of action under a specific --

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Frances Davis is a licensed practical nurse. 
    She seeks to enroll in the Southeastern Community College nursing program, and to advance in her education, and to reach her full potential. 
    She is a hearing-impaired woman but the college has refused to give her that opportunity solely on the basis of her hearing impairment, with that any consideration of possible program modifications to be made in this case. 
    The college position as stated in its reply brief is clear. 
    Nurse trainees must be drawn from the national pool of those who are able-bodied in the fullest physical sense. 
    Applying this criteria to Mrs. Davis, we have the situation as indicated in the reply brief that the college has applied the rule saying that Mrs. Davis must possess hearing to the fullest degree without substantial impairment in order to qualify. 
    Quite frankly, Your Honor, this would apply to Mrs. Davis as an LPN, and under this status, under this way of looking at it, Mrs. Davis would not have the opportunity to be an LPN where she is safely and efficiently functioned now for 12 years. 
    It has been assumed by the college --

    It has been assumed by the college that people with hearing impairments which can not be fully corrected, people with impairments similar or worst than Mrs. Davis' cannot function as a nurse. 
    And it's precisely this assumption which Congress has recognized is incorrect in acting Section 504. 
    The assumption that a hearing impaired person can not be a nurse. 
    The federal government employs over 150 impaired nurses and over 300 nursing assistants.

    No, I think the District Court found that the feelings of the college that she couldn't be a registered nurse were one of the reasons that the college refused her. 
    But the report from the nursing director is very difficult to understand. 
    At one point, it certainly indicates that there may be some problems from Mrs. Davis. 
    No question about that from the report. 
    But at another point in the nursing statement, it indicates that Mrs. Davis might not be licensed as a licensed practical nurse. 
    And what has happened since this -- her application, she has been re-licensed by the state as a licensed practical nurse. 
    And at the end of course the nursing director for the state said that they could not predict the eligibility because the eligibility would be determined on how she does in the clinical program.

    The legislative history is that handicapped people can not be excluded on the basis of stereotypes and can not be excluded because of failures to make modifications. 
    And in particular, one Senate Report states “Special attention must be paid to the needs of those individuals who through no fault of their own have not received adequate education. 
    These individuals, young adults and adults alike must be afforded the equal opportunity and access to higher educational services.”

speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2795.928" stopTime="2802.121">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Of course at the time of the District Court decision, was there a regulation that raised this question with the District Court?
speaker="marc_p_charmatz" startTime="2802.121" stopTime="2813.265">
    Mr. Marc P. Charmatz 
    The HEW regulation was promulgated in June of 1977. 
    And the District Court hearing was in October of 1976.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2813.265" stopTime="2823.424">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    So the District Court at that time didn't ask the wrong question what you are in effect arguing that later regulations raised a question that they should've anticipated, the District Court judge should've anticipated.
speaker="marc_p_charmatz" startTime="2823.424" stopTime="2982.860">
    Mr. Marc P. Charmatz 
    That and also that from the legislative history it seems that you should also consider accommodation questions which were not asked by the District Court. 
    The Fourth Circuit's decision, a very narrow one, started on statutory grounds rather than constitutional grounds recognizes that a prejudgment on solely on disability is incorrect. 
    And first, the Fourth Circuit is saying “Look at the admission standards, the academic standards to see if they can be considered so that we do not screen out handicapped individuals.” 
    If the decision is in the affirmative, then we have to look to see if there are program modifications that can be made. 
    If the person does not meet the academic standards, well the person will not be admitted. 
    If the person -- if there is no program modification to be made, then the person may not be admitted. 
    But the point is that we have to at least consider those, and in this case that was not done. 
    I think this approach is it consisted with Section 504, its legislative history, and consistent with the HEW regulation? 
    The college position as found by the Fourth Circuit was no modification. 
    They didn't consider that issue and the Fourth Circuit suggested that they give close attention on remand to it. 
    At that point they would also -- should be consideration of the academic standards which were not considered at all in this case. 
    I think even the amicus, the American Association of Medical Colleges, recognizes that the sole focus on disability conducted by the college and conducted by the District Court was inappropriate, because the District Court did not consider the issue of accommodation, and because the District Court did not consider the academic standards in this case. 
    There's no indication and in fact I think the record reveals that an evaluation of whether Mrs. Davis was a licensed practical nurse did not enter into the evaluation in this case. 
    In addition, it would seem that Mrs. Davis as a person who is licensed for now 12 years, may be an ideal candidate to be able to participate in a registered nurse program.

    Didn't the District Court find that LPNs perform their services only under the supervision of someone with superior medical training in the immediate supervision?

    Mr. Marc P. Charmatz 
    I think that's correct that they do perform their training under the supervision of a registered nurse. 
    In fact, there's a North Carolina statute which defines the duties of a licensed practical nurse and defines the duties of a registered nurse. 
    And certainly, the duties of a licensed practical nurse include patient care. 
    There's a degree in responsibility and supervision which is really the key difference between a registered nurse and a licensed practical nurse.

    Just as the way we look at the blind bus driver, whether he could perform the essential functions of a job as blind bus driver is the initial question. 
    I wouldn't think he could. 
    And the second question is whether there'd be an accommodation, and again I don't think he could. 
    The conclusion that we draw in this case is that the college in this instance was blind to the ability of handicapped people to perform such as Mrs. Davis, and to contribute meaningfully to society.

    The amendments referred to indicate in any action or proceeding to enforce or charge a violation of a provision of Title 5, the court may allow attorney's fees to enforce or charge a violation. 
    In addition, the committee reports indicate that the committee believes that handicapped individuals under Title 5 are and will remain in need of vigilance by handicapped individuals to assure compliance and the availability of attorney's fee should assist in vindicating private rights of action. 
    The Senate Committee Report in 1974 indicated that there was private right of action. 
    The amendments did not take that private right of action the way in fact by having attorney's fees and by additional legislative language, by the Senate Committee comments, from Senator Cranston, the floor leader; all indicate that there is a private right of action.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Some members of Congress --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Some members, yes.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, if it speaks through its statutes not through its reports.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But you concede that if there is a private right of action, as you contend there is, it is an implied one it's not an explicit one.

    Mr. Marc P. Charmatz 
    That's correct.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I know that you cite --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Everybody agrees it's not explicitly in the statute.

    Mr. Marc P. Charmatz 
    That's correct.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You cite Borak versus J.I. case in your brief, do you think that case is still good law, after Amtrak and Cort and Barbour?
speaker="marc_p_charmatz" startTime="3740.194" stopTime="3754.023">
    Mr. Marc P. Charmatz 
    Well we think that for the purposes of this case, that for Section 504 that the private right of action can -- should be implied.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3754.023" stopTime="3756.224">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You don't feel you have to rely on Borak?

    Mr. Marc P. Charmatz 
    No. 
    Thank you.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
