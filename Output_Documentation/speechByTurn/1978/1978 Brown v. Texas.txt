    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Brown versus Texas is a direct appeal from the county court at law, number 2 for El Paso County, Texas. 
    From a misdemeanor conviction for the failure to identify himself by appellant and to the report of his name and address. 
    The facts are that on December 9, 1977 at approximately noon, two uniformed El Paso police patrolman in the squad car looked down an alley and noticed appellant and another individual who were apparently only a couple of feet apart walking in opposite directions. 
    The officer could not tell if the individuals had met or had spoken. 
    Both men were black. 
    No other activity was noticed. 
    There was no report of suspicious or criminal activity. 
    The officer stated that they decided to stop appellant to ask him his name and that that was the sole purpose for the stop. 
    The appellant was stopped and the officers did ask him for his name and also for the reason for his presence in the alley. 
    Appellant protested the stop stating that the officer had neither right nor reason to detain him. 
    He did not resist the arrest or stop. 
    Brown was padded down then and no weapons, drugs or any of the contraband were found on his person. 
    But he was placed under arrest for the failure to identify himself. 
    The other individual in the alley was never stopped or questioned. 
    Now on the way to jail, appellant gave the officers his name but he was still booked for the offense the officers stating within his viewpoint the offense was complete at that point. 
    He was later on found guilty in an on-jury trial and was fined 500 -- $45.00. 
    Now, the provision in question does not carry any term, jail term or imprisonment simply provides for a maximum penalty of a $200.00 fine. 
    The provision is Section 3802 of the Texas Penal Code which makes it a misdemeanor to refuse to give a report of one's name and address to a peace officer who has lawfully stopped one and requested that information. 
    This case is significant and different from DeFillippo that you've just heard in the following respects. 
    The Detroit ordinance at least attempts to put in some sort of a Terry Standard that there must be suspicious conduct or criminal conduct afoot which would allow a police officer to investigate further and ask for one's name. 
    The Texas statute does not have any such requirement.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Oh, it has the word awful.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="331.066" stopTime="332.279">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="332.279" stopTime="355.939">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well if you assume that the Texas Courts understood what a lawful stop was and convicted this person, you would have thought that that as a initial matter, they thought to stop was a lawful and that therefore there was at least a voluntary stop.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="355.939" stopTime="367.406">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    I think Your Honor that if you use the word lawful in a statute such as this, you can I suppose read in all kinds of standards. 
    However to the person reading the statute on its phase --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="367.406" stopTime="368.696">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Oh, that's a vagueness argument?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="368.696" stopTime="369.677">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    That's correct Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="369.677" stopTime="381.270">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's a vague -- you're making a vagueness argument but you were just making a statement that the Texas statute didn't have any standard in a -- different from the Michigan --
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="381.270" stopTime="396.310">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    What I'm saying is simply by reading unlawful, there's nothing to tell you whether it must be criminal activity for example. 
    It may be that the Texas legislature thought it was lawful for a person, police officer to stop a person on walking down the street and asking for his name for no other reason.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="396.310" stopTime="403.113">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well then you -- you do are suggesting that neither the Texas legislature nor the Texas Courts knew what lawful meant?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="403.113" stopTime="494.801">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    I'm suggesting they probably didn't consider it carefully enough Your Honor. 
    The statute is not drafted carefully enough to set forth what is lawful and what is not and that is one of our principal arguments here. 
    Now, also in the DeFillippo there was evidence of other criminal activity, drunkenness, perhaps some sort of indecency or sexual conduct, possession of drugs, possibly impersonation of a police sergeant. 
    In this case here, we're solely dealing with an offense involving only one type of criminal conduct and that was the offense of failing to identify himself. 
    Now, DeFillippo did not involve a prosecution for failure to identify. 
    This case it does involve that kind of prosecution. 
    Also, in DeFillippo, of course it was a question of good faith reliance by the police officer on the ordinance. 
    Before the trial court and before this Court, the appellant has challenged its unconstitu -- the constitutionality of the Texas statute for facial vagueness and for overbreadth because it punishes not innocent conduct Your Honor but protected conduct and there's a big difference. 
    Conduct protected by the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States constitution making the statute therefore invalid under the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    First question is comes up into the vagueness argument, can a police officer ask someone questions. 
    This is apart from the ability to stop someone. 
    Can he ask someone a question? 
    Point brought up by Mr. Justice White --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="494.801" stopTime="496.840">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the answer to that is clearly a yes. 
    He can ask, can he?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="496.840" stopTime="501.536">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    I agree with you Your Honor. 
    I agree with it. 
    He has the same rights, I can ask people questions. 
    I think --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="501.536" stopTime="503.062">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It takes -- the police officer can.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="503.062" stopTime="506.770">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    It is correct. 
    He has the same rights as any other citizen to ask questions.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="506.770" stopTime="508.509">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, at least those rights.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="508.509" stopTime="513.263">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Up to a point Your Honor where it becomes harassment or where you're --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="513.263" stopTime="515.581">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But to inquire what is your name?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="515.581" stopTime="528.525">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Simply that point, for example, if I'm arguing the case up here and the police officer came up to me right now and asked me what is my name, I don't know if that would be a reasonable type of inquiry Your Honor. 
    I think there are conceivably --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="528.525" stopTime="531.070">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But Mr. Brown wasn't arguing a case here, was he?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="531.070" stopTime="558.565">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    That's correct Your Honor. 
    I'm saying that conceivably there could be limitations on a person's right to ask questions. 
    But I think as a general proposition under most fact situations he does have a right to ask questions. 
    Now, what about the stop? 
    The way I read Davis versus Mississippi, the Fourth Amendment is applicable to any kind of stops, detentions, arrest, they're all the same as I understand the reading of Davis versus Mississippi.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="558.565" stopTime="561.220">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Oh, Terry against Ohio said the same thing, didn't it?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="561.220" stopTime="586.113">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    I believe it did Your Honor. 
    In that case I can explain Terry versus Ohio, Judge -- Your Honor. 
    The only way I can see it is that under Terry, you're simply trying to protect the life of a police officer who -- thinking there is criminal activity afoot, number one and two thinking that he might be in a dangerous position is simply able to pat someone down before he starts asking the questions. 
    Let's move --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="586.113" stopTime="617.813">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is this -- for hypothetical purposes, out of the criminal area and say that a police car called to an automobile collision and there are a number of people around. 
    Do you suggest that the state has no police power to require the persons who observed that automobile collision to give their names to the police officer?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="617.813" stopTime="619.961">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Well, Your Honor I'm not suggesting that. 
    That's the problem --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="619.961" stopTime="620.264">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    No?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="620.264" stopTime="639.785">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    -- with this case, it is not limited to civil or criminal incidents. 
    And what I suggested to the Court in my brief was that Texas used to have a predecessor statute which was not a penal statute, kind of a material witness type statute provided that the police officer could round up the witnesses to a civil or a criminal incident which --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="639.785" stopTime="654.992">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well then just to take one step at a time, the First Amendment is no barrier to a statute requiring a person to identify himself to a police officer at high noon with no criminal activity going on.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="654.992" stopTime="692.565">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Your Honor, the statutes that I'm talking about does not make you identify yourself. 
    You have a choice of doing two things. 
    First, you can identify yourself or if you stand mute and refuse to identify yourself, then the officer must take before a neutral magistrate at that time make a provision for a material witness bond or to identify yourself. 
    But no statute -- I'm not suggesting to this Court that any statute, civil or criminal can make you under the pain of criminal violation state what your name is or say anything. 
    Anything that comes from your mouth as far as I'm concerned Your Honor is a violation of both the First and Fifth Amendments if its orally compelled.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="692.565" stopTime="698.791">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But then if you refuse to do that before the magistrate in this hypothetical situation then what?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="698.791" stopTime="706.886">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Then he places you under material witness bond. 
    If you can't make a bond then you're in jail Your Honor. 
    Now, I am --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="706.886" stopTime="713.224">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    May I suggest to you that that pretty well washes out the First Amendment arguments you're making.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="713.224" stopTime="777.347">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Well, let me talk about the First Amendment then Your Honor. 
    Let's assume that you have a fact situation of NWACP v. Alabama that is the situation where you have the group persons who for their own protection are trying to unite and let's say get rid of racial segregation which was the case there. 
    And the state wasn't violently opposed to -- at that point that leads to the NWACP. 
    And you want to find out as a state officer who the members are of the NWACP. 
    Now, this Court held under NWACP v. Alabama that you could -- a Court could not compel NWACP to give up its membership lists. 
    I'm suggesting to this Court that there is a First Amendment violation potentially here if I could stop every single person who had attended an NWACP meeting on their way out of the meeting and ask them, "What is your name?" 
    A person refuses to give his name then I'm marching him on down to jail, have him fingerprinted and try to ascertain your identification through some other means. 
    I am suggesting Your Honor that there is a First Amendment violation.

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I think my client's activity is closer and still First Amendment protected right which this Court decided in Norwell versus Cincinnati wherein a police officer approached a gentleman walking under -- with a suspicious person activity -- report afoot and he stopped to Mr. Norwell and he asked him what he was doing there at that time of the night and Mr. Norwell simply said, "I don't tell you anything", in those words. 
    And this Court held out it was protected activity at a non-provocative protest of an arrest.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And he was arrested for that.

    Pardon me Your Honor?
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="860.303" stopTime="862.682">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Was he arrested for what he did say?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="862.682" stopTime="864.930">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    They didn't -- he was arrested for what he did not say.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="864.930" stopTime="865.889">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Yes, that's --
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="865.889" stopTime="866.271">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    That's correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="866.271" stopTime="866.939">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But the fact was --
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="866.939" stopTime="909.903">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    But he did say something and that was that he protested the right and reason of the officers to detain him under the circumstances in this case. 
    By implication, if you say to take the question earlier what lawfully means, by implication if I only have to give my name under the Texas statute when I'm lawfully stopped it would mean that if I am not lawfully stopped then I don't have to give my name. 
    Now when in -- is one person supposed to know that he is not lawfully stopped under the City Civil case, under Terry, under Davis versus Mississippi, a person -- let's assume you had a constitutional scholar walking down the street and he knew about those cases --

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    You're not -- you don't -- you're simply arrested, that's a fact.

    What if the -- what if there's a probable cause -- what if a policeman thinks there's probable cost to arrest and then he arrests him then he -- and he ask him his name? 
    Do you think the state could then make the refusal to give the name a crime?

    No.

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    No, Your Honor. 
    That's getting out of the vagueness and -- then you're getting into the area of overbreadth because at that point what you're doing is you're making criminal conduct which is protected by the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments not because of vagueness. 
    You're setting aside the vagueness argument at that point. 
    Now, the California statute, the Detroit ordinance in this case, the Henderson City ordinance all kind of incorporate a little bit better than this statute does, the Terry type criteria. 
    In this case, there is nothing, I don't think you can read anything near Terry into the words lawfully in this case.

    What I'm saying is that there may conceivably be cases where it would not be a lawful stop. 
    This may or may not be a lawful stop.

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    The reason I have attacked it on its face Your Honor, I can see -- I can -- eye to eye, my position before this Court, this is the same kind of case as See versus Seattle and Camara versus Municipal Court of San Francisco and that is in those cases they're attempting to make criminal a person's implication of his rights under the Fourth Amendment. 
    No motion is suppressed, no nothing, simply an attack on the invalidity of the statute on its face. 
    I don't believe you have to have a motion to suppress in order to raise facial invalidity on Fourth Amendment grounds.

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Well, my understanding of the term vagueness Mr. Justice Stevens is a person reading the statute would be able to tell whether his conduct was criminal or not. 
    I thought that was a test of vagueness not whether the Court somewhere knew what Terry versus Ohio held. 
    But maybe I misunderstood it. 
    That's what I thought vagueness meant.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    May I come back to the question you've just been discussing? 
    One of the elements on this statute is that the stop must be lawful. 
    Now that's what the statute says. 
    I realize you argued that lawful could mean a lot of things. 
    But it seems to me from the record that that element of the offense maybe absent in this case, the prosecuting attorney, Mr. Paton on page 15 of the appendix concedes that the stop must be lawful. 
    He said an officer cannot go up to anyone on the street and ask his name unless the stop is lawful. 
    And if you look at what the officer said back on page 28 and later at 31, I think the response to your questions at the bottom of page 28, you inquire, did you -- was any action by my client that he was armed or committed a crime at that time, the answer was no. 
    The only thing you wanted to do was to stop him and ask him for his name. 
    And the answer was correct. 
    So doesn't that why should the element of a lawful stop better this case altogether?
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="1274.260" stopTime="1290.048">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    In this case, if you were to -- if I were to -- had said my conducts -- the conduct of my client in this case was protected, it was not criminal, that would be correct Your Honor.

    Well, on its face Mr. Caballero I know -- in your index of authority, its in front of your brief, the only Texas case you cite is one saying that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction only where the fine level is over $100.00 and it very likely is not your fault that you can't get to a higher Texas Appellate Court.

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    No, Your Honor. 
    This question came up earlier and I can answer your question I believe in this manner. 
    If the statute provides a pretext for an arrest such as for example in DeFillippo, you find drugs or other violations, you never see this kind of prosecution arise. 
    It's a very rare instance I don't even know how we got this far but usually at that point prosecutors have --

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    The only thing I can say is that at that point, the prosecutors are simply not interested in prosecuting someone for the mere refusal to give his name. 
    And you don't see this kind of prosecution. 
    No Texas Appellate Court to my knowledge and I've checked has ever considered the issue. 
    In Sunny Shell versus Texas that I have cited in my reply brief they didn't cite the statute but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did give you its viewpoint concerning the lawfulness of stopping someone on the street and asking their name and I was --

    I -- I suggest that isn't quite accurate. 
    The police officer has said that at page 29, just above the middle, he referred to this being a high drug area and it is -- this is certainly related to the reason he made the stop.

    You're going to a legal argument which is your privilege.

   Argument of Renea Hicks
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1575.167" stopTime="1581.316">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Hicks.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1581.316" stopTime="1661.407">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    My name is Renea Hicks and I represent the State of Texas on this appeal. 
    The statute challenged here, Section 3802 of the Texas Penal Code and just generally it imposes a very limited duty on citizens of the State of Texas in a very narrowly circumscribed situations to a police in their investigatory functions and indirectly to either fellow citizens by helping to possibly preempt crime or help catch those who have just committed a crime. 
    I do not see that it is unconstitutional under any of the four grounds that were raised on this appeal. 
    The First Amendment issue I think clearly must be discarded as a valid grounds for invalidating the statute because to invalidate the statute because -- saying that someone has a First Amendment right to silence in all situations just would lead to totally unacceptable results throughout our society, we are -- much of our government functions on requirements that people respond to request from people in Securities and Exchange matters, in Food and Drug Administration matters in situations like that.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1661.407" stopTime="1682.193">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But what if the State of Texas passed a statute saying that every citizen when he left home during the day had to call the local police station, tell them he was leaving and where he was going or when he'd be back and made a vio -- made a pros -- a violation of that command or criminal offense punishable by a fine?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1682.193" stopTime="1710.188">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I don't see that that would be a First Amendment problem. 
    It seems to me -- well, it could be a First Amendment problem in the sense of impinging someone on associational rights by constantly keeping track of someone. 
    I don't think this statute does anything like that. 
    But if anything I would think that that would be a general due process from the statute going back to the situation in DeFillippo where the Michigan Court of Appeals said making criminal, that conduct is –
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1710.188" stopTime="1712.559">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What is the general due process?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1712.559" stopTime="1731.658">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Well, by that I meant the Fourteenth Amendment due process question. 
    This Court has held in numerous kinds of cases that the only things in the Due Process Clause are not rights incorporated from the first 10 amendments, first 8 amendments.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1731.658" stopTime="1751.169">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    To pursue Mr. Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical, under this kind of an ordinance the really only safe way that is -- this can avoid embarrassment at least is to carry some form of identification on him at all times, isn't that true?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1751.169" stopTime="1752.269">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I don't think that's so.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1752.269" stopTime="1752.622">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You don't think so?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1752.622" stopTime="1810.645">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    This statute is different than many of the other statutes that are similar to this in that there is nothing on the face of the statute that says someone has to carry identification to support what they speak to the officer. 
    In other words there's no requirement of showing a validated driver's license or a general ID card. 
    It just says a person must report his name and residence or address to a police officer. 
    And I don't think the word report in this instance means that they have to report it by showing proof of the identification. 
    In other words, if someone says my name is John Smith, to an officer's lawfully requested it, the officer has no right to say, "Well, prove that you're John Smith". 
    And he has no right to arrest the person unless he has independent ground to point that this a false identification.

    Mr. Renea Hicks

    I understand that.

    It may be that the Court in this situation did not read it that way but it is not in the appellate court in the State of Texas.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    That is my argument before this Court.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if the El Paso County Court says lawfully stopped under the statute means lawful for purposes of federal constitutional laws as well as Texas law and I conclude this was a valid Terry stop. 
    And this Court which is hearing the case now says, "No. 
    We do not think it was a voluntary stop." 
    We would -- we'd simply reverse on it as applied basis, wouldn't we?

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Well, I don't think that it's -- the issue of the lawful stop has constantly been pushed to the background by Mr. Brown or his counsel. 
    And it is not really before this Court whether there was a lawful stop. 
    I realized under Thompson versus City of Louisville, this Court has said that it can be a denial of due process if there's no evidence to support a conviction.

    Then if that is true, if there is, as we can read the records that there isn't any indication of violence and no motive to do anything but ask this fellow's name when he happened to be in a drug area and he happened to be black and I don't know which is more significant for other reason for the stop. 
    But do we just ignore that then or do we -- and what can be done if it is not actually a violation of the statute there's no appeal in Texas is there from this Court?

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    That's correct. 
    Well, I do think that it's very well that there may not have been a lawful stop in this case. 
    I -- I can only go back to the position --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2092.831" stopTime="2104.377">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But then isn't Mr. Brown's counsel -- don't we then have to assume as a matter of Texas law that the Texas Court which is the final court construing this statute has held it applies more broadly than Terry does.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2104.377" stopTime="2132.436">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Its -- there are two conclusions that -- two possible conclusions that could be drawn I think. 
    One could be that conclusion. 
    And I don't think that that's the problem. 
    The other one would be, I would think that the Court misunderstood or misapplied the Terry doctrine. 
    The Court, the trial court did not apply the Terry doctrine properly. 
    That might be the proper one and I believe that that is what's supported by the record. 
    The reason I say that under the Texas stat -- under this statute --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2132.436" stopTime="2135.824">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Are you -- are you conceding that, you say?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2135.824" stopTime="2149.959">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I'm saying that this Court very well might find that there was not a lawful stop in the Terry versus Ohio if it was independently reviewing the evidence and if the issue was clearly presented to them. 
    I do think that the Texas statute requires the Terry versus Ohio stop.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2149.959" stopTime="2159.543">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There's no indication in this case that it does.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Well, again I think that the other -- there is another conclusion that can be drawn and that is that it was misapplied, the Terry Doctrine was misapplied.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2166.248" stopTime="2176.980">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, but you have no basis for submitting that this law requires at least in -- a justification equivalent to the Terry against Ohio --
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2176.980" stopTime="2177.034">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I -- I think --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2177.034" stopTime="2179.724">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Isn't it -- no basis on this case for saying so?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2179.724" stopTime="2206.250">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    In this case, but in Texas statutes for instance in the Texas Code Construction Act which governs to the Texas Penal Code, there is provision in the Texas Code Construction Act which says that if terms of the statute have a technical or special meaning through some means such as a Court decision such as Terry versus Ohio -- doesn't specifically meets in Terry versus Ohio. 
    Then those words in a statute are to be given that construction.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2206.250" stopTime="2217.756">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, Terry versus Ohio in that case the Court upheld what the police officer did. 
    There was no statute ordinance covering what he did.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2217.756" stopTime="2219.758">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2219.758" stopTime="2230.017">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It didn't say that he couldn't have done more or less, it just simply upheld what he did. 
    Why -- why are you suggesting that that's a limit of what a police officer can ever do?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2230.017" stopTime="2231.381">
    Mr. Renea Hicks

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    No. 
    As I -- I believe I said that under this statute, the term lawful stop is limited by other statutes in Texas that construct -- controlled the construction that the state court to be able to give these statute to a situation that there being a Terry versus Ohio stop. 
    I -- since Terry --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2249.455" stopTime="2260.636">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that's telling us that Terry against Ohio represents the limit of what a lawful stop would be, isn't it?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2260.636" stopTime="2279.000">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I don't think that that's a necessary conclusion from what I just said about this construction that would be given to the statute. 
    There are stops that might not have meant to a Fourth Amendment detention that would be turned lawful I suppose. 
    I mean, policemen constantly are patrolling their areas checking with the merchants and so on.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Yes.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, in reaching that conclusion, it's certainly a hornbook that the whole record is viewed by that judge, necessarily by us but by that -- the judge reaching that conclusion. 
    Part of that record is that this somewhat inarticulate policeman and brand new policemen as well said that part of his motivation -- implied the part of his motivation was that it was in a high drug area. 
    Is it reasonable to conclude, do you think we could conclude that the judge made the decision that the lawfulness was demonstrated in relation to the high drug area that the policeman said was part of his reason?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2344.941" stopTime="2351.724">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I believe that that is one of the factors on which the judge based his conclusion implicit in the judgment of conviction --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2351.724" stopTime="2356.204">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that -- then is that decision reviewable here?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2356.204" stopTime="2432.954">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I don't believe it is Your Honor. 
    That is my point that there -- there are -- there is some evidence on the point of whether there is a lawful stop. 
    As I say, this court reviewing the record are in -- as an initial trial court might decide that there was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a lawful stop. 
    But there were two factors I think. 
    One was that it was a high drug area. 
    The other factor -- there were three factors. 
    The other factor was that these people were in an unpaved alley and the other factor was that there were two people in this unpaved valley in a high drug problem area near one another. 
    Now in the -- those three factors in isolation very well that probably are not a lawful stop in the Terry versus Ohio but there are some evidence on that point. 
    And that is the reason I suggest that under Thompson versus Louisville the conviction could not be reversed because there is no evidence on the point. 
    And I do not believe that because a judge in Texas may have applied Terry versus Ohio in a way differently than this Court might have that that means that that court were saying that lawful stop means something different in Texas than it means under the Fourth Amendment litigation after Terry versus Ohio.

    Suppose there were no reference by the policeman in this record to the fact that he was observing two men in an alley, in a high drug area and that there was nothing in the record except that he just wanted to find out the man's name. 
    Would you think that would be a lawful stop or a permissible stop under this statute, permissible First --

    No.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But the difficulty with your case is that we don't have an opinion from the Texas Court and so we don't know whether it's a question of interpretation of the state statute that maybe troublesome constitutionally or whether it's an evaluation of the evidence under a perfectly permissible interpretation of the state statute.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2538.790" stopTime="2597.588">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I -- I think that that is one of the main problems in this case. 
    There -- I do think that there is support in Texas law, statutory law for the argument that this is a Terry versus Ohio stop and again I cite the Texas Code Construction at which governs the Texas Penal Code in which says the technical terms or terms that have acquired a special meaning retain that special meaning in the Codes of Texas. 
    And there's also a provision that Texas Courts are to construe statutes so as to avoid findings unconstitutionality, kind of black literal problem. 
    I did want to address the following Norwell versus Connecticut which Mr. Caballero cited as supporting his First Amendment argument and I do believe the reading of that case will reflect that the gentleman that was convicted of disorderly conduct in that case had his conviction reversed by this Court because of something he had said. 
    It was his -- his convictions was not --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2597.588" stopTime="2598.006">

    Norwell against Cincinnati?

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    -- because of something that he had said.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2599.511" stopTime="2600.109">

    Cincinnati, not --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2602.309" stopTime="2691.178">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    It was because -- it was a First Amendment question because it -- the record reflected in that case that he was convicted for what he had said not for violation of the statute. 
    He had non-provocatively responded to the officers accosting him. 
    In this situ -- in this case the record reflects that he was arrested simply for refusing to give his name after a lawful stop by the police officer. 
    I did want to also distinguish this case from cases such as (Inaudible) and the other cases that have held vagrancy statutes unconstitutional because this statute punishes conduct not status. 
    I think there's an important difference in (Inaudible), that the statute was held unconstitutionally vague because underlying that decision I think was the feeling that people were convicted for what they were not for what they had done. 
    I don't believe that is the situation in this case. 
    I also wanted to point out that there is a mens rea requirement in the statute that requires an intentional refusal. 
    I think this is the same which is this somewhat from the DeFillippo case which not -- did not clearly contained a mens rea requirement. 
    And I think the intentional element the mens rea requirement does under various decision of this Court say the statute from any vagueness that this Court not find otherwise.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The last argument that I would like to address or the last issue that I would like to address is just briefly is the Fifth Amendment issue that was raised in the brief on appeal by Mr. Brown's attorney. 
    I just wanted to point out that this is an attack on the statute on its face and all the issues that are not in particular at this point on the Fifth Amendment question. 
    And the Fifth Amendment self-privilege against self-incrimination is not a right that can be asserted vicariously on behalf of large groups of people. 
    This Court has many times held that is a personal privilege that must be asserted which brings me to my second point on this and that is that Mr. Brown nowhere in the proceedings until the motion to dis -- set aside the information was filed invoked the Fifth Amendment. 
    In fact, on the way down to the booking station he told them his name. 
    Another point I would like to make use under California versus Byers at least in a plurality opinion, this Court has written that a person's name and his address is just a neutral adamant information which is not incriminating in anyway and it can be analogized to the taking of blood samples, the exhibition of the person at a lineup in such situations. 
    One question that has not come up here so far and was brought up in the DeFillippo case, I think Mr. Justice White asked it, was -- what about the Miranda situation? 
    But, is it required that Miranda warnings be given? 
    I didn't want to point out that Miranda spoke briefly to this issue when it said that it did not apply to general on the scene question in circumstances where a crime might have been committed or something like that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2993.935" stopTime="2997.246">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course the crime wasn't committed until after the question was asked?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2997.246" stopTime="3020.578">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Well, that's true, this particular crime was not. 
    And what I was saying is as going back to my argument that a lawful stop, in the Terry versus Ohio stop, Miranda seem to side that in a situation like that you don't need to give Miranda warnings because general on the scene question is not covered. 
    I think Oregon versus Methieson kind of expanded this idea.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    It isn't just to see whether the man has got a gun. 
    The primary trust is to investigate possible criminal activity but in that process this Court has said, they may search the person to see whether he has got a gun and that's a prophylactic thing so that the officer doesn't --
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3165.329" stopTime="3172.305">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    That's correct. 
    They can pat him down or frisk him to see if he has a gun if circumstances are present which indicate that they may need to protect themselves.

   Rebuttal of Raymond C. Caballero
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3200.654" stopTime="3204.241">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Caballero you have a few minutes left.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="3204.241" stopTime="3274.082">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Yes, sir. 
    Reading Terry into the words lawfully stopped looking through the record there I don't know that the court below ever considered Terry. 
    And I can't see simply by saying a state legislature putting in the words lawful or unlawful reads in or reads out Supreme Court decisions. 
    And under the decision in this Court, Connally versus General Construction Company, the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it. 
    That's the test of vagueness not that some court some place may be able to read in Terry or read it out in a particular situation. 
    Otherwise, all you have to do to make a statute pass the vagueness test here would be just to put in the words lawfully stopped or unlawful detention or whatever you may want to read into the statute by those words.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3274.082" stopTime="3288.268">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But don't many statutes in fact do that, for instance, criminal test which statutes doesn't -- oh, unlawfully on the premises and -- it may be a question of considerable doubt in that particular case whether a person is or is not lawfully on the premises.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="3288.268" stopTime="3415.258">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    I agree with you sir. 
    In the situation where you read in the words lawful there are other standards for example unlawfully on the premises normally takes to me you're on the premises and you don't have permission to be there. 
    But the words lawfully stopped are so vague it's a question of degree I agree with you. 
    That they are so vague lawfully stopped that in this case for example this Court under facts that I would consider that it was not a lawful stop simply stopping the person in an alley who had not been doing anything wrong, no suspicion or report that he had been doing anything wrong. 
    Court held below that it was a lawful stop. 
    Now what the court did below, the Court had serious reservations about the constitutionality of the statute but simply presumed that the statute was valid and read in to the statute apparently that this was also a valid stop as applied in this particular case. 
    Now if the stop had been unlawful, necessarily my client would've been acquitted and you would not be reviewing the statute. 
    If the stop is lawful, excuse me, if the stop was unlawful under the facts of the case then it would be like Norwell where you simply apply in the -- there was protected activity, it never reached the constitutional issue by that means. 
    And incidentally in Norwell versus Cincinnati, I went back and looked at it, you -- this Court did say we are persuaded at the ordinance as applied to this petitioner on the facts of this case operated to punish his constitutionally protected speech. 
    So that was decided on First Amendment grounds. 
    The Fifth Amendment question in this case, it's very difficult sometimes to see how the invocation of that right to -- under the Fifth Amendment can be valid or it applies to a name only. 
    However, in the situation where for example I saw a case out of Texas, the Miller case cited on the brief where a person had made a false claim for insurance. 
    He claimed that he was dead, the claim was made through his wife. 
    Later on he was arrested. 
    Had he given his name Joe Dolks or anything else, that person had never would've put the crime --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3415.258" stopTime="3435.634">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, aren't you confusing probable cause with incriminating? 
    The disclosure of the name may lead to the arrest but the disclosure of the name per se doesn't incriminate him? 
    It merely sets in motion the chain of events that will bring him on to Court.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="3435.634" stopTime="3513.593">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Isn't that also incrimination? 
    Incrimination goes beyond mere evidence presented in Court. 
    Incrimination means something that they may subject me to prosecution. 
    And I can't see how you can totally separate the concepts of evidence in Court and probable cause also evidence to give someone a reasonable cause to arrest him -- a person. 
    I -- separating the two, I have a difficult time with that. 
    To me they're both incrimination. 
    One allows evidence to be presented in Court. 
    The other one allows my arrest. 
    In either case it's incrimination. 
    But reaching the cons -- how would you ever -- under the facts of this case, how would you ever test the constitutionality of the statute if you didn't get beyond the facts of this particular case and find out whether there was constitutionally protected conduct which was being punished by the statute here which is exactly what appellant is trying to do. 
    And is there constitutionally protected conduct which this -- the statute in this case makes criminal. 
    The fact is you do have a right to walk down the street and stand mute. 
    Under the case Norwell versus Cincinnati, you do have the right to walk down the street and tell the policeman I don't want to tell you anything.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well he did more than that. He verbally and negatively protested. 
    Now in your case, you don't have anything said at all.

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Yes, we do Your Honor.

speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3529.055" stopTime="3543.187">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Yes, but he's being arrested for not speaking to with -- identifying himself. 
    I think it's a very different case from Norwell. 
    I think your First Amendment argument is frivolous.
speaker="raymond_c_caballero" startTime="3543.187" stopTime="3565.004">
    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    Alright. 
    Yeah, under Norwell, whether Norwell was being prosecuted for saying something or not doing something, the point is that in that case this Court held that it was constitutionally protected speech. 
    In other words, telling the police officer I don't want to tell you anything, this Court held was constitutionally protected speech. 
    If someone is asking my name and I tell them, "I don't want to tell you anything" --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="3565.004" stopTime="3571.686">

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero 
    I think it ought to be pinned on the First, Fourth, and Fifth. 
    Your Honor, they all are bundled so close together that I don't think any one amendment ought to decide this case. 
    I think this is a group of rights that are so close in this case --

    Mr. Raymond C. Caballero
