    Justice Potter Stewart 
    These cases are here by way of a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    The respondents who are a certified class of present and former employees brought this action against the petitioners, their employer, the Albemarle Paper Company and the other petitioner, the employee's union, seeking injunctive relief against "any policy, practice, custom or usage" at the plant which was violative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, and after several years of discovery moved to add a class backpay demand in that lawsuit -- in this lawsuit. 
    At the trial, the major issues were the plant's seniority system, its program of employment testing, and the question of backpay. 
    The District Court found that, following a reorganization under a new collective-bargaining agreement, the Negro employees had been "locked' in the lower paying job classifications," and ordered the petitioners to implement a system of plantwide seniority. 
    The District Court refused, however, to order backpay for losses sustained by the plaintiff class under the discriminatory system on two grounds. 
    First, that Albemarle, that is the employer's breach of Title VII was not in bad faith. 
    And second, that the plaintiffs, the respondents here, who had initially disclaimed interest in backpay, had delayed making their backpay claim until five years after the complaint was filed, thereby prejudicing the employer and the labor union. 
    The Court also refused to enjoin or even to limit Albemarle's testing program, which the respondents -- plaintiffs had contended had a disproportionate adverse impact on Negros and was not shown to be related to job performance. 
    The Court concluding that "personnel tests administered at the plant have undergone validation studies and have proven to be job related." 
    The plaintiffs -- respondents here appealed on the backpay and the pre-employment tests issues. 
    The Court of Appeals decided in their favor and reversed the District Court's judgment. 
    Today we hold that given a finding of unlawful discrimination, backpay should be denied only for reasons that, if applied generally, would not frustrate the central statutory purpose manifested by Congress in enacting Title VII of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination. 
    We hold further that the absence of bad faith is not a sufficient reason for denying backpay since Title VII is not concerned with the employer's "good intent or absence of discriminatory intent," but rather "Congress intended the thrust of the Act to be -- to the -- be the consequences of employment practices and not simply the motivation." 
    That as we understand it is the teaching of the case of Griggs against Duke Power Company reported in Volume 401 of the United States Reports. 
    Whether the respondents' lateness -- tardiness and inconsistency in making their backpay demand in this lawsuit were excusable and whether they actually prejudiced the petitioners by that delay and inconsistency are matters that will be open to review by the Court of Appeals if the District Court, on remand, decides again to decline a backpay award. 
    As we concluded that it's clear from the opinion in the Griggs case in 401 U.S. and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Guidelines for employees seeking to determine -- for employers rather, seeking to determine through professional validation studies whether employment tests are job related, such tests are impermissible unless shown, by professionally acceptable methods, to be "predictive of or significant -- significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which the applicants or candidates are being evaluated." 
    Measured against those standards, Albemarle's validation studies in this case were materially defective in several respects all of which are described in detail in the written opinion filed today with the clerk. 
    But in view of the facts that during the appellate stages of this litigation Albemarle has apparently been amending its departmental organization and the use made of its tests. 
    And in view further of the fact that issues of standards of proof for job relatedness and of evidentiary procedures involving validation tests have not until this case been clarified and that provisional use of tests pending new validation efforts may be authorized. 
    The District Court on remand should initially fashion the necessary relief. 
    And accordingly, we vacate the judgment before us in this case and remand it to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with Court's written opinion filed with the clerk today. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Rehnquist while joining the opinion of the Court have each filed separate concurring opinions. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring only in the judgment of the Court. 
    The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
    And Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
