    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I also have for announcement, No. 74-548, the United States v. State Tax Commission of Mississippi. 
    Regulation 25 of the Mississippi State Tax Commission requires out-of-state liquor distillers and suppliers to collect from military installations within Mississippi, there are four of such installations in Mississippi, and remit to the Commission, a tax in the form of a wholesale markup of 17% to 20% on liquor sold to the military at those installations. 
    A three-judge District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi held that the legal incidence of the tax is upon the out-state-liquor dealers and suppliers and therefore rejected the argument of the United States that the tax is unconstitutional under the doctrine of McCulloch and Maryland as a state upon instrumentalities of the United States. 
    We reverse. 
    We hold that since Mississippi law requires that the out-of-state sellers collect the tax from the military, the legal incidence of the tax as a matter of law is upon the military and therefore that the tax is an unconstitutional state levy upon instrumentalities of the United States. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents and have filed a dissenting statement.
