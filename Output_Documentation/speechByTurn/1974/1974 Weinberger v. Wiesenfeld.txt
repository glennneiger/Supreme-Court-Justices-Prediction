    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I also have to announce No. 73-1892, Weinberger, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare against Wiesenfeld. 
    Under the Social Security Act, when a covered male worker dies, leaving a wife and minor children, survivors' benefits are paid both to the children and to the widow. 
    However, when a covered female worker dies, leaving a husband and minor children, survivors' benefits are paid only to the children and not to the widower. 
    A three-judge District Court in New Jersey held that this sex-based discrimination was unconstitutional because in violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
    We agree and we affirm. 
    Mr. Justice Powell joined by the Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed an opinion concurring in the result. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
