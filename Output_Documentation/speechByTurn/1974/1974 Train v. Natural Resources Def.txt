    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    This case involves a construction of the Clean Air Act and comes to us from the Court of Appeals from the Fifth Circuit. 
    The Clean Air Act requires that each state adopt the plan for attaining and maintaining national standards for the quality of air within its borders. 
    The state plan details the limitations on air population with which particular sources within the state must comply. 
    The present case has required us to determine the conditions under which the Clean Air Act permits sources of population to obtain variances from the population limitations which are imposed on them by a state plan. 
    For reasons set out at length in the opinion, we concluded that variances may be granted under Section 110 (a) (3) of the Act which governs revisions of state plans if the plan nonetheless concludes to provide for the attainment and maintenance of national air quality standard. 
    This was the adoption of the regulation originally promulgated by the EPA, the Fifth Circuit set it aside. 
    The Fifth Circuit was wrong in doing so and we reverse the Fifth Circuit. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has noted his dissent. 
    Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
