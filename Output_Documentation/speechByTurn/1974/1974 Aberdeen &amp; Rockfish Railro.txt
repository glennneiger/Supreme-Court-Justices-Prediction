    Justice Byron R. White 
    In 73-1966 and 73-1971 so-called "SCRAP case". 
    We noted probable jurisdiction from appeal on an appeal for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
    This case has a long and complicated history which I need not go into right now. 
    The District Court concluded that the Interstate Commerce Commission had given inadequate attention to environmental factors in refusing to declare unlawful a general revenue rate increase which the Nation's railroads had filed. 
    The District Court ordered that the commission should conduct further proceedings in which it would give more explicit attention to environmental concerns by filing a new environmental impact statement. 
    For the reasons given in an opinion filed today, we conclude that the District Court had jurisdiction, that we in turn have jurisdiction over this appeal, and that the District Court erred in several respects, in ruling that the ICC should conduct further proceedings in this case. 
    We accordingly reverse the judgment of the District Court. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision in this case.
