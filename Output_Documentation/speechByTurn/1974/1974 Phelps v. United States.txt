    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    74-121 is here from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
    A corporate taxpayer unable to pay assessed federal taxes conveyed its assets to an assignee for the benefit of creditors. 
    The assignee converted the assets into cash to which the federal tax lien attached. 
    The United States thereupon served a notice of levy upon the assignee demanding turnover of the proceeds to pay the tax and debtors. 
    The taxpayer then went into bankruptcy and the receiver in bankruptcy obtained from the bankruptcy court an order upon the assignee directing the payment of the proceeds to the receiver. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the order holding that the bankruptcy court was without jurisdiction summarily to adjudicate the adverse tax claim of the United States in that the receiver's only recourse to test that claim was by way of plenary action for refund under Section 23 of the Bankruptcy Act. 
    We agree with the Seventh Circuit and unanimously affirm.
