    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    These three cases come to us on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    Each presents a different issue concerning the United States Border Patrol's operations for apprehending aliens to enter the country illegally. 
    In 1973, we held in Almeida-Sanchez versus the United States, that Border Patrol officers on roving patrol may not search private vehicles without probable cause to believe that they contain aliens who are illegally in the country. 
    We did not decide in that case whether probable cause would be required for similar searches at established traffic checkpoints. 
    In United States against Ortiz, No. 73-2050, respondent's car was searched without probable cause at a Border Patrol checkpoint near San Clemente, California and three aliens were found in his trunk. 
    The Court of Appeals held this search illegal under the principles of Almeida-Sanchez. 
    We agree that the ruling of that case cover searches of private vehicles at traffic checkpoints. 
    Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist filed a concurring opinion. 
    The Chief Justice joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice White joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.
