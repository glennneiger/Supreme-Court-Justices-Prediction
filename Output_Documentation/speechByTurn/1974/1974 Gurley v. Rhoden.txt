    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    This case is here from the Supreme Court of Mississippi. 
    The Mississippi 5% sales tax is applied to the pump price of gasoline. 
    That pump price is increased 13 cents represent federal and state excise taxes passed on by the retailer to the motorist. 
    The Mississippi Supreme Court held that this does not render the sales tax an unconstitutional tax upon a tax. 
    We agree and affirm. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
