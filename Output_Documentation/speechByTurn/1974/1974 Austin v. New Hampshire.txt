    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In this case, the appellants, residents of Maine have challenged a New Hampshire Commuters Income Tax under which their income earned in New Hampshire is taxed while the earned income of New Hampshire residents no matter where earned are not taxed. 
    A prior decision of this Court established that in the area of taxation, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the constitution required that non-residents be treated on terms of substantial equality with residents. 
    The actual effect of the New Hampshire Commuters Tax however, if exact from the non-residents the wholly disproportionate share of the costs of government. 
    Therefore, for reasons stated in an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold the tax statute unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
