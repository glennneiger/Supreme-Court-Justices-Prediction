    Justice William O. Douglas 
    These cases are here on appeal from a three-judge District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. 
    They involve applications on motor carriers for certificates of public convenience and necessity to transport commodities in the southeast and southwestern parts of this country. 
    The three-judge court refused to enforce the order of the commission. 
    No question is raised here by the parties concerning the substantial evidence test. 
    There is a question raises respects the -- whether the District Court was correct in refusing to enforce the ICC order on the grounds that it was arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    This is a rather lengthy opinion. 
    We review the points passed on by the District Court and argued with the parties and we conclude that the District Court erred and accordingly we reverse and remand the cases to wit.
