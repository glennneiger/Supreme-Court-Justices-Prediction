    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. 
    In Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 authorized the President to stabilize wages and salaries at certain levels, and created the Pay Board to oversee these controls. 
    The question presented by this case, is whether the Act was constitutional as applied by the Pay Board to Ohio state employees. 
    The language and the legislative history of the Act make it clear that Congress contemplated, sacrifices by business and labor as well as other segments of the economy to implement the controls. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that general raises to state employees, could significantly affect interstate commerce and could thus by -- properly subject to regulation by Congress. 
    State employees do not derive immunity from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status. 
    Here, where the Act did not appreciably intrude on state sovereignty, but was an emergency measure, the effectiveness of federal action would have been drastically impaired if wage increases to state and legal -- and local employees were left outside the reach of the Act. 
    The judgment below is therefore affirmed. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a separate statement. 
    And Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.
