    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    In the third case, the United States against Brignoni-Ponce, No. 74-114, presents an issue about a different aspect of the Border Patrol's operations. 
    Respondent's car was stopped on a highway where there was no established checkpoint. 
    No search is in issue in this case because the passengers immediately admitted that they were aliens illegally in the country. 
    Because a mere stop, the questioning about citizenship is less intrusive than a search, we hold that the standard of probable cause is not required. 
    But even random stops for questioning anywhere near the Mexican border could subject law abiding citizens to potentially unlimited interference with their use of the highways. 
    We therefore hold that Border Patrol officers on roving patrol may not stop a private vehicle unless they have reasonable grounds to suspect that it contained aliens. 
    In this case, the only reason for stopping respondent's car was that the occupants appeared to be of Mexican descent. 
    We agree with the Court of Appeals that this alone does not constitute reasonable grounds to believe that the occupants were in fact aliens. 
    Accordingly, we hold that the stop was illegal. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist filed a concurring opinion. 
    The Chief Justice, joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun, filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice White joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun filed an opinion also concurring in the judgment.
