    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have the disposition to announce in No. 73-1119, MTM Incorporated against Baxley. 
    For the reasons stated in an opinion for the Court filed this morning, we conclude that we are without jurisdiction. 
    And accordingly the judgment of the three-judge District Court of the Northern District of Alabama is vacated and the cases remanded to the District Court so that a fresh order may be entered and a timely appeal prosecuted to the Court of Appeals if the parties so desire. 
    Mr. Justice White filed an opinion concurring in the result. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas filed a dissenting opinion.
