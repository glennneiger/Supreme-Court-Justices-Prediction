    Justice Byron R. White 
    The 1972 Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to allot to the state up to the amount -- sums of money up to the amounts specified in the Act for the years covered by the provisions of the Act. 
    Those funds allotted thereafter become available for commitment for approved sewage treatment projects. 
    The issue in the case is whether the Administrator has the authority to postpone allotments or to allot to the states less than the total amounts authorized under the Act. 
    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the Administrator had no such discretion. 
    For the reasons that we given an opinion on file with the Court -- or on file with the clerk, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    I'm authorized to say that Mr. Justice Douglas concurs in the result.
