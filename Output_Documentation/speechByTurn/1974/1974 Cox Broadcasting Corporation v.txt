    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Georgia and that Court sustained a statute of the state which forbad the press under any circumstances to publish the name of a rape victim. 
    There is an initial question about jurisdiction and we answer it and sustain our jurisdiction for the reasons which we given an opinion which is on file with the clerk. 
    On the merits and on First Amendment grounds, we reverse the judgment of the Georgia Court insofar as it purports to forbid the publication of the name of the rape victim which has already been made a matter of public record in the course of judicial proceedings. 
    Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion. 
    The Chief Justice concurs in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.
