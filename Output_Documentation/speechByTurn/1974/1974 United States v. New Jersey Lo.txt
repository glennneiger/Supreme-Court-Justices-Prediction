    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    We have filed a per curiam opinion in this case for reasons stated in that opinion. 
    The judgment for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is vacated and remanded so that it may consider whether the case is now moot in light of a recent amendment to the federal statute involved. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas filed a dissenting opinion. 
    The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or the decision of the case.
