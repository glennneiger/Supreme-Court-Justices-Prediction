    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    The question is whether a shipowner's duty to furnish maintenance and cure to a seaman who suffers an incurable injury aboard ship continues from the date the seaman leaves the ship to the date when a medical diagnosis is made that his injury was in fact incurable when he left the ship. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the shipowner's duty did not continue after but terminated when the seaman left the ship. 
    We unanimously reverse.
