    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In Philbrook against and Glodgett and Weinberger against Glodgett the question is whether the receipt of State unemployment compensation may be permitted to bar the receipt of aid -- aid for dependent children assistance under the federal Social Security statute. 
    A three-judge District Court in Vermont held that it could not be and that Vermont's administration of its program so as to terminate AFDC upon receipt of -- or eligibility for unemployment compensation violated the applicable federal statute. 
    Both state and federal administrators appealed to this Court. 
    We conclude that the three-judge District Court was correct in its construing of the federal statue. 
    And on the appeal of the state administrators, we affirm. 
    On the appeal of the Secretary, we dismiss his appeal.
