    Justice Byron R. White 
    In the Richmond case, 74-201, with -- the District Court for the District of Columbia was asked to issue a declaratory judgment to the effect that an annexation by the City of Richmond have neither the purpose nor effect of denying the right to vote to the Negro minority when the City of Richmond annexed certain parts of Chesterfield County, a suburban area. 
    We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal. 
    We do not agree with the District Court that the annexation has finely conceived have the effect of denying the right to vote. 
    We are also sufficiently unsure that it had the purpose -- that it had such a purpose that we vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case for further proceedings with respect to the purpose of the annexation in the light of present conditions. 
    These conclusions are more fully explained in the opinion filed with the clerk today. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion in which Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined. 
    Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
