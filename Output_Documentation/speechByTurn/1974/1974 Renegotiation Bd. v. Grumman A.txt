    Justice Byron R. White 
    The Grumman case, 1316 is also a Freedom of Information Act case, this time raising the issue whether there must be disclosed the various documents produced by the Renegotiation Board as well as its regional boards in the course of deciding whether certain government contractors have earned and must refund excessive profits. 
    The Court of Appeals ordered the disclosure.We have concluded otherwise and reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals. 
    All is set out in an opinion which we have issued this morning. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas dissents and Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the case.
