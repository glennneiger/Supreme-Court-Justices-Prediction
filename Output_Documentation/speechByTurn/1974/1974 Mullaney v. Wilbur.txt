    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    Petitioners are the State of Maine and its prison warden. 
    Respondent was convicted of murder under a Maine procedure that placed the burden on him to prove that he had acted in a heat of passion on sudden provocation. 
    Only if he carried this burden could he reduce the charge of murder to manslaughter. 
    After exhausting his state remedies, respondent filed a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court challenging the Maine procedure. 
    For the reasons stated in our opinion filed today, we hold that the imposition of this burden on respondent constituted a denial of due process. 
    We follow this Court's decision in In re Winship which requires the prosecution in a criminal case to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the charge -- the crime charged. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist filed a concurring opinion in which the Chief Justice joined.
