    Justice Byron R. White 
    In the Johnson case, petitioners were charged in Mississippi courts with the illegal boycott of local businesses. 
    They sought to remove the cases under 28 U.S.C. 1443 (1) which permits removal when defendants and local criminal cases are denied or cannot enforce their rights under any federal law providing for equal civil rights. 
    The District Court denied removal and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    We in turn affirm. 
    The case is controlled by our prior decision in Greenwood against Peacock. 
    Here as there, there is no federal statute conferring any rights of the necessary kind that are being denied by these prosecutions in the Mississippi courts. 
    The judgment is affirmed. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion with whom Mr. Justice Brennan has joined. 
    Mr. Justice Dougla took no part in the consideration and decision of the case.
