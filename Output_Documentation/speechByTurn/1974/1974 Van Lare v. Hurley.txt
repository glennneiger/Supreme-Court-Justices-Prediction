Van Lare v. Hurley

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    74-5054 and 74-453, are concerned with a New York regulation under which the rent allowance payable to a recipient of aid under the program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children is reduced when the recipient takes a non-paying lodger into the home. 
    In No. 74-5054, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that this New York regulation does not conflict with the Federal Social Security Act and the regulations under that statute. 
    We disagree and reverse. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    In No. 74-453, a three-judge District Court in the Southern District of New York held that the New York regulation was unconstitutional because in violation of the Due Process Clause. 
    In light of our decision in 74-5054, we have no occasion to address that or any constitutional question. 
    Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the three-judge District Court and remand with direction to dismiss the case to that extent as moot.
