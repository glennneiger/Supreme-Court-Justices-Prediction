    Justice Byron R. White 
    In 74-156, Hicks against Miranda. 
    A three-judge District Court for the Central District of California entertained a suit to declare the California obscenity statute unconstitutional and to enjoin its operation in certain respects. 
    The Court refused to grant a motion to dismiss which was filed under Younger v. Harris and which asserted that criminal prosecutions against the federal plaintiffs were then pending in the state courts. 
    The District Court also concluded that it was not bound by cases in which this Court had dismissed an appeal for a want of a substantial federal question. 
    The Court then reached the merits and declared the California statute unconstitutional. 
    We noted probable jurisdiction and now reverse the District Court. 
    As explained in the opinion we have filed, we overrule objections which have been asserted to our jurisdiction include that the District Court should have dismissed the case under Younger v. Harris and make clear that the District Court was indeed bound by our summary dismissals of appeals for want of a substantial federal question. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a concurring statement. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Douglas, Marshall and Brennan have joined.
