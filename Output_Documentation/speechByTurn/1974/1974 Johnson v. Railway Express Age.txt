    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    The second case, No. 1543, Johnson against The Railway Express Agency comes to us from the Sixth Circuit. 
    It presents the issue whether the timely filing of a charge of employment discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission pursuant to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act serves to toll or delay the running of the period of limitation applicable to an action on the same facts instituted under Section 1981 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code, a statute which has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1866. 
    We granted certiorari here because of apparent conflict on the issue among the Circuits. 
    We hold that the finding of a charge with the EEOC does not toll the limitation period applicable to 1981. 
    In this case, the petitioner waited three and a half years after his claim of employment discrimination accrued before he instituted his 1981 action. 
    His suit therefore is time barred by the one year limitation period imposed by the applicable state law, in this case, Tennessee. 
    Notwithstanding the fact that he had filed his Title VII charge before that limitation period had expired. 
    I'm authorized to say Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part and that he has been joined in that opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Brennan.
