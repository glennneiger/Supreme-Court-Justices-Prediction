    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    Petitioner, who was convicted in a state court of robbery, sought a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he had been denied a fair trial because jurors had learned from news accounts of his prior felony convictions or certain facts about the robbery charge itself. 
    In an opinion filed today, we hold that jurors' exposure to this type of information does not in a state trial presumptively deprive the defendant of due process. 
    Looking to the particular facts of this case, we hold that the jurors did not display hostility to petitioner, suggesting a partiality that could not be set aside. 
    The jurors neither betrayed or belief in the relevance on petitioner's past through his present guilt nor withdrawn from a community with settlements so inflamed against petitioner as to call in to question various signs of impartiality. 
    Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denying the writ is affirmed. 
    The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in the result and Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion.
