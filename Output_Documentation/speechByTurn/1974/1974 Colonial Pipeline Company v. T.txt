    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    This case is here from the Supreme Court of Louisiana. 
    The appellant, Colonial Pipeline Company is an interstate pipeline engaged exclusively in interstate business. 
    The Louisiana Supreme Court held however that as a foreign corporation qualified to carry on and actually carrying on business in Louisiana in corporate form, Colonial gained the benefits and protections from Louisiana, a value and importance to its business and therefore that Colonial can be required to pay Louisiana's franchise tax without violating the Commerce Clause. 
    We agree and affirmed. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist joins. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
