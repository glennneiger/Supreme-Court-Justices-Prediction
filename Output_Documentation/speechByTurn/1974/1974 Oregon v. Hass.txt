    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    The other case, Oregon against Hass comes to us from the Supreme Court of Oregon. 
    It presents a variation of a fact situation encountered by the Court in the case of Harris against New York decided here four years ago. 
    Mr. Hass, as a suspect, was in the custody of a state police officer. 
    He had been given full Miranda warnings and then a little later he told the state officer that he would like to telephone a lawyer. 
    The reply was that this could not be done until the officer and Mr. Hass reached the station. 
    Mr. Hass then provided inculpatory information. 
    And our issue here is whether after Mr. Hass took the stand and testified in a manner contrary to that inculpatory information it may be testified to by the state officer in rebuttal solely for impeachment purposes or whether on the other hand it is inadmissible under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    In the Harris case, the situation was identical except that the Miranda warnings were defective. 
    In here, they were not defective. 
    The state trial court ruled that the Harris decision controlled and that the testimony of the state officer was admissible for impeachment. 
    The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed feeling that an Oregon case decided before the Harris decision here was controlling. 
    The Supreme Court of Oregon affirmed by a sharply divided four-to-three vote. 
    And it did show, we hold and solely on federal constitutional grounds. 
    In an opinion filed today, we reverse the Supreme Court of Oregon and hold that this case despite its slight factual differences is controlled by our decision in Harris against New York. 
    And I'm authorized to say that Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has also filed a separate dissenting opinion and is joined in that opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
