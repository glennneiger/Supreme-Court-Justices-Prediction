    Justice Byron R. White 
    This is a criminal case that comes here from the courts of Louisiana where the petitioner Taylor's conviction was affirmed by the Louisiana Supreme Court. 
    At the time of the conviction the statutes of the state provided that women would not be called for jury service unless they had filed a written declaration in advance if they desire to be subject to jury service. 
    The consequence was that hardly any women were called to serve on the criminal case juries. 
    The issue here is whether this jury selection system comports with the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendments to be -- to the constitution. 
    For the reasons we state in the opinion on file with the clerk, we hold that it does not and we consequently reverse the conviction of petitioner Taylor. 
    The Chief Justice concurs in the judgment Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.
