    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This case comes to us from the Fifth Circuit. 
    The petitioner is a general contractor in a construction business in Dallas. 
    The respondent is a labor union that had no collective-bargaining agreement with a contractor. 
    But the union, by picketing a construction project of the contractor was deemed to agree that in granting subcontracts for plumbing and mechanical work, the contractor would deal only with subcontractors who had collective-bargaining agreements with the union. 
    The contractor brought this action to annul the agreement as a restraint on trade under both the federal and state antitrust laws. 
    For the reasons stated in our opinion filed today, we hold that the agreement between the union and the contractor is not immune from federal antitrust laws. 
    We remand the case to determine whether in fact, this agreement was an illegal restraint of trade. 
    We also hold that state antitrust laws are preempted by federal labor policy. 
    Mr Justice Stewart filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan, and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas also filed a brief dissenting statement.
