    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    This case arises out of respondent Metropolitan Edison's termination of electrical service to the residence of Catherine Jackson, the petitioner, for alleged non-payment of bills for prior utility service. 
    Metropolitan is a privately owned company licensed and regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission. 
    Its action in terminating petitioner's utility service was permitted by a provision of its general tariff which had been filed with the state utilities commission. 
    Petitioner brought suit against Metropolitan in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking damages and injunction requiring Metropolitan to continue providing service until she had received a hearing and an opportunity to pay the amounts found due. 
    Petitioner argued that she had an entitlement to electric service under a Pennsylvania statute which constituted property under the Due Process Clause. 
    And that Metropolitan's termination had deprived her of this entitlement without minimum procedural protections required by that portion of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    She further argues that Metropolitan's termination was state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The District Court dismissed her complaint and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. 
    We granted certiorari to review this judgment. Our cases from the civil rights cases of 1883 forward have recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment opens to judicial scrutiny only in state action and not private action. 
    The threshold question in this case is whether Metropolitan's action in terminating service was sufficiently closely connected to the State of Pennsylvania to be fairly attributable to that state for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We hold that is not. 
    Under our decisions, the partial monopoly status of Metropolitan and the fact that it is subject to state regulation do not create a sufficient nexus between the state and the termination to make the termination state action. 
    The provision of electrical services also is not traditionally exclusive state function. 
    Respondent's exercise of the choice allowed by state law in this case where the initiative comes from it and not from the state does not make its action that of the state for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Taking all of petitioner's arguments together we find that the State of Pennsylvania is not sufficiently connected with the termination so as to make its action state action. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is therefore affirmed. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan, and Mr. Justice Marshall have each filed a separate dissenting opinion in the case.
