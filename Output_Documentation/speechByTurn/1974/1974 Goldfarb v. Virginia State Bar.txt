    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have the opinion for the Court and the judgment to announce in No. 74-70, Goldfarb against the Virginia State Bar. 
    And for reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk today, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed. 
    And the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals with orders to remand it in terms of the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration of this case.
