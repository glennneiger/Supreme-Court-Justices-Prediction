    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This case is here on appeal from a three-judge District Court in Connecticut. 
    Appellees claiming continuing eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits challenge the validity of Connecticut procedures for determining that eligibility. 
    The District Court sustained the challenge on due process grounds and the state appealed. 
    Following our noting of probable jurisdiction, the Connecticut legislature enacted major revisions of these procedures. 
    We concluded from our examination of Connecticut as revised that the changes were significant and could affect the merits of this case. 
    We therefore vacate the decision of the District Court and remand the case for reconsideration in light of the intervening changes in Connecticut law. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion.
