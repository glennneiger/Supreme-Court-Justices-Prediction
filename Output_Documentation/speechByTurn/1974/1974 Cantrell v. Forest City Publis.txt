    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    This is a diversity of citizenship action, brought in a Federal District Court, grounded upon invasion of the petitioner's privacy. 
    The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    For the reasons stated in some detail in the opinion filed today, we hold that with respect to two of the defendants, the Cleveland Plain Dealer and one of its reporters, the trial judge did not commit constitutional error in allowing the case to go to the jury under the instructions that he gave and we therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion.
