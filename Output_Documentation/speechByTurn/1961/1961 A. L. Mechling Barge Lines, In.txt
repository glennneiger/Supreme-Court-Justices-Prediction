    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    May I should like to call attention to the report of the late great Joseph B. Eastman on this form of rail rate competition with water carriers which shows that -- about what it is, a means of financing lower rail rate competition with water carriers by revenue -- rail revenue derived from none water competitive rail transportation, both with respect to the short-haul rate and the great reservoir of non-competitive traffic which the railroads have generally, and to -- yes sir.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    May, I ask you please, is this matter in contest now? 
    Does not the Solicitor General concede your point?
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="59.731" stopTime="196.373">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Not quite, Your Honor. 
    And may I refer directly to that having said what I have said. 
    The Solicitor General’s concession is put in a form which is confusingly broader than any issue that is presented in this case. 
    Let me lead up to that if I may, I referred to the fact that after insisting in the lower court on the validity of the Commission's procedures in all respects, both with respect to the necessity of findings and also with respect to the necessity of hearings before on a contested issue or uncontested issues, a binding order is made without giving the hearing that the Commission admitted the needs because it orders one -- insisted in the lower court on the validity of its procedures on both those points, then the Solicitor General concedes that as to the necessity of findings -- it, the Commissioner, has for some years been following a practice which is contrary to law. 
    That admission is made in very broad terms. 
    But the insistencies that there should be no consideration as to whether the Commission has not also been following a procedure for years. 
    Some few years last past that is contrary to law with respect to the necessity of those hearings in these circumstances. 
    It is in these circumstances that we urge that findings are necessary and that hearings are necessary.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="196.373" stopTime="197.861">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    I thought he conceded that?
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="197.861" stopTime="216.282">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    No sir, he did not concede that hearings were necessary. 
    He conceded only that findings were necessary, and asked that this Court not even consider whether the Commission had not also been departing from legally required procedures with respect to the necessity of hearings.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="216.282" stopTime="222.855">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Isn't it true that before findings could be made, some hearing would have to precede?
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="222.855" stopTime="375.945">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    That sir is my position. 
    He does not concede it. 
    As a matter of fact he asked this Court not to pass on that point, but to allow the Commission to proceed without review on the short-term orders which have so long escaped preview by the means that I described yesterday. 
    Changing the situation when the immediate practice -- immediate instance of the unlawful practice is the same. 
    That is the essence of this case. 
    It is the recurrent nature of these illegalities in short-term orders escaping review that makes it necessary for that to be a review here against the contention that there is no longer any controversy because the particular instance of the unlawful practices (a) findings -- no findings, (b) no hearing has lapsed by virtue of something engineered for the railroad defendants. 
    This Court said in the Southern Pacific Terminal cases, I cannot put my argument in better language than that of the Court in that case. 
    The questions involved in orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission now usually continuing as are manifestly those in the case at bar. 
    And their consideration ought not to be as they might be defeated by short-term orders capable of repetition, yet evading review, that at one time the Government and in another time the carriers, have their right determined by the Commission without a chance of regress. 
    There was a situation in which the order before the Commission, had order of the Commission had expired by its terms. 
    It had been entered for two years only, and the two years were up and the argument of the Commission was there as yet, but the case was moot. 
    That was the answer that this Court returned in a situation of short-term orders that goes straight to the circumstances of this existing continuing controversy.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="375.945" stopTime="393.485">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    On that case, as I understand it and the ones like it go to the question of mootness, but if you get over that and reach the merits, then does not the Solicitor General practically concede your position on the merits?
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="393.485" stopTime="428.338">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Your Honor, I think he does. 
    It seems to me that to say that the findings of fact are necessary and yet, that it is not necessary to hold the hearing which the Commission admittedly the needs to make those findings which are to be decisive of its action, before it takes action, binding action, action that can't be collaterally attacked that continues for years, although it's called temporary while the hearings are postponed. 
    It seems to me that is an impossible position.

speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="439.401" stopTime="575.881">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Thank you for raising that. 
    Let me urge the point that I have made in my brief. 
    These so-called temporary orders are the diametrical opposite of the relief traditionally granted by Chancery to maintain the status quo pending the hearing. 
    These so-called temporary orders changed the status quo. 
    At once before the hearing by a determination on findings now admitted to be necessary are precisely the issues on which any such binding order, changing status quo, injury and immediate injury of one of the parties would have to depend. 
    It's hard to concede how anyone could defend that kind of a practice. 
    It is just reminiscent of the famous trial in Lewis Carroll's satire which the order of procedure was, “Sentence first, verdict afterwards.” 
    It turns it upside down. 
    No one would imagine that when the Commission goes to Congress and says, “We always give a man a hearing if he has a proper interest.” 
    What they mean is that they dispose off his interests right at the outset merely on pleadings. 
    And then so far as the facts are concerned, the hearing is long postponed. 
    And the results of the Government says sometimes, “In a change of the order which had forced those issues apparently when the case was first submitted on the pleadings.” 
    Now, I say the Government's concession with respect to the necessity of those findings rarely carries with it a concession of the necessity of having a hearings.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well why do you say that -- the history of the Commission, the history of this Court with reference to Commission action, is full of determination, that the most abrupt, the most limited, the most empty hearing will suffice on it at all. 
    No one has more often Mr. Hayes expressed this satisfaction with the kind of findings the Commission made, but no one than I have, but no one is more aware than I am, what a tickly subject that is and how disputatious the subject matter is, and how often this Court has divided with the findings of adequate or inadequate, and you blow this up into a great constitutional issue.
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="659.115" stopTime="725.413">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Your Honor, I am -- with submission beginning by urging that the Commission's concession of the necessity of findings is confusingly far broader than the issue presented by the facts of this case. 
    Here, bear with me. 
    Here is a case in which the railroads ask an order to divert from these water carriers the traffic they're moving. 
    They asked that order on the basis of papers that they have spent months on amassing, interested, tendentious, disputed data. 
    The water carrier is given 15 days to get something on file on Washington, all he can do is to put an issue the events that the railroads have made.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="725.413" stopTime="732.758">

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="778.948" stopTime="803.804">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But these aren't new issues either for you or the railroads, or the ICC. 
    I'd like to repeat, nobody, nobody, I believe is more exactly a finding and easily ascertainable and readable findings of the Commission than I did for nearly 40 years. 
    But that's not – that doesn't determine my view in regard to this case.
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="803.804" stopTime="864.468">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    This case Your Honor here is, one, in which the concession of the necessity of findings in every case is so broad that as it was -- is put, it would include the necessity of findings even in an uncontested case, even in a case where there is no effort on the part of the railroads to do anything but protect traffic which they already have. 
    There -- even where the protest is filed by one who has no profit interest, even where the protest is -- there should be findings as I suppose as to the interest to show why no hearing is granted even then, under this concession. 
    But there -- it is so broad as to include every kind of a Fourth Section proceeding. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="864.468" stopTime="882.476">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I have been instructed by this Court that we need not take concession regarding questions of law by any agency of this Government not even the Solicitor General.

    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    That was not the matter to which I was addressing for myself Your Honor. 
    If I understand. 
    It is true that, that concession as so phrased is one on which the Commission may change its mind. 
    In fact, if the Commission in the subsequent proceeding came to the conclusion that it was erroneously made, then perhaps it would be its duty to change its mind.

    Provided -- but -- well, I suppose they have their views on due process. 
    Unless, they have been confronted with a determination by this Court that according to their concession, today, according to our contention, according to the decisions of two or three judge courts. 
    It is necessary that there should be findings, constitutionally necessary that there should be findings for that necessity of findings is placed by this Court upon fundamental principles of constitutional government. 
    And that quotation Your Honor will recognize as from Panama Refining Company against Ryan and Mahler against Eby. 
    Those are constitutional necessities of findings which they now recognize and which they now say they have not been observing in their procedures for the protection of water carriers, a protection which was enjoined on them by Congress. 
    And surely if by short-term orders they can for many years fail to give to the water carriers protections which are as this Court has said required by fundamental principles of constitutional government in one respect. 
    It should have the consideration of this Court as to whether they have not been giving less than that constitutional protection in the other respect.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'll ask you only one more question, Mr. Hayes. 
    Am I to infer from what you said a minute ago that they failed to make findings only in Section 4 cases that affect water carriers? 
    That they treat water carrier -- Section 4 applications differently from the conventional Section 4 applications as we see in railroads and on shippers?

    Well, Mr. Justice when we speak of the pleadings, this is what I'd like to come to. 
    These -- if I may explain a little as to how the Commission processes these cases because I think that fact will indicate the basis on which the Commission can make this kind of finding in this type of case without holding any evidentiary hearing. 
    The statute -- I'd like to refer just briefly at the outset which is set forth at the pages 2 to 3 of our brief initially makes it unlawful for a common carrier by rail or by water to receive greater transportation for a shorter haul than for a longer haul. 
    But it goes on to provide that the Commission may after investigation in special cases authorize a lesser charge for the longer distance and for the shorter distance providing certain circumstances are met. 
    Now under the Commission's regulations a carrier which is seeking relief from the Fourth Section is required to file a detailed and comprehensive application setting forth a great deal of data relating to these particular criteria specifically whether the proposed shorter long-haul rate is reasonably compensatory, the reasons why they are seeking this relief, and showing if it is made to mean water competition that it is not just potential water competition.

    The notice of the filing of one of these applications is given in the – published in Federal Registry and the parties have 15 days within which to file a protest.

    Now, I have to distinguish two situations. 
    If there is no protest filed and -- let me come back a minute. 
    The Commission has an administrative group called the Fourth Section Board which is a group of free rates specialist within the Commission and when an application is initially filed, it is referred to this Fourth Section Board for preliminary evaluation. 
    If no protest is filed to the application of the expiration of the 15-day period, the Fourth Section Board either itself acts on the application or may refer it to the Commission for action, if there is no protest filed.

    What you're saying is that when an application is made for relief on what -- in many instances, it's a stringent -- well, I know it's properly stringent, restriction that in order to give the Commission that on the face of things, the Commission suspects or believe or prophesize that there will be relief. 
    But it does -- it wants to have ample of time in which to confirm or to verify or to validate its impression, and yet it is sufficiently made out on the surface that they give temporary relief so that they have ample time to determine whether relief should be withdrawn or made permanent, is that it?

    I understand that. 
    Do I understand that you're saying for the Commission, these people do not ask for temporary relief in such mystical or subtle language as they desire?

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    I would say yes Mr. Justice and in this context that the Commission has a statute which provides that if certain conditions are met, it may grant relief from the Fourth Section. 
    And it has frankly from the very beginnings since 1887 recognized that there may be situations in which on the basis of the filings they are able to make a determination that the statutory standards have been met. 
    And however, although they make this determination, they feel they want to have the opportunity for further inquiry.

    I don't know if it is crucial in the case but I -- and when you ask for temporary injunction, ordinarily, the statute which requires that there's a limitation at the time that temporary injunction can be granted and even in states where they provide that temporary injunction can be granted as a rule as I recall it for a limited time.

    This is not a matter that takes place just as a routine thing.

    How could they reject it without seeing the papers, to see what had been done and to have something -- some knowledge of the charges they made that this was part of the continuing practice? 
    How could they do it without looking in what the Commission had before? 
    Whether the railroad raised the question how the Commission acted, how soon it acted, what notice it gave, who it talked with and so forth?

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    I think Mr. Justice because the mere allegation that even though the particular controversy is to the particular orders granted moot, that the agency is following a general practice in other cases of doing the same thing is not enough to create a justiciable controversy. 
    This is what we think this Court has repeatedly held.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your question of mootness, then that gives me an idea I hadn't gathered from you or the other counsel before. 
    Your question of mootness suggests to me that you are not relying on the fairness that the Commission has made it moot by relieving itself of these 14 months of order but that -- they didn't have a right to litigate this at all.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    They did -- they did not but once -- once the railroads -- I -- something that I think has to be made clear that what happened in this case after the railroads had received the temporary authority while the case was pending in Court and I want to emphasize the 10 months elapsed between the time that the Commission granted this temporary authority and the railroad and the barge lines went into Court. 
    After they've gone into Court, the railroads published new tariffs which reduced the short-haul rates. 
    They reduced the short-haul rates to the level of the long-haul rates and this meant that the differential which Section 4 of the Act prohibits, had been eliminated. 
    There was no longer any need for the Fourth Section relief.

    There have been cases in which the application or the complaint was filed in the District Court the day on which the order became effective, a temporary restraining order was sought, and the effective period, effective operation of the Commission's orders has been completely stayed.

    This is nothing novel. 
    This has been going on for many years and it is not only limited to protest by water carriers against the action of rail carriers.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That is correct. 
    But I would like -- Mr. Justice, I would like to emphasize that in this context of Section 4, there has been a great deal of talk about protecting the water carriers against the rail carriers and of course that is one of the purposes that Congress had in mind in the Transportation Act of 1940. 
    But this statute is not so limited. 
    This statute also recognizes that the Commission may grant relief from Section 4 where the statutory criteria are met. 
    If I may put it a little differently, the barge lines have an inherent advantage, they are cheaper and the rate structure must recognize that inherent advantage.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No, I think Mr. Justice, the theory of the damage suit as I understand would be that since the Fourth Section Board are allegedly -- it would be invalid be -- for the lack of findings that in that situation the railroads would be collecting rates illegally. 
    And that would be the theory of the damage suit. 
    Now let me just say this on the damage suit, a point has been raised but the question as to the effect of the Commission's order on any claim for damages is an issue that we think can be fully litigated in the damage suit. 
    And I might mentioned that the issue of the damage suit goes to the question of mootness. 
    Now, this Court has frequently held that you cannot collaterally attack an order of the Commission in a private suit. 
    And the theory of those cases is that under the statute, the only way you can seek such review is by a proceeding broad and a three-judge District Court against the United States. 
    Now, we think that an exception that perhaps properly be made in the narrow case where a proceeding is brought to get such relief but the case becomes moot before there is any decision, because in that situation if you say that the order cannot be collaterally attacked in the damage suit, there is no way to challenge it. 
    But we think that in a sense of the question of whether the chicken or the egg came first, you might say the case is not moot because you have to determine that alternately, you could say, it can be determined in a private suit because the case is moot. 
    And we think the latter is the preferable practice because the possibility of this damage suit, what the issues are, the theory of it are all wholly conjectural and we think that to allow life to be breathed in to a controversy otherwise dead because of the possible -- possibility that the issue may be raised in a damage suit is not enough to cause a deviation from the traditional --

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    In one of the cases it was and one of the cases it wasn't, but I may have to say taken to Court, these problems do not arise solely in the Chicago grain rate. 
    I mean they may come up throughout the country. 
    There have been cases in the Chicago area but --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3694.202" stopTime="3723.658">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    With reference to this particular -- this grain effect, the generic term, these grain commodities affecting this carriage, the claim is that there was a recurring phenomenon sufficient to make out a pattern or has been suggested from debenture system, so that equity properly doesn't close it's eyes and says we're going to guard against this bifurcating it in the future.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3723.658" stopTime="3859.457">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well, there's one case involving this particular traffic which was taken to court immediately and a temporary restraining order was issued and this the case Mr. Hayes referred throughout in the Seventh Circuit. 
    It was subsequently dismissed on the Government's motion. 
    There have been other cases and I want to emphasize as far as this practice is concerned, there had been other cases in which a protest has been filed by a water carrier to a proposed Fourth Section application by the railroads in which the Commission has denied temporary relief. 
    This is not a uniform practice that every time the railroads seek an application for Fourth Section relief and as a protest by the water carriers, and automatically the Commission denies it. 
    And I wanted again to emphasize that if the Commission grants this temporary relief in another case involving different rates and if the appellant barge lines feel they are injured by that they can go right into court immediately. 
    They can go right in and seek judicial review, but of course these rates, this differential which is the sole subject of this suit cannot be automatically reinstituted. 
    The railroads have increased -- I'm sorry, reduced the short-haul rates to the level of the long haul-rates. 
    Now, if the railroads wanted to reinstitute this differential again, they would have to file a whole new application, new protest, different facts, the Commission might or might not grant the temporary relief and the statute I haven't had a chance to refer to this, I just want to say it brief and the statute says after investigation the Commission may grant relief. 
    And Section 2 of the statute specifically says after hearing that the Commission may grant the temporary relief after investigation, but if the rate has been reduced, if the long haul-rate has been reduced to meet water competition, and later on the railroad wants to increase it again, then the Commission may only permit that if after hearing, not after investigation, after hearing, the Commission finds that the increase has not been the result of the elimination of water competition. 
    This is a very significant thing and its --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3859.457" stopTime="3862.477">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, rate conditions change, commodity conditions change --

    Certainly.

speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3878.578" stopTime="3924.878">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    They are. 
    There's no -- I don't think there's a practice in the sense of the Southern Pacific situation. 
    Let me just briefly mention that. 
    That was the Commission order directed to a specific discrimination in one instance, to a specific series of rates that were unreasonable. 
    And the Commission ordered us -- the statute then existed was limited in durations for two years, and by the time the case has got to this Court, the two years have expired. 
    And the Court said those cases were not moot. 
    Those cases were not moot because the practice was capable of repetition. 
    But the practice wasn't the practice of the Commission of generally issuing orders, prohibiting discrimination with the precise thing involved in that case. 
    That is that the same type of discrimination at the expiration of the two years could be resolved.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3924.878" stopTime="3938.116">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's like our labor cases where an unfair labor practice is safeguarded against future repetition by letting injunction, the restraint in the Commission -- the court order stand although the particular thing has been collected.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3938.116" stopTime="3964.636">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Precisely. 
    Whereas in this case -- in this case, the complaint against the repetition of the practices is only not that -- in this particular rate situation there's going to be some injury, but that at some other time and some other case, the Commission may do the same thing and these people maybe injured, and we don't think that is enough to breathe life into this controversy over this particular order.

    Because it was giving them an advantage and depriving him of that natural advantage. 
    The Commission issued an order refusing to suspend those rates in January of 1959?

    Correct.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4000.446" stopTime="4042.214">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And this suit was filed November 16, 1959. 
    I don't know what went on in between, but I'm trying to get at this situation. 
    Then the case was answered, was about to go to trial and the Commission on March 28, 1960 notified the court that the railroad had withdrawn their Section 4 application. 
    And that therefore it was no longer in controversy. 
    At that time, as I understand it, that's put in effect that all rates which are -- were in effect before the new rate, the railroad had filed to which it -- the water carrier's objective, is that right?

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    But the effect of the order in this case was to eliminate the violation of the Fourth -- sir, if I may draw the analogy of the rates that previously has been at this level. 
    Let's assume this is the long rate and this is the short rate and then the long rate was pushed down below the level of the short rate. 
    Now, the effect of the adjustment made by the railroads in 1960 was to push the short-haul down again, so you have the same relationship at a different amount, at different dollar and cent amount.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So then you're understanding of it is, Mr. Hayes, we can find it later, your understanding of it -- and that's what I was trying to find out in that connection, is that while there was one level of a high-rate here and one level of the high-rate here, they said that the relationship between the two rates was wrong and discriminatory. 
    The new rates that were put into effect at the time when the question of mootness arose, retained that old level which as a relationship between the two level, so that they have in effect and in substance by the new order, gotten that which they wanted to reach.

    Mr. Donald M. Tolmie 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    A great deal has been raised as to the factual situation here with the rates. 
    I think it's rather important that this be reviewed. 
    The grain traffic here involved moves from Northern Illinois, origin, to Eastern destinations. 
    The rates on which this traffic moves are made up of two parts, one is a rate into Chicago and the second portion is a reshipping rate from Chicago to the East. 
    Now, prior to the rate reduction of 1959, prior to the reduction here involved, the Western railroads had in effect reduced the rates into Chicago at the same time the water carriers had rates in effect into Chicago. 
    The Eastern railroads had reshipping rates which applied from Chicago to Eastern destinations on practically all traffic, grain traffic originating in Western territory. 
    However, there's one glaring exception to this and that is on grain from Northern Illinois origins arriving at Chicago by rail. 
    These reshipping rates would not apply. 
    Now, the reason for the --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Would you mind repeating -- just the repeat those very words again --
speaker="donald_m_tolmie" startTime="4533.937" stopTime="4548.624">
    Mr. Donald M. Tolmie 
    On grain from Northern Illinois arriving at Chicago by rail, the Eastern railroad's reshipping rates applicable from Chicago to the East would not apply.

    What would apply?

    Mr. Donald M. Tolmie 
    What would apply would be the inbound rail rate plus an amount necessary to equal the local rate which was applicable from Chicago to the East. 
    Now, the purpose of this was that without applying a rate greater than the reshipping rate in Chicago, the railroads would be in violation of the long and short-haul laws.

speaker="donald_m_tolmie" startTime="4621.621" stopTime="4660.621">
    Mr. Donald M. Tolmie 
    Yes sir. 
    On barge traffic originating in Northern Illinois distant to the East which arrives at Chicago by barge, this reshipping rate would apply and still does apply. 
    This was a result of the Mechling Barge Line case where in this Court required that the Chicago to the East railroads cannot lawfully charge more for carrying ex-barge grain than they can charge for carrying ex-lake or ex-rail grain to or from the same locations. 
    Now, the effect --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4660.621" stopTime="4665.323">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I think -- pardon me, but I think we said whether they call it proportional or whatever device is used.
speaker="donald_m_tolmie" startTime="4665.323" stopTime="4682.716">
    Mr. Donald M. Tolmie 
    That is correct. 
    The effect of the rate provisions that is the effect of the availability of the reshipping rate to ex-barge traffic, and the unavailability of this reshipping rate to ex-rail traffic --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4682.716" stopTime="4685.901">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    As I take, it was lower. 
    The reshipping rate (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Donald M. Tolmie 
    Reshipping rate --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4686.524" stopTime="4688.399">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- in what it had to charge with the ex-rail cargoes.
speaker="donald_m_tolmie" startTime="4688.399" stopTime="4877.352">
    Mr. Donald M. Tolmie 
    Yes. 
    If it we're not, the reshipping rate would apply. 
    The effect of this is -- was an exact turnabout of what faced the Commission in the -- or rather faced the Court in the Mechling Barge Line case. 
    The railroads were charging more, the Eastern railroads were charging more on ex-rail traffic to Northern Illinois than they were charging on ex-barge traffic from Northern Illinois. 
    Now, because of the -- because of Section 4 of the Act, the railroads before they could affect any change in this, had to deal with the rates from the intermediate points. 
    That is the local rates from Chicago or the local rates from Indiana to the East. 
    This could be dealt with in two manners. 
    Either to reduce the rates at the intermediate points, the local rates from Chicago to the East, or to seek Fourth Section relief to maintain the high rates of the intermediate points and permit the combination of the rail rate in the Chicago and the reshipping rate out of Chicago to apply to this traffic. 
    What the railroads did elect to do was to secure Fourth Section relief. 
    Their application was filed. 
    All interested parties including the appellants here did file, did have the opportunity and did file protests. 
    In these protests, they stated their views. 
    Now, as a result of the relief granted, the Eastern railroads were able to charge the same for their service from Chicago to the East whether the traffic arrived by barge or grain or rail at Chicago. 
    It should be noted that the same result here could've been reached by reducing the lower rates from Chicago -- by reducing the short-haul rates applicable from Chicago to the East. 
    Now in fact, this is what was ultimately done in March of 1959. 
    The railroads at that time reduced the short-haul rates. 
    By this reduction, any violation or departure from the long and short-haul clause was removed and any relief which the railroads had been granted under the Fourth Section orders here involved, expired. 
    The appellants here have asserted that the reductions in the short-haul rates, that is the rates from Chicago and Indiana points was done solely or was done for the purpose of avoiding a judicial determination of validity of the orders in this case. 
    All I can say, since there's nothing more in the record that this was not the fact, that there were other economic factors which were involved. 
    I see my time is up.

    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    A hearing was scheduled after the order was made that disposed off our rights. 
    Now, their suggestion is that our rights can be disposed off for 14 months without a hearing, “Sentence was first, verdict afterward.” 
    That has not been the procedure of the Commission and there has been no communication to Congress to that effect. 
    I quote from the 1950 report of the Commission, published here in 1951. 
    Frequently, during the past year, we have had occasion to consider either in suspension proceedings of Fourth Section application cases, rail rates reduced to meet water competition. 
    Numerous suspensions of the rates resulted. 
    In some instances after investigation, the reduced rates were found not unreasonable below. 
    In others they were found not justified and required to be cancelled. 
    It has been the general policy of the Commission not to grant any relief from the Fourth Section to meet water competition without full justification of the hearing. 
    This is a new practice. 
    It is not the inveterate practice since 18 -- the first rules of the Commission provided that the first thing that would be done in the Fourth Section application was filed was to set the date for the hearing. 
    That's quoted in the next page on Sharpman (ph) from which I read.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5270.182" stopTime="5277.236">

    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    I can't see how it does and yet that is urged, Your Honor, and seems to have weight. 
    And perhaps it may have some significance that this is a practice which has come in only since 1950. 
    And is not the inveterate practice which Congress has presumed to have sanctioned by its acquiescence at all. 
    Then, it is suggested that we can make a showing to the Commission in opposition to an application, an application which is made in a case which was described from the bench as very difficult and complicated. 
    The case in which we are expected to meet a mass of tendentious data which we dispute as to which we raised contested issues of fact, issues that we can only present on a hearing when? 
    15 days will not give a man an opportunity to what relief against him, to his opponent that takes his property that is going to be in effect for 14 months particularly when that same thing can be done again and again and again. 
    I'm tempted to say a famous quotation, “Indeed it can. 
    Indeed it is.” 
    This complaint says that it is. 
    This complaint is admitted as to its factual averments.

    My recollection is that it was not, and it did not occur until the following July. 
    And I know that it was reopened then. 
    And I'm perfectly clear that there were delays of those hearings over our objection at the instance of the railroad applicants. 
    That is detailed in our complaint, these names, dates, times, and places. 
    That is not what courts of equity do. 
    What courts of equity do is to issue orders, not to change the status quo, based on determination of the contested issues before it. 
    But to maintain the status quo. 
    They issued those orders to maintain the status quo until there was a hearing. 
    This is the diametrical opposite. 
    It changes the status quo before the hearing and even with respect to the maintenance of the status quo, a court of equity as pointed out from the bench will require at the instance of any party that if it has entered an order to maintain the status quo, generally done only under bond to protect damages but if it is entered that order to maintain the status quo, then the parties must proceed promptly to that hearing upon the merits. 
    The maintenance of the status quo protected by bond against damages with the requirement of immediate proceeding, the hearing on the merits, is not the same as this changed the status quo.

speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="5702.731" stopTime="5820.376">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Yes sir. 
    This order of the Commission is now admittedly an unlawful order. 
    It is an order that authorizes the railroads to charge those lower rates for longer hauls that did us this damage. 
    Now, the order is admitted to be unlawful by the Commission, but it is not admitted to be unlawful by the railroads. 
    If we proceed against the railroads whose brief prefers only to Section 8 of the Interstate Commerce Act by the way, is necessary also to read Section 9 giving us the right to proceed in court we choose, if we proceed against the railroads, then they who have not admitted the invalidity of this order will say to the court, these people are trying to recover against us for doing something which an outstanding order of the Commission authorizes us to do, that under the (Inaudible) case is absolutely out of order. 
    The only place that we can get relief against that order so that we may recover our damages is in this direct review. 
    Indeed, the Government substantially conceded that suggesting some sort of an exception for this case, as the court remarked, the court is not a counsel. 
    And the lower court will not concur if the railroads can't help it in that view, and the Commission won't be a party there, the railroads only will. 
    Therefore, it stands as a bar until this Court strikes it down on this direct review to our recovery of damages which were unlawfully authorized and were unlawful rates.

    There is absolutely nothing that this Court has any interest in that I don't have the greatest desire to have this Court have.

    It's alleged in the admitted complaint, the series of four orders just the same like soldiers at rest and just as unlawful form, admittedly unlawful form, that is part of the record, and our complaint thus set forth that we file the protest here alleging that those rates were destructive. 
    It's threatened the extinction of legitimate water competition and were lower than necessary certainly to meet legitimate water competition. 
    And counsel for the Government conceded in his argument that that goes to whether or not it is a reasonably compensatory rail rate. 
    It reasonably it goes two ways, that is before the court and anything more the court desires for me, I desire affirmance.

    Yes. 
    But if we said because it's an illegal -- because we find that is an illegal practice, would that take care of you?

    -- then that does my business with respect both to the findings and the failure to give a hearing before they could argue it.

    But Mr. Hayes, speaking for one member of the Court, that this -- the Solicitor General does not concede that a hearing is required, he protests that claim and so far as I'm advised, he rightly protests that claim.

    I didn't conclude in my assumption in the hearings, he says there must be findings, and whatever you are going to rest those findings on, is another day perhaps, but he agrees this is order is bad. 
    And he says they've stopped the practice. 
    Now then, what would be tried if we remanded this case to the three-judge court? 
    What issue would there be to that effect?
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="6631.963" stopTime="6752.977">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    I don't know. 
    The only issues are concluded so far as they are factual issues by the admissions of the complaint and the showings of the affidavit. 
    There may be some. 
    But Your Honor, may I urge this, the questions involved in the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission are usually continuing and these questions are manifestly continuing and their consideration ought not to be as they might be defeated by short term orders capable of repetition, yet evading review, and at one time, the one party, and at one time the other, have his rights determined without a chance of regress, unless you settle these matters. 
    Then the short term orders will be recurrent. 
    They will be recurrent not because the Solicitor General is in bad faith on the question of the necessity of findings. 
    They will be recurrent because the Commission doesn't agree with it or because he changes his mind or at any case, because this Court has not settled the right of the parties, the question that needs to be solved. 
    And as pointed out from the bench on the other point, the necessity of hearings, that is question B in this case, just as much this case as the question of the necessity of findings. 
    That's that. 
    That's in the complaint. 
    And on that, we think, we are entitled to be heard before it rule is off with our heads.
