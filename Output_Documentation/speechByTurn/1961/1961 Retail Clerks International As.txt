    Mr. Lippman, you may continue your argument.

    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    Thank Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I'd like to point out another basic problem raised by the lower court's opinion. 
    The Court will observe that 301 is not limited to suits between employers and labor unions, but also provides for the enforcement of contracts between labor unions themselves. 
    The court of course disregarded that feature and in no ways seemed to be troubled by that aspect, but to me, it is a clear expression that Congress intended to cover the entire field of labor contracts which in anyway contribute to stability in Labor Affairs and indicated a broad concept must be given to the term labor contracts, and it was not to be a limited application and that it seems to me was quite indicative by the fact that Congress covered contracts between labor unions. 
    Another difficulty with the lower court's opinion, if I haven't said enough, is that the lower court would provide that every suit for the enforcement of a contract would inevitably raise a representation question as to whether or not, the union suing or being sued was in fact the bargaining agent and this --

speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="132.188" stopTime="157.912">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    Well, if the -- if in fact it is a jurisdictional concept as the lower court holds, that you must be the exclusive bargaining agent, then jurisdiction cannot be granted surely by words, saying you are the exclusive bargaining agent. 
    At least this is one of the problems which has raised because you -- mind you, we're talking about --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="157.912" stopTime="158.437">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I have difficulty with it (Inaudible).
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="158.437" stopTime="558.188">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    -- yes. 
    I have difficulty with that too and -- but this is the problem which was raised and every enforcement proceeding could very well become converted into a representation proceeding to term with in fact, and of course this would definitely be in derogation of the Labor Board's processes to exclusively determine representation questions. 
    It seems to me that Congress was not concerned with any of these problems, but Congress was concerned with the idea of placing sanctions and behind agreements which carrying out any national labor policy and this is the way to settle disputes and if the federal court should be open to enforce these agreements and it was -- and it is a broad statute in that respect. 
    The lower court in no respect paid heed to what I believed to be national policy, which I believe is important in determining the scope of 301 questions of jurisdiction. 
    It made no reference to Lincoln Mills or Steelworkers cases. 
    It made no reference to the preamble of the Act. 
    It made no reference to the Norris-LaGuardia provisions and the policies involved there, encouraging the peaceful adjustment of disputes. 
    It made no record -- it made no reference to Title II of the Labor Act which sets up this entire complicated mediation and conciliation machinery, all devised to bring parties together to end labor disputes. 
    Indeed, it did not consider the concept of labor disputes. 
    It was a very narrow -- very narrow approach. 
    I would like -- for the next few minutes to meet and anticipate some of the arguments which I believe my opponent will raise to this Court. 
    When I, as he stated this brief, he takes the position that the stipulation which the parties entered into had a provision in it in which the parties agreed that there was no collective bargaining on an individual store basis and this demonstrates that in fact there was no collective bargaining. 
    Of course, it is conveniently overlooked that the last part of the stipulation provides that nothing herein shall exclude the courts from finding that the strike settlement agreement was in fact a collective bargaining agreement as to why the -- as to why there was any provision, respecting individual collective bargaining, I think is a matter of speculation. 
    The explanation perhaps is this. 
    In fact there was no individual bargaining, they bargained on a multiple employer basis. 
    The strike settlement was not negotiated with any particular individual employer, but was negotiated with several employers. 
    But in any event, I believe it is quite clear that what we have before us is a collective bargaining agreement and I think that the stipulation itself, the very last paragraph there, clearly indicates that nothing in the stipulation was to preclude the courts from finding that this was a collective bargaining agreement. 
    In that respect, I refer to page 41 of the transcript where it is specifically set forth saying, “Nothing in this paragraph is to preclude the courts from finding that the settlement of December 24th, 1958 was a collective bargaining agreement.” 
    Again, I think this whole concept of what is a collective bargaining agreement is not specifically defined and I don't think it has any particular real meaning in terms of the problem before us. 
    The other question which I would like to discuss because I think it was raised in the respondent's brief is the Bernhard-Altmann problem. 
    Respondent believes that what we are seeking here is exclusive bargaining rights because there was appended to the strike settlement agreement, the terms and conditions which were operative in the store and the court in Bernhard-Altmann struck down an exclusive bargaining contract where in fact the union did not represent a majority of the employees. 
    I believe that Bernhard-Altmann is in no respect applicable. 
    One, I refer back to my previous argument of the basic distinction between enforcement of contracts under 301 and unfair labor practices which is another proposition when the Court enforces contracts. 
    It is not adjudicating in any respect, in any matter as an unfair labor practice but enforcing a provision of a contract. 
    Of course in the enforcement of the contract, as this Court has pointed out in Lincoln Mills, once the court assumes jurisdiction or search jurisdiction, it questionably will take in to consideration all aspects of federal law. 
    But Bernhard-Altmann, if it were to arise at all, would arise only after the court has taken jurisdiction in a situation perhaps where we were seeking to enforce the contract as a whole as an exclusive bargaining agent, and not in any situation where we are seeking as matter of -- as matter of an arbitration award to reinstatement of two strikers, and the right of the union representatives to obtain access for the store. 
    I believe the Bernhard-Altmann decision makes it clear that device in that case was exclusive bargaining feature and but for that, the contract of course would have been a members only contract or would have been limited and would not create any difficulty.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Are you going to deal with the respondent's suggestion about this?
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="561.608" stopTime="684.894">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    Yes sir, I'll be happy to. 
    Respondent has suggested this cause is in the moot. 
    It is true, that following the institution of the lawsuit, three local unions who are members of a council, merged with the council into a single local union. 
    They merged and took the name of Local 924 I believe is the name of the new local union. 
    In fact, the local unions maintain their distinct identity as divisions within local 924. 
    They hold separate meetings, they have separate officers, they maintain the same employees, all rights and obligations have been assumed and are carried out, and all obligations are met. 
    What was involved was purely an internal maneuver, an internal operation within the unions where instead of having three local unions affiliated with the council, the council was abolished and the three local unions became one, but they maintain their complete identity. 
    The membership is there. 
    They're operating as separate divisions and in all respects, they are in a position to carry on, and are carrying on all collective bargaining relationships. 
    It is pure -- it was purely an internal operation, and in no respect having any kind of an impact so far as outside relations were concerned. 
    We point out in brief that this Court had met the same problem in number of -- in a number of instances and has overruled any suggestion of mootness. 
    At best, you have a successorship where the successor assumed in all respects all the rights and obligations.

    -- yes sir you did. 
    You reached it on two separate occasions I believe and you also reached it in a prior order in the Steelworker case. 
    You first issued an order and then again the Court reached it in this decision where are discussed it in a footnote, but you're correct Justice Brennan.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="834.622" stopTime="1079.802">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    Yes you do. 
    You are completely correct and I believe so far as Bernhard-Altmann is concerned, I would refer the Court to the Cameron Iron case where then Fifth Circuit where certiorari is denied, where the Court pointed out distinctions between unfair labor practices and the enforcement of contracts, that one does not impinge on the other. 
    If there is, we have any unfair labor practices, the Labor Board still sits -- still sits. 
    There is nothing in a 301 proceeding which in any respect (Inaudible) or divest the Labor Board jurisdiction. 
    For long time, the Labor Board has dealt it within his own policy to permit arbitrations, and whether or not, the Labor Board will take jurisdiction where there's an arbitration award is a matter of its own discretion. 
    It makes up his mind whether or not this arbitration award carries out its policies, or whether or not he believes it took -- it should take a jurisdiction, but the point I make is, that in the 301 action unfair labor practices are not involved but other considerations. 
    I might point out that in any event of course, it's more than 6 months of taking place and so, there could not be any unfair labor practices brought here. 
    I would like to close my main statement with the respondent's brief. 
    Respondent in his main brief seeks (Inaudible) to support the court's holding, that exclusive bargaining recognition is a condition precedent to the court's jurisdiction. 
    Indeed, he poses the question in that light, but when confronted with the members-only argument, but the members only argument if -- if -- if -- if members-only contracts had been forced, cannot be squared in the Court's opinion. 
    He then retreats and accuses -- and accuses us of misreading the Court's opinion and thereby concedes that members-only contracts are enforceable if they can be found to the collective bargaining contracts. 
    I point this out because it -- to me, it appears to be abandonment by counsel of the Court's basic rationale because aside from the rationale, that 301 must be related to other sections of the law requiring exclusive bargaining right for other purposes, the holding that this is not a collective bargaining agreement makes no sense at all because there's no examination of that proposition because plainly any agreement between a labor union and an employer execute on behalf of one or more -- of several employees is within in a broad sense, a collective bargaining agreement is not a -- a terminal part, there is nothing to find. 
    And so, if the court's opinion, lower court's opinion is be given any rationale at all, even though I think a highly disputable one, it must rest on the proposition as I think it spelled out and as it pointed out in its findings of fact that union involved was not the exclusive bargaining agency. 
    I therefore conclude by pointing out that I believe that the courts -- the lower court erred very seriously because I think if allowed to stand, it will create a very serious frustration and impediment to the carrying out of the promise of Lincoln Mills and the Steelworkers cases.

    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, if the Court please? 
    I believe that the outset I should address myself very briefly to the suggestion that mootness that was raised. 
    I would like to say for – as part of an answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question about the Insurance Workers case, that that was covered in the footnote in which the Court said that the light of the ruling on the merits, there is no point in determining then and now the legal status of a predecessor or successor union.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="merrit_w_green" startTime="1135.367" stopTime="1536.980">
    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    -- but that was the footnote you said you -- you weren't going to decide that and it wasn't a pertinent view of your decision on the merits. 
    In this particular situation, this did not come to counsel's intention -- attention until we are practically finished with our brief, and it came to our attention only through receipt of reports filed with the Labor Department by respective labor unions under the Labor Reform Act. 
    Those reports revealed that three labor unions, as they said in their -- as of January 1, 1960, this local merged with Local 128 and 954 and just to count from number 6 to 4 they knew Local 954. 
    The only thing I can say to you about this local -- this new local, this new union I gather from the contents of those reports that I have filed with the government agency is that, this was not a mere change in identity as some of the old cases of where they changed affiliations. 
    The report indicates that after the merge and after the formation of the new union, the members of locals 128 and 633 who are the petitioners here comprised about, if not a little less, but let's say about one-forth of the total membership of the new union. 
    The officers of the new union were not in fact the same officers. 
    There are only two officers of the -- of the combined 633 and 128 petitioners who became minor officers in the new union. 
    I thought that it was incumbent upon me to suggest mootness because of this change in circumstances because if per chance this Court should find that the employers here were parties to a collective bargaining agreement for the purpose of the 301 suit then of course you have to take the other side of the coin and say, “Well, this new union be responsible for all the obligations that 133 -- and 128 and 633 might have had during the course of their existence, including damage actions and things of that nature.” 
    So I found learning that there was a material difference in the make up and the membership of these unions. 
    I thought it was proper and incumbent upon me to bring that to the Court's attention. 
    And one other thing in connection with that, I should bring to the Court's attention that is in connection with Mr. Lippman's statement that a function within the organization with a 954 as they use to. 
    Well now, we are presently and I think I have pointed out in my brief in Lasalle's, one of the respondents here, presently has pending before the NLRB, a petition for election by local 954, not the Lasalle's division of 954 or anything else. 
    If that were true, then the -- these divisions within the union, I would think under this -- this Court's holding would be labor organizations and they too would have to comply with the Reporting Act and so far as were able to determine, there has been no such reports made by labor organizations or so called divisions, department store divisions. 
    The reason of Mr. Lippman's presentation to this point, I feel it's incumbent to not only rearrange, but add to with the facts that he gave, in order that the Court might get a better backdrop against which this very important question can be considered. 
    These -- these two unions and for convenience, I'm just going to call it this union, had for many years as he said, bargained with an organization of multi -- multi-employer organiza -- organization known as Retail Associates Inc., who -- who was the bargaining agent for four downtown Toledo department stores. 
    They were never -- they were just recognized. 
    They were never certified. 
    There has never been in an election among the employees. 
    In 1957 at the conclusion or an impasse was receipt -- was reached in the -- in collective bargaining and the union called a strike against retail associates and part of their strategy was to start (Inaudible) picketing. 
    They picket only on of the four stores, as I say all over in the downtown area of Toledo. 
    They picket Tikis. 
    Tikis immediately within a day withdrew formerly from Retail Associates and entered into direct negotiations with the union and entered into a contract with the union. 
    Three days after that, on November 20, 1957, the strike started on the November 15, three days after Tikis had capitulated, the stores, Retail Associates, filed a petition with the NLRB, asking that the NLRB conduct an election among the employees of the three stores, on a single unit to determine whether or not this union did in fact represent a majority of the employees. 
    In 19 -- April of 1958, that's five month later, the NLRB finally ordered an election in a single -- on a single unit basis of three stores whereupon the unions filed an action in the District Court here in Washington and was successful in getting an injunction restraining the NLRB from conducting an investigation or an election. 
    Now, it's necessary for me to flash back. 
    After the Retail Associates filed the --

    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    I'm going to pick that up right now Mr. Justice Black. 
    After the Retail Associates filed the request for an election on November 20th, three days thereafter, there's no strike -- there's no strike activity in the meantime, on November 23, the unions notified each one of the store that they no longer wanted to bargain on the basis of multi-employer bargaining, but wanted to bargain in fact with each store separately. 
    So that when -- in April, when the NLRB ordered the election on a single unit of the three stores, the basis of the injunction action was that the employees were being deprived of their rights in being forced in the multi-employer bargaining. 
    In fact, they said it this way that employers were permitted to withdraw for multi-employer bargaining, Tikis, the union should have the same right, if they no longer wanted to engage in multi-employer party. 
    And therefore, they were -- the employees were being deprived of their rights to bargain with the rights to have them on the act to bargain separately and they wanted to bargain on a single store basis. 
    Well, the local court – the District Court here in Washington granted a temporary injunction and no appeal was taken because immediately thereafter, the three separate stores or the three stores separately in effect disbanded Retail Associates. 
    And the three stores each filed a petition asking that the NLRB conduct an election among the employees of the respective stores and a unit among the stores only like the union had wanted -- said they wanted to bargain for.

    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    Yes in the lower courts, we were contending that we have the right on the (Inaudible) case to even black out if we are called upon, but -- so you see the November -- at the time that the unions notified the stores, if they wanted to bargain individually that was on November 23rd. 
    As I say, the -- the -- at that time, coincident that same time I believe, they then struck the sales alone. 
    Such (Inaudible) events, it seems to us then made the Lasalle's strike which went on for 13 months, a really, a strike for recognition. 
    This was a -- this was then a demand for individual bargaining and Lasalle's was just saying and did say all the way through well then we -- we will bargain with you and -- after our employees have a vote and has determined that you represent people. 
    Well, that -- those -- for those individual petitions were filed in September. 
    Immediately therefore and even before with the NLRB start to have hearing, the unions again filed a suit in District Court to enjoin the NLRB from holding hearings because in the meantime, they had deliberately permitted their compliance with the non-communist affidavit to elapse and then they went into court and said, “We know -- we haven't filed a non-communist affidavit and therefore we're not entitled to use the facilities of the Board and therefore, the Board -- even on the employer petition cannot hold a hearing.” 
    That's the way the lower courts here refused to grant that injunction and that refusal to grant the injunction to prevent the hearings, was on appeal on December 24th when this matter concluded. 
    At that same, of course, the petitions for election were -- on the individual store basis that they wanted were pending.

    Well, that means you conduct to -- to be so designated to an election.
speaker="merrit_w_green" startTime="1916.524" stopTime="2038.271">
    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    That's right, that's right. 
    Well, as I say in all this time then we have nothing, but more or less at Lasalle's as they strike for recognition and we're saying we will recognize you if you're -- if you let us have an election. 
    In the meantime, the -- I should say this now. 
    The Alliance store people, they may have a strength, nobody's ever allowed to work at the Alliance store. 
    In the meantime, as department stores work and Lasalle's is the biggest department store in Toledo in Christmas 19 -- during the Christmas season of 1957, after notice required to the people and opportunity to hold their jobs, they were replaced, permanently replaced. 
    So, that really the strike in 1958, the big issue then was put our people back to work. 
    The (Inaudible) officers of the Toledo Labor-Management-Citizen's Committee that referred as L-M-C in the -- in our briefs, Monsignor Doyle had suggested that the union was willing to wipe out this whole thing by saying that, “Well, we don't represent these people and we won't claim to represent them until such time as we are certified by an NLRB election. 
    And this whole matter can be settled if you'll take these people back and reemploy them and reinstate them to their positions.” 
    Now, during all of this time, our conversation with L-M-C, the union never participated at any save one which was the night of December 20. 
    This is not on the record and I think that Mr. Lippman would permit me the letter to --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2038.271" stopTime="2039.438">
    Unknown Speaker

speaker="merrit_w_green" startTime="2039.438" stopTime="2109.517">
    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    Alright. 
    Then I go back in my statement that during all the time, the union did not participate in this so called “strike settlement,” the L-M-C talk us solely. 
    Here's what took place then. 
    We said or we put in the writing and gave to the L-M-C what we characterized and have never said anything different, as our understanding, the statement of our understanding of the conditions upon which the union terminated its strike. 
    There has never been any signed piece of paper. 
    There has never been as Mr. Lippman insists, no negotiations between the union and us to terminate the strike. 
    We handed the L-M-C and said now this, this is a statement of understanding and these are the conditions under which we understand this controversy has -- is to be settled.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that on the record?
speaker="merrit_w_green" startTime="2110.441" stopTime="2249.797">
    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    Yes sir and I'll cover just quickly and I can tell you just what it was. 
    Page 9 and 10 of the record, this was appended to the petition. 
    I might say to it because narrow issue here of only whether or not there was an enforceable contract in existence between employer and employee. 
    Some of the matter that was before Judge Clove in the District Court is not here which was stipulated other instruments and so forth, but now here's all of the -- all -- all the statement of understanding is and so we have understanding. 
    We just said we'll reinstate the employees. 
    That's on page number 9. 
    That's number 1 and without any loss of seniority and without any -- any discrimination. 
    And we'll reinstate them to their former position classifications if available. 
    At this point, I want to correct one of things that Mr. Lippman said and that was that this arbitration was over the reinstatement of two workers, that isn't the fact, as I will show you in just a minute. 
    Third paragraph of the statement is just to saying that we understand that there are going to be good employees and number 4 Lasalle's said to L-M-C, “We'll work to UL-M-C that will not reduce any of the pay rates now in effect. 
    We won't do these other things. 
    There'd be no recriminations and so forth. 
    Now, the wage schedules which are the record between 11 and 34, the wage schedules and the so called personnel policy were given to L-M-C at their request so that if something came up in the mean -- later on, they would have an available. 
    There isn't one thing in that wage schedule as the stipulation to which I'm going to refer in a minute shows, none of the wages, none of the working conditions, none of the terms of employment, nothing, nothing in -- in the Exhibit A and B which contained in the record were the result of -- none of those things were the result of negotiations between these labor unions and the employers.

    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    That's right.

    That's right. 
    As the Court will notice that the effect -- these effective dates of this wage -- wage rates was a -- well, one of them went back to November 1, 1957, the other went back September 8 -- September 1 of 1958 and this wasn't handed to the union until December 24, 1958 or to the L-M-C. 
    Well, then in paragraph 5 of the statement of understanding, all we said there that neither the – it's understood that neither the company of the union will interfere with the rights granted to these people under -- under Section 7and 8 of Act. 
    That's just the restatement of their -- of their privileges and then we went out to say that now look, nothing that's contained in this thing as to be construed by anybody that this is recognition of the union as the barging agent for these people, for anybody. 
    And the union was our understanding, sat down -- see it's our understanding that the union will not request barging rights.

    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    You see, we say that 301 require -- permits a filing of a lawsuit for breach contract entered into between the employer and the labor union representing the employees as which was result a collective bargaining. 
    Now, collective bargaining and this I think, if I can read just a few lines here, might distinguish between the so called agreement -- what agreement we're talking about here and the one that's contemplated for enforcement under 301. 
    Section 8 (d) or some -- I think it's 8 (d) of the Act defines collective bargaining in this way, to bargain collectively as a performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confirm good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment for the negotiation of an agreement or any question arising there under and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, such obligation does not compel someone to agree to proposal while making a concession, meaning of course, you still have your right to strike and so forth.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- for a moment, just forget about it. 
    It doesn't exist. 
    Pre 301, if I may draw on personal experiences, in more than one situation like this, I was in the position of [in Monsignor Doyle, a mediator between two parties neither in which the employers would under no circumstances, sit down and bargain with the union. 
    Now, there are two kinds of mediation in such a situation and I've been through both of those. 
    In one in which terms of agreement are made between the employer and the union through the conduit of the mediator, but they have been great hostility, they don't want us to go down the same rule. 
    In the other, and these were cases during the war, no this last war but the first World War and the other where neither would talk to the other, would have anything to do, which was conscious of public responsibility and each side made concession to the representative of the Government not by way of any agreement with the union remotely. 
    That's just what they would resist to the death but they would make concessions to the government mediator. 
    Now, those are two very different situations for the intervention of the mediator and I want to know which this was, forgetting all about 301.

    They appear on page 28. 
    But at the end of that paragraph, you say nothing in this paragraph is to preclude the court from finding that the settlement of December 24, 1958 was a collective bargaining agreement and that's the -- that's the contract that we're talking about.

    We weren't going to stipulate -- the unions weren't going to stipulate itself out of Court and we weren't going to stipulate then in the Court. 
    We were going to say that these were all the facts and we're not -- none of these things were negotiated, but this -- if the court thinks that there was a collective bargaining agreement, because that was the very knob of the jurisdictional question, then of course we're not --

    Yes. 
    Well, I think that's -- that's the -- that's the thing that the court found and I base that primarily on the bargaining or I mean on the legislative history of this whole thing. 
    After all, employers prior to the enactment of 301 as I understood, were suitable for breaches of -- the claim breaches of contracts by unions, or as there was some difficulty if not impossible to sue unions. 
    And the -- as I read the -- about the history -- legislative history, the main purpose of this enactment was to make unions responsible for breaches of contract and then in the -- it seems as though that when they get down to the enactment of the section, the House -- the Senate or the House agreement changed the -- changed the sections to include also breaches of contract between labor unions. 
    And therefore, they had to change their original Senate language from contracts as a result of collective bargaining to make it apply to both types of contracts; to contracts between employers and employees, represent these employees and labor unions. 
    Now --

    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    Well, in view of this Court's case in the Ladies' Garment Workers in 1961 where they struck down a contract which the union tried to keep in existence as a members only contract where this Court said that even though the employer and the union mistakenly entered in -- good faith, entered into a contract as -- as though they were the majority representative that therefore, they violated the Act and the members only aspect of it could not be maintained. 
    Now, I think it --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible)

    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    Yes, that was a -- that's right, where the NLRB made them -- have an election even though in the mean time, they'd become the majority representative. 
    Now, of course, you got to remember here that the effect of your decision to say that this was a some type of an action that this Court had jurisdiction over this type of an agreement would be, in view of the fact that this does not -- this is not restricted to members only; the members of these unions. 
    It would involve the employees of three stores but the effect would be -- that by decree of the Court, you would be bringing in to an existence a labor contract in which these unions had the right to represent all of the employees even though they have admitted that they were not -- the representative of the majority. 
    You see, that's really what's in the knob, what will happen?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4397.353" stopTime="4413.776">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, what would be your answer is yes, but the only (Inaudible) under 301 is the agreement that an employer in a labor organization in fact representing an (Inaudible) interrogating an employee, therefore it's under recognition of the suit.
speaker="merrit_w_green" startTime="4413.776" stopTime="4454.297">
    Mr. Merrit W. Green 
    It may be possible as Justice Douglas pointed out on his dissent under the Ladies Garment Workers for an employer and employee to enter into a members only contract so long as it doesn't extend privileges to that union to do things that -- that only majority representatives to do. 
    Now, in this case of course, this action was not brought out on the base of this members only contract or that they were bringing the action only for them, that was nothing the pleadings on that you see.

    That's right, but what I'm saying is that if the Court held that they did have the -- this right, it would extend to the employees of all three of these stores because it's the -- the so called statement of understanding does not limit it to only their members, you see. 
    And what you would be doing is by court decree bringing in to existence a collective bargaining contract where this union would have a right to -- to negotiate or arbitrate, to do all these things on behalf of these -- these people and bring suits under 301 and we don't believe that is really what -- was within the contemplation of the labor policy.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Green, before you sit down, I'd like to ask you this question. 
    Before I reverse the judge; I'd like to know what he's decided. 
    I thought that Judge Kloeb had ruled and that's the opinion on -- in fact that's the opinion of Court of Appeals of course, by adoption if it were. 
    I thought he had ruled that the 301, this is not -- does not come within enforcement under 301 because 301 has a specialized conception of what is a collective bargaining contract. 
    And I have read very carefully, I think I can say very carefully; reread and Judge Kloeb's opinion and I am less in doubt whether that's what he's decided at least there are (Inaudible) through findings that he decided that 301 requires (Inaudible) of a particular kind of a contract. 
    Can I call your attention to three items which -- out of which -- which to deal them together all into one, of the mere cloud as to what he's really decided. 
    On page 46 in the 2nd open paragraph, is that --

    346 of the record. 
    He displayed his position, etcetera that in these statements, these statements of plaintiffs constitute a contract, at least a contract for the benefit of plaintiffs, and that it is there for such a contract as it's contemplated by Section 301.” 
    Constituted contract, now that's, at least, the contract for the benefit of plaintiffs. 
    The implication is that might have been a contract between him and Monsignor Doyle's Committee. 
    As I turn to page 47, next to the last paragraph, the last sentence, the agreement that we are here considering is a strike settlement agreement which we cannot construe as having been entered into for the benefit of plaintiffs and that looks to me like --

    Now thirdly, next to the last full paragraph on page 48, that none of the factors and so on which gives substance rights of the unions to bring actions on the Section of 301 are present in this case and particularly a contract between plaintiffs and defendants. 
    But I can't imagine anybody would contend it if there's no contract between employers and employees, you have a suit, the basis for suit under 301. 
    I don't suppose anybody would contend that, at least I don't tend they suggested yet, that is the (Inaudible) case, but is it particularly the contract of being plaintiff and defendant so that those three items together make me -- leave me in doubt as to what it is that Judge Kloeb really has decided.

    Unknown Speaker 
    What page?
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="5071.683" stopTime="5107.699">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    This is found on page 47, the second paragraph in the bottom. 
    We believe that the Act enlarging the authority in any District Court of the United States contemplates such authority to be exercised where there's been a violation of a contract that had been entered into between employer and a labor organization representing employees and (Inaudible) effect in Congress and it thereby contemplates a collective bargaining agreement. 
    The agreement that we are here considering is a strike settling of the agreement which we could --

    And then the Court --

    -- the District Court decided.

    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5114.293" stopTime="5127.513">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They -- they -- they recognized or they said that they understood that there was a contract involved here, I'm now looking at page 52. 
    They said on their brief per curium that the contract here involved is not a collective bargaining agreement between so on.
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="5127.513" stopTime="5127.893">

    But they did imply there was a contract then they went on to say that the District Court, their view was correct and thinking that only collecting bargaining agreements were subject to 301.
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="5136.790" stopTime="5147.670">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    Yes. 
    And you'll find throughout the opinion of the lower court recognition, at the same time sir, there are the matters you pointed out which just don't make a consistent picture.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5147.670" stopTime="5176.158">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And what he says in that sentence on page 47. 
    The agreement that we are here considering is a strike settlement. 
    I can assure you Mr. Lippman I've made -- I was a counsel for a Commission and acted for it and made a number of strike settlements so denominated in the press and by everybody else and then you report to the President, there were strike settlements but under no circumstances where the enforceable contracts between the parties.
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="5176.158" stopTime="5181.505">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    Yes. 
    Let me then refer you to another section of lower court's opinion sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5181.505" stopTime="5189.108">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well it may be -- I'm not saying that -- I'm not saying any of these things. 
    I'm not saying that he was right in saying that there was no contract.
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="5189.108" stopTime="5189.841">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    I appreciate that sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5189.841" stopTime="5214.450">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not saying he was right that if there was a contract, it was not the kind of a contract under 301. 
    I'm not saying either of those things. 
    I just -- I do think there are distinctions between saying that although you've got an enforceable contract either directly enforceable as between the parties or because the third party beneficiary, you do not come within 301. 
    Those are very different questions.
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="5214.450" stopTime="5246.550">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    I think that the lower court and the upper court both recognized that they have contracts. 
    Again, I refer you to page 46 of the lower court's opinion where the lower court says and the study of the legislative background of the act, and certain decisions with that, we have examined, we are of the opinion that the strike settlement, that was concluded on December 24, 1958 is not such a contract, so he first -- the strike settlement as a contract.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5246.550" stopTime="5250.738">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Of course he said (Inaudible)

    I appreciate, it was --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5251.648" stopTime="5257.232">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible) no one presents in this case particularly of contract between plaintiffs and defendants on page 48.
speaker="sg_lippman" startTime="5257.232" stopTime="5401.813">
    Mr. S.g. Lippman 
    I recognize there is that loose language but I think being read as a whole, I think he's referring to collective bargaining agreements, that great deal of colloquy occurred between counsel and the court as to whether or not we have a contract. 
    I would like to refer to the Court, and I think Mr. Justice Black didn't make reference to it but I would fill up my duty to call the Court's attention to it, on page 8 which is a letter of transmittal in which the strikes settlement itself was appended and the employer says, the conditions to be formed and met by us are of course subject to and conditioned upon the receipt by your organization of guarantees from the respective labor organizations to make the principles enumerate err completely effective. 
    Now, I refer the Court to page 30, in which the union in writing accepts it, and this is the letter to Monsignor Doyle and it also partly answers Justice Frankfurter's question as to what kind of mediation we have. 
    We had a mediator who moved between hotels, transmitting and carrying messages and seeking to reach an agreement. 
    We say there in the -- we acknowledge of the transmittal from the employer to him and the stipulations. 
    Then we say we here with agree to -- to the conditions and guarantees of the statement of understanding, attached exhibits of subject to proof reading to assure conformity with applicable provisions of the expired contract in November 15, 1957 offer through the L-M-C. 
    Actually, the wages, hours and working conditions appended where the wages, hours and working conditions of the expired contract plus additional officer -- plus additional offers which have been made through the L-M-C and so we accepted all these things subject to it proofreading. 
    Then we say we agree that the success of the undertaking and stability of labor relations depend upon the good faith of the parties, such assurance is a grant on our behalf. 
    I might point out, get down to the very --
