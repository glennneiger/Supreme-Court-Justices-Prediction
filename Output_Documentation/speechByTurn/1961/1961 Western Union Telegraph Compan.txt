Western Union Telegraph Company v. Pennsylvania
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="33.231">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 15, Western Union Telegraph Company, Appellant, versus Pennsylvania, by Sidney Gottlieb, Escheator. 
    Mr. Buchanan, you may proceed now.
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="33.231" stopTime="214.806">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This appeal is from the affirmance by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of a decree declaring the escheat to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of the amounts of Western Union telegraphic money orders which originated at office in Pennsylvania. 
    The Western Union Telegraph Company, the appellant, asserts that the Pennsylvania escheat law as here applied is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amend -- the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it escheats these amounts with which the Pennsylvania has no sufficient contacts without sufficient notice and without giving Western Union the protection to which it is entitled or should be entitled under the Constitution against liability to others for the same amounts. 
    Western Union is a New York corporation with its principal office in New York City. 
    It has thousands of offices in the 48 states and District of Columbia where it is registered to do business. 
    It's not registered in Alaska or Hawaii. 
    Its interstate business is regulated by the interstate -- by the Federal Communications Commission, formerly by the Intestate Commerce Commission. 
    It has been continuously regulated. 
    A telegraphic money order transaction is designed to cause a credit for payment of money to be telegraphed from the office of origin to a payee at another office. 
    The sender -- sender of the money order goes into Western Union office and fills out an application form and pays the principal amount plus the tolls and gets a receipt. 
    A message is then sent from the office of origin to the Western Union office closest to the designated payee who is often called the sendee. 
    This message directs the second office, the office of destination to make payments to the designated sendee by negotiable draft the file tariffs of the -- this telegraph company call for this form of payment. 
    The office of destination gets to in touch with the sendee.He is called in and given a negotiable draft. 
    If he wants cash immediately, he can endorse that draft and in fact in return for currency. 
    But very often, because this draft is in some ways preferable to cash, he walks out of the office with the draft.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And who's the drawee of the draft, who is he?
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="217.352" stopTime="233.053">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    The drafts are drawn on banks called fiscal agents and sub-fiscal agents of Western Union but they're just banks in various cities throughout the United States but none of those cities are in Pennsylvania.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="233.053" stopTime="235.697">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Western Union is drawer?

    Western Union draws against its account at those banks --

    The sendee is named as the payee --

    Normally --
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="252.725" stopTime="259.223">

    It's a check.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    If it's a draft in any event, it's accepted before it's delivered.

    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    It is an absolute obligation of Western Union.

    No I'm sorry, Your Honor. 
    It is drawn against the Western Union's account at the bank. 
    It is a draft on the bank but those bank -- in those banks, balances are maintained.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    It's an effective check, right?

    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    It's a check. 
    It's referred in the book of rules of Tariffs as a draft, that's why I find myself calling of that. 
    But it is payable at a particular bank. 
    And it is also payable to order is negotiable.

    Are you in effect, send a Western Union here is -- is your client is a stakeholder and you don't care to whom you're paid as long as you're protected?
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="331.613" stopTime="394.508">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    We do want to be protected, Your Honor, and in our position in this case is this Pennsylvania decree cannot protect us. 
    First of all, it can't protect us under the Full Faith of the Credit Clause and it can't protect us even if this Court said, “Oh yes, Full Faith of the Credit Clause would protect you here.” 
    It can't protect us against the continual harassments that we would have and people that might not take that as the last word. 
    The trouble is that this is such a multistate transaction; anyone of these money order transactions can involve possible claims of three or four states. 
    Therefore, a wise rule is badly needed to save the courts and litigants and my clients against multiple litigation if not multiple liability.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does any other state ever brought any actions to escheat this money?

    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    Other states have brought actions or made claims, some of them under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act don't bring actions, they just say give us a return, give a report and pay the money in, and as I will show later, some of those are quite duplicative as of the same moment of escheat. 
    Just very confusing to the owner of the escheated.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="428.891" stopTime="436.730">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Of course, well do you -- do you concede that -- in these circumstances, some state couldn't cheat the money?

    They only escheat after 15 years.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, but I mean --
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="459.011" stopTime="464.890">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    Therefore, they're sometimes too late. 
    Others take this in a shorter period of three years.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="464.890" stopTime="477.317">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But has New York attempted to escheat the money on all of your -- all your transactions throughout the country because you are incorporated in New York?
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="477.317" stopTime="480.162">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    No it does not appear in the record, but that is the fact, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="480.162" stopTime="480.880">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That is the fact.
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="480.880" stopTime="522.722">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    That is the fact. 
    New York exerts that he is entitled to all of these unclaimed property. 
    Before I -- made statement of facts, I'd like to make it perfectly clear, I'm not sure that I made it absolutely clear in answer to Mr. Justice Douglas' question that though we cannot under the Pennsylvania procedure be in the position of the stakeholder in this case, we think we should in all equity and fairness be a stakeholder and would want to be a stakeholder. 
    Some state is entitled to all of the funds that we're talking about here.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="522.722" stopTime="526.998">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Why can you not distinguish?
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="526.998" stopTime="589.976">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    Because Pennsylvania has no provision for New York for instance which has already brought suit for at least part of the particular funds back of the particular drafts involved in this Pennsylvania case. 
    There's no provision for New York to come into the Pennsylvania proceeding even if New York wanted to and maybe they would choose that's well we'd like two bites out of cherry and if you lose to Pennsylvania, you'll have lost under a decree that doesn't bind us and we'll come in again. 
    The Assistant Attorney General of New York is here and I'm very happy to have given a quarter of my time to her because I think that when you hear her argue, you will see that New York is out to take these funds under its custodial statute. 
    It's not -- that the true escheat statue -- statute but it's the equivalent so far as we're concerned.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="589.976" stopTime="616.084">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, I think this raise was to the Pennsylvania Court and would substitute service was then had upon the creditor, would that not bind New York?
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="616.084" stopTime="649.034">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    With good seizure of the raise and good fair notice, an opportunity to come into courts, it would bind New York. 
    But this decree that we're dealing from is not going to convince New York that it is bound. 
    Hence, I am afraid that unless this Court makes it very clear one way or the other, other states will not feel themselves bound.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="649.034" stopTime="664.054">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You made one statement that I'm not sure I quite understood, maybe I understood it wrong. 
    Did you say that one state is bound under all circumstances to be entitled to all these funds?
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="664.054" stopTime="702.060">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    The very nature of escheat is that it takes 100% of funds. 
    It's one or another. 
    Now, whether the state entitled to escheat, is entitled by mere priority regardless of contacts which is Pennsylvania's position here or whether the state that is entitled is the domiciliary state or some other state, only one state can take the funds. 
    If more than one can take it, we have been denied due process by a multiple taking.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well I'm not take -- talking about making you pay it, two or three or four or five, did I understand you to say that's under the law, one state is entitled in every dollar of this fund, one or another state is entitled to every dollar of this fund.
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="721.243" stopTime="722.552">

    No, some of these funds might be proven to be new to the State of Nevada or I don't think they have a current escheat statute or say, California.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    How much -- or is this a combination? 
    As I understand it, if I go to into a Western Union office in Pennsylvania and I ask you to send my son at college $25, but that's too low, but if I do, there's a relationship established in that. 
    If you don't deliver to my son the $25, I'm entitled a refund of it, am I not?

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="823.832" stopTime="828.155">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    Though I wondered whether Your Honor's son would give you the opportunity with refund, the majority -- the great majority of the monies involved here are cases of outstanding negotiable drafts payable to the sendees.

    Whether the relationship is between you -- the Western Union and the father by reason the father's right to refund or between Western Union and the son by reason of the outstanding draft, where it be the son will be to holder of that I guess it's negotiable draft. 
    Relationship was one as far as Western Union is concerned of debtor to creditor.
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="906.092" stopTime="912.136">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    Debtor to creditor, evidenced by draft in almost all the cases -- in some of the cases.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="912.136" stopTime="917.722">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So what's escheated here is what? 
    The property of the creditors and not of the Western Union's?
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="917.722" stopTime="920.415">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    It's the interest of the creditor.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="920.415" stopTime="921.869">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And not of Western Union?
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="921.869" stopTime="930.246">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    No it's -- it's an obligation of Western Union but it's the interest in that obligation which is escheated.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="930.246" stopTime="935.497">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I guess that's negotiable (Inaudible)

    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    The typical case you might say of those that are involved here is an out of state sendee or is endorsee where there is a negotiable draft outstanding.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="950.991" stopTime="960.394">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So that in that sense the property interest in the sense of the creditor is owned not by anybody in Pennsylvania but outside of Pennsylvania.
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="960.394" stopTime="965.982">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    And it's payable outside Pennsylvania under the negotiable instrument --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now is there any -- is there any Pennsylvania's statute of limitations which makes the claim, whether it's claim for refund or the claim presented by the draft barred by that.
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="980.111" stopTime="1003.736">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    The Pennsylvania in its escheat does not recognize the statute of limitations. 
    We did plead it here as a protection to those better entitled to these funds but we have not pressed that. 
    As a matter of fact, Western Union has not -- has never taken that as its personal defense in a suit on one of these obligations.

    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    Western Union as a matter of fact pays stale drafts, old obligations. 
    There's one in the record here that we paid off while this was pending and while Pennsylvania was claiming it dating back to 1935. 
    That was paid in New York. 
    And -- Pennsylvania cannot, though they have tried in their brief, say to us, “You have to plead the statute of limitations and therefore you're protected." 
    We -- the only thing that Pennsylvania can furnish us to satisfy the Constitution when they take this is the right to plead that there has been a valid escheat decree which bars all others. 
    Otherwise, there is a double taking or the possibility of a double taking which is a violation of due process.

    I take it, you're starting you -- your contention from where the decision of this Court have left you, is that right?

    That is exactly right, Your Honor.

speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="1140.379" stopTime="1231.204">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    The decisions of this Court leave us a fairly narrow scope. 
    The decisions of this Court have been based. 
    I say this is the rationale though they haven't been based in so many works on a domiciliary hold on the property taken. 
    The bank deposit case is obviously inclined against United States which was deposits in the U.S. Marshals office in Philadelphia taken by Pennsylvania because the -- those funds were held in Pennsylvania by what is -- for those purposes of Pennsylvania Court. 
    In Connecticut Mutual against Moore, the Connecticut Mutual was a foreign life insurance corporation though its -- its regulated status and its method of doing business under the supervision of the New York Insurance Commissioner in effect as to those policies made it the same as the New York Corporation. 
    But there, the only thing that this Court held was that where you have a New York insured and New York beneficiary and a policy issued in New York, New York can take the proceeds.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1231.204" stopTime="1239.516">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If there's -- if there has been no change of residence prior to maturity of policy by debt.
speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="1239.516" stopTime="1248.811">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    Exactly, that has to be the situation at the date of the escheat or the date maturity of the policy.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1248.811" stopTime="1257.385">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But in the New York in the insurance case we couldn't tell that is -- that's what bothers some of us, we couldn't tell what -- what the domicile of the beneficiaries.

speaker="john_g_buchanan_jr" startTime="1280.607" stopTime="1315.659">
    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    The domiciliary hold, Standard Oil of course, that's the most recent; it was a case of domiciliary corporation. 
    They said, “If it's the money you owe, give us your stock which is located at the registered office of the -- in the domiciliary state." 
    The stock is much closer than anything else to the corporate heart. 
    Give us its stock in these -- under dividend checks because you are a domiciliary state and that is the holding.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well Mr. Buchanan will this be it, if Pennsylvania may despise the interest of the creditor and in that way require you to pay your obligation owing the creditor to the State of Pennsylvania. 
    You want to be protected against some other state with the creditor actually resides that.

    Tell me you're saying well now that property -- Pennsylvania can't displace a New Jersey creditor by just picking up Western Union's obligation to New Jersey, if anyone may do that, New Jersey's got to be it or --

    Mr. John G. Buchanan, Jr. 
    -- or New York, yes. 
    The -- if Pennsylvania by simply saying, “Well, we can serve your registered agent and therefore, we have power to seize the raise that is a hard thing to seize simply by service. 
    Well then, anyone of 48 states or the District of Columbia that has an escheat or custodial statute can do the same thing. 
    And as I indicated before lunch, there are some of the custodial statutes under the Uniform Act where the period of dormancy, the period for escheat is exactly seven years, the date of escheats and presumably the moment of escheat is exactly the same day in each year. 
    So that four or five states by their legislative action, escheat the same amounts could escheat, the same amounts due from all over the country, simply because they can get jurisdiction of Western Union in that state. 
    Then which one of four or five that have the identical statute is the escheator? 
    You'd have an automatic quadruple or quintuple escheat or taking into custody at the same moment. 
    The very theory of escheat is that a court decree only declares escheat that has already taken place, but if Pennsylvania by speedy action, runs through its own courts and gets a final decree and if therefore able to cut off the claims of four or five other states, that's we're doing the same thing but didn't get there as fast, then has Pennsylvania's action nullify the escheats which had already occurred in this other cases just through the action of its courts?

    The monies that are paid on these unclaimed amounts and were represented mainly be negotiable drafts, eventually find their way back into the treasury in New York of the Western Union Company and that after two years under Federal Communications Commission regulations, these unpaid amounts have to be taken in as income. 
    They thus enter into the profit-loss statement and into the regulated rate structuring.

    Almost all, Your Honor.

   Argument of Ruth Kessler Toch
speaker="ruth_kessler_toch" startTime="2604.035" stopTime="2958.790">
    Ms. Ruth Kessler Toch 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    New York has filed here as amicus curiae in the Court being given permission to argue. 
    As amicus curiae asking that the Court not decide this appeal on consideration only of Pennsylvania's contention that it has jurisdiction of these obligations by virtue of the amenability to process of Western Union, 48 states, at least, United States can make that statement. 
    Nor on consideration only of the single contact that Pennsylvania has with these transactions. 
    Now, whether we say situs in the traditional way or contact as that term has been used in the fairly recent escheat case in decisions, opinions by this Court. 
    Now, I should say that in all escheat cases, the holder has no interest. 
    It is the key, is or it is the holder, banks, life insurance and so on. 
    The interest is by the owner who is unknown or cannot be found. 
    Now, we ask the Court that if you -- the whole of this transactions, the kind of transactions these are, with virtually every one of them passing through several states and to evaluate Pennsylvania's claim in that plight. 
    Now, we ask the Court to evaluate the claim of the State of New York which in this case is the state of incorporation and the state where the principal office of the obligor is located and where the obligation is -- ultimately has its place as Mr. Buchanan has described it. 
    Now, obviously, in these multistate transactions, Western Union having its offices and thousands of offices in the 48 states, in other words, not just one office but thousands of them, it would be difficult of course, to bring all of the states that could possibly have a claim before the Court. 
    We submit that Pennsylvania in this case is representative of all the other states which have some contact with these transactions as contrasted with New York State in this case because the step that may take place in anyone of these several states is no more essential in the transactions than the step which may take place in another state. 
    And accordingly, the contact again of anyone said state would not be greater than a contact of another. 
    This would include Pennsylvania and perhaps Pennsylvania's claim is a great and its contact is a great deal less than that of, for example, the state where the sendee has been or where he is resident. 
    And so we asked the Court to weigh as alternative to the number of states with minor and equal in value and degree, at the most, the ultimate and essential contacts of the principal office of Western Union with the transactions and therefore, of the state of the principal office of Western Union, New York State. 
    Now, Pennsylvania, in its brief, has sent that New York's position in this case is and in its statutes is different from the position we took in the Connecticut Mutual case. 
    And perhaps in my comment on that, I will also answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question of where Connecticut Mutual and Standard Oil leaves us or states which are before the Court on the question of escheat. 
    I think our position is in harmony with the position we took in Western -- in Connecticut Mutual and also that where those cases leave us is that the factors in one kind of transaction point to one state as having the jurisdiction, the dominant contacts and in another transaction, another kind of transaction that another state has it. 
    Now, in the Standard Oil --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Ms. Kessler Toch, I wonder if --

    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2961.921" stopTime="2985.971">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If we don't use contacts in different senses here now, when we're determining what the dominant contacts should be, what contacts are we talking about? 
    The contacts with the company or are we talking about the contacts with the person to whom who owes -- to whom the money is owed?
speaker="ruth_kessler_toch" startTime="2985.971" stopTime="2993.107">

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, now that's -- that's just what I want to ask and why -- why should it be that way in this escheat matter, I can see if there was contest between the person to whom the money was to be paid and the person who is to pay, that perhaps the contacts of the person who is to pay would be the appropriate one, but here we're not doing that. 
    Here the company has no interest in this money at all and the -- and the only person who's interested in it would be the person who's entitled payment.
speaker="ruth_kessler_toch" startTime="3033.682" stopTime="3056.590">
    Ms. Ruth Kessler Toch 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    But in escheat, as I said, the money is taken by the state from the holder of it. 
    That is where it is, it's the holder of it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3056.590" stopTime="3077.978">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I'm not so sure -- I could agree to that because the -- if the Western Union and takes money in Pennsylvania to send to a person in another part of Pennsylvania, I don't know that we necessarily need to say that -- that they hold it in New York.

    I should state that that was that -- perhaps Mr. Buchanan can answer a little more definitely on that one, he has his five minute because I didn't study it but I should also say two things, that -- notices would have to go from Pennsylvania also to the payees -- the sendees all over the United States and moreover, New York a custodial statute so that at any time when the sendee discovers at any time that this money has gone to the State of New York, always comes to the State of New York to control and gives them the money and that is the daily practice.

    In the few minutes that I have left, I think that the -- we took the position in Connecticut Mutual and the brief is on file in this Court. 
    We said that New York there seeks only policies written by the branches of the foreign companies on New York ensures and delivered in New York. 
    And that is the core of the court's holding; it is the domiciliary tie, the tie of residence. 
    Now, those where the essential factors in this insurance policies, so that the prinicipal office aspect of it was subordinate. 
    But in this case, Pennsylvania does not rely on residence of any one. 
    They don't know the residence of the sendees, they don't know the residence of the senders and certainly Western Union is not a resident. 
    And New York State, the only domicile that we know, both by registration and by the principal office is in New York State. 
    Now, as to life insurance since then, we have these giant insurance companies in New York State, Metropolitan New York by this showing.But we only escheat the unclaimed funds on policy written in New York, delivered New York and the lives of New York residents by our own domestic insurance companies. 
    Their branches outside New York in Pennsylvania, anywhere, we do not touch them. 
    And finally as far as our legislation is concerned, in 1953 we added in the -- as subject to escheat to our statute Section 501 involving securities. 
    And there, we said, that we take only the unclaimed securities of domestic corporations owed to residents of New York State. 
    So I think that our position is consistent, I think that our position is rather temperate, it is a custodial statute and so we ask that for these transactions is to court reverse Pennsylvania, reject Pennsylvania's claim and approve New York's claim.

   Argument of A. Jere Creskoff
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="3608.468" stopTime="3790.558">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Perhaps I will first endeavored to answer Mrs. Toch because she spoke last and that is always most clearly in mind. 
    I have no objection to the fact but the fact is that in filing its petition before this Court, the State of New York seemed to rest its application on the question of the domicile of the corporation, the respondent in this case. 
    However, the brief filed by the State of New York seems to depart from that position and argues rather on contacts. 
    Now, it seems to me that in the contents of the brief, New York leans over toward the position taken by Pennsylvania and depends on contacts rather than the mere fact of domicile of the corporation. 
    Now, this of course must necessarily be so because in the sense, it was New York in the decision of its appellate court by its legislature on the decision in Connecticut Life versus Moore in 297 New York, that got away from the question of the domicile of better corporation and rest it in a contacts, the so-called superior contacts that New York had with the insurance policy stoned by foreign insurance companies, domesticated in New York and so to residents of New York. 
    It's true that when that case reached this Court, this Court modified the cases of escheat or to taking under its custodial law various classes of policies that might have troubled this Court such as the residence of the beneficiary and other factors that were then involved but it was New York itself that in that series of cases departed from the principle that is a insignificant fact that a corporation has its domicile in one place or another. 
    Now, this business we've heard about the unseemly raise of the states for the escheat of funds, just isn't held up by the facts. 
    It so happens when my hair was a lot darker even then day, I argued the original client case in this Court way back in the 303 U.S. 20 some years have passed from that day and I leave it to this Court to answer for itself how many us chief cases have reached this Court in those 20 some years. 
    Obviously, very few and obviously always when someone thought that there was a special point involved that hadn't been decided.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3790.558" stopTime="3812.476">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let me ask you before this last statement the special point involved.Using this Court, can you suggest that this Court could affirm the judgment of your Supreme Court by just citing the insurance cases in the case?
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="3812.476" stopTime="3839.114">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    No I wouldn't come go completely that far for the simple reason that there has been raised in this case by the appellant, the question of this threats that were issued. 
    I don't know exactly what controlled this Court's decision to know its probable jurisdiction in this case but we have in our discussions in Pennsylvania assumed it was that new element of the graft. 
    Although --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3839.114" stopTime="3859.897">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, but the fact in the -- do you think the fact -- the fact that are now before us common within the -- in the decision, I don't mean the rationale, I don't mean the philosophy but I mean the circumstances which were relied on in the opinions of the Court for sustaining the claim of escheat by state.
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="3859.897" stopTime="3875.220">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    I do indeed. 
    I think in the case of Standard Oil and New Jersey and in the Connecticut and Moore cases, there is sufficient law without further for this Court to recognize the degree of the Pennsylvania Court in this particular case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3875.220" stopTime="3880.444">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, wasn't that a great emphasis on the domiciliary place of the business?
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="3880.444" stopTime="3888.119">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    Not in the Connecticut case, there was emphasis of it but the Court departed from the significance domicile.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I know that talk about the contacts.
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="3890.238" stopTime="3959.695">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    It talked about substantial contacts and in my opinion, may I say that there was a lot to the theory of substantial contacts and when we examined what contacts we are talking about as the Chief Justice started to inquire, we can perhaps clarify just what the substantial contacts is and what the affirmable contacts are that other states might touch upon a fund and then this point let me say that I can't conceive of any single escheat situation where any of that more than two states can possibly be involved and probably when a situation is analyzed in each particular case just one state is surely involved. 
    Now, I wonder if it was made clear to the Court in the answer to the Chief Justice's question, I know there was no one intention not to make it clear but I want to leave it crystalline clear that not one cent of the funds covered by the Pennsylvania escheat decree have been the subject of the claim of any of state including New York. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3959.695" stopTime="3980.617">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is that proof that it's that -- that (Inaudible) -- no, I'm sure that that involved -- the implication is, if they had it, they wouldn't have gone after it. 
    Does that mean that it's a matter of law that issues to Minnesota and South Dakota and Florida wouldn't give rise to legitimate claim of contacts?
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="3980.617" stopTime="4006.290">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    I think not for the following reasons because I think that what we're talking about here, the most substantial contact of all can only be in the state where the raise, when the obligation was created, now I can conceive of the shifting locale of that obligation once created and that obligation that's being escheated --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4006.290" stopTime="4028.496">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- (Voice Overlap) -- I don't follow the necessity of such monistic doctrine. 
    If I issue a check in one's states, which gets to the another state and the whole of it, as a negotiable instrument funds which he can claim in the courts of that state and every state, why do you cut it all off we say that the issuing place is the only contact place.
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="4028.496" stopTime="4087.615">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    No I said when you judge this substantiality of contacts that give a state and perhaps the only other state a right to proceed. 
    That is a very substantial contact, now let me answer something on the question of these drafts and these payees. 
    That very question was before the New Jersey Court of the Standard Oil case. 
    It's true that the same question was not pressed when that case reached this Court but if the Court will keep in mind that Mr. Buchanan agree that another name for these drafts we talked about is checks and that checks in payment of dividends that's been issued in the thousands and that that question was disposed by the New Jersey Supreme Court in the Standard Oil case, those checks too might have been negotiated; those checks to may have found their place in the hands of citizens or residents in other states or other foreign countries.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, may I suggest though Mr. Creskoff isn't there at least has difference that the sender comes into a Pennsylvania office of Western Union as an agreement from the Western Union, that if show order its office in Connecticut make a payment of X dollars to somebody in Connecticut. 
    Since a draft issued from the Connecticut office, the obligation with Western Union undertook in Pennsylvania present and order to it's Connecticut office which discharged and the transaction which involved in what's now an outstanding draft originated not in Pennsylvania, in that sense, but in Connecticut whereas the dividend shops which we're speaking of in the New Jersey case and perhaps my memory fails me but I thought that those went out on the statute of limitations, I may be wrong about that but in any event, the initial obligation to pay dividend was discharged in New Jersey by the draft which issued in New Jersey, wasn't it?

speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="4184.069" stopTime="4310.781">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    Let me follow up your question there a bit, in another direction, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    These drafts, we must remember, are issued -- we're issued no less than 15 years to go in any instance and in some instances 30 years ago, as assumed by Exhibit A in the record page 59, where there's a representative list, of this type of graft. 
    Only one item is for a hundred dollars and the rest are for $1 to $15 dollar maximum. 
    We understand that that is represented those 20 items are represented above the situation. 
    Now, you've have heard they might not be a majority of cases but many of these drafts were issued intrastate. 
    The sender was in Pennsylvania, the recipient was in Pennsylvania. 
    The whereabouts of neither is known, no claims has been made. 
    Now what about these drafts, isn't it interesting that the respondent himself in his answer in the State Court in Pennsylvania, pleaded that the Pennsylvania stature of limitations has deprived to all of these drafts and there was no further liability. 
    Now, in this situation we are much of the fears of dual liability, triple liability, quintuple liability but in fact, this respondent while it didn't pass in the appellate court, did plead at the Pennsylvania statute of limitations was a bar to all of the drafts, and I think any liability to run wherever held. 
    Now, going to the question or fear of liability over and over again, that certainly wouldn't be true. 
    That the respondent has any fear on that score at all because himself, has categorically pleaded that these obligations are all dated.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4310.781" stopTime="4360.569">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Creskoff, I might suggest that I don't think you don't get to the point that troubles me. 
    I don't see how Pennsylvania has a better claim for purposes of escheat. 
    By reason of the initiation of the transaction in the Pennsylvania office, when in many of this cases at least the terminal part of the transaction now represented by an outstanding draft, to place at an office in another state. 
    The state of the office, where the sendee was at least at the time where the order went then, now, why should Pennsylvania's connection whit the transaction rise to any better claim than that of --
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="4360.569" stopTime="4382.516">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    May I try to answer that this way. 
    We assume that in the ultimate sense, it was the duty of the respondent to refund the price deposited or the amount deposited with Western Union to be sent in the event that they could not deliver that month.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4382.516" stopTime="4406.982">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But only then but I as understand what Mr. Buchanan answered us earlier, I haven't look at this record to know the actual facts, I thought what he told us was, that the bulk of sum escheated is represented by drafts, issued by sendee offices which have never been presented for payment, am I wrong in part of it?
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="4406.982" stopTime="4441.339">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    No, that's -- I'm in agreement with that generally but perhaps, this more approaches our are reasoning in answer to your question. 
    We must remember that there was no agreement here or whatsoever between the sender and Western Union to issue any draft at all. 
    All the record discloses and all of the instances, all that happened was, Western Union gave a receipt to the sender saying, we will send so much money to the sendee.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4441.339" stopTime="4457.931">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But isn't this -- this -- isn't this involved us with a tariff of requirements and whatever may have been the words in the understanding between the clerk and the sender is not the whole transaction as defined in the tariff.
speaker="a_jere_creskoff" startTime="4457.931" stopTime="4502.463">
    Mr. A. Jere Creskoff 
    I don't -- I don't think that the sender is bound, nor anyone is bound unless under the Pennsylvania law, there's a specific agreement that the issuance of a draft is in fact payment and of course the draft is evidence of the obligation. 
    But the original obligation is that which the draft is built around, now even in notifying the pay where Western Union said we have received a sum of money for you. 
    It's true that Western Union for its convenience or that of the payee might not pay the dollars over the counter but issue a draft, but that's something that was never within the agreement between the sender and Western Union.

    The very -- the record will show that these are exhibits of the respondent that is was a matter of convenience whether in a given case, either making refund to the sender or giving the money to the payee whether a draft was or was not issued was a pure matter of convenience, to one or the other of a party, now in any case, the sender could come in, and walk out with the cash if that's what he prefer. 
    If he didn't want to carry the cash, he might say I will take a draft in which case, they gave him a draft. 
    Sometimes Western Union would know the payee and would mail a draft or deliver it by messenger and would do so apparently without asking the sendee which form he wanted the transmittal but would do so as a matter of convenience to itself and the draft.

    Pennsylvania does not regard that as escheatable property within Pennsylvania, even though the sendees may have been in Pennsylvania because to be consistent, the concept of Pennsylvania is that the closeness of the contact to the core of the transaction, the obligation if there's to be some order “must reside in the state” where the fund, where the obligation is originated because the sender's sent the fund from that and was presumably a resident of that state.

    Our position right or wrong is that the locale of that obligation cannot shift by the mere issuance of these drafts which are now stale-dated, a term used by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in its opinion and that Pennsylvania had jurisdiction over the rights, notice it was proper, it was affirmed on appealed and as far as Pennsylvania's concerned unless this Court finds that an error was committed. 
    We are not concerned with the third step where the full faith and credit will be given by New York. 
    They have given heretofore, as a matter of fact, during the whole tendency of this case, the Pennsylvania case we're here talking about and New York abandoned property laws specifically exempted any situation in which another court and another state have first taken jurisdiction. 
    Now, it's true in 1960, after the decree was injured in this case, New York amended its abandoned property law and left out that provision and I'm saying during the entire period, the inception of the action to the procurement of the decree, New York recognized that many field with another state had proceeded to the escheat of the fund, it would hold hands off until the determination of that case and Your Honor needs determine.

    Our essential position in the situation is of course this, that Pennsylvania have jurisdiction over the subject matter that the raise as we see it was seized, that the case proceeded to unnoticed to hearing that the lower court adjudicated the case, that exceptions were heard. 
    Exceptions disposed of then appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 
    All of the arguments you heard here today and more are heard and carefully considered by the Supreme Court.

    I necessarily think that the decree of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, opinion by that Court in this case is where they have a lot of weight because it considered all of these questions. 
    And insofar as it determined the interpretation of the Pennsylvania statute on notice and the Pennsylvania statues on the drafts concerning a question whether they're payment or not or just an evidence of the obligation deserve a great deal of weight from this Court and I'm certain that they will get a great deal of weight.

    Well, let me point out as far as Pennsylvania's concerned of escheat statute still provide a term of years and which then a proper person, that could include that term could include another state, could include anybody that might come in and recover the fund that had showed superior title. 
    There's nothing that bars any state I'm coming in for period of three years after the final decree escheat in Pennsylvania. 
    Now, in New York under this custodial statute, I must differ although it may seem a matter of temerity with Mrs. Toch here from what that statute provides that statute is a mixed mini escheat statute to New York statute.

    Mixed. 
    Some cases are mini escheat and some cases custodial. 
    I say, if we assume that these drafts are separate obligations under the New York statute, you must come in within five years. 
    Or you forever lost your chance for a refund.

    No, because from my point of view Pennsylvania as sender the state would be out because I think the receiving state would ever get a claim because that's where a new obligation either in a piece of paper or in the creation of a new shows and action, that was the -- as it was the domicile of the grieving states and all of these and I'm afraid play either than most of writing my own acts.

    Mr. Justice Brennan you asked about the Book of Rules the tariffs, the filed tariffs. 
    At pages 61 to Page 64 of the record are the extracts from the filed tariffs and each one starts by saying, “All payments will be made by drafts.” 
    There are some provisions for paying cash in certain instances but at the very least, those -- these filed tariffs give Western Union the option at least, the very least, no matter how you read them to pay by drafts. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Douglas had some question about the situation in Minnesota, will Minnesota sit back and let Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania decree rule us, I say no. 
    Minnesota is free to say Pennsylvania sent out a notice filed a petition, sent out a notice saying, “We are taking money refundable to senders,” and that's what the notice said here. 
    But we're -- we are taking drafts payable to sendees says Minnesota because this whole proceedings started out saying in the notice saying, “We're just taking money refundable to senders” but in the end they took something much broader than that payable to sendees, payable to endorsees and drafts and so on. 
    And the fellow who is sitting out in Minnesota with a negotiable instrument in his hands stale-dated though it be, he knows Western Union is good for it, doesn't get anything from that, so he had published in the newspaper in Pennsylvania saying, “Money is refundable to senders are being taken.”
