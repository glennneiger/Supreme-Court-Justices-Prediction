Townsend v. Sain

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- Petitioner versus Frank G.Sain, Sheriff of Cook County. 
    Mr. Leighton you may continue your argument.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="7.967" stopTime="150.759">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    At the time of adjournment yesterday, I was answering a question of Mr. Justice Goldberg with regard to the events on the occasion of the coroner's hearing of January 4. 
    I was at the point of saying Mr. Justice Goldberg that with regard to the inquest into the death of Thompson when the deputy coroner asked the petitioner about this particular incident. 
    He asked him where he was in the night in question. 
    Townsend answered that he was in the vicinity of 35th in Giles in the City of Chicago. 
    Now, it happened that the coroner knew that the body of the decedent was found at 47th in Wabash and the coroner turned to the police officer and said, “You must have the wrong man.” 
    At that point, the investigating officer turned to Townsend and all these facts are in the coroner's minutes now before the Court as part of their response to paragraph 18 of the petitioner's habeas corpus. 
    The officer then turned to Townsend, began jogging his memory as to some conversation the officer had with Townsend prior to the inquest and I remind Your Honors that the origin of this dispute in the record arose because Townsend had said that what he had said in the coroner's hearing was what the officer had told him to say. 
    When the interrogation continued, the deputy coroner turned to the officer and said, “Look, you must have the wrong man”. 
    At that point, the officer said to the coroner, “Well, we can go out and get these guys. 
    They have their patterns. 
    Why shouldn't we get credit for these cleanups?” 
    In other words, he was saying to the coroner that this being the first time we're here this year, we're cleaning up some unsolved murders of 1953 and this petition appears to be as good as an individual clean up the record with as anyone else. 
    That's all part of the record now when Your Honors request the respondents to specifically answer paragraph 18 for petition for habeas corpus.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    He was not, Your Honor. 
    It was not the practice in Cook County to require counsel at coroner's hearings although it is the practice for defendants to be confronted with what they say or not say at the coroner's hearing.

    What is this coroner's hearing state? 
    Is this something special or -- what's its nature anyway?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="203.046" stopTime="212.833">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    It is just the nature, Your Honor, to determine how the decedent came upon his death. 
    It's the ancient and classical coroner's inquest inquiring to the cause of death.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="212.833" stopTime="215.198">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And is it formal like this all the time?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="215.198" stopTime="332.057">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    It is. 
    It's a very important part of the criminal proceedings in Illinois. 
    Now, a great deal has been made, if Your Honor's please, to the insistence of the petitioner in this Court to make reference of these confessions and we are told by respondents of this Court that we have taken an inconsistent position in asking Your Honors to consider these confessions while we sought to object to them in the trial court. 
    And since the objection has been made so extraneously, I have taken your case to go back and look to the record which I asked Your Honors to examine. 
    On page 55 of the common law record of capital A which is the proceedings in the criminal court appears a motion made on February 9, 1955 by this petitioner, asking the Court to direct the state attorney of Cook County to furnish him with all the copies of the confessions taken from him on January 1, 1954. 
    That motion was denied at the outset of the trial. 
    It happens to be the law in Illinois today that a defendant who confesses to a crime upon his being arrested is entitled upon arraignment to a copy of his confession. 
    In 1955, the law was just a reverse. 
    It was the practice in Cook County not to let a defendant see a copy of his own confession until he came to trial and it was the result of the activities of the defense bar in Cook County that in 1955, Section 729 of Chapter 38 was amended to provide the law as it now exist. 
    But in 1955 when this petitioner came to trial, the law was that he was not entitled to these copies of his confession and when he made the request by motion of his counsel, he was denied the copies of the confession so that if this motion had been granted, we don't know what defense counsel would have made of these confessions. 
    These confessions were denied the petitioner by the trial court so it isn't true that the defendant --

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    They were available in the sense that that police had them in their possession.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="340.440" stopTime="343.329">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    You mean they -- weren't they recorded there?

    No, they were not, Your Honor.

    I thought you said that the policeman said something about an order to clean up.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="348.154" stopTime="360.432">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes. 
    You see, Your Honor on January 1, the petitioner had been interrogated at the police station after this drug injection. 
    They had five confessions he had given, a five felonies, three --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="360.432" stopTime="364.966">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Were these five separate confessions or just a confession to five murders?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="364.966" stopTime="387.533">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No, five separate confessions taken each individually each time and the respondents have told Your Honors that they are all separate confessions taken of separate different crimes and given all at one time while he sat there soon after drug injection. 
    Within a few minutes -- I think five minutes or ten minutes. 
    Prior to that, he said he wouldn't talk to anybody. 
    Now --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="387.533" stopTime="392.367">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    At the inquest, did they point out the names of the persons who he was accused of murdering?

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes –- yes, Your Honor.

    Did he confess?

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="394.903" stopTime="396.302">

    I know you have that information.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="396.302" stopTime="435.325">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes. 
    And the instant thing, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Clark, that with regard to the death of Thomas Johnson, they have the confession. 
    They have the confession already but by the time of the inquest, he couldn't repeat. 
    You see, the drug had worn off. 
    He couldn't repeat what he had said so they were trying to jog his memory with the dispute generating between the police officer and the coroner which is shown in the coroner's minutes. 
    So that the police, in answer Your Honor's question, the police did have these confessions then but it is not the practice as I'm committing with it of the police producing the confession. 
    They hold those confessions you see, until the time of trial as a practical matter.

    They held against you.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="534.596" stopTime="535.930">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    And they ruled against me.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="535.930" stopTime="537.122">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    The Supreme Court affirmed.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="537.122" stopTime="659.663">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    And the Supreme Court affirmed. 
    They rejected the contention I made here. 
    Now, to come back briefly to a point which I think is very important, if Your Honors please. 
    This case is no different today before Your Honors than it was the day that I appeared before the Supreme Court of Illinois when I argued it. 
    The only difference is that in the interim of time, I learned a great deal more about scopolamine than did Mr. Branion know at the time of the trial. 
    The thrust of the constitutional question raised by this petitioner when he objected to the admission against him of the confession taken from him while he was under the influence of a drug given to him by a police doctor is the same question presented here. 
    Your Honors could decide this question overlooking all these other questions about the niceties of scopolamine, its colloquial use as a drug known as “truth serum”. 
    Because if Your Honors will look at the brief that I filed before the Supreme Court of Illinois, it is the very question presented here. 
    The only difference between the case now and then is simply that I have added more detail. 
    I know now more about this drug. 
    I'm convinced from my knowledge of the subject that the constitutional issue was well-posed at the time it was made and that the confession at the time it was offered was an involuntary confession, the product of narco-interrogation. 
    Now, the point is made by the respondents that this was not the same kind of connivance between a doctor and the police as in Leyra versus Denno. 
    But I say to Your Honors that they were not interested in the good health of Charles Townsend. 
    The reason why they call that doctor was to see to it that Charles Townsend was put in a condition by which he could be interrogated. 
    And as Mr. Jernigan said to his superiors after the administration, I was able to get the confessions. 
    It is because of that ability to get the confession after the administration of the drug that we say the Fourteenth Amendment was violated by the use of this confession.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But -- how would you put the constitutional issue in this case that are asked which concerned. 
    How would you put constitutional issue of this case that is, how do you determine whether the precise question was answered?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="668.997" stopTime="691.818">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Whether a drug -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. 
    Whether a confession taken from a state prisoner while he is under the influence of a drug injected into him by state police officer is a voluntary confession when it appears from the facts that prior to the injection he would not talk and immediately after the confession after the injection, he did give the confession.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="691.818" stopTime="704.952">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Are you saying that as a matter of law -- as a matter of law, the injection of any drug precedes a confession, an initiated confession?

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    If that injection produces a destruction of his will.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="709.172" stopTime="710.754">

    That was a question of fact.

    That is true. 
    But as Your Honors have held that if the ruling against the petitioner is not supported by evidence which Your Honors will respect and I submit to you in this case, the evidence shows that he was -- his will was affected by that injection and as pointed out by the very facts I've related here.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's just a -- that's -- you're basing that just on a chronology. 
    Now, what if a man had refuse to talk about a crime of which he was suspected of committing and said he had a headache and they gave him two aspirin tablets. 
    And thereafter, he did confess. 
    Would your rule apply?

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And you remind me of a point I've made in this case. 
    You know this case stands for a very dangerous doctrine. 
    If an ordinary motorist is going down the street according to the Townsend doctrine and he has an ordinary automobile accident and he is taken to the police station and complains of a headache and he asked for a doctor and the doctor comes in and gives him what the doctor thinks is proper and as a result of that, he is put in a stupor and he begins talking about crimes he has never committed. 
    According to the Townsend case, he can't object because the test applied by the Supreme Court is not volition. 
    Its adequacy of the medication, the fact that it takes his life upon the Supreme Court of Illinois is of no moment.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes.Mr. Justice Goldberg, that question is clear in this record. 
    In fact the doctor said, he gave him the drug because he knew that it was to pacify and he used a very instant expression to put him in more of a state of -- or on reality and that it was for the purpose of affecting his mind and for the purpose of pacify and to deprive him. 
    That was the purpose of the drug and the drug produced the confession.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Well, Your Honor, I'm glad you asked me that question, Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    I like to see this Court determine this case finally 
    .This case has been in the judicial proceedings since 1955. 
    And I think the time has come for us to have a determination of this issue. 
    Your Honors can determine that on the basis of this record, this confession was unconstitutionally admitted and thus directed back to the trial court and the District Court for the entry of proper findings of fact and conclusions of law which I can then present to that court and we can dispose of this case. 
    I think that this record -- that's why when I began my argument, I said to Your Honors, I was going to predicate this argument only on undisputed facts. 
    These facts I stated to you are not subject to dispute. 
    So therefore, no further hearing is necessary.

    And if I have the opportunity to have this case heard on the merits, I would produce some outstanding experts, all of whom would testify that this drug under the circumstances of this case and this petitioner in the circumstance he was in as a narcotic addict with a huge injection of heroin, he was put in a position where he had no control over his will.

    I believe Your Honors could take this record as it now stand since it presents a legal question and determine that that confession as it's shown by the record contrary to what Judge Igoe concluded because Judge Igoe could have made this conclusion himself.

    That's right. 
    You see, Your Honor, if we didn't have to contend with the written confession, I wouldn't worry at all about what this officer said because Officer Cagney contradicts this other officer.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It was not Cagney, it was Officer Corcoran and Cagney was the principal officer. 
    You see, I have a cynical view of that officer's testimony. 
    I believe that somebody whispered to him that it was necessary before the jury to say this. 
    He didn't say it in the preliminary hearing and he is contradicted by every officer in the case.

    No, no, no. 
    I said, I predicated my remark, Your Honor by saying that I have a cynical view of his testimony. 
    You see, if the only evidence I had to contend with or this petitioner have to contend within the trial court was Officer Corcoran's testimony that he heard an oral remark. 
    You see, in Illinois, we have well established cases that oral remarks are not seriously considered. 
    You see, and this -- it's true that Officer Corcoran said that and it caused a great deal of dispute in the record.

    Do you --

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    It varies to individuals depending upon the tolerance developed over the years of addiction but I'm told that it may start within six hours to 12 to 14 hours after the injection.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1331.482" stopTime="1333.935">

    That will last for how long?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="1333.935" stopTime="1350.330">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    An hour and a half or two until the drug has completely worn off or unless if the addict is kept in custody, he receives no medication, eventually, he will suffer a great deal but eventually he will leave that state, that mental of illness, mental and physical illness.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1350.330" stopTime="1372.523">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    To the fact that they only asked him few questions when he was arrested at five o'clock in the morning and then asked him no questions at all until 8:30 tonight when he probably would be within -- with all the symptoms.Does that play any part in this case?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="1372.523" stopTime="1441.080">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I think it does. 
    You see, these officers knew and by the way, this transfer of this man from one police station was interesting. 
    It doesn't -- to the unsuspecting, it has no significance but to the experience, it does.You see, they're putting him away he wouldn't be questioned to be left alone until eight o'clock is significant when you look at it retrospectively. 
    These officers knew who he was. 
    They all admit; the record is clear. 
    The officers knew he was an addict. 
    They knew he had taken the drug. 
    In fact, Officer Cagney so testify, so they knew -- they knew all these. 
    Now, it is true that we don't have this case here we had in Leyra versus Denno where there is proof that the prosecuting attorney stayed another room and they bugged the room and this -- we don't have the tape recordings and all that. 
    We don't have that kind of thing. 
    We have here much more subtle form of the use of knowledgeable consequences of a drug addict in this condition and as I said before, they weren't interested in Charlie Townsend's mental and physical well-being. 
    They wanted to put him in a condition to question him. 
    That was the whole purpose of this.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I remember you're saying and you correct if I'm wrong from the first argument of this case and I think I asked you the question that you did not claim that the administration of this drug by the prison doctor was part of a scheme to induce this man to confess which we may know such claim is done.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="1462.098" stopTime="1500.154">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    If I made the answer to that direct Your Honor, I didn't mean to carry that impression completely. 
    What I meant to say was that there isn't the obvious scheme that we find in Leyra versus Denno. 
    This is much more subtle to say. 
    And you see Your Honor, if this wasn't part of the plan, the thing they would have done and these officers were officers of great experience, they would have let that man alone. 
    That's all they had to do was to leave him alone over a period of time and then they could have questioned him later and he would have resisted their interrogation. 
    You see, this is the plain fact of the matter.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1500.154" stopTime="1525.836">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Leighton, I have somewhat the same recollection with my Brother Harlan. 
    I understood that this was administered while he was exhibiting withdrawal symptom from an earlier application of the drug that he taken himself and that this was administered to relieve him of the pains of withdrawal symptoms. 
    Was I wrong about that?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="1525.836" stopTime="1552.202">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That was -- that is the ostensible -- that's what the record shows ostensibly. 
    All I'm saying Your Honor that when you reflect upon it a little longer than that, the ostensible purposes are displaced by the real purpose of the injection as shown by the fact that I just quoted to Your Honors today a letter which is made part of the record written by the officer who took the confession in which he said that after the administrations, I was able to get the confession.

    Well, it is a question of fact but it was also a question of fact Your Honor in Rogers versus Richmond which Your Honors held that reliability of a confession is an unconstitutional standard to be applied in a confession case. 
    Your Honors so held in the Richmond case and I suggest to you Your Honor that the Illinois Supreme Court and Illinois trial courts made the same error in this case that the Connecticut courts made in Rogers, you see. 
    They applied the test here which I find in reflection almost ludicrous because they say that the fact that the drug produces confession that takes a man's life is of no consequence. 
    The fact that it is important is that the drug eased his pain for the moment. 
    You see, that's what the Supreme Court did and that's what the trial court did in effect by its own ruling of the objection to the confession.

    No, no, he didn't say that.

    They used the standard in this case of the propriety of the drug not its effect upon his will, you see.

    Then upon remand, only one thing will be left for the district judge to do and that is to make certain findings of fact and conclusions of law which shall guide the state authorities in the retrial of this petitioner.

   Argument of Edward J. Hladis
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1799.716" stopTime="1822.398">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Hladis. 
    And you may -- Mr. Hladis, you may have five minutes additional if you should desire it also.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="1822.398" stopTime="1963.926">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    As we have tried to marshal these vast expands of proceedings, it is our view that this controversy presents two basic issues. 
    The first I think is rather easy to phrase and that is whether or not Judge Igoe in the United States District Court abused his discretion when upon an independent examination and investigation of the record in the Supreme Court of Illinois, he was satisfied that this petitioner was accorded due process and dismissed the petition. 
    The second one is much more difficult to phrase and that's the one that has caused the problem particularly today. 
    As I read the petitioner's briefs, as I distill his arguments, his claim appears to be that a drug induced confession is violated of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    If that would be the issue then I would not be standing here today. 
    The issue in this case is whether this confession was drug induced and nowhere, nowhere that we had any demonstration at all from this petitioner that this confession and the amount of drugs employed here could have possibly in any way at all, could it possibly created such a situation in his personality as to induce a confession. 
    Before I examine these two basic propositions, I would like to make one remark by way of preface. 
    As this Court well knows, the final judgment in this proceeding was handed down in April of 1955 in the Criminal Court of Cook County. 
    Since that time, we have had one post-conviction hearing, four petitions for writ of certiorari --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1963.926" stopTime="1966.033">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There's a direct appeal first, wasn't it?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="1966.033" stopTime="2203.449">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Yes. 
    I'm including the direct appeal, one post-conviction hearing in the State of Illinois, four petitions for writ of certiorari and this proceeding. 
    We have great many papers in this file. 
    I will try to summarize and analyze the proceedings. 
    I have experienced the scene here what I thought it was a rather resourceful use of the federal writ of habeas corpus and in general of post-conviction remedies. 
    I think it's my responsibility not only as an advocate but as a member of the bar of this Court to call certain basic discrepancies, contradictory theories to the attention of this Court. 
    In doing so, I want this Court to know and to understand that in no manner of safe reform I -- am I imputing any form of criticism upon imposing counsel. 
    As I can truthfully say, I respect the gentleman as a lawyer as far as his ability is concerned and through my activity in the states attorney's office I have got to know him as a friend. 
    However, aside from the issue of this petitioner in this case and I just want to rest one minute on this point. 
    This case presents a problem as far as federal habeas corpus is concerned and I would like, if I could to speak, as a lawyer rather than as an advocate. 
    And I would like to report an incident that I heard several years ago which is quite applicable that during a course of a television interview of a counsel or attorney from the foreign service of England, where he was interviewed in the Chicago station about three or four days after another internationally famous death case in this country. 
    And while this gentleman was discussing the pre-criminal procedures in England, he made one observation which didn't strike me until I realize of the man not our own, the man of the English bar had mentioned it to us and that was this. 
    He appreciated the concept of dualism of sovereignty that we have in this country, the several individual 50 states and the national federal state that we have. 
    And he marveled at the manner in which the Fourteenth Amendment and the guarantees incorporated therein could be made available by way of our federal writ of habeas corpus. 
    And I, as a lawyer, think it's one of the finest inventions that's ever been made in the field of jurisprudence, but I think we must always remember that up until, I believe it was 1867, it was impossible to review a state court conviction. 
    It was not until the enactment of the Federal Habeas Corpus Act that this could be done. 
    And I cannot help but feel that if federal process such as being employed here to the point that one could very well consider it an abuse, I cannot feel and fear that possibly Congress might take a more restrictive view someday and a great deal of damage would be done.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2203.449" stopTime="2214.702">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    That of course raises a very large question as to the power of Congress to cut down the availability of habeas of corpus in the federal court. 
    It's something we don't need to get into here.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="2214.702" stopTime="2434.750">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    I understand. 
    Now, I address myself with the first proposition sir and that is whether or not Judge Igoe abused his discretion. 
    During the course of the last argument which is held in February of this year and once again during the course of this argument, questions have been propounded by several members of this Court. 
    Counsel, what did you want to put in? 
    And for some reason or other, the petitioner and his counsel just have not been able to tell the Court precisely what it is. 
    This federal habeas corpus proceeding began in December 1958 before Judge Igoe. 
    It began before Jennings v. Ragan and up until Jennings v. Ragan, it was a practice and what everybody thought was the approved practice in the Northern District of Illinois to judge or to apply the Brown versus Allen criterion from the opinion of the highest court of the state and not the record. 
    The state office petitioned on that basis and counsel for petitioner in addressing Judge Igoe during that proceeding and that transcript is a part of this record. 
    As a matter of fact, it is found on page 26 of the transcript, December 15, 1958. 
    And this is counsel speaking and quote, “I agree with Your Honor that the cases on this subject hold that Your Honor need not conduct a hearing in the sense of witnesses being called. 
    I agree with Your Honor that we could submit to you for an example and I could make it available to Your Honor quite promptly. 
    I could make available to you the court reporter's notes, transcript of the hearing in question. 
    I could present that to you, it won't take me long,” in December 1945, as I said, before Judge Igoe pursued the practice prior to Jennings. 
    In the meantime, Jennings was decided on petition writ of certiorari. 
    This Court vacated the orders of the lower court citing Jennings v. Ragan. 
    Now, counsel during yesterday's argument made some suggestions that some mandate came down to Igoe as to what he should do. 
    As I read that brief, minute order, there was no secret or implied mandate contained therein. 
    It was an order of this Court when they cite Jennings and it's quite obvious to everybody that to practice now is in applying the Brown versus Allen standard, in attempting to ascertain whether or not there was a vital flaw in a state court proceeding. 
    The District Court judge no longer can rely upon the opinion alone. 
    He must go to that record and that is the practice now. 
    And that record came up and Judge Igoe on the 12th of June took that record. 
    And for 12 days he had it and he examined it.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2434.750" stopTime="2442.944">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Was there ever a practice Mr. Hladis to supplement the conditional testimony?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="2442.944" stopTime="2648.028">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Yes. 
    I was -- I don't want to be impertinent sir, but I was subjected to it in another death case which this Court had recently and denied certiorari. 
    As long as you ask a question, I wanted to develop that I may develop it right now. 
    Your Honor, as we read Brown versus Allen, Brown versus Allen is an opinion of caution, of caution to the trial judges admonishing them that it is only in the extraordinary cases that the federal court will end the theory. 
    In line with your question sir, I suggest and I urge that it should be proper practice that before any witness be called that the state be entitled to know whether it can rely upon that record and I think the determination as to whether there is a vital flow in that record or not should be made before anything. 
    I'll tell you what happened to me in the other case. 
    I filed my answer and set this up to Brown versus Allen defense up as the first affirmative defense and I requested the ruling on that defense before we go any further. 
    The District Court judge took it under advisory. 
    Now, I have a problem in Illinois because in Illinois in confession matters, as a matter of decisional law, any law enforcement officer who was in any way associated with the defendant during this investigative process out of which a confession arises must be called. 
    In other words, the state cannot choose say five out of 14 and say we'll go with five witnesses and prove up the voluntary nature. 
    You've got to call all of them. 
    And if you don't, reverse and remanded for a new trial. 
    I'm in the Federal District Court, I don't know. 
    My only defense, I'm notified within 48 hours with the state court record and I don't know whether I can rely upon that state court record and we were put to the test as far as evidence is concerned. 
    So I was forced to gamble. 
    I was forced to gamble and say, “I will go with the record. 
    I will not examine that record and choose my witnesses because certainly, I won't call all of them in the federal court.” 
    So I respectfully suggest Your Honors, if this question should in any way at all come up during the course of the discussion in this case, I think that it is sound practice consistent with the spirit of federal habeas corpus as announced by this Court in Brown versus Allen and it is orderly practice that before any evidence be given, the state have a determination from the District Court that he is -- the district judge is either satisfied or he is dissatisfied with the state court record. 
    And if he is dissatisfied then we know where we stand. 
    We know that we have to go to trial.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But that -- if he thinks something more is required then what does he do, does he merely supplement the state court record or does he retry factually the constitutional claims.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="2720.101" stopTime="2784.039">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    What will happen to that record in the event that he is -- well, that would be a case of dissatisfaction. 
    He is not satisfied with what he had in the record. 
    What would happen to that record would depend upon the trial technique of the attorney representing the state whether he is going to introduce it, I assume that he would, but he would give accumulative evidence also. 
    It would almost develop into a trial de novo on the issue but I don't think that -- I submit that the state should not be led dangling on that issue. 
    We get -- and the statute says three days and that's just about what we get and it takes us just about that time to get that record from Springfield on to Chicago. 
    And gentlemen, that's all we have when we go to a federal court, that's our case and we I think we're entitled to know whether that is going to stand after the case or not.

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    I would say yes in this respect that Judge Igoe I think follow the procedure as outlined by Brown versus Allen. 
    And he exercised the discretion on the basis that the state court record was satisfied that all the issues raised, the counsel practically conceded off before -- off before this courtroom this morning when he said the record that we have here is no different than it was when I was in the Supreme Court of Illinois and that's true. 
    There had been a few changes in theory, a few changes in technique but it's the same record.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2836.133" stopTime="2860.572">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, it's the same record obviously since Judge Igoe didn't supplement it. 
    I must confess I'm a little confused about what Mr. Leighton's position is but I gather that the last thing he answered me was, if we think well of it, we can send it back for at least supplemental -- supplementing this record on the properties of the drug hyoscine.

    Coming now to the question of this confession. 
    This counsel had advised you the petitioner was arrested in January 1, 1954 about one o'clock in the morning. 
    About an hour and a half prior to that time, he had taken some heroin having been an addict with two previous years. 
    At the time of his arrest, he was 19 years of age, he had been examined by a psychiatrist and found to be legally sane but of low border intelligence. 
    And the psychiatrist equated his psychological finding to a range of 75 to 80 which he testified compared favorably to the average of the United States Army. 
    He was asked certain questions regarding vital statistics and for about a half hour was questioned by the police officers.

    That is right. 
    But you'll find in records pages 1027 to 1030 that he translated that into the terms of mental IQ, this is the evidence. 
    The range is from 75 to 80 for petitioner, though it's below average, it compares favorably with the World War II average mental IQ of 78. 
    And the record references on that at 1027 to 1080.

speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="3283.476" stopTime="3383.227">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    After a half hour interview, period of questioning, there is some discrepancy in his own testimony as to what happened. 
    When he was on the stand during the preliminary hearing and the motion to suppress, he stated that he talked to them only a half hour. 
    When the petitioner testified in the trial before the jury, he claimed that they talked to him for about two hours. 
    At any rate, they took him about five o'clock in the morning over the 19th District and that's a new station. 
    The record so shows and there's nothing in the record to support any supposition or inference that was made here that this man was taken to another station for any sinister purpose. 
    If you read the record, you'll find that the squad led by Officer Cagney had left and then they return late in the evening and the answer most probably is that they were on the night shift and they were going home. 
    He remained at the 19th District Police Station until approximately 8:25 p.m. or about 8:30 p.m. of January 1. 
    During the day, there is no dispute about the fact that he was not questioned by anybody. 
    He admitted that food was available one of the lock up keeper testified that food was offered to him and he refused it.

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    The withdrawal problem actually set in around -- I would have to say about 10 minutes to 9:00 sir because he was brought back in the 19th District about 8:25 to 8:30 p.m. in the first of January and then we have to show off which the record reflects, it took about 10 to 15 minutes. 
    And then they began to talk to him about 10 minutes to 9:00 and it is at this point that we give in to the controversy about the oral statement. 
    One that is testified to by Officer Corcoran at pages 647 to 650. 
    As I read the record, we would -- we indicated that the oral statement was given somewhere between 10 minutes to 9:00 and 9 o'clock. 
    He was being questioned by four officers. 
    Not all of them participated but they were there one time or another. 
    Both on direct examination and cross-examination of the court he testified that when he was asked about striking a man of 38 in Michigan and robbing him that the petitioner answered in the affirmative. 
    Now, during the course of this argument both yesterday and this morning, this Court and particularly Mr. Justice Clark exhibited a considerable amount of interest in that oral statement. 
    Excuse me. 
    And if I remembered counsel's remarks yesterday since we attached no significance to that. 
    It would seem to create the impression that it was almost non-existent.

    I beg your pardon. 
    That's right. 
    That is correct. 
    At pages 1274 and 1275 to some very explicit and specific instructions were given on this oral statement. 
    At page 75-a, now that is the common law record coming out of the State of Illinois which is also part of this record, we find the petitioner's motion for a new trial which is filed in the Criminal Court of Cook County. 
    And under point two, the Court erred in admitting into evidence the oral confession made by the defendant because it was involuntary -- because it was an involuntary confession. 
    The issue there was not whether there was an oral confession but whether that oral confession was involuntary. 
    Under point four in his motion to new trial, the petitioner charged that the Court erred not sustaining the defendant's motion to suppress the confessions and admissions both oral and written. 
    There is also a blanket charge on instructions.

    The counsel testified, he remembered Cagney asking him whether he's on 37th of Michigan or 38th of Michigan that night.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="3725.116" stopTime="3885.638">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Now, one final observation on this oral admission as it relates to the state court proceeding and I pointed out the error of the admission of that oral admission was made in the Criminal Court of Cook County. 
    On his writ of error, on his appeal of the Supreme Court of Illinois, you'll find that in the petitioner's brief, not a single instruction is challenged, not a single instruction. 
    It would seem to me that if today, the view is that in fact there was no such oral admission and you have to express explicit instructions as we have in this record, it would seem to me that proper objection would have been made in the appellate level in the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    Apparently, there must have been some satisfaction that that testimony was given. 
    As I said previously, the petitioner became ill somewhere between 10 minutes to 9:00 and 9 o'clock. 
    It is quite obvious and we know now that he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms. 
    And the doctor was called -- and Dr. Cagney called -- Officer Cagney called the doctor who was Dr. Mansfield, the police surgeon. 
    During the course of yesterday's argument, Mr. Justice Goldberg asked counsel for the petitioner a certain question about the request that was made. 
    And this came about in this fashion as I remembered counsel's representation originally on this whole thing that none of this was the petitioner's doing, the calling of a doctor, the administration of drug or anything. 
    And then upon the question, counsel limited and says, “Well choosing this doctor.” 
    If the Court will check the record at page 110, it will find that the petitioner on direct examination on a preliminary hearing testified that he had been talking with Mr. Cagney about this doctor friend of his and he was so ill that he requested Mr. Cagney to call this doctor.

speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="4187.858" stopTime="4338.692">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    I'll get into the Thompson very shortly. 
    Now, dwelling on this choice of doctor in the general area, there has been an impression attempted to be created that perhaps his entire program of treatment was forced upon him. 
    I'd like to call the Court's attention to the history of this proceeding. 
    In the first place, when this petitioner prosecuted its appeal in the Supreme Court of Illinois, no argument was made that the drugs were involuntarily administered or without his consent. 
    No question was raised as to the purpose for which the drugs were given. 
    He filed this petition writ of certiorari from the judgment of affirmance and that was done in August 3, 1957. 
    Now, during the course of that petition, the petitioner wrote that the drug used is known under two names, namely, hyoscine and scopolamine. 
    And the petitioner further declared to this Court and I quote, “that the drugs were administered to petitioner with his consent and with the avowed intention on the part of the police surgeon to alleviate the heroin withdrawal symptoms. 
    The first time, the very first time in the history of this case that you get a switch in this theory, you get it in the post-conviction hearing. 
    And incidentally, that post-conviction hearing is the very item which gives rise to the proceeding here. 
    That's what started everything. 
    And we had a new case and the only difference, the only difference between the record as it stood in the Supreme Court of Illinois and the record that we have here is the addition, is the compilation of a new item in trial. 
    And what was the gist of that post-conviction hearing? 
    The petitioner was trying to develop, trying to claim the constitutional right to a label just as simple as that.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4338.692" stopTime="4339.052">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Label?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="4339.052" stopTime="4398.633">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    To a label. 
    And the position he took there was that not only was a drug given to him against his consent without his consent but for the sole purpose of extracting a confession and he reported that to this Court in a second petition writ of certiorari, less than one year after the first was filed. 
    Now gentleman, I have looked at this and I find it difficult to reconcile the statements and I can't understand, I can't understand how there can be consent at one time and lack of consent with the other. 
    Because when that drug was administered in the night of January 1, 1954, it was administered only once and the consent or lack of the consent occurred only once. 
    How can you say and tell a court in one term, it is given for a proper purpose with my consent and on the second term, it is given for an improper purpose and without my consent.

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    No. 
    No, there was no testimony attempted to be adduced in that point at all. 
    Now, the administration that was given here was 1/230 per grain of scopolamine together with 1/8 grain of Phenobarbital. 
    Now in his brief, counsel for the petitioner has set out a great number of medical authorities. 
    We have examined and reviewed the same authorities in our brief. 
    And this 1/230 for the grain is approximately 0.27 milligram of scopolamine and the normal therapeutic dose as reported by petitioners own authority is 0.5 milligram. 
    During the course of number of questions here and I believe it was yesterday afternoon, counsel stated flatly that he was not making any claim of incompetency of trial counsel but did suggest that perhaps trial counsel was not as well equipped as he should have been to conduct the examination. 
    Well we disagree and disagreed most heartedly. 
    I think if you'll examine the cross-examination of Dr. Mansfield, the cross-examination of Dr. Hoffman as well as the direct examination of Dr. Proctor, you'll find that John Branion -- Mr. Branion was thoroughly familiar with the properties of the drug. 
    There's one important item which is common to all three examinations. 
    When he cross-examined Dr. Mansfield, he wanted to know whether this drug was used for twilight sleep. 
    When he examined Dr. Proctor, the same question was propounded on direct and when he examined Dr. Hoffman, the neurosurgeon, the same question was propounded in cross-examination. 
    And that's very significant --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4719.860" stopTime="4720.973">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    This was at the trial finding.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="4720.973" stopTime="5054.415">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    This is the trial, that's correct. 
    And this is very significant because this use of drug in the field of narco-analysis and narco-interrogation began in obstetrics. 
    It began in the early 1900s and the doctor from Texas came upon a flight suddenly. 
    The twilight sleep was developed during the early 1900s and a man by the name of Dr. Gauss, G-A-U-S-S is actually the man who developed the technique. 
    And Dr. Gauss' formula in order to induce twilight sleep was 1/6 grain of morphine plus 1/140 grain of scopolamine. 
    Now, that's 1/140 of grain scopolamine is more of course than 1/230 of the grain. 
    Three quarts of an hour later, 1/140 of grain is administered again, scopolamine alone. 
    And a half hour later, the memory tester began. 
    In other words, the time of the first injection, they say a cup was shown to the person. 
    Then you come back and show the person the cup and if they still remember the cup, that means that the degree of anesthesia, and that is what narco-analysis and narco-interrogation is. 
    That's an anesthetic. 
    When you read the scientific journal, they speak of dissenting to level to bring him down. 
    The degree of anesthesia is not high enough so they keep administering the drug until they reach that point. 
    In 1916, a man by the name of Dr. House doing some obstetric work in Ferris, Texas; it was during the course of delivery and he had a woman, mother, prospective mother under twilight sleep. 
    He was talking to her husband. 
    And he asked her the questions -- asked him the questions and he answered them. 
    He answered them truthfully. 
    But the point is that when she came out, she had total amnesia for the incident. 
    She didn't remember it at all. 
    But immediately Dr. Ferris felt that he had something in the field of -- I don't want to call it psychiatry because in those days, psychiatry was not -- it was just pioneering. 
    He felt that something could be done. 
    The newspapers hit upon it and we had the famous phrase “truth serum”. 
    Of course all your scientific man, even to this day throw their hands up at the term or phrase “truth serum”. 
    One school did take it on and that was the School of Crime Detect -- Crime Detection Laboratory which was attached to the Northwestern University Law School. 
    We have there a man by the name of Goddard who led that group. 
    He was associated and assisted by Muehlberger and Keeler. 
    And Keeler later ran a crime detection lab and they used this technique. 
    They used it on 25 volunteers and he made a study of it which is reported in 1932 I believe in Hygeia and his recommendation was that in order to use scopolamine for purposes of narco-analysis or narco-interrogation. 
    This is the method. 
    Your initial injection 1/100 of a grain hypodermically and then you have additional hypodermical or hypodermic injections of 1/200 of a grain every 20 minutes for an average of three to six injections until the subject reaches the proper stages of their interrogation. 
    The important thing to remember that under this system, it is given on an anesthesiologist and the time element is anywhere from an hour and a half to three hours and you have an average here. 
    I withdraw that. 
    I'm sorry. 
    And your initial injection of 1/100 is actually more than twice that was administered here on the first of January and then for three to six additional injections, you have 1/200 of a grain which continues. 
    If you total this out gentlemen you have an average here of 10 times the amount, 10 times the amount that was administered to this particular individual in order to achieve any kind of narco-analysis which is necessary in order to induce a confession such as is claimed by the petitioner in this particular incidence. 
    Now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5054.415" stopTime="5057.164">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    None of this is in the record. 
    This is in the literature.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="5057.164" stopTime="5185.183">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    I beg your pardon. 
    This is in the literature, yes. 
    Actually, this part of the research is triggered by several questions of Mr. Justice Black during the course of our last argument. 
    Now, what are the other uses for -- of scopolamine? 
    Those are analyzed in the medical authorities which have been advanced by counsel for the petitioner. 
    A very common use is the preparation for anesthesia, preanesthesia; the reason being that it contracts the Salisbury muscle that maintains dryness. 
    It is used in the field of ophthalmology to produce psychoplegia. 
    As I explain the last time to triple or to paralyze the accommodation of the lens to enable the examination so that you cannot see near what you can see far. 
    An interesting thing, I believe its fine reports that it was used by the Air Force for air sickness. 
    And the amount of dose that was given was three-tenths of a milligram and study shows that it was given without any impairment of military efficiency. 
    I think that's quite significant. 
    You not only have a man flying a plane, this is war time activity because after all, the airplane during war time is secondary. 
    It's only a means of transportation. 
    You have a pilot and must maintain formations. 
    You have a navigere that must make mathematical calculations, you have a bombardier that must make mathematical calculations and you have a gunner whose reflex is better be in top shape. 
    Now gentlemen, do you think for one moment as these studies indicate that the Air Force have administered three-tenths of a milligram if at any time that have endanger tripling those men, their reflexes to the point that they could not operate efficiently and it's only -- yes, sir.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="5185.183" stopTime="5190.083">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Perhaps the Air Force also have been given Phenobarbital (Inaudible), doesn't it?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="5190.083" stopTime="5401.676">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    The Phenobarbital, no. 
    At least doctor's finding does not report that. 
    The Phenobarbital actually, even as Dr. Proctor testifies a very low dose. 
    This is not in the record. 
    This is part of inquiries I have made myself with several doctors. 
    And the purpose of this is I think there are two consistent drugs. 
    The Phenobarbital going with scopolamine didn't do anything at all. 
    What it did do, it guaranteed a long ranged sedation. 
    In other words, give him rest into the next morning because he had these tremendous pains. 
    It's the scopolamine which in this treatment and incidentally that is one of the tricks advanced by the petitioner. 
    He said -- he states the fact that the use of scopolamine is a recognized narcotic withdrawal. 
    It is the scopolamine which acts quickly and you've got to do it because you've got these muscles down here which are contracting and the Phenobarbital carries you along the line. 
    Now, much has been said here, cases tried defended on the theory that amnesia had developed. 
    Now, the key to this treatment that uses scopolamine narco-analysis is amnesia. 
    If you read the petitioner's testimony, it's indeed significant that he remembers the favorable items but forgets the unfavorable. 
    And there is no record or no history of the partial amnesia in this type of treatment. 
    In this trial, namely the Boone trial, he says he did not remember the Assistant State's Attorney taking the statement. 
    The record will show and he was impeached by the -- by his testimony in Stinson trial where he did remember the State's Attorney. 
    He remembered in the following morning on Saturday when he signed the statement and remembered him to be the same man that talked to him the previous night. 
    His testimony on psychoplegia, Dr. Proctor his own witness said, “You can't see near you can see far.” 
    This testimony is exact reverse. 
    Pre-anesthesia, the quickest reaction is thirst. 
    No complaint of thirst here at all. 
    And I think the most significant statement that we have in this record is when he requested the doctor the second time that was on Sunday. 
    He told the doc, he says, “Doc, those didn't do me any good,” words of that effect which would seem to indicate that there was hardly a threshold of fact there and certainly one which does not go to the nervous system.

    That's right. 
    It was a -- he gave 1/8 grain at the time the doctor visited him and he left one-quarter of grains if I remembered correctly. 
    Incidentally gentlemen, his own testimony indicates that the doctor spent but a few moments with him. 
    When you examine the studies in the field of narco-analysis, that is a long process just like any anesthesia. 
    I see that my warning sign has flashed and I would like close with this remark. 
    Many questions have been asked, many incisive questions. 
    But the question was propounded yesterday for the first time and also picked up today by Mr. Justice Harlan and later by Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    Weren't all these matters before the trial judge and the jury and aren't you asking us to make a finding of fact. 
    Gentlemen, basically that is the decisive question in this case because if this Court is to give this petitioner the relief that he asks for, he must of necessity ask this Court to substitute his judgment for that of the trial judge who saw the witnesses on the preliminary of the jury who saw the witness. 
    And he must ask this Court to ascribe more credibility to Dr. Proctor his expert as against Dr. Mansfield and Dr. Hoffman, and incidentally in the Court of Appeals in his own brief he conceded that Dr. Mansfield was entitled to be accorded more weight for the testimony was entitled to be accorded more weight than that of Dr. Proctor. 
    Now that, gentlemen, to me is the case here. 
    It's a question of fact. 
    We do not have an undisputed drug-induced, drug-influenced confession here. 
    We have a confession that was taken and acclaimed is made that it was drug-induced and that claim was made seven years ago in the Criminal Court of Cook County and that fact issue was found against him.

    Would you mind to tell us about that?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="5724.750" stopTime="6103.891">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    First of all, I have that in my notation. 
    Thank you very much for the suggestion because I recall the question by Mr. Justice Brennan yesterday as to whether those are before the trial court. 
    Of course, the easiest way to find out whether they're before the trial court is to look at the record from the Supreme Court of Illinois, you'll find it's not in there and it's true that Judge Butler did make some inquiries. 
    But he had to make the inquiry to rule on the objection and the best that Judge Butler did find out was that there were other crimes. 
    But Judge Butler this day on the basis of this record, doesn't know what those crimes were and neither did the Supreme Court of Illinois because the petitioner kept them out and he kept them out in the grounds where they're highly prejudicial. 
    Now, they are the Stinson, the Thompson and the Johnson item. 
    Johnson is a gentleman that was coming home and stopped at the local pub and it was late in the evening. 
    And he was hit -- as I read the medical history about here. 
    He did not die immediately. 
    And during the course of -- certain statement is made, he characterized his difficulty as a result of an action. 
    It is true that during the course of the interrogation on January 1, 1954, the petitioner did confess to the Johnson murder of the Johnson assault which later resulted in murder. 
    Now, the petitioner is trying to develop now the idea that there was no murder because the man said, it was an accident. 
    Well, I said the last time and I say once again, judging the course of the thrust of the blow and it was in the evening as I recall it, how does he know what hit him. 
    You're walking alone the street that could happen to anybody and Mr. Johnson would not be the first case of a man who was struck in the head and felt that was a result of an accident and later was found to be the result of a murder. 
    As far as the Thompson case is concerned, that's the one where he didn't remember. 
    And I believe that's the case where the hassle developed between Officer Cagney and the deputy coroner. 
    And the hassle developed precisely over this. 
    The deputy coroner had suggested that the officer go out and get some more information. 
    Well, these were December 1958 assaults and murders. 
    I think it appears in the record certainly in the coroner's inquest that Officer Cagney had been working since that time and he felt as though that he had made the case. 
    And it's over this remark about his going on to get some more dope -- dope by mean information. 
    That was the language that was used that Officer Cagney became quite excited. 
    Now, it's true that the petitioner was not represented by a counsel here. 
    Under the Illinois law, the purpose and that's primary the problem. 
    The purpose of an inquest to determine the cause of death and if there'd be a felonious death, the statute requires that person who is suspected of causing it be held over the grand jury. 
    That's the very limited power with -- of an Illinois coroner's inquest. 
    His sister was there. 
    A point was made yesterday about his reluctance to testify. 
    He was warned. 
    Now if you read the inquest, there's a pattern there. 
    When they said, “Do you want to testify?” 
    He either stood mute and I believe -- or I think he stood mute both times or shook his head no. 
    Then he asked, “Do you want to tell the story?” 
    The answer was “yes”. 
    Now, the Stinson, I don't know what happened in the Stinson case and if you look at the case on the evidence and you think the state would never have any trouble. 
    The man stole the shoes. 
    He stole the overcoat. 
    He stole the watch. 
    By the man I'm talking about the petitioner. 
    They have the man to whom he sold the -- to whom he gave the shoes and they also have the man to whom he sold the watch and he's also -- he gave the coat. 
    They go to trial. 
    They go to a jury with the finding of not guilty. 
    I appreciate counsel's argument. 
    I mean he wants to ascribe some degree of infallibility to that particular jury. 
    He was able to look into Townsend's mind and say that confession was not voluntary therefore, none of them are voluntary. 
    The best that I can say Mr. Chief Justice on that is that, to me, it establishes one thing. 
    I've mentioned it before and I think it's worth mentioning again that even in Cook County, Illinois, if for some reason or other in what the reason is here but even in Cook County, Illinois, a jury has some doubt regardless of how heinous the crime, they'll come back with the verdict of not guilty. 
    And I think when you examine that in this proper perspective, it points out that there is fairness. 
    And that we do not have a climate of sequestering and enforcing people in this situation such as it's been implied here in one remark or another.

    It's been a little while since I read the transcript of the proceeding, how far he went in his remarks.

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    First time that I remember sir that an attempt was made to bring the confessions of other crimes in the coroner's inquest picture into this proceeding was in this federal habeas corpus proceeding. 
    I don't remember it being advanced any other time on the state court's side. 
    And the reason that it was into coming back to your remark was -- is this. 
    During the course of both the preliminary hearing and the motion to suppress as well as the hearing before the jury, the counsel called the defendant for the petitioner, Mr. Branion, conducted an examination which in the view of the State's Attorney was rather broad and he sought to use this inquest for indecent purposes and he was stopped. 
    And the reason he was stopped was because counsel said they're highly prejudicial. 
    Now, that characterization was somewhat cast aside yesterday by opposing counsel but I think anybody experienced in trial or when a lawyer gets up and said it's highly prejudicial, he knows what it is and he doesn't want it in there.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, to answer Mr. Justice Harlan's question more precisely, Mr. Hladis was not representing the respondent before Judge Igoe. 
    If you look in the report of proceedings of June 12, 1959 on page 61 of the report of proceeding, I asked Judge Igoe for a full plenary hearing with the opportunity to present evidence, point three of the petitioner's brief before Judge Igoe prayed for an opportunity to be heard and Judge Igoe denied that opportunity by his memorandum order of June 24, 1959. 
    Now, Your Honor, I would like to have you accept my answer since Mr. Hladis wasn't there. 
    I asked for an opportunity to be heard, to introduce evidence to be heard in the full sense of that term. 
    Judge Igoe denied that opportunity.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="6556.838" stopTime="6558.151">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    It's at page 61 of the record --
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="6558.151" stopTime="6696.635">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    61 one, yes. 
    Yes, page 61 and if you look -- if Your Honor will please look at my brief before Judge Igoe, point three, I asked him for a hearing and urged it because I wanted an opportunity. 
    In fact, I even went out with some rather language that at least when the man is executed, when he is taken to his grave, we can all be satisfied, he had a final consideration of his question. 
    And Judge Igoe denied that opportunity. 
    Now, that closed it. 
    Judge Igoe ruled on the respondent's motion to dismiss in effect and held that he was satisfied. 
    In other words, he took the court records. 
    And to answer Mr. Justice Clark's question with regard to the confessions, I did represent this petitioner in the post-conviction petition. 
    I did refer to those confessions. 
    Now, my difficulty, if Your Honor please, is the use of the word “canvass”. 
    On a motion to dismiss, all that was done was the petition was filed. 
    I made reference of these confessions, asking for the same opportunity before Judge Butler. 
    I thought if Judge Butler had given me the opportunity to be heard, he might have been persuaded with the fact which Mr. Hladis has not answered Your Honor's question. 
    He didn't' tell you about Gus Anagnost, saying that X had assaulted him with a brick and then a moment later, they have taken a confession from Townsend after this drug injection that he had robbed Gus Anagnost. 
    You see, I was hoping that if I could ever get a judge, a trial judge, to listen to me, to hear this evidence, he might be persuaded all these confessions were like Stinson was. 
    And with regard to the Stinson prosecution, Mr. Hladis didn't touch upon the point that these items of property of the deceased found in and about Townsend's room was shown to the jury to have been in the possession of other persons. 
    That's why the jury found him not guilty. 
    That's why they acquitted him. 
    They didn't acquit him on his specious malfunctioning of the jury system. 
    They took all of it and they found him not guilty because he didn't believe the confession and I was hoping if I can get before a judge would hear the evidence, he might conclude with me that this confession of Boone case was as furious as the one in the Stinson case, a furious as the one that Gus Anagnost case, as furious as the one in the Thompson case, as furious as the one in the Johnson case. 
    That's what I want --

speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="6722.476" stopTime="6723.490">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's right, Your Honor.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No, Your Honor. 
    These were separate -- integrally separate, yes. 
    Now, one other point about Judge Hoffman and I wish to emphasize this point that when Judge Hoffman was asked this question about the identity of scopolamine and hyoscine before the jury. 
    The admissibility of the confession had been determined by Judge Butler and I have said this time and again that the only place in this record where anyone thought to ask anyone who knew about the identity of scopolamine with hyoscine was on rebut -- on surrebuttal as Mr. Hladis said, on some surrebuttal when the admissibility of the confession have been determined. 
    When the only question was the credibility to be given the confessions under the Illinois law and that matter was resolved to the jury. 
    Now Your Honors, I --

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No. 
    Your Honor, my use of that word is at the fact that the coroner's hearing indicate that in case of Johnson -- Thomas Johnson -- you see, if that confession ever was offered in evidence and the evidence of the circumstances of Johnson's death were put against it. 
    My idea of it is that it just wouldn't hold one when the man tells a doctor and his sister and everybody else that he had an accident, of course the state will say, he was hit in the head. 
    We don't know how he was hit. 
    No one saw he was hit. 
    He might have been hit by a truck. 
    We don't know. 
    People are hit in the head with trucks and other forms of accident. 
    This man said he had an accident. 
    That was my point and with regard to Gus Anagnost when the victim himself says that that's not the man and that they have a confession that he was the person. 
    You see, that's what I meant.
