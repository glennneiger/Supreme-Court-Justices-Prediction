    Mr. Jay E. Darlington 
    The -- I am here mainly to serve the Court and to answer any questions with no set -- a stereotyped speech to make but if it's agreeable I would like to state what were appealing from what I think the question is and briefly the facts as to how the question arises and what I feel is the applicable law that the petitioner was the plaintiff in a personal injury case in the District Court based upon diversity. 
    I was his attorney there. 
    It was -- and the District Court in the Fall of 1960 dismissed the case in my absence on a court sought motion without any motion for dismissal by opposing counsel and the dismissal was not purportedly based upon Rule 41 (b) of Civil -- of Civil Procedure or upon any local rule. 
    But upon -- and asserted inherent power so-called of the District Court to make the dismissal. 
    And that so-called inherent power was affirmed on appeal by a two-to-three decision. 
    The facts underlying that I think can be very briefly stated. 
    This case was filed in 1954. 
    In the spring of 1955, the defense counsel, my distinguished opponents erred -- filed a motion to dismiss the case for alleged failure of the complaint to state a cause of action. 
    And in the fall of 1955 after six months consideration, the District Court sustained that motion. 
    I appealed from it successfully and the Court of Appeals held the complaint good in order to do -- reinstate it. 
    That meant -- and instantly by opponent's petition for certiorari which took some more time and was denied. 
    So they mandate that back to the District Court in the spring of 1955 but after a delay of a couple of years caused by the defense. 
    Following that in the summer of 1957, there was a trial setting. 
    I moved too far and obtained a continuance; the general continuance with the consent of my opponent. 
    In the summer of 1959, the situation was reversed, it was against that for trial and my opponent moved for continuance to which I consented. 
    Then in the spring of 1960, my opponent filed some additional interrogatories which I answered. 
    And the next step in the case was that late in September of 1960, the District Court, acting under the -- this Local Rule 12 on pretrial which simply says that the Court may hold pretrial conference upon notice to the attorney of the case. 
    It's really a short restatement of Rule 16 of Civil Procedure adds nothing to it. 
    That notice, a mimeograph form of notice, went out to both counsel, I received it. 
    It was set for a 1 p.m. on October 12, Columbus Day, fell on a Wednesday. 
    Beginning Monday morning, I was engaged as the record shows, in preparing urgent papers of an undescribed nature to be filed in the Supreme Court of Indiana -- I was -- at Indianapolis, a 160 miles distance from the seat of this District Court. 
    And the record shows that my opponent conceded that -- that on Tuesday the 11th, I called him on the telephone, told him what I was doing and that I thought I could make that pretrial conference the next afternoon and I expected to be there. 
    It turned out Wednesday forenoon that I couldn't make it. 
    I -- like some lawyers maybe I was (Inaudible) 
    I had -- unable to finish this job, these papers that we're committed to the Supreme Court of -- at Indianapolis. 
    And while they're not described, I think it can be assumed that -- that I was acting in good faith in completing that job but there's no affidavit, no showing to the contrary. 
    At any rate, the -- the record shows that on that forenoon; that Wednesday forenoon, I called the judge of the District Court, and being able to reach and talk to his secretary, I told her that I was still working on papers for the Supreme Court. 
    I couldn't get there that afternoon. 
    I would be there the next afternoon, 24 hours later or the day after that or any day that was convenient for the Court or counsel.

    Oh, yes. 
    Yes Your Honor and the -- was not going -- I didn't think it was appropriate to go into detail with the secretary as to the nature or the necessity of the work I was doing. 
    I told her I was preparing for the papers for the Supreme Court of -- of Indiana. 
    Actually they were committed to be filed that day but I didn't go into that. 
    That at any rate, that afternoon after waiting for sometime, the -- before, I -- I don't know why because it was known I couldn't be there but anyway, at 3 p.m. that the matter was called for pretrial conference and a pretrial conference was held ex parte the -- between the District Judge and my opponent that at which my opponent said, "Yes, I had called him the day before", and said, "I thought I could make it, I expect you to be there", and the -- the secretary was called in and related substantially of what I have stated. 
    And then His Honor said to my opposing counsel that -- that -- if I may read one short paragraph, "Under the circumstances, what is your thinking Mr. Bodle?" 
    There was no motion then by my opponent or at any time during that hearing, written or oral to dismiss this case. 
    Mr. Bodle announced this legal doctrine to the Court which was adopted by the District Court, substantially adopted by the Court of Appeals yet the question here is substantial whether the doctrine is right or not, whether its dangerous or not. 
    Rest of it is at the bottom page 13 of the transcript. 
    "Mr. Bodle, I would certainly suggest to the Court that it has an inherent authority to dismiss cases not only under its own local rule concerning prosecution but it has an inherent power without any specific rule by virtue of Federal Rule 83 and the inherent power of the Court to dismiss where the Court fix if necessary under the particular situations not provided for by any specific local rule." 
    Well the -- after some discussion about the -- my being to blame for not being there which is not important. 
    I don't consider I'm one the trial particularly except to say that I never have conceded below that -- that if I did any wrong. 
    I don't think I did -- I think that I did my best but that's not the point. 
    The proceeding ended with this statement; this directive of the District Court. 
    The Court now directs the clerk to enter in order to this effect pursuant to the inherent -- this is page 68, pursuant to the inherent powers of the Court and upon failure of plaintiff's counsel to appear at pretrial which was scheduled for the day and so on, pursuant to notice under Rule of 12. 
    Counsel having failed to give any good and sufficient reason for not appearing at that pretrial, the cause is now dismissed. 
    And we go over to the majority opinion at page 21 and we find the paragraph which I think is embedded in a little confused argument in the opinion if I may say so, but the crux of it is there at the bottom of page 21. 
    If I may I read it, "The plaintiff argues that there was no motion by defendant for a dismissal since the trial court did not base its dismissal on Local Rule 11 or on Rule 41 (b) of Federal Rules Civil Procedure for want of prosecution. 
    No such motion was required." 
    It is quite clear to us that the District Courts have ample authority to regulate their practice in any manner not inconsistent with the Federal Rules so on as provided in Rule 83. 
    This case comes within the purview of that rule. 
    The Court then goes on to say that my argument to the contrary as to sheer sophistry to -- and that the trial court has inherent power to do what? 
    To enforce its rules, orders or procedures. 
    I call attention to procedures; it's a pretty broad loose term and to impose appropriate sanctions for failure to comply. 
    The authorities are all against me the court says. 
    Judge Schnackenberg dissented. 
    He points out that the dismissal was not based upon want of prosecution that as indeed the majority opinion had said, "If it has been the defendant wouldn't have been in the very good position because the defendant had caused two years of delay in the case, much expense to my client and myself by causing that unnecessary appeal to get back in court again." 
    And at the last time the case was set for trial. 
    It was postponed generally at his request to which I consented. 
    I had offered and conveyed to the judge my desire to be there the next afternoon 24 hours later. 
    Now the -- that raises questions which depend not on any federal statute. 
    It does involve the Fifth Amendment if this Court cares to invoke it because if my accusation is going to be correct, I think the plaintiff has been deprived of his property that is his cause of action without the presence of law. 
    I think the Court has the option to reverse on that ground if it thinks the case shouldn't be reversed. 
    I think the Court likewise has the option to bypass the constitutional question and decided on an interpretation of the rules. 
    At least the division of power between the Courts and the extent to which District Courts can go unrestricted by anything definite either in the Rules of Civil Procedure or anything in their own rules just for their inherent power on the spur of the moment. 
    As counsel announced to the Court and this was upheld. 
    Our contention is that the -- that is a dangerous doctrine that if allowed to persist and it will persist as a precedent that unless reversed here that it would make the -- the Rules of Civil Procedure to -- a hollow shelf that no lawyer could rely on. 
    The same would be true of the local rules. 
    You couldn't even rely on the local rules. 
    You'll find in my brief, I quoted that on -- the Court's own Local Rule 7th which says on page 6 of the brief, "Motions to dismiss for summary judgment for a judgment on the pleadings shall be accompanied by a brief and adverse party shall have 15 days to file an answer and so on." 
    In that respect, the protection that was given to me and other parties by that Local Rule, it's greater than is spelled out on Rule 41 (b) did. 
    Now the -- I have studied my opponent's cases as well as I can and particularly the two decisions of this Court that he refers to in the text (Inaudible) Moore's that he refers to and the other cases. 
    Incidentally, Mr. Moore's text is based -- cites only the Wisdom case. 
    The District Court case in Alabama where the -- the dismissal was under Rule 41 (b) and the defendant had made a motion for dismissal. 
    Now, in that case as in many others which counsel cites, there are some dicta, there's some loose language about the inherent powers of courts to dismiss cases and to apply sanctions. 
    And I don't deny the sanctions but how about dismissal, how about final disposal, final judgement that had some serious matter that (Inaudible) -- there is not a single solid holding that I know of by this Court or certainly not by this Court or by any other court except the dicta that I have mentioned which is -- supports this doctrine. 
    And if there were below, it certainly wouldn't bind this Court. 
    That's what this Court seats for. 
    And I haven't time to elaborate. 
    I don't need to elaborate. 
    Just please consider the -- what shape the practice is going to be in and all of the confusion like of uniformity, all the aggrieved parties coming up here for relief the same as I am that should the procedure be tightened up, should that -- or should it be left the way this precedent leaves it.

    Thank you Mr. Darlington.

   Argument of John Bodle
speaker="john_bodle" startTime="1230.248" stopTime="1650.593">
    Mr. John Bodle 
    May it please the Court. 
    The counsel for the petitioner in his brief although not in oral argument today has asserted that there is no power in the Federal District Courts to dismiss actions of their own volition for disobedience of court orders or court settings or court rules. 
    This is not the case. 
    The rule of law is well established to the contrary. 
    We have the cases or some of the more recent cases outlined in our brief at pages 11 through 14. 
    And it's simply indisputable. 
    This Court has recognized in passing that the trial courts still has sua sponte powers to enforce sanctions including dismissal of their own motion. 
    The federal rules have certainly not removed those powers and Federal Rule 83, the situation, the Rule which allows the Court to govern itself in unusual situations where there is no standing rule is applicable here. 
    And of course Rule 41 (b) which talks about motions by defendants for dismissals also contains within itself a reference to other dismissals not provided for herein. 
    The counsel for the petitioner would have the courts strike down these long-recognized and frequently exercised powers. 
    There is nothing new or nothing noble on what was done by the trial court in this case. 
    On behalf of the respondents, we submit that the preservation of this powers of trial court is necessary to the efficient operation of the courts in the scheduling of their procedures and their settings that their application in this case was justified by the facts which I'll consider in a moment. 
    And that this Court accordingly should affirm the dismissal which was granted below and which was approved by the Seventh Circuit. 
    There's no constitutional question here since the basic power to act in the manner in which the trial court did act is well established by the cases. 
    The only possible question is the exercise of discretion by the trial court, was it within its discretion to grant the dismissal sua sponte as it did on -- and was entitled to do so under the particular circumstances of this case. 
    Now, of course any case involving exercise of discretion will stand and fall on its own facts. 
    Nevertheless, we have cited a number of cases in our brief clearly recognizing the propriety of dismissing actions sua sponte for disregard of pretrial settings. 
    I'll now refer to those cases in a moment. 
    We submit that to affirm the result below will be to follow the existing state of the law and will not be part from more effect, the present state of the law in any regard. 
    But then on the other hand, a reversal would have serious consequences and that it would impinge upon the powers of the trial courts to regulate their business which would be most unfortunate view of the continuing congestion problem in our courts. 
    Turning to the facts, I'd like to reexamine very briefly. 
    We have for purposes of this case and action that was filed in March of 1957 since that's when the court -- the trial court got the case back on remand. 
    Now at no time since March 1957 and indeed at no time prior to the first appeal did the plaintiff ever make any move to carry this case forward by the smallest step. 
    There was never a request for a setting. 
    There were never any interrogatories spelled. 
    There was never any action taken by the plaintiff on the record in this case to move the case along. 
    Now two years after the remand in the spring of 1959, and this is the point which my opponent omits from his brief and from his argument today. 
    The trial court brought the matter up of its own volition for possible dismissal for failure to prosecute under its one rule, under the 20-year rule. 
    After keeping that matter under advisement for a couple of months, the Court did decide to leave the case on the docket which I certainly think and submit to the Court shows that the trial judge was not dead-set against this case and was not determined to get rid of the case. 
    There have been absolutely no activity for two years and still he let us stay on the docket. 
    Now another year and four months went by and still there was no action whatsoever by the plaintiff. 
    Finally, in October of 1960 or actually at the end of September 1960, the trial court sent out notices of the pretrial. 
    This was done pursuant to a valid local rule based upon Federal Rule 16 and accordingly, as this Court said many years ago in Weil versus Neary having any force and effect of law. 
    Nothing happened and until about two hours before the pretrial when this telephone call came from Indianapolis. 
    Plaintiff's counsel talking to the secretary said in the fact that he was staying on in Indianapolis to take care of some other unspecified business and an unrelated manner -- matter. 
    Now it's obvious I submit that on these facts, petitioner's counsel was not the innocent victim of some unforeseen circumstance created by someone else which prevented his attendance. 
    That is an imaginative version but it will not fit within the framework. 
    We -- all of us have many different cases to work on but we -- all of us, as officers of the Court or allegiance to the Court and to its trial settings. 
    The trial courts and not trial counsel are in charge of the trial dockets and trial schedules. 
    There's no contention here by the petitioner that the Court was obligated to grant its continuance. 
    And of course only the trial court knew when its affairs would again permit the matter to be brought on for pretrial. 
    The petitioner's counsel is not entitled to bargain with the Court by telephone to say, "Well I -- I just can't make it today, I've got something more important on. 
    Now, I'll just show up in the next day or two and we can take care of it then.

    But secondly, I think that application of that rule is entirely just in this case because if -- a perfectly reasonable inference from the long delay and long inaction, the plaintiff never once tried and move his case ahead and if he treasured the case and thought it was valid and valuable I think he would've done so and I submit to the Court that the --

    The District Court has a one year rule permitting dismissal where a case has been inactive for that amount of time.

    By the same talking, the courts often have power to make a decision and then a notice period is granted and of additional facts are desired to be presented. 
    They are presented as in a case where a third party complaint is filed or counterclaim is filed. 
    The party can be heard and the action set aside.

    Mr. John Bodle 
    No, Your Honor and this is the last point I want to make. 
    I think this is of greatest significance because if there had been any facts which the counsel wanted to bring before the trial court to try to explain exactly what is undisclosed alleged work in another city was and he never filed any affidavit or anything about that. 
    He could have and we submit should have in fairness to this Court come before the trial court and said, "Now here are my facts. 
    I want a complete hearing."

    Now, he didn't have to proceed that way, I don't contend for that for the moment but I do say that if he chooses not to then let him not complain that he had no opportunity for a hearing because the opportunity was there and he elected not to take advantage of it.
