    Pursuing the question that I had before lunch with Mr. Justice Stewart and I apologize for misnaming Mr. -- Mr. Justice Whittaker.

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    On the Barnette case on the flag salute, I want to make quite plain that our position is that the flag salute even before the words "under God" were put into it was regarded as a religious right by the Jehovah's Witnesses and was so treated by this Court. 
    The Jehovah's Witnesses thought that the flag salute even without those words was the worship of graven images and exposed a participant to power of damnation and if my friends are right in their contention, any conscientious, agnostic or atheist can object to the flag salute in its present form and cannot merely ask to have it -- have his child excused but can ask to have it embo -- abolished and that is the case that's now pending in the New York Court of Appeals. 
    And any conscientious Jehovah's Witness and the Jehovah's Witnesses are not unknown in this Court as litigants. 
    Any Jehovah's Witness could say that the flag salute without those words should be abolished for the whole school room so that his child should not be pointed out as different. 
    And the Jehovah's Witness child is put -- is marked off as considerably different because in the case of the flag salute, there is an open gesture prescribed and a child who doesn't say it can be spotted right away. 
    A child who doesn't want to say this prayer can just keep silent and not say it at all. 
    I take one further step in our national heritage and that is the words "In God We Trust" which were declared to be our national motto. 
    I regret to say that the very same organization which is publicly announced that is sponsoring this case has gone off record as saying that it's a violation of the First Amendment to have the words "In God We Trust" displayed on the walls of the public school where a child can read it. 
    I presume the same organization would say that it was unconstitutional to read or to teach these words from the Constitution of Iowa, "We the people of the State of Iowa, grateful to the Supreme Being for the blessings he thereto enjoyed and feeling our dependence on him for a continuance of those blessings." 
    Or this from New Jersey, "We the people of the State of New Jersey, grateful to Almighty God for the civil and religious liberty which he has so long permitted as to enjoy and looking to him for a blessing upon our endeavours to secure and transmit the same unimpaired to succeeding generations," or this from Texas, "Humbly invoking the blessings of Almighty God." 
    The plain fact is that as this Court has said, such things run through our national history and our national heritage and it would, in the view of the parents whom I represent, be a warping of our national heritage forcibly to rewrite the curriculum of every public school to extend everything that slants in that direction yet nothing less than that is what my friends are now asking. 
    I do not ask my friends to --

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    This -- this is my position that it -- it is part if our national heritage to have this kind of thing including the principles of the declaration of independence and that if a school board having in mind local sentiment and responsive to local needs, feels that it is appropriate to include that sort of thing in the curriculum. 
    It is a -- I won't say a destruction but in an impairment and infringement of our children's rights to share in what we regard as our national heritage to have that excluded on the suit of petitioners who have not a cent of pocket book injury who claim that this prayer is not particularly objectionable and who have shown no compulsion and no coercion against themselves. 
    We object to their dictating to an unwilling school board and to unwilling parents their theory of national history and national heritage.

    I think it would be a step in the direction of denying us a share in the religious heritage of the country which we feel is part of a proper educational system. 
    That's the best answer I can give (Voice Overlap) I would not go so far as to say that we can mandamus the school board to compel it to put this in.

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    I would take the latter Your Honor. 
    I would say -- I would agree with Your Honor in that definition of secular. 
    Now secular in the sense of extending any mention of God from our national history and from our education is not the kind of secularism that I think the First Amendment contemplated.

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    Well is it religious training?
