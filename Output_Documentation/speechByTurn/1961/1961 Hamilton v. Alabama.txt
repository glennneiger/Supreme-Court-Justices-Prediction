    Number 32, Charles Clarence Hamilton, Petitioner, versus Alabama.

speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="17.297" stopTime="576.691">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here pursuant to the provisions of Title 28, United States Code Section 13 -- Section 1257 (3), petitioner having asserted below in here rights secured by the constitution of the United States. 
    The rights asserted below and here are rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution specifically the unqualified right to counsel in every stage of the capital case and the right to a trial on a capital charge which afforded the petitioner a fair hearing. 
    Now, this case is here for the second time. 
    Petitioner first sought to have this Court review his case during the October 1959 term when he petitioned this Court to grant a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama affirming his conviction on a charge of burglary with intent to ravish for which he had been sentenced to death. 
    In that petition, the petitioner claimed, as he now claims, that he had been denied due process of law in that he had not had counsel at the time of arraignment. 
    And in that he was denied the fundamentals of a fair trial. 
    On his appeal from his conviction to the Supreme Court of Alabama, he made this same claim. 
    Now with respect to the first claims, the Supreme Court of Alabama ruled that it had no quarrel with the petitioner's claims right to counsel in a capital case where the accused is unable to afford counsel and the petitioner's claim of right to counsel at the time of arraignment. 
    But the court ruled that these principles were without application to the case before it because the record on its face read that the petitioner was represented by counsel at the time of the arraignment. 
    Petitioner sought to prove by reference to a certified copy of the bench notes of the trial judge that he had not in fact then represented by a counsel at the time of his arraignment. 
    But the Supreme Court of Alabama ruled that the state law precluded impeachment of the minute entry of record which showed that counsel was present at the time of arraignment and at the time of trial. 
    In his October petition to this Court from that ruling of the Supreme Court of Alabama, petitioner asked this Court to find as a fact that he did not have counsel at the time of arraignment, that this deprived him of due process of law, and that the conduct of the trial in view of the representations of this petitioner by his court-appointed counsel among other things did not make due process requirements. 
    Now, in opposition to that first petition for certiorari in 1959, the State of Alabama filed a brief in opposition thereto. 
    And on pages five and six of that brief, the state said this, “The burden is not on the State of Alabama to explain the fancy inconsistency as to why the minute entry of the record shows that the defendant did have counsel at his arraignment and yet his trial counsel was apparently appointed three days later.” 
    Actually, the counsel in the particular case have appointed quite some time prior to the official judgment entry to defend the petitioner on a previous indictment and remained assigned as counsel to the defendant throughout and including the day of arraignment on the second indictment. 
    The two entries of judgment are not in conflict and the statement by the petitioner that the defendant was deprived of counsel at the time of his arraignment is pure conjecture on the part of the petitioner's counsel. 
    Then Alabama pointed out that however, petitioner still had available to him another remedy to attack the judgment entry in this case with extrinsic matter. 
    That method it said was by writ of error coram nobis. 
    This Court refused to review that decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama affirming his conviction. 
    Now after that, the petitioner then filed in the Supreme Court of Alabama a petition for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis in the trial court. 
    In that petition he alleged that he had been indicted on November 9th, 1956 for the crime of burglary in the nighttime with intent to steal. 
    Arraigned on this charge on January 4th, 1957 at which time his counsel Mr. Mayfield was appointed and entered a plea of not guilty. 
    Trial was set for January 14th, 1957 but was passed four times until April 24th, 1957 when the case was now crossed on recommendation of the Solicitor. 
    Now in this petition for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis, petitioner also pointed out that on February 12, 1957 before the first indictment was nolle pros, he was indicted the second time by the grand jury. 
    This time he was indicted for burglary with intent to steal in one count and burglary with intent to ravish. 
    He was arraigned on this second indictment on March 1st, 1957 at which time he again pleaded not guilty but this time without the aid, advice or representation of counsel. 
    Counsel is not appointed for him he alleged until March 4th, 1957. 
    Now this allegation was supported by the affidavit of the petitioner's trial counsel which was attached to his petition in which he stated that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, he was not present at the arraignment on March 1st and that he did not advise or consult with the defendant. 
    In addition to the affidavit which was submitted by the petitioner (Inaudible) counsel, the State of Alabama submitted an affidavit from the trial counsel in which he again said that he had been appointed to represent the petitioner with respect to his first indictment, later nolle pros, and that on March 4th, 1957, he was appointed to represent petitioner with respect to the second indictment that is three days after the second arraignment. 
    That he knew of the indictment prior to its being returned by the grand jury, that he was aware of the second indictment and arraignment which he stated occurred on March 1st, 1957 that he considered himself as representing the defendant. 
    And that the arraignment was done with his knowledge and consent although he was not present. 
    He alleged that he would not have entered any different plea from the plea of guilty entered by petitioner had he been at the arraignment, and finally he alleged that he considered the arraignment a mere formality, since the same plea would have been entered which was entered on the first arraignment, and that this was his reason for not representing petitioner on March 1st on his second arraignment. 
    Now in addition to these two affidavits, there was a third affidavit. 
    This one was filed by the deputy second Solicitor who prosecuted the case in which he alleged that he had spoken to the Mr. Mayfield, the petitioner's court-appointed counsel informing him that there no indictment was being procured and later told him that the new two count indictments had been returned and that the petitioner would be arraigned. 
    However, none of these affidavits indicates whether Mr. Mayfield actually sought the second indictment with the more serious crime. 
    The prosecutor alleged that the --

    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Well, the statute says with intent to steal or intent to commit a felony. 
    Now in this indictment he was charged with intent to ravish which is nowhere defined on the statute. 
    But the statute does of course forbid rape but he was not charged in the words of the statute with intent -- to commit a felony. 
    He was charged with intent to ravish.

    One can be sentenced to death in this state simply for a burglary --

    With intent --

    -- with intent to --

    -- to steal.

    -- to commit petty larceny?
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="658.446" stopTime="818.778">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    With intent to commit a felony and with intent to steal. 
    Now as I -- I'm sorry. 
    Was that all your -- as I started to say, the state said that the reason for the appointment on March 4th was necessary in order to ensure that this lawyer get his fee of $50 or $100, and that the record had to show it so that he could be paid when the trial was over, and this was the reason for the subsequent appointment. 
    Now upon considering petitioner's application in which all of these facts were alleged for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis, the Supreme Court of Alabama held that the petitioner had followed the proper procedure. 
    It also found as a fact that petitioner was not represented by counsel at time of arraignment. 
    It ruled that it was not bound by the minute entries that had been on the appeal and so they could find this as a fact. 
    The Alabama Court then held that the law of the state placed upon the trial court the obligation to see that the petitioner here had counsel because this was a capital offense and that he had such counsel before he was arraigned and called upon to plea. 
    It pointed out that there was no decision in Alabama expressly so ruling but that this had been the almost uniform practice of the Circuit Courts of Alabama for many years and that the very purpose of the statute would seem to dictate such action. 
    It also held that the petitioner should have been represented by counsel at arraignment, but refused to grant the petition on the ground that this fact standing alone was not prima facie just ground for granting the thing. 
    The Alabama Court acknowledged this Court's decision of course in Powell against Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 and held that the right to counsel is not a right confined to representation during the trial on the merits citing this Court's decision in Moore against Michigan, that's 355 U.S. 155. 
    However, it ruled that in this case, there was no denial of due process since the petitioner had failed to show that he was not prejudiced by the absence of counsel at his arraignment.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="818.778" stopTime="844.115">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Could I make you -- ask you a question, did the Supreme Court of Alabama make any finding with respect to the truth of Mr. Mayfield's statement that he considered himself to be this man's lawyer shortly after the second indictment was found though he had been formally reappointed so to speak?
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="844.115" stopTime="895.967">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    No.I don't believe it did. 
    I think the only thing it found as the fact was that he was not present on March 1st, 1957 when the man was arraigned on the second indictment. 
    It referred to his affidavit and said that he pointed out that he would not have entered any different plea had he been present at the time as I recall but I don't recall any specific finding as you suggest. 
    The Alabama Court ruled that the petitioner's counsel had been appointed three days after arraignment whose competence was not questioned and who was searched in an affidavit as I've just said that he would not have entered a different plea. 
    Finally, that court ruled that there is no --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="895.967" stopTime="896.193">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Excuse me, Mrs. Motley --
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="896.193" stopTime="896.757">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    -- suggestion.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="896.757" stopTime="898.908">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- what was the plea on the second time, it was also not guilty?
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="898.908" stopTime="1237.356">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Not guilty, that's right. 
    Finally, that Court ruled that there is no suggestion that the guilty plea interposed an arraignment in absence of counsel prevented the filing of any other plea or motion. 
    Now this Court -- this petitioner now asked this Court to review this judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    The record filed in this case with this new petitioner causes supplemented by the record which was filed here in 1959 with the first petition for certiorari. 
    And petitioner asked this Court to take judicial notice of that record as the Supreme Court of Alabama might have done upon its review of petitioner's request for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis. 
    Now this record shows that the petitioner, an indigent Negro was convicted by the courts of Alabama of burglary with intent to ravish and sentenced to death on April 23rd, 1957. 
    Now the testimony on the trial I think is far from clear but it shows that the petitioner was convicted on the night of October 12th, 1956 or the early morning hours of October 13th, 1956. 
    At that time, petitioner was found in the bedroom of an elderly white woman in Ensley, Alabama by the woman's grandson by marriage who live in the same house who testified that petitioner was indecently exposed when found. 
    The petitioner testified that he was summoned into the house by the woman who gave him the impression that she had been robbed and sought help. 
    He testified that he could not understand her because he spoke with a foreign accent, and that whenever he attempted to leave, she prevented him because she insisted on his helping her, whatever her plight might have been. 
    The grandchildren called the police who arrested the petitioner. 
    There was some testimony concerning the lock on the door of the room which petitioner was found -- in which petitioner was found, a door which led from the porch into the room. 
    But it was not demonstrated that this lock had been broken. 
    It appears that while the windows and doors had been secured and so forth, the door in the porch was open. 
    In addition, although there was testimony that the petitioner was indecently exposed, Mrs. Giangrosso, the elderly woman who was the alleged intended victim of the rape did not testify. 
    Petitioner's counsel called her for testimony during the trial but since she had not been subpoenaed she did not appear and no effort was made to secure her attendance. 
    There was no evidence that there was any rape, violence or physical injury at any time which occurred to alleged intended victim or anyone else, neither was there evidence that petitioner had any weapons, burglary tools or the like. 
    Now, the trial of this capital case have started at 11 o'clock in the morning and terminated at 4:10 in the afternoon with an hour and 40 minutes for lunch. 
    When the case came on for trial the petitioner got up and said to the trial court, “This is not my lawyer, he was appointed by the Court.” 
    The trial counsel then got up and asked to withdraw from the case. 
    All of these occurred in the presence of the jury because petitioner had indicated his dissatisfaction with his counsel, the Court didn't inquire as to the basis of it. 
    He merely asked him if he had other counsels and he said no. 
    The Court then invited the petitioner to participate in his own defense and said that he could ask questions after the counsel had completed examinations. 
    And during the course of the trial, the petitioner made a bungling, inept effort to defend himself. 
    He interrupted the Court and argued with witnesses for which he was reprimanded by the Court throughout the trial in the presence of the jury. 
    The trial concluded with a lengthy charge to the jury which nowhere defined intent to ravish and to which no objections were taken by the trial counsel. 
    Petitioner himself argued to the jury but as he said in his own words, he did not understand the charge. 
    The verdict of course was guilty and the petitioner was sentenced to death. 
    Upon this review, petitioner claims first that his right to counsel in a capital case may not be qualified as the Supreme Court of Alabama has qualified it, by superimposing upon this right a requirement that he shows some qualitative disadvantage flowing from the denial of the right to counsel at time of arraignment. 
    Petitioner also claims that even assuming for the purposes of this argument that a showing of disadvantage is required, the record in this case demonstrates that the petitioner was denied a fair hearing.

    Of course if the Mayfield affidavit is taken as true, he did have counsel at the time of the arraignment but he didn't have counsel who, for one reason or another, showed up at the time of the arraignment?

    And let's assume that's the federal law too, presumingly. 
    Is what you've got here a due process claim that says that at least as to court-appointed counsel, the due process requires that the state not proceed without requiring counsel to be present at the arraignment. 
    Is that the real issue in this case?

    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Well, I would like to clarify something, Your Honor and that is that Mr. Mayfield was not actually appointed until after the petitioner had been arraigned because --

    -- with him prior to that second arraignment, so that he was not his lawyer, we'd say, at the time of the arraignment. 
    He was his lawyer on the trial and he was appointed after the arraignment. 
    And our claim is that he had -- this petitioner had an absolute right to counsel at the time of arraignment, and that that abridgement of that right denies him due process of law.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1336.344" stopTime="1366.163">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But Mayfield also says unless I'm mistaken, understanding of his affidavit, that shortly after the indictment of February, the second indictment, the ravishing, he was told by the district attorney that the indictment had been found that he considered himself this man's lawyer. 
    But that for reasons of his own, whatever they were, he just didn't show up at the arraignment.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, if you'd -- if you'd take those facts as established, then what you have got here as a due process claim it seems to me, is whether or not even though he had a lawyer in a nominal sense, the payor of the lawyer who appear who was such ineffective representation and denied due process, or that as a matter of law at least as to court-appointed counsel, the state cannot proceed unless that lawyer is required to show up.

    Mrs. Motley, did not -- do I understand you in your reply to Justice Harlan's question to imply that there is no other question before this Court but the constitutional significance to be derived from Mr. Mayfield or to be based on Mr. Mayfield's own affidavit, namely, that although he was aware, I don't know how he -- if that's what they -- as the Attorney General would indicate, although Mr. Mayfield said he knew of the indictment before it was handed down by the grand jury, that after it was handed down, he knew of his place, that he knew the effect -- he was aware of the indictment and the arraignment thereon, and that he was aware of the indictment, meaning he -- I should think a fair reading means not merely that he knew there was an indictment, that he knew that there was -- what was in it, that's subject to controversy, I suppose. 
    That he knew all the circumstances of the reindictment, the prospective arraignment that he purposely abstained from being present at the arraignment for whatever reasons. 
    That the arraignment came and the plea of not guilty was made and he swear that he would've made the same plea. 
    Now, there's nothing else in the case, is there, Mrs. Motley than what consequences -- constitutional consequences are to be drawn from those circumstances?

    Yes sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1926.929" stopTime="1955.206">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mrs. Motley, in order that I might be oriented on it, do I understand there are two prongs to your argument about representation of counsel. 
    First, there was actually no counsel there to represent him and secondly, that he didn't have any counsel in this case because he was not appointed by the court to represent the man in this case until three days after the arraignment?
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="1955.206" stopTime="1956.158">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    That's right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1956.158" stopTime="1961.155">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="1961.155" stopTime="2219.742">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Now, as I've pointed out, the law in Alabama is clear that he had this right to counsel. 
    And that the right was qualified by Alabama by this ruling which it has made that in order to show a denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, the petitioner was found to show prejudice to him from this fact. 
    Now, we say that the right to counsel in a capital case of this kind is so essential that it cannot be qualified as the Supreme Court of Alabama has qualified it. 
    In so ruling, the Supreme Court of Alabama relied on several lower, federal, and state court cases. 
    It also relied upon this Court's decision in Canizio against New York, 327 U.S. 82, a noncapital case in which the defendant who plead guilty was not represented by counsel at the time of arraignment. 
    There this Court ruled that under the circumstances of that case, no denial of due process had been shown and then the Alabama Supreme Court relied on two other decisions of this Court, one, Gayes against New York, 332 U.S. 145, another noncapital case in which it was shown that the petitioner waived his right to counsel. 
    The same with the case of Quicksall against Michigan, 339 U.S.660 in a capital case on which Alabama relied. 
    But, there again, it was clear that the petitioner there had waived his right to counsel so that the Alabama Court did not have any decision of this Court on which to rely. 
    It relied upon cases of this Court which were either noncapital cases or cases at which the petitioner had actually waived his right to counsel. 
    Here of course, the petitioner was charged with a capital case and he certainly didn't waive his right to counsel. 
    And so we say that in a capital case of this kind, at every stage, it is so essential to have a counsel that to deprive him of counsel at the time of arraignment is in itself a denial of due process. 
    As Mr. Justice Stewart said in the concurring opinion in Spano against New York, 360 U.S. 315, at page 327, a case involving coerced confession in which the defendant was without counsel at the time, he confessed following indictment. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Stewart said this, “Under our system of justice, an indictment is supposed to be followed by an arraignment and trial. 
    At every stage in those proceedings, the accused has an absolute right to a lawyer's help if the case is one in which the death penalty may be imposed”, citing Powell against Alabama. 
    What this Court said in Von Moltke against Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 723 is clearly applicable here. 
    Arraignment, this Court said is too important a step in a criminal proceeding to give such wholly inadequate representation. 
    Arraignment is considered so crucial as step in a criminal proceeding that in 19 states, the law provides for appointment of counsel for indigent defendants at arraignments in virtually all felony prosecution. 
    Now, in the appendix to appellee -- to this petitioner's brief, we have set forth all of the law of the various states on the right to counsel at time of arraignment. 
    Under Alabama law, arraignment is the time to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity as we have pointed out. 
    And the failure to answer the plea at that time means that your right to do so is lost. 
    You may then make a motion which is then wholly within the discretion of the trial court and the Alabama Supreme Court has so ruled. 
    So that an arraignment --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2219.742" stopTime="2228.839">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Didn't the -- didn't the Alabama Court say in this or I'm mistaken that in this case, he could've made any alternative or additional plea subsequent to the indictment --
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2228.839" stopTime="2229.474">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Yes. 
    He could have.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2229.474" stopTime="2230.105">

    -- couldn't be?
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2230.105" stopTime="2247.518">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    But you say it was not an absolute right. 
    He lost that because he didn't make it at arraignment and he didn't make it we say because he had no counsel. 
    He was not himself educated enough to make any such plea. 
    He didn't know what could've been done except to plea guilty or not guilty.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2247.518" stopTime="2251.369">
    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. George D. Mentz 
    As we understand this case, the primary question presented is whether or not denial of counsel at arraignment in a state capital case in and of itself violates due process. 
    Now, if the Court agrees with our contention that it does not, then the second question is whether the facts in this particular case present such a showing of fundamental unfairness as to warrant a determination that by -- due process has been violated. 
    As to the first question, namely whether such denial per se violates due process, I think it is significant in Alabama, arraignment is merely a calling of the accused to the bar of the court, and reading or explaining the indictment to him, and demanding his plea.

    Mr. George D. Mentz 
    Yes sir. 
    Now, our statute does prescribe that an indigent charged with a capital offence shall have court-appointed counsel to represent him. 
    And our State Supreme Court recognizing that the right to representation by counsel is not a right limited to a trial on the merits stated that Hamilton should have been represented by counsel at this certain arraignment. 
    However, on his appeal, Hamilton ineptly attempted to dispute the minute entry of March the 1st and the judgment entry of April the 23rd, both of which showed that he was represented by counsel on his arraignment on March 1st. 
    He did this by offering his evidence only the judges' bench notes and under our procedure that is not permissible.

    And that was why his appeal failed and this Court denied certiorari when it was brought up here. 
    Now, his subsequent petition for coram nobis which was supported by competent evidence showing that Hamilton did not have counsel at arraignment failed because it did not allege or offer evidence showing that he was disadvantaged or prejudiced in anyway by such denial of representation. 
    Our courts have said that in the extraordinary writ of coram nobis that a mere naked allegation that a constitutional right has been invaded will not suffice. 
    And it simply followed a doctrine which was restated by this Court in Darcy versus Handy -- well, and this is a very short quotation. 
    It is not asking too much that the burden of showing essential on fairness be sustained by him who claims such injustice and seeks to have the result set aside and that it be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality.

    Did I misunderstood, Mr. Mentz, but I thought your court accepted petitioner's showing that he was not represented at the arraignment and said -- but there is no showing that this disadvantaged him and therefore, the writ is denied.

    That's a different thing than if he made it to appear affirmatively, the petitioner did, that it did not injure him, but I should think that if he has a -- an unqualified right to counsel at his arraignment, then some inference of injury flows and he has no further burden at least until someone -- the state has gone forward.

    I -- that's all I can say.

    Mr. Attorney General, how would you distinguish legally this factual situation from the one where he was -- we'll say he was denied counsel at his trial, at the actual trial? 
    Supreme Court says here the burden is on him although he has a constitutional right to counsel this time, the burden is on him to prove that he was prejudiced.

    The case before us isn't a case where under state law, arraignment is a mere formality, as you've indicated a little while ago, meaning by that, I don't know whether any state deal with the hypothesis which I'm about to give. 
    Meaning by that that the state has a statute which says at all arraignment, a plea of not guilty is to be assumed to be entered, and every question of law either attacking the indictment for insufficiency or for the makeup of the grand jury or for whatnot, prejudice of the judge, defense of insanity, alibi whatnot, all defenses are completely opened and must be initiated when the case is called for trial.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you take it's the meaning of it?
speaker="george_d_mentz" startTime="4624.074" stopTime="4897.300">
    Mr. George D. Mentz 
    That is my personal interpretation. 
    Now, but in line with Canizio case, while it was discretionary with the trial court, the trial court nevertheless had the authority to grant any of these motions that I just mentioned. 
    Now, furthermore, inasmuch as this Court refused to review a federal appellate court, amended 1955, the Court seemingly recognized the principle that representation by counsel at arraignment in a state court is not mandatory even in a capital case. 
    I refer to State versus Sullivan in which the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that where an accused charged with murder entered a plea of not guilty and is immediately thereafter furnished with counsel for the preparation for the trial, for the trial itself, and proposed trial proceedings, that the sentenced rendered is not void. 
    In that case, the court found that there was a complete failure of any showing that at any juncture in the criminal case, the accused was denied any substantive or procedural right which might have been available to him except for such plea. 
    The court logically reasoned that the petitioner did not suffer any proscription or disadvantage arising out of the plea of not guilty. 
    And therefore, that there was no violation of due process or any impingement of fundamental rights. 
    And we submit that in this case that there is a somewhat situation, a comparable situation. 
    While counsel was not appointed immediately, he was appointed three days later, after the arraignment, he was appointed 50 days prior to the trial. 
    And in line with State versus Sullivan, I think there's a very close analogy. 
    And as I say, in his petition for coram nobis, he did not allege and he did not offer any evidence and the record doesn't show that he was injured by not having been represented by counsel at arraignment. 
    Now, as to the second question presented, it's our contention that the record in this case does not make such a showing a fundamental unfairness as to warrant a decision that the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the reversal and denying Hamilton's petition to coram nobis. 
    Various tests have been applied in the determination of what constitutes fundamental unfairness, and they include the gravity of the offense, the nature and the complexity of the issues, the age of the accused, his mental capacity, which would embrace mental illness or feeblemindedness. 
    His background, including education and experience, ignorance or literacy, his knowledge of law, such as lack of familiarity with legal rights, capability of questioning witnesses, the degree of protection given during the trial as it appears from the conduct of the court or the prosecutor, or any other like inadequacy which makes the accused incapable of conducting his own defense in that particular stage of the proceeding. 
    Now as applied -- as we apply these tests to the present case, we admit of course that the offense was extremely grave. 
    But I am unable to see where the issues were complex. 
    As for his age, the record doesn't show how old he was but there's no claim of youthfulness and we know that he served in the army for five years.

    It took place in open court, didn't it?

    Mr. George D. Mentz 
    This particular part did take place in open court, yes sir. 
    At the outset -- says the defendant, before the trial gets underway, I have been here for seven months and the first charge that was brought against me was nighttime burglary with intent to steal, grand jury, July 1956, and that was the charge. 
    And now, they have another one out.Can they charge me two times? 
    And the court went on to explain that he was indicted by one grand jury and that a second grand jury returned the second indictment. 
    And the defendant says, “It's one and the same thing. 
    I understand that once they put a charge on me with one thing they can't take that off and put another one on me.” 
    Then he -- a little bit further down, he says, “Before you go on, let me say this, this lawyer is not my lawyer. 
    He was appointed by the court.” 
    The Court: “The law provides the court to appoint you counsel. 
    You were appointed the lawyer so that you may get your constitutional rights.” 
    Mr. Mayfield: “I would like to request permission to withdraw from this case.” 
    The Court: “Permission would be denied at this time. 
    I know how you feel about it. 
    But the law provides that this man have counsel and he did not have one. 
    And we have had no word from any other lawyer other than yourself. 
    You were kind enough to agree to represent this man when I appointed you and I appreciate it. 
    I know you are qualified to give this man a fair trial and for that reason, I would not at this time allow you to withdraw.” 
    And in that connection, I have found no Alabama cases in point but I have found some Federal District Court cases, which say that the right to -- for a counsel to withdraw or for the defendant to demand the counsel withdrawal is purely within the discretion of the trial court. 
    And that's -- the reason is obvious because the defendant could indefinitely stall at the eve of trial and he could say, “I don't want this man to represent me. 
    They'd have to carry the case over for another time.”

    Hamilton was reprimanded but he was reprimanded not in the presence of the jury. 
    If I may -- he -- the court excused the jury and then he cautioned Hamilton as to the effect that his conduct would have on the jury. 
    He said you're sitting up there reading a newspaper or pamphlet of some kind, you're chewing gum and he cautioned him, he said now, --

    Mr. George D. Mentz 
    No sir, I don't call it a reprimand. 
    I have to call it bending over backwards in an effort to be fair to the defendant. 
    And certainly, as Mr. Justice Harlan has pointed out, after each interrogation or after the interrogation of each witness, the court asked Hamilton, they said, “Now, do you want to ask this witness any question?” 
    Of course, Hamilton kept hammering away what he was trying to get at was the double jeopardy feature of the second indictment as to what went on in the grand jury. 
    The trial judge properly ruled that those questions were not proper or pertinent and told him that they were not. 
    Now -- and I would like to point out also that Hamilton was permitted to argue the case personally to the jury when -- at the conclusion of the case. 
    During the trial, Hamilton treated his -- Mr. Mayfield respectfully. 
    There's no evidence that he argued with him. 
    I don't -- I don't see this build up about open conflict of being at war with each other.

    He ran the risk of double jeopardy by improperly putting them to a trial but waive all that. 
    Suppose he wanted to have a new trial or another trial, what would that involve in the county in Alabama in which this case was being tried? 
    Could he try it the next -- could he -- could he call the case, put it off the next day, and get a new jury?

    He was present with Mr. Mayfield at the first arraignment when Mr. Mayfield upon a very similar indictment pleaded him not guilty.

speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="6259.657" stopTime="6399.933">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Well, we did. 
    And then Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed to one place. 
    And we, of course, say that the conflict was evidenced in the very beginning when the petitioner said, “This is not my lawyer.” 
    We think that the Court had a duty to inquire into that and to find out the basis of the dissatisfaction and to make some change in the situation. 
    If the counsel has been present in the arraignment, the Court might have at that time, seen the conflict between counsel and the client, and then was the time to have made the change in counsel of course. 
    But the lawyer was not there and this is one of our reason for saying arraignment is very important because this kind of thing, they come to light at the time of arraignments. 
    But all of the remarks made by the Court and this conflict or dissatisfaction with client and lawyer was all in the presence of the jury and what they concluded of course was mere speculation. 
    But we say this kind of thing should not happen in the presence of the jury in a capital case. 
    Another thing I'd like to clarify which was raised earlier in the argument with my -- my opponent, this petitioner never had a hearing on his coram nobis application, permission to file coram nobis in the trial court was denied by the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    So there was no hearing on it. 
    He made an application for leave to file a petition in the trial court which is a procedure in Alabama. 
    So that what was denied was the permission to file it. 
    Now of course, petitioner says that arraignment is not a mere formality. 
    The arraignment is a very, very important step in a criminal proceeding. 
    In this case, the charge shows that the petitioner here was presented with a charge involving complex legal and factual issues. 
    As was pointed, the code nowhere defined intent to ravish, yet that was the charge in the indictment to which he pled. 
    In addition --

    And to make a special plea if it were for insanity and to make other objections to the indictment. 
    For example, objecting to the composition of the grand jury.

    And the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that he should've raised it at the arraignment or prior thereto, and when he was denied the right to do so by the trial judge, they did not reverse it, because he had lost the absolute right to challenge the jury by not having raised this on arraignment. 
    So that arraignment in Alabama is not a mere formality. 
    Of course, as a practical manner, arraignment also is the time to enter a plea to lesser crime which this petitioner could not have known and without a lawyer, he certainly didn't know that. 
    It was also the time perhaps to enter a plea of guilty and receive mercy, so there was no mere formality about it. 
    And I don't recall anything in this record which attempts to explain why the first indictment did not contain the second count. 
    I don't see anything in there. 
    Maybe I overlooked it but I don't believe there's any explanation in the record to that effect.

    Page 25. 
    I should think that page contradicts the uncritical observation that a defendant must be represented at every stage throughout the case because that case holds just the opposite, namely that the defendant's lawyer need be -- needn't be present when the jury views the scene. 
    That's -- that what the case decides, I think I'm right Mrs. Motley that that --

    Namely, that's the case, the decision in a murder case, that counsel need not be present at every stage of a trial, of the proceeding. 
    That's what the Snyder case stands for. 
    Would that turn the heart of Mr. Justice Cardozo writing the opinion for the Court?

    I just point out that there is a decision which shows the danger of this at larger remarks, even in opinions. 
    And when the -- when in the Patton case, just as -- you said that he must -- a lawyer must be present at every stage of the proceeding, of course it must be with reference to the proceeding they were talking about, in that case, which was the trial.
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="6664.260" stopTime="6753.423">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Yes. 
    Well, I'd like to make this other point and at this time that Alabama says in effect when it cites Canizio against New York that whatever went amiss at the time of arraignment, it could have been cured or was cured at the trial. 
    The Court may recall that in the Canizio case, the defendant had pled guilty to a lesser crime and he was not represented by counsel. 
    But at the time of sentencing, he was represented by counsel and during a long, lengthy hearing on that day, the lawyer considered as this Court pointed out probably the advisability of withdrawing that plea of guilty and decided against it because the record in that case showed that he was, perhaps, guilty of the greater offense which was robbery unarmed, whereas he was permitted to plead not guilty to a lesser offense. 
    So that in effect in that case, his counsel did correct whatever might have been wrong by -- as not being present at the time of arraignment. 
    But in this case we say that no such thing happened, at this trial, nothing could have been corrected.

    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    That's right Your Honor. 
    I think that in this case, as in many other cases, as the Court knows, it is very difficult but not impossible to prove that a counsel was ineffective or incompetent. 
    And I think that for this reason, this Court ought to require as the very minimum objective standard of procedural due process which may be enforced, that at the time of arrangement, there ought to be some counsel represented -- representing the petitioner in a capital case.
