    Mr. Howard E. Payne 
    Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court. 
    This case comes before the Court on this appeal, presenting a matter involving an attorney admitted to the Bar of the State of Kansas and the question that is presented to the Court is whether or not under the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Constitution of the United States may an attorney who has been regularly admitted to practice in the state of his residence, in this instance, Kansas. 
    And who also maintains an office and in active practice in that state since the date of his admission be denied by a subsequently promulgated court rules the right to appear as counsel in the courts of Kansas and the Boards and Commissions of that state unless he associates with him, a local lawyer, a local Kansas lawyer. 
    The same as if he were a nonresident, non-admitted attorney for the sole reason that Mr. Martin, the appellant in this case, in addition to maintaining an office and a practice and being admitted to the Kansas Bar, also maintains an office and a practice in the sister state of Missouri. 
    That is essentially the question which we have here before the Court today.

    Mr. Howard E. Payne

    Mr. Howard E. Payne 
    Well, that is correct, Your Honor. 
    I think that probably, if Your Honor, if the Court rather understood the geographics of this thing, primarily, this situation arose because of Johnson County Kansas having a largely residential population and having about 90 members of the Bar at Johnson County, Wyandotte County, Kansas, which adjoins Johnson County, having approximately --

    But if a lawyer, a local counsel so-called, insisted that he be paid a minimum fee as adopted by the standard or by the local bar committee, I suppose there would be matter of negotiation between he and the so-called foreign attorney.

    But actually no lawyer who is compelled to hire a local lawyer expects a local lawyer to sit there and incidentally, I would say to the Court now, that when I talk about a local lawyer being associated, I do not mean a lawyer who merely signs the pleadings in the clerk's office, and then goes back to his office. 
    Under these rules, that local lawyer, if a case takes a day or 10 days, must be in constant presence of the Court in the court room, and not back at his office.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    My point is that if association of a local lawyer for nominal reasons, does that follow that your Supreme Court will also say that if a fellow says, “Yes, I'll hire a Kansas lawyer to sit there or sign his name, but do nothing,” it is a coercive, an unfairly coercive thing for me to be influenced by or guided by the local fees which implied fees for doing business and not merely phenomenal requirement.
speaker="howard_e_payne" startTime="782.296" stopTime="801.210">
    Mr. Howard E. Payne 
    Well, I will agree with Your Honor on that statement. 
    But nonetheless, there are in the two counties involved and in most counties, I believe, a local schedule of minimum fees.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="801.210" stopTime="814.226">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What I'm saying is that our problem isn't tied to the necessity of assuming that this fee scheme also follows from sustaining this promulgated rule.
speaker="howard_e_payne" startTime="814.226" stopTime="870.847">
    Mr. Howard E. Payne 
    Well, of course, Your Honor, if I understand the question correctly. 
    If a so-called foreign lawyer is compelled in this instance, it's Mr. Martin, the appellant here, who as I would like to point out to the Court, ought not be characterized as a foreign lawyer. 
    But if he hires a local attorney and he's required to do it under the present rules, he of course becomes obligated to remunerate that local attorney, he could not expect a local lawyer to even just sit, as Your Honor has suggested, and not be paid. 
    Now, how much he ought to be paid is of course regulated so far as the regulation can go by the minimum schedule of fees adopted by the local bar association.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="870.847" stopTime="902.253">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I agree with everything you said except the last sentence. 
    I do -- do not think -- I do not think until the Supreme Court of Kansas says that any service, any service falls within this minimum fee scheme of the two counties in question, any service, the most nominally subject to it until that is done, I do not think I have to read this promulgation as assimilating the fee scheme of these two counties.

    Suppose your client comes into Kansas to practice law as he could, at least, and under this regulation he has to retain somebody. 
    Suppose everybody recognizes that he is such a master of a particular litigation in question, if he doesn't need any assistant, he has to comply with the law. 
    But he says, “I will retain you, but not for the minimum fee.” 
    And no lawyer in Kansas, in either of these counties, is ready to associate himself on that basis. 
    And he then goes before your court and said, “I've done my best to comply with your rule,” but no lawyer will serve you except on the basis of an extortion of the fee, what would your Supreme Court say to that?
speaker="howard_e_payne" startTime="1011.125" stopTime="1082.589">
    Mr. Howard E. Payne 
    Well of course, I would not want to speculate Your Honor, about that, it has never occurred, and I hope that it never does. 
    But I suppose, as I suggested a while ago, that if the local lawyer said to the so-called foreign lawyer, now we have adopted a minimum fee schedule here in Johnson County or Wyandotte County or in Doniphan County or wherever it is. 
    And if I associate with you, my fee will be the minimum of a third or 50%, I suppose that the foreign lawyer would have no alternative, if he wanted that lawyer other than to -- and of course the local lawyer would be as far as the schedule is concerned, would be within his rights in saying that. 
    Now, whether our Supreme Court would say that was exacting tribute rather than compensation, I would not argue.

    Most of the local judges are cognizant of the fees that are fixed by the local bar association and in most instances with their approval or at least pass an approval and sanction and so they don't ordinarily go below.

    Mr. Howard E. Payne 
    Yes sir. 
    But the thing which I am not so much concerned myself, at least, with the fee proposition, although that is important in this case. 
    Is that in 1958, December the 15th, I believe it was in 1958 or about 10 years, after the appellant in this case had been admitted to practice in Kansas and had practiced in Kansas incidentally for all of that period of time. 
    The Supreme Court of Kansas amended certain rules, rules designated in the brief as Rule 41 and Rule 54. 
    Now, in the amendment of those rules, the effect of it was that any lawyer although admitted to the Bar in the State of Kansas and although residing in the State of Kansas, and although maintaining an office in the State of Kansas, if he also engaged in practice of law in another state to which bar, he was admitted, then that lawyer that I'm talking about, and it's the appellant in this case, must hire a local lawyer to associate with him whenever he tries a lawsuit or appears before any Commission or tribunal.

    In this respect, Your Honor, for 10 years at least, for 10 years from 1940 to 1950, if these rules have any basis at all, it must -- a necessity be predicated upon the competency of the lawyer in an attempt to make lawyers more competent in Kansas. 
    Now, for 10 years, there was no question with regards to the competency of the qualifications of my client Mr. Martin to practice law in Kansas. 
    And then almost overnight, Mr. Martin by the promulgation of these rules, and law was placed in the same category as in lawyer who had no license to practice in Kansas who had no residence in Kansas, and who had no office in Kansas, he was placed in that same category. 
    And I say in the brief I'm -- that I have left that when they do that, take away the competency and the qualification after 10 years of no complaint about, and indeed, there isn't any complaint in anywhere here about Mr. Martin's competency. 
    The Attorney General of the state has filed a brief in this case and says on page 2, as to his professional qualifications and his personal character, there is no question.

speaker="howard_e_payne" startTime="1661.284" stopTime="1881.927">
    Mr. Howard E. Payne 
    Very well. 
    Well, as I have said to the Court previously, they are saying that we are complaining about here is that the court passed these rules and disqualified or put Mr. Martin in a classification that we think is not real nor not warranted. 
    And what I have said about Mr. Martin would go to those other attorneys if I may speak briefly upon classification in the little time that I have left here. 
    I think this Court has said many times that you cannot have a wholly arbitrary standard or a consideration that offends the dictates of reason and that there must be some rational connection with a person's fitness and capacity to practice law. 
    Now, weighing these rules in the light of those general statements that has governed this Court in other decisions, surely it cannot be said that after all of the years of practice that Mr. Martin either had the privilege or the right to indulge in, and I'm not so concerned about that, surely can it be said that now simply because Mr. Martin continuing in the same method and mode that he followed previously also engages in the practice of law in the state of Missouri has now become incapacitated, incompetent, or not qualified to practice law in Kansas without being associated. 
    And having associated with him a local lawyer with all of the incidents of pay or economics or whatever may be concerned with that. 
    We think that any classification, Mr. Martin upon that score is an unreal thing and of course, it not only offends the dictates of reason but it is an unsubstantial and not a logical classification. 
    To say that here is a Kansas lawyer with all of the requirements of even being a local lawyer that is as to admission of the Bar, residency, and maintenance of an office, and to say now, he's different, he is different, and he has counsel in this case and I practice only in Johnson County, except occasionally, that he is different now than his counsel merely because he goes two or three miles over into the State of Missouri, where his office is located in Kansas goes over two or three miles into the State of Missouri and practices law over there.

    Of course that -- if they have motive of lawyers to do something, it would necessary to invalidate your law, but I was asking because I think I've noticed recently that there are quite a number of places where the lawyers have been backing movements of this kind, I think right here, and in the city of Washington. 
    With reference to having people register or not register, but divide up their fees, which is a very understandable motive or desire on the part of the bar.

    Mr. J. Donald Lysaught 
    All right, here, Your Honor, is this situation -- there was a lawyer licensed to practice in Kansas, practice regularly in Oklahoma, he resided in Oklahoma, but to me, residence doesn't mean a lot. 
    It is one criteria and one thing demanded at many states. 
    But to me, it has nothing to do with professional competence. 
    A carpenter can live 80 years in Kansas, and not be qualified to practice law. 
    This lawyer, relying upon, apparently, upon his knowledge and everyday usage of the law of Oklahoma, came in to Kansas, and he filed his action in the wrong court.

    Because what we have in this case, and two or three places in the appellant's brief, the client call was supposed ex post facto judicial notice of the Supreme Court of Kansas. 
    But in the opinion of that court, what the court says is, that prior to the promulgation of these rules, we took judicial notice, they could not only take judicial notice. 
    They could do as any other Court does, have judicial conferences and take actual notice of those things that were obstructing, hindering or having a detrimental effect on the administration of the law in Kansas, that was done -- these rules, as Your Honor asked before, these are legislative in nature. 
    I don't question that at all. 
    And I don't question that they are subject to the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause. 
    Being legislative in nature and being promulgated as rules by the court, and not as a decision of the court on a matter before that court, the Supreme Court of Kansas not only had the right, but in my opinion, have the duty to ascertain all they could. 
    Then, in the opinion, they set out their reasons why they felt that the promulgation of these rules was necessary, and a question was asked --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose they extend it to the county, I suppose, there's ample reason to believe that if the man being tried for defense in a county a hundred miles away from a good lawyer of his own county, said they'll get a better jury trial and a better trial as a whole, if they'd get a man located -- local man, wouldn't it?

    Mr. J. Donald Lysaught 
    I think the Supreme Court of Kansas made that distinction in our opinion, if the Court please, on this reason. 
    They say the trial work demands instant decisions and Your Honor has tried so many lawsuits that I think you can understand the difference between being before that jury, a new question arising and you must make your decision like that, and examining an abstract or drawing a contract and office where you can take two weeks if you want, too, to look up what the law actually is on the subject if you don't know.

    In 1935, general statute 7104 was enacted by the Kansas legislature. 
    That applied to foreign attorneys who had not been admitted to the bar. 
    That was amended in 1947. 
    In 1958, these rules were adopted. 
    Subsequently, an attempt was made in the Kansas legislature to avoid the effect of these Court rules. 
    A bill which was presented to the Kansas legislature is set out in the appellee's brief in this case. 
    The legislature refused to enact that bill after hearings which included testimony from trial court judges of Kansas, as to what the situations were that these rules were designed to prevent.

speaker="j_donald_lysaught" startTime="3923.849" stopTime="4041.327">
    Mr. J. Donald Lysaught 
    I will answer that in this manner, if the Court please. 
    Experience shows that Kansas Court has set out in there, in their opinion that too often, these lawyers who practiced regularly in Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, or Colorado came into the courts of Kansas, and to use a colloquialism, if Your Honor will excuse it, they played it by year. 
    They regularly practiced over there. 
    They were accustomed to the procedure over there, so when they came in to Kansas Court, they wouldn't look up to see what the proper procedure was, but assume it was the same as their. 
    And with regard to this appellant if it please Your Honor, while Mr. Payne says that he is without fault, there is no question of any blemish on him. 
    That, we are here on a motion to quash so the facts submitted, the facts in well-pleaded in his petition in mandamus are admitted. 
    But there is a Kansas reported case in which this appellant failed. 
    He went up on appeal in a criminal case, his client was convicted. 
    He failed to tender some motion to -- some evidence that has been rejected by the trial court on his motion for new trial. 
    Now, that's just an oddity we have in Kansas, but if you don't do it, there isn't anything before appellate courts. 
    He complained that the trial court hadn't given an instruction to the jury. 
    No instruction was tendered. 
    Now, I don't know under the procedural law of Missouri, if you must present at your motion for new trial, any evidence which is excluded by the trial court.

    And the question is and I was amused that the question asked here before, is this to be dealt with regard to only Keith Martin or with the group which falls within the rules promulgated by the court. 
    I myself have had just a little bit of difficulty in following an appellant's brief just which we are here with. 
    At times, he finds fault and says that the group established is unreasonable. 
    Well, that would apply to the entire group. 
    And then at other places in his brief, he says, “Well, maybe these rules are necessarily for some of these fellows, but I am a man of superior ability.” 
    And he is, there's no question about that. 
    “And therefore, they should not be applied to me.” 
    Well that, if this Court please, and the Supreme Court of Kansas set out to establish a standard on individual ability, I think that would be first thing this Court would strike down.

    Sir?

    Suppose the gentleman when he had gone to try the case of Taylor versus Taylor out which this seems to be in the beginning, had hired another lawyer like himself who practiced both in Kansas City -- Kansas and Missouri. 
    Would that have been a local lawyer, could he have associated him?
speaker="j_donald_lysaught" startTime="4259.632" stopTime="4277.504">
    Mr. J. Donald Lysaught 
    No, there is a statutory definition that goes back behind that, Your Honor, in 7104, that the local counsel must both reside and maintain his office and I think that has been extruded --

    Well, I assume -- let's suppose --

    Would you say sole office?
speaker="j_donald_lysaught" startTime="4283.744" stopTime="4316.502">
    Mr. J. Donald Lysaught 
    I think that has been so construed. 
    And I think that Mr. Martin in his brief admitted that in substance, he was not authorized to local -- to serve as local counsel under that rule, under that statute. 
    The statute itself does not use that word, but, I think that the appellant himself has taken the position that that cannot be.

    I know that your Supreme Court, in the opinion said and gave reasons why, at least, in conclusion, that it had power to promulgating this rule, constitutional power. 
    But apart from that, is there any special rule with less than the Supreme Court, powers of administration of the judicial grist in the lower courts of Kansas?

    There is statute which is pointed on in my brief, 60 days, 3825 of the 1949 general statutes which goes back in substantially its present form to 1923, Your Honor, which gives the Supreme Court, the power to make and amend rules or itself and all inferior courts.
