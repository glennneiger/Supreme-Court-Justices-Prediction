Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="15.264">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Theodore R. Gibson, Petitioner, versus Florida Legislative Investigating Committee. 
    Mr. Carter, you may continue your argument.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="15.264" stopTime="291.785">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    At the close of the argument yesterday, Mr. Justice White raised the question and asked me to address myself to it, on today. 
    I can’t repeat the question in words, but the burden of it as I understood it was whether why was it not in the interest of the organization to verify the fact that the person’s name, that alleged the communists were not in Memphis and therefore to give the testimony requested. 
    The reason that this was not done and I think that the record is clear, the reading of the record makes clear that these 14 persons named by virtue of the fact that the membership in the organization has only existed for one year and it’s obvious that these persons that were -- supposed persons were named or persons that if they had any connection with the organization at all, would have been predated 1950. 
    The reason that this was not done is because of the fact that petitioner believed that he would place in jeopardy the constitutional right of freedom of association and the privacy in that association which this Court protected and secured in NAACP versus Alabama. 
    Now, the issue that comes down to it is if -- that if the petitioner answers that the question, where will he stop? 
    The next question will be a list of Negro school teachers and proffered with the statement that we have reason to believe that these persons are members of the Communist Party, will you verify as to whether they are members of your organization or ministers for example. 
    And the fact that this is itself can be gleaned from the Court -- by the Court -- by reading of the record at page 241, in which on the -- when the petitioner came back to the committee on the second time, counsel for the petitioner need be with the -- it begins on about -- at page 239, but looking at the middle of page 241, he was asked to disclose whether or not Reverend Edward Graham was a member of the NAACP. 
    Mr. Holt said that Reverend Graham that -- what's -- the pertinence of the question is that Reverend Graham is and has been a member of the organization in Dade County that over a period of years, he is or has been a member of certain organizations which have been listed as subversive, etcetera. 
    Now, we contend that the committee was not really looking for these persons. 
    That what the committee was in fact doing and what is before this Court, is not a discussion of an abstract principle of state power but the same issue which was before this Court in NAACP versus Alabama and the Bates case and in the case from Louisiana. 
    And that is that, and I have not stressed this in the argument in this case because this case does not come here of a -- as a case of first impression, but this Court as I understood its opinion in both cases held that this being an organization of a minority group, unpopular, that the freedom of persons or their desire to the persons who might ordinarily join would be deterred by virtue of the fact that they might be disclosed and -- their names might be disclosed, their identity might be disclosed, and therefore, they would be subjected to kinds of intimidations, intimidation which would prevent their doing what the Constitution says that they can do and that is to participate in a lawful group activity. 
    For this reason, in that case, this Court said that there must be a status with some compelling -- of compelling proportions in order for the intrusion in this area to be allowed, and secondly, that the disclosure must be relevant to a valid legislative objective. 
    Now --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you claim in this case that the state had no power to contest this investigation no const -- (Inaudible) -- it was a constitutionally unauthorized investigation?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="302.329" stopTime="375.559">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    No sir. 
    I don't have -- I don't think I have to make that argument, but I do think that what the state must disclose, is not only that the interest and that is the interest here being investigation of subversion, but that the state's interest must be directed one to a valid legislative objective and it must show that there is some basis for the inquiry in this particular instance. 
    In other words, this is not a case as it was in -- but Baron, Black or Braden or Wilkinson in which the petitioner was asked, "Are you a member of the Communist Party?" 
    Nor is this the case in which the -- if there is an assertion by the investigators that the organization is subversive nor is it a case in which there is an -- any assertion at all that the organization engaged in any illegal or unconstitutional activities, nor as in Wilkinson and Braden had there been any showing that the inquiry is directed to any legislative objective that there is any legislation being composed which would deal with this particular problem, I must say that I don't know what this -- what they could do in this instance validly legislated.

    [Inaudible]
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="396.369" stopTime="627.338">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    -- if the state were really interested in information, then of course it could do this in another way, but what I was attempting to define was that the limits what I regard as state power. 
    And in this instance, it seems to me that the state has to make this kind of showing or else, what is really occurring is that the state can say, “We are concerned with the infiltration of communists. 
    We have reason to believe that they're members of subversive organizations, of subversive groups and a particular organization, and it that regard it can destroy the enclosure which this Court has erected around freedom of association in NAACP versus Alabama. 
    And I think that this Court, that this is a retreat them from that decision which I would respectfully urge that this Court not take. 
    Now, in further answer to Mr. Justice Goldberg's inquiry, it does seem to me that if the -- if there was any real interest here in evidencing to the petitioner's organization that we have the information that these 13 people are members of the party, they're likely to taint your organization, you be careful about them that what they can do is to inform. 
    They could inform the petitioner's organization to watch out for these persons and permit them if they -- if such people are in the organization to purge them from it. 
    But if they did not do that, what they did was to attempt to -- by this means, we think to get constructive possession of the membership list. 
    And we say if the Court please, that this case is of the same of a piece with the same situation which was before this Court from Alabama, Louisiana and Arkansas that if the Court will read the first opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida in this case. 
    But the Supreme Court of Florida took this Court's opinion in NAACP versus Alabama and said, that the committee at that time was seeking the possession of the entire membership list. 
    But the Court said, in view of NAACP versus Alabama, we do not hold that you can have that but that -- on the grounds that you're looking for a communist in the organization, you may require an answer to this -- to specific questions asked by -- as to whether a person -- validating as to whether a person belongs to this organization. 
    And we if the Court please, that this is a legalism, that what this does by not placing any real predicate, any real indication by the Court, any real showing by the committee that there is some link, some real link between the organization and communism that what is in -- it in fact saying is that we, merely by virtue of the fact that we alleged that certain -- a person is a communist, then we can get your -- just your membership was entirely. 
    And we think that this gives the individual whose custodian of the listing, the only person who can protect the membership list and the freedom for association of the organization's members. 
    In this instance, gives him no principles on which to stand, he acts -- he doesn't know what names to give up, he has to give up all the names or else he has no way of knowing whether these persons who are called communists are in fact communists or not. 
    And I might --

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    No sir. 
    I would -- again, I don't think I have to go that far in this case. 
    I think that if there was a showing, not that do we have evidence that A, B and C are members of the Communist Party, but a real showing of a connection, an activity on the part of the organization which connects it, which -- that which -- has -- give up the -- the state reason to believe that is harboring subversives and engaging in subversive activity, then it would seem to me that that would present to the Court an entirely different question. 
    And that would present also to the Court a question as to whether or not the individuals who was custodian of the list had a reason to know and believe and understand that this is exactly what the organization is doing.

    Well, then it seems to me what you're doing is saying that, or are you, that factually, this record is more like the Sweezy record where this Court found there was no evidence that the progressive party engaged in communist activities and therefore, questions put to Dr. Sweezy about the progressive party could not be put, even assuming the validity of the New Hampshire legislative inquiry in the subversive activity. 
    And that this is like the Sweezy record and not like the Uphaus record where the Court found that the World Federation or whatever that thing is called, that the Uphaus was connected with in fact was engaged in activities which at least to a majority of this Court satisfied the requisite of proof, substantial proof of activities by the organization itself under inquiry.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    But if I may say Mr. Justice Harlan, I think that the state cannot merely be investigating something for the purpose of investigating. It must be related to something. 
    It has to -- if they are investigating the presence of communist in the Miami Branch of the NAACP, it has to be related, I think. 
    And I think this Court held to this in the Watkins versus United States, something in regard to the congressional investigation, it has to be related to a valid legislative purpose. 
    I also think that this Court reaffirmed this doctrine in Braden and in Wilkinson. 
    And I don't believe that it's sufficient to say that they are investigating the presence of communist or that they have a right to investigative. 
    Of course, I think they have a right to investigate but it has to be related to something that they can do, some valid purpose which I think that they have failed to show in this particular case. 
    And I -- as we pointed out in our brief, this committee has to -- in existence since 1956, that it has been reconstituted in 1957 and 1959 and in 1961. 
    And as -- and it -- during all this period of time, it has not evidenced and certainly is nothing in this record to evidence that it is doing anything valid -- in a valid legislative objective in terms of this other than an attempt to disclose and expose which I think this Court says that legislative power cannot be used to that extent. 
    For these reasons, if the Court please, we respectfully urge that the judgment below be reversed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Mark R. Hawes

    Mr. Hawes.
speaker="mark_r_hawes" startTime="1473.410" stopTime="1658.941">
    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    If Your Honors please, I was a little surprised today to see my opponent taking the position that in addition to the nexus between communist activities or subversion and people within this organization that we had to show an addition before we could raise these questions. 
    Some evidence said this organization as such was engaging in some sort of subversive activity. 
    Now this is not the question, if Your Honors please, this case came before this Court only. 
    It is not a question embraced in the petition for the writ that you issued. 
    Now, if you refer that these two petition for the writ itself, you will see the question presented is quite substantially different from the contentions being made by counsel for the petitioner here in this argument. 
    The question is presented in the petition for the writ is whether or not under the circumstances in this case, we could compel these answers without violating the freedom of association and privacy. 
    In the absence of some showing of a nexus between the Communist Party or communist front organizations and their subversive activities in the petitioner's organization, I deem that to be a proper question, if Your Honors please, and I deem that to be the question that's before the Court for consideration. 
    And I say that if a nexus is established by this record showed that there's reason to believe that people connected with a subversive organizations are or might be members of the Miami branch of the NAACP what you have an actuality before the Court, is Uphaus against Wyman over and over. 
    Now, it is not required and was not required in the Uphaus case that the Legislative Committee of New Hampshire operating as a one-man committee through the Attorney General, show that the World Fellowship organization had engaged in any subversive activities. 
    But the nexus in that case was that some 18 or 19 members of the Communist Party and/or communist front affiliation groups had spoke at meetings in a summer camp run by the World Fellowship Association. 
    That was the sole nexus in that case. 
    That record didn't purport to show that the World Fellowship Association as such had engaged in any subversive activities.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, am I wrong -- I thought that among the truths that the Court relied on in that case, were these that the -- some of the speakers at World Fellowship meeting were admitted communists. 
    That Dr. Uphaus himself had attended that Warsaw Convention where the United States was censured for using germ warfare allegedly in Korea and there were communist pamphlets, some wanted by smaller talk. 
    The evidence was were distributed at meetings of the World Fellowship. 
    Now, wasn't that rather a different record than we have here, that is as regards -- the activities of that organization, World Fellowship, and the activities of the Miami branch of the NAACP --
speaker="mark_r_hawes" startTime="1712.253" stopTime="1755.749">
    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    Your Honor I read Uphaus opinion yesterday. 
    If my recollection is not in error and I admit it may be, the only evidence reflected by that opinion is that Uphaus himself is -- and he was executive director I believe or secretary of World Fellowship shown to be a member one or more communist-run associated organizations. 
    And at the summer camp run by this association had their speakers of some -- I believe 19 speakers, some of whom had been members of the Communist Party and some of whom had been members of various front organizations.

    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    No sir. 
    I can't glean that from the opinion Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    I say that these are meetings at the summer camp run by the organization. 
    The record does not show from the opinion that this is official meetings of the organization, but they are meetings of some type at the summer camp run by this organization in which these people spoke, that is what I glean from the opinion.

    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    I think not Mr. Justice Goldberg. 
    What you have in mind is a fact that the laws of New Hampshire required this summer camp which ran apparently a larger motel to maintain a guest list for the state purposes but it did not appear that this list had actually become available to the state. 
    It simply was that the state law required the maintenance of this list to show which guest apparently had stayed at the motel or the hotel. 
    That is my impression of the decision.

    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    Well, Mr. Justice Douglas, as I say there is a point. 
    Definitely, there must be a point where past membership fails to be relevant any further. 
    But I don't think that past membership of a year or two years or three years, in the Communist Party itself is necessarily irrelevant in determining whether or not an individual is a subversive still. 
    Now, if he renounced the membership in the party 10, 15, or 20 years ago, I think clearly there's no question that that becomes irrelevant to any reasonable mind.

    Now, if Your Honors please, it's a fact. 
    This same committee investigated John Kasper, the Ku Klux Klan and the Seaboard Citizens White Council in regard to their activities in their same racial disturbance down there in Florida.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2097.116" stopTime="2103.818">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, my question would be as relevant but if this was a White Council and you're investigating past membership, (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="mark_r_hawes" startTime="2103.818" stopTime="2289.361">
    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    Yes sir. 
    And I submit Your Honor if the petitioner in this case was a Ku Klux Klan that I wouldn't have any difficulty in explaining to the Court the legitimacy of the state's interest in this investigation. 
    Now, it's certainly is not true that this particular committee of the State of Florida is going out simply to destroy the NAACP and I want to say to Your Honors that the State of Florida has long recognized the binding effect of the judicial decisions of this Court in regard to segregation and desegregation. 
    And that if you will read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida in this case, I don't think you can come to the conclusion at all that any -- the judiciary of Florida and I know it's not the position of my committee to defy and use of power of the state in this committee to defy the edicts of this Court in regard to desegregation. 
    Yet that is a suggestion that's made by counsel up there for the petitioner. 
    Now this is the question, pure and sample as this. 
    As you're going to close this organization with absolute immunity, from many sort of investigation in regard to subversion and the effect is that you're saying to all investigating committees, you've got to get out of this field entirely, not only in regard to the race issue and regard to communism but anything else. 
    Now you must look at the effect such a law will have on other cases in my judgment. 
    I can see the effect of this type of decision is overruling the immunity statutes of many of the states and the Federal Government. 
    You're going to make on the First Amendment if you continue and if you receive to what is asked you, on an absolute shield in effect like the Fifth Amendment. 
    You're going to have witnesses coming before state juries and regular state prosecutions of ordinary crimes and saying this and regardless of the fact that I get immunity under your law for my criminal involvement whether defendant in this case, I'm not going to testify as a witness from the state against this defendant because it invades my privacy, my associational rights. 
    You cannot compel me to say, "Well, I know this criminal" and whether I have associated with him before. 
    Now, these are facts and problems if Your Honor pleases, been said many times that hardship law is bad law. 
    And when you sit down to write a decision to protect the individual because perhaps you think in one sympathetic case is in a hardship situation, the result nearly always is that there's a distortion of the true law that operates in benefit of those -- that you don't contemplate. 
    Now, what is the purpose of an investigation?

    We've got to make a conclusive showing that present members of the Communist Party or in the NAACP branch in Miami before we can subject this organization to these questions.

    Because if we don't --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2428.416" stopTime="2439.278">

    I thought the question is whether or not there is any evidence that the organization that you're investigating was engaged in -- engaging in communist activities.
speaker="mark_r_hawes" startTime="2439.278" stopTime="2907.129">
    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    That is the question that has evolved here orally if Your Honor please, I agree with that. 
    I disagree violently that that is the question legally before the Court. [Attempt to Laughter] 
    Now, here's the situation. 
    We set out in here before these groups, we call the counsel in, we call them in and in their presence, we put on -- and let me say incidentally, that Reverend Gibson broke into this hearing. 
    This committee didn't go looking for him. 
    This record shows that he broke into this hearing. 
    He was not the proper custodian of these records at all. 
    A woman named Ruth Perry was the secretary and had these records. 
    He went and is present and took him and announced to us in advance to that hearing that he wouldn't produce them for any purpose at all under any condition, under any showing. 
    Now, when we called him up there, we made our position clear by the same token, he made his clear. 
    If you think I've exaggerated his position, you look at page 44 and 45 of the record. 
    On page 44, and let me say, there's been some talk of 14 members of the Communist Party here. 
    Mr. Strickland did identify 14 people as members of the Communist Party and those 14 people. 
    He said, he had reason to believe, might have been members of the NAACP or had attended meetings of it, but there were another 33 people that he identified as members of the party or communist front associations, and another five members of the Communist Party itself which he had no information in regard to whether they had been associated with the NAACP in any capacity. 
    If you look at the last question on page 44, I say to the Reverend Gibson that I have this list of people before me that they have been -- according to my information affiliated with the party or various front organizations at sometimes -- and I want to know whether or not -- I didn't have any photographs of these men, the first 14 men I'd showed in photographs of and was -- got to rely in on his memory of the faces, he admitted that sometimes you don't associate name with the face and sometimes you don't recall a name. 
    I didn't have any photographs of any, but the first 14 men, Mr. Justice Goldberg. 
    Now these other 33 plus eight -- five, these 38 people, I had no pictures of them and I asked him if he would bring his list after the purpose of me inquiring with regard to whether or not they were members of NAACP. 
    This he declined to do and if you look on page 45, I asked this question. 
    Reverend, so there won't be any misunderstanding on your position, regardless of the names or the information that I have concerning the names of the people that I have before me here, you simply will not bring your records here for the purpose of comparison. 
    You yourself examining them, he said, “No sir, I wouldn't. 
    If you will call those names, I will unequivocally and truthfully tell you if I know these people. 
    Question - Based strictly on the name. 
    Answer: Yes sir. 
    Question: Your recollection of the name? 
    Question: But you will not bring your records for the purpose of comparing your membership rule with the list of the names that I have. 
    He says, "No, no." 
    Now, if Your Honors please, they didn't raise any question then and that was the time to do it, that we haven't -- we hadn't produced enough evidence in their presence, that these people were subversives. 
    That's the time they should have done it if they wanted to raise that question. 
    He says, my position is, I'm not going to bring those records into this hearing room on any condition for any purpose, purely and separate. 
    Now, if his conviction is to be set aside under this condition, if Your Honors please, on the basis of the evidence actually presented in the presence of he and his counsel is not sufficient to show a nexus, you are simply saying that an investigation, you can't have one because you've got to have conclusive proof in order to justify the inquiry and if you have conclusive proof sir, there is no objective to the hearing. 
    And so, you are simply saying that you just can't operate in this field, if this conviction is to be upset in my judgment and that conclusion is absolutely inescapable in my mind as a lawyer. 
    As one way or the other, you either got to have conclusive proof or you haven't? 
    Now, in Uphaus, Your Honors made this comment about an issue of the nexus. 
    You said, the nexus -- the proof in regard to the nexus is “not conclusive but sufficiently relevant.” 
    That's the test you laid down in Uphaus versus Wyman, not conclusive but sufficiently relevant. 
    Now, no court has ever said as I understand the decision, what degree of proof must be laid down to show the nexus? 
    I have never seen that degree of proof laid out in any decision, but you talked about reason to believe in some of these cases, reasonable grounds to think, I don't think it means the same as probable cause in a search warrant case, but if it does, the evidence before the Court is sufficient to satisfy that. 
    Would you prefer please to some of the testimony of a -- an investigator in this case beginning on page 24, down in the middle he identified a woman that he says she has information, this is record page 24, addressed to Burnberg of Miami as a member of the League of the Communist Party and he gives the court Number 357. 
    He says he has all the information that she is a member of front organization cited by the House Un-American Activities. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Harlan, at this point I was simply laying enough evidence out there for the purpose of making the relevancy of the inquiry to this witness apparent. 
    Think of the position the committee is in. 
    If I've got to stop the inquiry with this witness to prove that his satisfaction conclusively that there's real grounds, in a factual way for me to propound the questions to him, I can't find anything but irrelevant issues throughout this hearing and I could never progress. 
    Every time I ask him a question he's going to say, “As a matter of proof, Mr. Hawes, what is a nexus, what is the relevance?” 
    You see it and the investigation cannot progress from a practical standpoint because the committee will be required to stop and put on these side issues factually rather than merely stating to the witness what the relevance is.

    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    He refused to say whether he was a member of the Communist Party and he refused to say whether he was a member of the NAACP on the grounds of the Fifth Amendment. 
    But I think this record discloses his actual communist card number, or one that he had borne in the past. 
    But in all events, Mr. Strickland testified positively that he was a member of the Communist Party. 
    Now, I note that among the 14 original men that I had pictures of, men and women, Arlington Sands also puts Oshana and James Nimmo in members of the NAACP, Oshana and James Nimmo are both shown to be communist by this record, that's on page 70 to 71 of the record. 
    Matt Negro is junior who's co-counsel for the petitioner here in this case puts James Nimmo in one meeting of the NAACP and he admits he only attended two or three of the meetings himself.

    You look in the middle of page 25 you will see that in regard to Charles Marks, he said that Charles Marks of Dade County, was a member of the Communist Party. 
    He gives two numbers that he has born there. 
    This is more than just a witness sitting up there gentlemen only as counsel and saying to them, “Listen, I believe out of the pigment of my imagination that this man might be a communist and we want to know for that reason if he's a member of the organization.” 
    Now --

    Is that a testimony that [Inaudible] instructed by the Communist Party to infiltrate [Inaudible]?
speaker="mark_r_hawes" startTime="3221.559" stopTime="3453.318">
    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    Mr. Justice Clark, I'm glad you brought that up. 
    I hold in my hand what the document on file before you entitled -- appendix, the petitioner's brief on reargument and if you will look on page 7 of that document, a revolution past in June of 1956 at the time of the commencement of this fair investigation, you'll find this statement in the last paragraph, the new line of the Communist Parties throughout the world and specially in the United States is by infiltration to insinuate their programs on noncommunist and even anti-communist organization. 
    We know, now this is the national -- NAACP speaking here, we know that the communist leadership in America has directed its representatives to seek -- to involve NAACP units in a united front program. 
    This, we absolutely reject and go along to say that the -- it's necessary now that they exercise more precaution than ever. 
    And in that connection, if you gentlemen will please refer to page 241 of the record, the page cited by counsel for the petitioner, you will find this question and I put to the petitioner in this case and I wish you'd read that question in light of that statement from NAACP there. 
    I asked about the membership of Edward T. Graham in the Dade County. 
    I explained the pertinency of the question to the petitioner Graham. 
    I state over period of years, Graham has been an active member of certain organization, was listed a subversive by the United States Un-American Activities Committee such as the Southern Conference for Human Welfare and it was holistic, the Southern Conference Educational Fund which was also cited as the outright communist replacement of the Conference for Human Welfare. 
    That Graham has appeared in addressed meetings of the Soviet-American Friendship Association and the FBR club, both subversive organizations. 
    As recent as, March 12, 1960, this is the last time he was before us. 
    March 12, 1960, he has participated in meetings in Orlando, Florida, called by and sponsored by this subversive organization to Southern Conference Educational Fund, that he went from Miami to Orlando with a man named Carl Braden whose conviction Your Honors upheld before this Court, that there was present a man named James Dombrowski, the Executive Director of the Southern Conference Educational Fund, subversive so said the Senate Committee on internal Security. 
    And according to our information, Dombrowski is a high official and member of a number of outright communist organization. 
    I go on and on and I say, “Now, I want to know Reverend Graham -- Reverend Gibson, if Reverend Gale is a member of your Miami Branch and if he attended this meeting in Orlando on March 12, 1960 as an official representative of your organization? 
    Am I not getting very close to saying that what he contends should be shown activity on the part of the organization itself?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3453.318" stopTime="3454.555">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Read that question.
speaker="mark_r_hawes" startTime="3454.555" stopTime="3535.855">
    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    In light of the statement, we know that the communist leadership in America has directed its representatives to seek involvement, to involve the NAACP units in the united front program. 
    This is the very united front program that they are referring to there in that opinion by the same Carl Braden and the Southern Conference Educational Fund that Reverend Gibson declined to answer that question. 
    And I laid out in detail the information that we have then in regard to Reverend Graham and his activities in regard to this united front organization. 
    Now, if Your Honors please, it just seems to me that you reach a point where reason doesn't mean anything. 
    If you can say on this record if you read it carefully, if you'll say that this record is not sufficient to show that there is or maybe a situation where members of subversive organizations are members of the Miami branch of the NAACP then you've got to say this conviction [Inaudible] unless you're going to say that that showing has got to be conclusive.

    And it's interesting to note that another witness in this case, Sands knew I think eight of these members of the Communist Party when the pictures were exhibited to him, and he puts three of them in meetings of the NAACP, but you see Mr. Chief Justice, I was handicapped in regard of these other 33 people, I had no photograph of them and if I'm going to ask him, does he know John Jones, I don't know whether we're talking about if he knows John Jones, nobody knows whether we're talking about the same person or not. 
    And the thing I would say after this, we don't care anything about having possession of this list of the NAACP.

    Mr. Justice Black, there is no showing in this record as to what legislative purpose other than to gain information was to be served.

    Now, it may be that we need state legislation to curve that, depending on whether we have sufficient infiltration or not in fact.

    You do not?
speaker="mark_r_hawes" startTime="4105.203" stopTime="4257.708">
    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    I think we have not in that particular instant. 
    Another great area of uncertainty has arisen in regard to what the effect of our state's subversive statute is since your decision in Nelson against Pennsylvania. 
    Now, I'm satisfied in my own mind that this Court left open to the states in that decision the right to proscribe and punish subversive action directed towards the state itself but not against the Federal Government. 
    I think that's the effect of that decision, but I think our statute directly is tied up with practically the same wording, in the same effect as in -- as the Pennsylvania statue was when Nelson was prosecuted. 
    And the legitimate legislative purpose of the Florida legislature determined whether or not there's sufficient communist activity in the State of Florida to justify redrafting that statute so as to make it clearly aimed at subversion directed against a state alone. 
    Another legitimate purpose in my judgment, is to determine whether or not subversive activity in the state is sufficiently extensive, that the legislature of Florida would want to exercise its right under, I think it's the Tenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, to get the state legislatures to attempt to initiate a constitutional amendment to the Federal Constitution to permit the states to enforce subversive statutes against subversion aimed at the United States Government itself as well as the states in spite of Your Honor's decision in Nelson against Pennsylvania. 
    I think the state has a right of self-preservation if Your Honor please, the same as the Federal Government has and I think there are many areas than legitimate areas for the state to operate in, in the field of subversion. I know that we've taken testimony in other hearings where we had competent witnesses to prove that one of the objectives of the Communist Party of this country is to obliterate the states because they look at them as individual packets of resistance. 
    There's no doubt at all that the communist conspiracy involved action against the state itself as well as the Federal Government is an interest.

    Mr. Justice Clark, in the absurdity of the position, it seems to me it was illustrated by counsel's statement to, I believe Mr. Justice Brennan or Mr. Justice White yesterday that he conceded that we hadn't the right to ask Reverend Gibson if they had any communist in the Miami branch. 
    But we didn't have the right to say, "Now, here's two communists and do you have them particularly in the branch?" 
    Now that's the whole situation if Your Honors please, you just lose reasons somewhere along this line in my judgment.

    Mr. Mark R. Hawes 
    There has been some proposed and not passed and there has been some proposed as a work of this committee and passed, in regard for instance to fingerprinting certain employees of the State Government. 
    We've investigated infiltration of the State Government in various agencies down there. 
    And one bill that I think of now that we passes all of these investigations was a bill requiring the fingerprinting of our employees permissibly and this section of the legislature, I'm sure we will have the necessary public opinion molded to passing mandatory to all our school teachers and all public employees in Florida. 
    But we've investigated many organizations, just not the purpose of this committee to just to smear NAACP at all. 
    Any other questions?
