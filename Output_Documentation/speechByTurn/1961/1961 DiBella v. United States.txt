speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="9.840" stopTime="290.835">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    The sole issue in the case is whether the Government can appeal from an order of the District Court, granting the respondent's pre-indictment motion to suppress evidence, when the order is entered in the district other than the district of indictment and trial, the -- the motion both for the suppression of evidence and for the return of the property. 
    The relevant facts are the respondent was arrested by FBI agents on September 29th, 1959 in Miami, Florida and charged with the robbery of a federally insured bank in Ohio, approximately a month earlier. 
    The arrest was based upon a warrant which was issued in the Southern District of Ohio which was later found to be invalid and on information known to the arresting officers which was later found to constitute probable cause. 
    Incident to the arrest, the respondent's house was searched and large sums of money and other items were seized. 
    On October 9th, 1959, a final hearing was held before the United States Commissioner in the Southern District of Florida on the Ohio complaint. 
    On October 12, 3 days later, the respondent filed a motion for the suppression of the evidence which was seized and for its return in the Southern District of Florida. 
    On October 16th, four days after the filing of the motion, an indictment was returned in the Southern District of Ohio. 
    And subsequently on December 18th, the District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted the respondent's motion to suppress the materials seized as evidence on the ground that the search and seizure were unreasonable, even though that the officers had probable cause to make the arrest but denied respondent's motion for the return of the property. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed the Government's appeal from the order of suppression on the ground that it was an interlocutory order in a criminal case. 
    In the petition for certiorari in this case, the Government contended that the decision of the court below was erroneous and that the order of the District Court was appealable. 
    In preparing our brief in the DiBella case, we -- we reevaluated our position to regard to the appealability of orders deciding motions to suppress generally and we've concluded that the decision of the court below in this case, dismissing the Government's appeal was correct. 
    I will first consider the order of the District Court as if it had been made in the district of indictment and trial instead of in the district of seizure which turned out not to be the district of indictment and trial and will contend that it would not have been appealable if it had been made in the district of indictment and trial. 
    I will then argue that it makes no difference that the order was entered in a district other than that of indictment and trial. 
    In the DiBella case, I indicate and I repeat now that we think none of the older cases, in the Perlman case, the Burdeau case, Cogen, Go-Bart which are the only cases which even bear on this subject, are holdings contrary to the Government's position. 
    While they tend against the Government's position and there's very little at any discussion in these cases, we do not think that they are controlling in view of the Court's more recent decisions. 
    In the Wallace Company case in 336 United States, this Court stated with regard to appealability, whether a motion is to be treated as independent and plenary or as merely a procedural step in a pending trial must be determined by particular circumstances. 
    We think this indicates that no mechanical rule should be applied and then again in the Carroll case, which is the most recent decision of this Court in this area, the Court emphasized in considering a Government appeal of an order granting a motion filed -- granting a motion to suppress filed after the indictment was returned unlike here in the DiBella where motion was filed before indictment that fragmentary appeals are not favored and “The delays in the prosecution of criminal cases are numerous and lengthy enough without sanctioning appeals that are not plainly authorized by statute.”

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, this one had brought to attention to the fact that in the Carroll opinions had occasion to say, I think it's not without significance in referring to the earlier case, earlier cases illustrated sometimes without inspection.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="307.249" stopTime="377.014">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right. 
    Precisely, Your Honor. 
    Now, that -- that statement was -- has been cited -- the state -- the statement in Carroll that the earlier cases decided that motions made before indictment are -- are appealable and motions made in the district other than the district of indictment and trial are appealable. 
    At that state -- those statements have been cited for the proposition when numerous Courts of Appeals and in -- and in DiBella case by the petitioner for the proposition that -- that in those situations that the appeal is automatically allowed. 
    We -- we think however, that the Court in -- in Carroll did not decide even in dictum which there would have been such a proposition. 
    It merely alluded to the earlier cases and did not have to consider them because that wasn't the issue which was before the Court. 
    The principle which the Government is contending for in both DiBella and in this case is that orders deciding motions under Rule 41 should not be appealable unless they decide important interest of the movement which are separate from the criminal case.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    There might be -- there might be a situation in which it would be different if the effect is substantially different. 
    For example, in this case the respondent contends that the effect of -- of granting a motion to suppress is res judicata, he doesn't use to resist, it is in res judicata but it's binding.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="400.222" stopTime="400.958">

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    But we think that -- if that is the effect then it must be a final order, and if it's a final order then the Government can appeal. 
    But we think he is wrong on the proposition that is binding or res judicata. 
    That it is not a final order and therefore it is not appealable.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    One thing I have in my mind and I may be going astray but the -- quite apart from the question of whether or not this would otherwise be an appealable order in a -- the -- the right of the Government to appeal on a criminal case is very much circumscribed, that is right of the Government to appeal I am talking about.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="659.104" stopTime="669.141">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Where in fact the most emphatic not only explicit legislation, but the history behind that showing why the Government should have appealed even though the defendant may not.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="669.141" stopTime="831.185">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I'd like now to consider the basic principle for which we've argued in the DiBella case and here in -- in five different situations, all involving pre-indictment motions to suppress and or seeking the return of the property. 
    First, we have the situation in DiBella where -- where the movement asked only with the suppression of evidence. 
    We think that there's no possible way that that kind of a motion could be independent of a criminal case. 
    The second situation is where the motion asked for the return of the items seized but the property is contraband so he's clearly not enti -- so that moving clearly isn't en -- entitled to the return. 
    So that in this case too we think that the motion is merely one for suppression even though it's labeled as also asking for return and the motion is not independent of the criminal case no matter when it is filed. 
    The third situation is where the motion asked for the return of property which may or may not be returnable to the movement even if it was illegally seized depending on the outcome of the criminal trial and I like to give an example. 
    For exa -- the -- the issue whether the property involved is contraband or is stolen often depends on the outcome of the criminal trial if -- in fact that's -- that's the situation here. 
    The money which was seized, the Government contends was stolen and therefore the movement isn't entitled -- the respondent isn't entitled to it -- to the return of this money even assuming that it was illegally seized. 
    So there too, in that kind of a situation we think even though the motion asked for both return and suppression, it is an -- is in essence only a motion asking for suppression and that therefore it is not independent of the criminal case. 
    And the fourth situation is where the motion asked both for suppression and return but the movement has an insubstantial property interest in the materials which were seized. 
    An example of that would be copies of documents which he doesn't -- with -- in which he has the original documents. 
    There's no need for him to get them back immediately. 
    Of course, he would be entitled to it -- to the return after trial. 
    We think that such -- that an order deciding that kind of a motion is not appealable since the movement's property interest is so unimportant that it -- that his plea for return does not make that portion of the motion an independent proceeding. 
    The last situation is where the movement asked prior to indictment again for both return and suppression and valuable property rights are involved. 
    Now in our brief, we suggested that that kind of a -- that that kind of a motion -- an order deciding that kind of a motion is appealable whenever it is made before indictment.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="831.185" stopTime="870.853">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If you had this kind of a case, the -- the events that potential offense was counterfeiting and a lot of money has been seized and the potential defendant as moving party has filed a motion to recover the money claiming that it wasn't counterfeit money at all. 
    It was considered authentic U.S. Treasury money and of course, if he were right there is no crime, is it -- would it -- at all would've been committed and if he were wrong, it would be contrabands and yet this would be the issue you say in the -- in the forthcoming criminal case. 
    What would the story be there?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="870.853" stopTime="880.784">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, that's -- that's -- in our views, the situation where you cannot appeal because he is not entitled to return prior to trial even if his motion for seeking suppression is successful.

    Although, I don't think -- I don't -- I know of no case in which it has arisen. 
    Now, in the -- in the example which the Chief Justice suggested, the Government in its briefs in these two cases indicated that -- that an order deciding that kind of a motion is appealable as long as the motion is made before indictment. 
    (Inaudible) -- I'd like to suggest, however, to the Court that the Fifth Circuit has a different rule. 
    It -- it would make the -- the crucial date in that kind of a case the complaint in the commitment hearing. 
    It -- it would -- the Fifth Circuit thinks that that is the start of the criminal case for these purposes and that the kind of a motion which the Chief Justice suggested is appealable only if it's made before there's been any start really to the criminal proceeding.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Now, turning on to -- to the facts of this case in applying the principles which I've suggested, the motion here was filed after the complaint in the commitment hearing but before indictment and had asked both for suppression and for the return of property and this property included $14,000. 
    We would -- we would think that if the respondent had an unchallenged right to the return of this money upon a finding that it was illegally seized, then that this proceeding would've been independent of a criminal case and the defendant would have been entitled to ap -- to appeal the refusal of the Court to return his property and the Government would've been entitled to ap -- to appeal the order of the -- of the District Court too. 
    However, this $14,000 is – is in litigation. 
    It is the issue, one of the issues in the criminal case. 
    The Government contends that this $14,000 is part of over $30,000 stolen in the bank robbery and therefore this issue must await the criminal case. 
    And we think that as to this part of the motion, it is -- it is just -- it in essence asked only for suppression and not for return even though it labels -- the motion is labeled both for suppression and return. 
    Now, there are some other --there is some other property involved and it's listed down on pages 15 and 16 of our brief, it's quite an extensive list but most of it is -- is extremely trivial royal -- of roles of coin wrappers and all things of that nature. 
    Now, the most important items were a pistol, three pairs of slacks and a sport shirt. 
    Now, while respondent is undoubtedly entitled to the return of this property, if it was illegally seized, we think that there isn't -- he doesn't have a substantial enough property interest in these materials to make his motion to return in regard to these items independent of the criminal case. 
    We think in other words, that his motion is based -- is basically a motion in the independent -- in this part of the criminal case, it is basically a motion asking for suppression and not for return. 
    In conclusion, I would like to emphasize two -- two points, one is that if the Government is wrong in DiBella and the -- and the order of the District Court in that case is appealable then we think a fortiori the order of the District Court in this case was appealable by the Government that the only factors which are different between DiBella and this case tend to show that the order in this case was more -- was more final. 
    The only two different factors are that here, the movement asked for both return and for suppression. 
    In DiBella he asked only for suppression and here, the motion was not only prior to indictment, but it was in a -- it was in a district other than the district of indictment and trial and we think both those factors tend to make it more final of those I've emphasized. 
    We do not think that it was a final decision that neither order either in DiBella or in this case was appealable.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Terris, before you move on, may I put this to you. 
    To my mind, these -- these two cases from -- involving these two cases is a far-reaching importance in the administration of criminal justice. 
    Isn't the matter as to district -- before the lower courts for great many years, I haven't gone from their cases, and I wonder if it's asking too much, you said, you agree but I just (Inaudible) not seeing you having done any. 
    But you -- I don't think the Government has done what I think needs to be done if you let me say so namely to make a comprehensive, present a comprehensive study as to what the lower courts have done over the years? 
    Why they've done it? 
    What discussion these cases have had or the people just made assumptions that would stand critical analysis because if there has been a uniform or an impressive rule of appealability, say for the last 50 years and before a -- of judges who have within the securities of these matters, that would -- that would make an impressive --

    He answers the door walking out of his living room still looking at the television, is greeted at the doorway with handcuffs on the FBI, “You're under arrest for a bank robbery”. 
    He is freighted through his living room, through his family into the kitchen in ordered to sit down. 
    At that time, may it please this Court, they ran into the front door, they ran into the back door, they climbed in through the windows, ten agents of the FBI. 
    This man, at that time, I'm sure was not thinking. 
    Is this a civil matter? 
    Is this going to be an independent action when I file to take back whatever they find? 
    He was fighting for his freedom at that point because he's been in handcuffs and chains since September 29th, 1959. 
    He is still in jail.

    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    4 o'clock, September 29th in the afternoon up in the Southern District of Ohio, some federal agent, FBI had sworn out a complaint before a proper United States' Commissioner. 
    That was teletyped down to the Miami Office, received about 4 p.m. 
    That was the first legal step of finding the defendant.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    A telegraphic warrant?
speaker="joseph_p_manners" startTime="1880.155" stopTime="1889.785">
    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    A telegraphic warrant was received by the Miami Office about 4 p.m., means that complaint obviously had to be filed between 3 or maybe 2 p.m. up in Ohio.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1889.785" stopTime="1893.545">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, that would be the initiation of criminals -- a criminal case, would it not?
speaker="joseph_p_manners" startTime="1893.545" stopTime="2019.615">
    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    And so this Court has held as early as 1894 in Post versus United States. 
    This Court has gone out and stated that the start of a criminal action is very apparent when an indictment is returned and when an information is filed, but it also starts at the very least when a commissioner's warrant is issued. 
    Now, what is the difference of a cow as the cow here, can it ever become a bull? 
    Now, and I have to apologize to the Court. 
    I'm talking now perhaps in a lower court fashion, but I'm greatly concerned, we can't be playing around with words and semantic problems of -- of any sort when it comes to something as fierce as this, 25 years of a man's freedom at stake. 
    My client isn't concerned, if I have to move back and tell him, “Well, I'm sorry, this is not a criminal case our fighting to stop this evidence from being used against you.” 
    The law is logical. 
    The law has to follow from the statute of const -- from the constitution. 
    There must be some reason in the law. 
    It's as simple as that and when it comes to rights of appeals which are not inherent, in our jurisprudence none whatsoever, strictly statutory and safely guard and limit it, especially when it comes to the Government, we must follow those rules of law. 
    And now what happens? 
    In the rights to appeal by the Government, it's extremely limited when it comes to a criminal case under Title 18, whatever the proper number may be and this Court is familiar with it. 
    They can only appeal for motions to dismiss that have been granted against them or for judgments in arrest of judgment. 
    They can't appeal from a judgment of acquittal, which is the vaguest thing any defense lawyer this client has. 
    They can't appeal from that. 
    And yet, they file a decision, the most final known under the criminal law. 
    But under Title 28, anyone can appeal from final decisions including defendants in criminal cases but not the Government. 
    And this Court has so held because the criminal statutes are limiting their rights to appeal when it comes to the Government.

    I don't stress as much and I didn't make a mention of it in my brief about the distinguishing as to property rights. 
    This didn't impress me one iota and if this Court would ask me why I moved for the return of the evidence on that particular motion to suppress, my answer in a very candid form would simply be that Rule 41 (e) says you shall move for the return of the evidence and suppression. 
    In fact, the return is first.

    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, I'll be honest with you, I'm taking Mr. Justice Frankfurter's view on this really. 
    I was afraid not to argue the point because it had been raised and brought and suggested by the Government here. 
    I'm inclined to feel the trial court first decide that. 
    I'd rather hope that doesn't have to but I'm being very candid again.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2255.037" stopTime="2267.192">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I understood your brief and I probably apparently misunderstood to say that this ruling in Florida will be completely binding on the judge in the Southern District of New York when this case is tried, this criminal case is tried.

    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    Except Mr. Justice Stewart, perhaps I wasn't that explicit. 
    I only raise that point because of the petitioner's brief in this case.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2280.014" stopTime="2301.912">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The only way that we can now pass on the question that -- that is before us that you've just made, that is not in this Court is on the assumption that we can't disperse the question of appealability without -- we can't decide that without deciding the res judicata. 
    For myself, I don't see that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2301.912" stopTime="2311.233">

    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    I'm inclined to feel that way, Mr. Chief Justice, I really am. 
    It was dictum in the Circuit Court, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    The petitioner stressed that for the simple reason he's saying that if it's final, now, we want you to take the DiBella view -- he was using these -- both sides of that sword that he was swinging around here and when he said that, of course I had to say something and we have an argument before this Court just to protect our rights. 
    But, I feel like I've just heard now mentioned by the various justices that this Court should only consider whether or not that order is appealable.

    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    Thank you. 
    Now, Mr. Chief Justice -- 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, oh yes sir. 
    The law in this regard has been settled for a long time and that is exactly what this Court has said in a few limited cases that are on this point that whether a motion is independent and plenary or whether it's part of a criminal case, not trial but case, would depend upon it's own particular characteristics. 
    Now, this is the law as pronounced by this bench. 
    And this is the law that's followed by every circuit in this land.

    And if we agree with Mr. Terris and say there are three --

    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    No.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2391.958" stopTime="2393.488">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- separate views.
speaker="joseph_p_manners" startTime="2393.488" stopTime="2471.836">
    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    I do not disagree, sir if I may continue? 
    The only disagreement comes in when this Court, and I -- I apologize to this Court, I'm not trying in any way to say anything to disparage you, is that whenever this general proposition of law has been phrased in two cases in particular, the Cogen and the Carroll case, as examples of the idea and maybe establishing a standard arbitrarily because there's never any rational or reasoning for it, the Court has gone on to say in its dictum that as an example of this is where a motion is filed prior to indictment or in a district other than in district of trial. 
    Now, we have disagreement in the Circuits. 
    The Second Circuit follows both the where and the when examples, both of them. 
    The Fifth Circuit uses the where and the when but doesn't it establish it as an arbitrary standard. 
    It uses as one of the practical factors to be considered, that's the Fifth Circuit. 
    The Fourth Circuit disagrees with this Court as establishing a standard of when. 
    They don't care when it's filed. 
    It's up with everything else, that's the Fourth Circuit. 
    The District of Columbia has now agreed with that position of when, in other words, we look at everything to see when it's concerned and not prior to an indictment.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2471.836" stopTime="2476.452">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Am I to infer that that's some reason if there's uniformity of you and the Circuit?
speaker="joseph_p_manners" startTime="2476.452" stopTime="2520.816">
    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    There is uniformity to the sense of dis -- disagreement. 
    I'm trying to make it brief, Mr. Justice Frankfurt if you please? 
    The majority of the Circuits do hold that as to prior to indictment rule or standard set, they follow it prior to indictment is appealable. 
    The Fifth says no, the Fourth says no, the District of Columbia says no. 
    The Second Circuit not only says no to that. 
    They also say if it's in a district other than the district of trial will be appealable. 
    That's the only Circuit that says that. 
    The Fifth disagrees and that's about generally where the law stands today. 
    But in none of these cases if Your Honor pleases are any rational or reasoning. 
    All the Circuit Court cases rely on Cogen and Carroll and the Wallace &amp; Tiernan Company case where --

    If it's to ever be appealed, it must be appealed now, then isn't it true?
speaker="joseph_p_manners" startTime="2597.254" stopTime="2756.582">
    Mr. Joseph P. Manners 
    That is correct. 
    If it could be appealed it should be appealed now, but Mr. Justice Whittaker if I may, if because you want to make it a final judgment does that mean that all final judgments are appealable because they are final judgments? 
    Now, the term final judgment is used under Title 28 of the rights to appeal statute, but a final judgment of acquittal is a final judgment as such and yet the Government could never appeal from that final judgment because it's found under Title 18. 
    If this is a criminal case from the word “go,” whenever it is a criminal case and this motion was filed pursuant to the criminal case, if this Court please, it still remains a part of the criminal case considering the purpose of why this motion was filed and that is to stop that evidence from going in to find this man guilty to give him 25 years for an alleged bank robbery. 
    Now, if the Court please, Mr. Justice Frankfurter brought it up earlier, Congress feels the right to the Government to appeal in criminal case is extremely limited. 
    And they enacted the Narcotics Control Act in 1956 giving the right to the Government to appeal in narcotics cases on motions to suppress. 
    Why because Congress felt and still does believe that the Government cannot appeal for motions granting -- motions to suppress from what is granting motions to suppress. 
    And if I may, I would like to just read a very short paragraph from the congressional record of the Senate, April 30th, 1956 at page 7284 wherein Senator Daniel while introducing the Narcotics Control Act Bill explained why he thought the Government should have a right to appeal and this is his words -- these are his words. 
    “The Bill would give the Government the right to appeal from lower court orders suppressing evidence in narcotics cases. 
    The Subcommittee found, during its investigation, that the liberal grant of motions to suppress the evidence has lost the Government many good cases against flagrant narcotic violators. 
    The Government now has no right of appeal if it believes the suppression of evidence was an error.” 
    Now, Congress went a little further under a criminal situation and said when it comes to narcotics, Government, you may appeal. 
    Congress is of the belief that the Government cannot appeal from orders granting motions to suppress evidence and here it is right from the congressional record. 
    Your Honor please, if there's nothing further come to you for this Court related to this particular question or questions, I respectfully submit that the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit should be affirmed.

    Mr. Terris.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="2852.061" stopTime="2885.984">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Your Honor, the -- I like to repeat that the Government feels that is the same right of appeal under Section 1291 that -- that private individuals do. 
    The Narcotics Control Act special provision deals with government appeals in the criminal case. 
    1291 in our view deals only with appeals that are not in the criminal case and that's in -- and -- and therefore, we think neither defendants nor the Government can appeal, assuming whether non-narcotics case unless they come under 1291 and that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2885.984" stopTime="2889.818">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Rule 41 is one of that rules of criminal procedures. 
    It seems to me that --
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="2889.818" stopTime="2890.321">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2890.321" stopTime="2897.150">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- my definition is in a criminal case. 
    And if you're in a criminal case then you come under the Criminal Appeals Act for the Government.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="2897.150" stopTime="2906.371">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, Your Honor, insofar as you're asking for return, we think -- we think that Rule 41 didn't -- didn't deprive the basic right of individuals to seek the return at their own (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2906.371" stopTime="2908.553">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    To bring an ordinary court action, I suppose that's true.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="2908.553" stopTime="2936.952">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, and -- and because it's labeled under 41, we don't think makes any -- makes any particular difference. 
    I'd like to -- I'd like to turn to the -- whether the issue of res judicata or the binding nature however you want to label it, is before the Court. 
    We think it is because if the order is final or as Mr. Manners said to the Mr. Justice Whittaker that this is a final judgment, well then it's a final decision and of course it's appealable, that's what the -- that's what the statute explicitly says.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2936.952" stopTime="2943.308">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it -- it's finality for purposes of an appeal necessarily equal to res judicata.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="2943.308" stopTime="2943.817">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2943.817" stopTime="2944.247">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't understand that.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="2944.247" stopTime="2946.315">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I -- I have two answers. 
    First of all --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2946.315" stopTime="2946.635">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't understand that.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="2946.635" stopTime="2995.942">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    -- this Court has itself indicated that there is a very, very post connection between the two and that is in the Wallace Company case. 
    It -- in considering a res judicata problem it said that the problem was essentially the same as for appealability. 
    The statement of judgments says it's basically the same issue, but Your Honor going beyond that, we think that even if -- that even if this order is appealable, final for that purpose, it may not be final for purposes of res judicata or on -- or however you want to label it. 
    The converse though is not true. 
    We think if it is final for purposes of res judicata that it is automatically appealable. 
    In other words, the standards insofar as they -- as they are different allow -- would allow appealability while not making the order absolutely binding on the trial court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2995.942" stopTime="2998.694">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is my whole -- that is my whole point.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2999.603" stopTime="3002.405">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You may have appealability not as res judicata.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="3002.405" stopTime="3023.006">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, that -- that's quite correct, Your Honor. 
    The -- the reason the Government argued this issue was to en -- ensure that the -- that in a later case, it would not be held that this order was absolutely binding in the trial court and yet in this case, have a decision that the order was not appealable. 
    We think that those two propositions cannot possibly fit together.
