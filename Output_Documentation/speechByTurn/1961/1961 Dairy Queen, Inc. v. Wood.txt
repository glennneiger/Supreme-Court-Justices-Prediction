Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Dairy Queen, Incorporated, Petitioner, versus Honorable Herold K. Wood, et al. 
    Mr. Egnal, you may continue your argument. 
    Mr. Ooms, I beg your pardon, sir.

    Mr. Owen J. Ooms 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Members of the Court, at the recess, we were having some colloquy with respect to whether in the question presented here, the breach of a contract involved a question of law or not. 
    I believe, I may in the colloquy which Justice Frankfurter engendered some confusion. 
    The question of whether the breach of a contract must be determined as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief or not does not necessarily involve a question of law. 
    It is a question of fact that the Court may and must determine before it can grant whatever relief the plaintiff asks. 
    Now, the fact that the Court must determine a question of fact is nothing uncommon or unusual. 
    We find that in all and many cases of equity. 
    If I may use a phrase and an illustration, if I alleged that a tort has been committed against me and file a suit to enjoin further torts, the common question of fact is whether in the first place a tort was committed. 
    That still does not take it outside the purview of a cause of acton for the chancellor alone. 
    Similarly, in a suit by one in possession of real property to acquire a title or to remove a cloud on the title, the court of equity may determine the legal title. 
    There still is the common question of facts. 
    In a suit for a specific performance of a contract, the court of equity may determine the making, the validity and terms of the contract.

    Yes, Your Honor.

    And I ask for information because I do not know. 
    In view of -- in view of the Seventh Amendment, what do the cases tell us or tell me that doesn't know. 
    Well, if you bring your suit for a specific performance and the answer is one that the so-called agent purported to make this contract for me had no authority. 
    And therefore, there was no contract. 
    And two, in the alternative for appropriate equitable reason, there shouldn't be specific performance. 
    And I claim a jury trial for on -- my first defense as to both defenses can be pleaded on the modern loose or free or rational pleading?

    Now, I suppose I make -- I put up those two defenses to your suit bill in equity for a specific performance.

    Mr. Owen J. Ooms

    Mr. Owen J. Ooms 
    Right. 
    Now, what do we have in this case, Your Honor? 
    We first must determine the breach of the contract. 
    This is the question of fact which the trier must try. 
    In terms of what the relief is asked and under all the cases, as I have been able to see it, as Judge Wood has said, this is an equity case. 
    We have asked for injunctive relief for trademark infringement in the county and another injunction pendent lite for money is unjustly received to be paid in to the Registry of the Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="392.345" stopTime="399.655">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Owen J. Ooms 
    You must look at the complaint in its entirety and the answer in its entirety. 
    And there are always going to be questions of fact which necessarily do not mean they're questions of law. 
    And the court of equity, the chancellor is in just as good at position to answer them as -- as a jury, if I might say, without violating the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution.

    Mr. Owen J. Ooms 
    That's an ultimate test at all. 
    Let me, in conclusion because I see my time is rapidly coming to an end, Your Honor, state that and read from what the -- Judge Wood found and stated what the complaint involves. 
    The complaint seeks in effect a declaration that the licensing contract is null and void and accounting of profits illegally obtained by the defendant since 1942 to date and a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from any use of plaintiff's trademark. 
    Now, what do we have here as it is presented here? 
    A preliminary injunction was granted December 28, 1960. 
    On March 1, this defendant came in after he felt the ill win of the chancellor's viewpoint as to what was involved here. 
    And we obtained a preliminary injunction. 
    What he is seeking here now is to get a new trier of the facts and further delay for his final day of accounting. 
    Your Honor, under these circumstances, we ask the Supreme Court here to invoke Rule 562 that is set forth on page 56 of the Court's rules. 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Michael H. Egnal

    I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter that your question may find an answer in a case cited here by the respondent on behalf of this plaintiff in Chappell which is a case that came out of the First Circuit. 
    In that case, the opinion, as I recall, it indicated -- excuse me -- that a question as to whether or not a contract was made is a question of fact that would be determined by a jury. 
    Now, it seems --

    Well, we sought --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="568.181" stopTime="590.763">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's strange that this should have been written before that there isn't a specific answer to my question because I should think it -- it must be a frequent occurrence that when specific performances sought, you challenge the justness of a contract because of lack of agency of the agent.
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="590.763" stopTime="595.528">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    Well, it may be that this is more or less regarded as hornbook because --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="595.528" stopTime="598.671">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Everybody that you'll leave it. 
    So what would be the case?
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="598.671" stopTime="599.984">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    It would seem that way.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="599.984" stopTime="602.502">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That these four judges below didn't, did they?
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="602.502" stopTime="779.415">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    No. 
    Now, it seems self-evident in this case that Mr. Ooms, with an awareness of the fact that his demand in the complaint for the balance due under the written contract creates a legal course of action is attempting to obscure that. 
    But, I think, Your Honors will find that the complaint in itself says that rather specifically and Judge Wood below understood it quite clearly because in his opinion, which is at page 36 of the record, he said in clear language, “Incidental to this relief, the complaint also demands the $60,000, now allegedly do and owing plaintiffs under the aforesaid contract”. 
    And we took his phrase of “incidental to this relief” to mean that he was giving it a subordinate position that the dominate phase of the case in his opinion was equitable. 
    And we submit that this is where Judge Wood erred in not accepting the teachings of Beacon that regardless of what evaluation, the two courses of action should be given, if there was present illegal course of action which he recognized, this defendant was entitled to a jury trial. 
    Now, I'd like to conclude with just two short paragraphs. 
    It seems to me that in Beacon, where you had two separate courses of action, one equitable, one legal, and this Court denied the right of the -- of the court below to postpone the trial of the legal course of action as a deprivation of the rights under the Seventh Amendment and in Thermo-Stitch, which followed that in the Fifth Circuit where you had two independent courses of action, one legal and one equitable, in which the same result was imposed. 
    We come to our case which seems to be even more compelling because in this case, it seems to me we have a legal course of action and an equitable which are dependent. 
    It seems to me that there can be no equitable relief in this case until this plaintiff has established the legal course of action because this case being heard by a jury would first determine whether there was a breach of the contract, whether any sums were due under the contract.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="779.415" stopTime="813.186">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does this question of jury or not jury have to be determined initially on the -- on the pleadings or later stages? 
    Because, if -- if the question is raised on the pleadings, then the plaintiff in the suit doesn't have to establish existence of a contract. 
    He alleged it and the denial of the existence comes from the defendant. 
    And therefore the plaintiff can prove this case without -- just on his inequitable demand.
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="813.186" stopTime="823.924">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    Accepting that, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, you get then to the question of fact which is common to both his position and the defendant's position.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="823.924" stopTime="837.681">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you don't mean to suggest of every question of fact that may arise in an equity suit when you try and it's hard to think of an equity suit in which questions of fact do not arrive has to be sent to a jury.
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="837.681" stopTime="838.625">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    No, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="838.625" stopTime="845.520">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The chancellor made call in the jury to aid him. 
    Their determination is just advisory when he does.
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="845.520" stopTime="845.997">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="845.997" stopTime="853.901">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And I can't imagine along with the Seventh Amendment every time a question of fact arises in an equity suit, you have to summon the jury.
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="853.901" stopTime="855.287">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    I agree with that, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="855.287" stopTime="858.828">

    Therefore, saying there's a question of fact doesn't take you very far from here.
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="858.828" stopTime="873.888">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    No, sir. 
    I should go on and say where the question of fact involves an issue which is a legal course of action. 
    And the legal course of action in this case is that demand for the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="873.888" stopTime="890.369">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Then my question, if I make a deal with that, then if -- if a question is raised by the defendant that the agent exceeded his powers, you think then you'd have to summon the jury for a jury determination.

    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    Yes, sir.

speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="891.433" stopTime="911.953">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    Yes, sir. 
    For the reason that that this question of fact, if it is left to the chancellor, would -- would be in the nature of a res judicata or an estoppel that would determine a legal course of action without a jury trial.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="911.953" stopTime="923.479">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, but every determination of fact by the chancellor has the term or is -- is the basis for res judicata. 
    I don't see that that helps me much.
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="923.479" stopTime="948.589">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    I think that, as I read the cases, the distinction is not whether there is a question of fact but whether the questions of fact are involved in an issue that make out a legal course of action or to put it in a converse that do not, in anyway, fall within the scope over either equity or admiralty.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="948.589" stopTime="1010.246">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Or take -- take proceedings brought by a corporation where specific performance of reformation of a contract or whatnot in almost every such case, a proper corporate proceeding may come an issue in fact that challenge do come an issue. 
    Was there a meeting of directors? 
    Did the directors have powers as inappropriate minute et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? 
    Now, those issues, if the corporation didn't act according to the requisite form or corporate procedure, the plaintiff is out but the defendant is out in his -- in his defense. 
    Now, what bothers me to get some guidelines to find out when a jury must be summoned or when the jury may be summoned, must be the Seventh Amendment chan -- made the chancellor's judgment.
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="1010.246" stopTime="1043.150">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    Well, apparently, if the question is closed, the -- the chancellor or the jury -- the Court must favor the implementation of the Seventh Amendment. 
    Now, if there is a clearly an equitable course of action that involves questions of fact, I would say that a jury trial would not be available and in the cases that have preceded this.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1043.150" stopTime="1051.152">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you saying anymore than money is in doubt, you better have a jury trial because the Supreme Court may reverse it?

    Mr. Michael H. Egnal

    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    Well, I would say that if this case did not have present, what appears in the pleadings and from the judge's opinion that in this case, the plaintiff is seeking to recover $60,000 which admittedly is an action for debt.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1093.421" stopTime="1112.616">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes. 
    But there has been no contract at all, equity can, in addition to giving its impersona relief saying mustn't do this in the future or should say you've been unjustly wrong, unjustly and unjustly enriched and walk out.
speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="1112.616" stopTime="1113.294">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    Well, I think in that --

    You wouldn't have to -- you don't have to call a jury.

    No, sir.

    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    No, sir. 
    Now, I think that that may point out the distinction. 
    And, I think you've mentioned that in your question yesterday. 
    Whether this particular demand for the $60,000 as empty seat where if in this case the defendant was a wrongdoing ab initio and it was sort to restrain further acts, equity would have jurisdiction and if the consequences of that were to make for damages as there would be no right to a jury trial but this case is distinguished by the sequence in reverse. 
    In this case, the plaintiff is saying, you breached the contract by not paying me $60,000. 
    And because you owed a $60,000, having established that, I want the Court to enjoin you permitting for the rights under this contract. 
    The complete reverse of what might be an equitable course of action.

speaker="michael_h_egnal" startTime="1398.950" stopTime="1509.023">
    Mr. Michael H. Egnal 
    Yes, sir. 
    To answer the first part of your question, Mr. Justice Whittaker, I don't think the prayers are controlling because under our Rule 54 (c), if during the trial of the case, it should appear that there is facts to support a judgment. 
    Irrespective of the prayers, the Court would have or the jury would have the right to find that kind of a judgment. 
    I think the prayers are merely in an advisory category. 
    However, this prayer does throw light on what the plaintiff is seeking. 
    The preliminary paragraphs in the complaint of where the failure to pay the $60,000, they call attention to the fact that it was because of the refusal to pay the $60,000 that this action was instituted. 
    You can see that from the letter of cancellation, purported letter of cancellation which is Exhibit C on page 27 in which they said this letter is to advise you that your failure to pay the amounts required in your contract then further, unless it's completely satisfied to the amount due and owing. 
    So, I say that upon a consideration of the complaint and the prayer, this is seems to be on unequivocally a demand to recover from this defendant $60,000 which is the balance, according to the plaintiff's position, now due and owing -- and due and owing under the contract. 
    And Judge Wood found that that was so.

    I suppose instead of couching that complain and the prayer and the language they did and it simply said that it were the truth in the proceeding that you have breached your contract to their that you needed an accounting because they didn't know exactly what you got and what you're going to get, so that in addition to suing you for the breach of contract, they wanted to supplement that by common lawsuit but an -- equitable accounting. 
    Would you say that that would give them a right to file the breach of contract issue because they later wanted to collect their money by either to discover an equity together?

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Yes. 
    Does it make any difference that they in collecting the money which they alleged to use them because of the breach of contract, they also wanted an accounting in order to forbid you to do some things in the future by injunction?
