    Mr. Joseph A. Mcdonald 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors. 
    After yesterday's session, I checked the file with respect to the current practice as to the cover sheets on the speeches and found there is no banner, Navy or AEC. 
    None has been used. 
    No cover sheet with a banner has been used since -- prior to December 1st, 1958 when that first speech was copyrighted individually, the one for delivery on December 11. 
    The distribution of the speeches was also changed at that time so that from that date, they were not available through the public information of the -- Public Information Office of the Navy. 
    Inquiries now made to the Public Information Office are referred to the Admiral's Office, and the Admiral's Office distributes these multi list speeches of which I have copies here. 
    They are on plain white paper, headed with the disclaimer, and the language concerning the release, the identification of the sponsorship, and the fact that the Admiral has prepared these remarks for public delivery.

    Mr. Joseph A. Mcdonald 
    No, I would like make it clear Your Honor that we do not concede that these changes were necessary for the successful maintenance of our position as to individual ownership in the Admiral. 
    But they were affected frankly to remove any vestige of a question and to put that much at rest. 
    The disclaimer was commenced may I add for the first time on October 29th, 1959 and of course, we concede that that was required by the language of the Navy regulation and its omission prior to that time was an oversight. 
    I made a statement yesterday that the Admiral's duties did not include the issuances -- the issuance of press releases. 
    And that is correct. 
    I checked with him on that as well as the speech handling and was advised that he has never issued one on behalf of the Navy. 
    Now occasionally of course, members of the press will approach him and you frequently see his name in the papers, but this is not pursuant to a press release which he has put out.

    No sir. 
    It was post the contact by Schnapper to the Admiral in October 1958.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="190.972" stopTime="194.879">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But not (Voice Overlap), anyhow, litigation was in the air.
speaker="joseph_a_mcdonald" startTime="194.879" stopTime="386.747">
    Mr. Joseph A. Mcdonald 
    Litigation was in the air, and the complaint was filed January 16th, 1959. 
    With respect to whether the petitioner in Number 36 wished merely to quote from the speeches rather than to publish them in full, I want to be sure you realize that. 
    While the Exhibit Number 1, the letter from Schnapper to Admiral Rickover ends with the statement I am very anxious to quote from them in the forthcoming book. 
    Contemporaneous with that request as memorialized in the statement of facts, page 6 of the record. 
    There were telephone conversations, this is page 6, middle of the page, contemporaneous with that request, there were telephone conversations between the parties whereby the plaintiff made it clear that he wished to publish the defendant's speeches. 
    In paragraph 5 of the complaint which appears at the foot of Record 3, says in its second sentence, the plaintiff desires to publish such speeches as have been made by the defendant. 
    I think of paramount importance here is the fact that the -- in addition to the Department of Defense Directive which is reproduced on the record page 99 to 103 in which it says in its paragraph 5, top of page 102 of the record, personnel who write for outside publication not in connection with their official duties on any subject shall ascertain and so forth that it will not interfere with their regular duties, the Navy Manual, a public information manual, which is reproduced on page 7A in the appendix to our brief in 55, U.S. Navy Public Information Manual, an official publication of the department labeled (Inaudible) P1035, Article 0514 provides in its sub (a), within the bounds of security, the writing of articles, speeches and similar material intended for publication on topics of military and professional interest is desirable and so authorized and in (b), commanders will provide full cooperation compatible with military security and/or assistants in the preparation of such material. 
    But the important one is in sub (e) over on page 8A, “military and civilian personnel may receive pay for private literary effort”. 
    This is a very clear recognition that personnel are encouraged to write and to own what they write else they could hardly receive pay for it. 
    It adds in that sentence to complete --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="386.747" stopTime="396.730">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That clause says, “However, they may not receive pay or other remuneration for the preparation of material on which their duties require them to provide gratuitously.”

    Mr. Joseph A. Mcdonald 
    Thank you, I should have added that myself.

    What does that mean?

    Mr. Joseph A. Mcdonald 
    This means that where they are required, if the Admiral had been required to make the speech, then he could not demand any pay for it. 
    These rounds out the sentence, first, they may receive pay for private literary effort but they may not receive pay or any other remuneration for the preparation of material required by their duties. 
    I think this makes a fine distinction between the two types of writing, one pursuant to orders or inline of duty and the other aside -- outside the line of duty, as a private undertaking.

    Mr. Joseph A. Mcdonald 
    In my opinion, they would not. 
    He'd be subject to discipline but his writing assuming and obviously this was contrary to orders not pursuant to orders, that would be his own work. 
    He would own it. 
    He'd be able to copyright it, and he'd be subject to disciplinary action. 
    Such a prohibition -- such an order not to write would not affect his rights in the material he wrote contrary to orders.

    He really doesn't have any office hours, and I, presently, well-aware of this 
    .As the stipulation says, he wrote it on the plane, in hotel rooms, at home, while traveling, and it's just -- if you will pardon the characterization, a human dynamo or perhaps I should say a human reactor and he is always on the go.

    I'm so -- I'm so sorry, but this is fundamental that the copyright statute is based on the Constitution of the United States, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, authorizes Congress to enact statutes to promote the progress of science and useful arts to encourage authors and inventors and enable them to get the exclusive right to their writings and their discoveries. 
    This is a right of the Admiral and it could be altered in my opinion by putting his employment, his career on the line by violating an order, but nobody could take away from him his right to own what he does write.

    Oh (Voice Overlap) --

speaker="joseph_a_mcdonald" startTime="806.794" stopTime="885.726">
    Mr. Joseph A. Mcdonald 
    Not in violation of Government orders. 
    I don't believe so. 
    Two of the cases have resulted in the material written by the employee belonging to the Government, Heine against Appleton and Sawyer against Crowell-Collier where the men in Sawyer against Crowell-Collier really used government personnel who were subordinates to prepare the map in question. 
    Heine against Appleton was a man engaged to prepare sketches in connection with Commodore Perry's explorations. 
    And when he claimed that he owned the sketches and know the part of your contract was that you would make these sketches for the expedition. 
    So they belonged to the Government. 
    But I don't know of any case where a man was ordered not to write and did so. 
    But I feel very sincerely that in violating the order, he would subject himself to discipline but what he wrote would be his. 
    He has a constitutional right to it and a statutory right to it, because the copyright statute in protecting works which are copyrighted also recognizes in its Section 2 the common law rights of authors in there writings up to the time that they are published.

    Mr. Joseph A. Mcdonald 
    May I point out that the Admiral was charged with concealment of some sort at the time he deposited on December 1st, 1958 a compilation of the first 22 speeches in order to have them copyrighted if possible as a compilation. 
    Now, in that case of course, each speech was redone to leave out the banner. 
    It was retyped on plain paper and this was very natural. 
    He didn't claim to own the material in the banner, what he claimed to own was the words he had written. 
    He couldn't begin to copyright that banner. 
    He took off the cover the sheet, had the text on that page retyped and incorporated all 22 of them in a compilation which was deposited for copyright. 
    Now frankly, I'm not going to spend a minute on the nature of that copyright unless you wish because I will concede that copyright in a compilation doesn't give the depositor anymore rights than he had in the individual components of the compilation. 
    But, I do want to point that connected with that there was some intimation here that the Register of Copyrights had conspired with the Secretary of the Navy to buckle up this material which should have been government material and prevented its use by publishers in violation of the First Amendment, and this is absolutely contrary to the fundamental concepts of the Copyright Law. 
    The Register of Copyrights doesn't hand out copyright. 
    You obtain copyright in this country in published works by publishing the work with a notice of copyright in the proper place. 
    It's as simple as that. 
    You don't have to go near the copyright office. 
    Frankly, you don't. 
    The mere fact of publication with notice gives you copyright for 28 years. 
    Now the statute does say that promptly, thereafter, you must deposit. 
    And you must deposit with a claim with an application for registration of your claim to copyright. 
    Now, there was some reference to an 18 month rule. 
    This is really not so. 
    I'm not quibbling about the fact that in that particular case, approximately 18 months, I think it was 14. 
    It makes no difference but there's no particular deadline within which you must file your work with an application for registration of your claim. 
    The Washingtonian case, 306 U.S. says, “That it cannot -- the copyright cannot be defeated by such a delay.” 
    As a practical matter, in as much as you have to accompany a complaint in infringement with proof that you've acquired a copyright, you have to file an application and get a certified copy thereof to attach to your complaints so the practical requirement is that you must apply the copyright before you sue and nobody can say what that is. 
    I personally think it could be 27th of the 28 years. 
    Now, this is brings me to the point where I have hardly time to press on your attention, the part of this case on which we are appealing. 
    We've been discussing the very interesting and important main point. 
    But Mr. Justice Reed and Judge Danaher agreed with him in a divided court, in the Court of Appeals, reversed Judge Holtzoff with respect to the dedicatory effect of the distribution in the form of press releases of the early speeches. 
    I really feel that this was error. 
    Mr. Justice Reed's opinion refers to the fact that taking the whole thing in the round including the fact that there was performance here, and so many copies here and so many copies here. 
    It involved a dedication. 
    The first place performance alone is not a dedication. 
    The distribution of the copies only can constitute a dedication. 
    You can put a play on Broadway, not copyrighted, no dedication. 
    No dedication until you distribute copies. 
    I urged upon you a consideration of an interesting case, White against Kimmel which is decided 10 years ago in California. 
    Judge Yankwich writing made a remarkable survey of the law of dedication through wide publication. 
    In that case, a book was involved. 
    Don't forget that here a speech was involved and there is a difference. 
    The speech is prepared for oral delivery and when you distribute it in a form of a press release, it's for the convenience of the press to let people know what you plan to say. 
    And I will say that when the Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit reversed Judge Yankwich, they did so without citing a single case. 
    They praised the opinion of the District Court remarkably clear and comprehensive review of the law with respect to a dedicatory divestitive type of distribution of copies. 
    But they said he had stretched the facts a little bit. 
    There was a dispute whether 75 or 200 copies had been distributed and they said that in this case that he had gone just a little too far. 
    They said this case of the books distributed by the writer in White against Kimmel is not thought to be comparable with those cases involving publication of lecture notes or the distribution of copies of a minister sermon among the members of his congregation. 
    It is by such assimilation that the trial court endeavors to satisfy the criterion. 
    But White, in distributing these books, White does not appear in the record as a teacher or as a propagandist endeavoring to persuade. 
    He is not pictured as a man with a message. 
    I sincerely feel that Rickover is a man with a message. 
    If Rickover's speeches had been before Judge Yankwich, he would obviously have decided the case exactly as he did in White against Kimmel. 
    And I believe, giving due attention to the language as expressed by the Court of Appeals itself that if Rickover speeches had been there involved, the Court of Appeals would not have reversed Yankwich and therefore I commend to you Judge Yankwich's decision in that case and the treatment of it by the Court of Appeals.

    They decided that the notes kept by Captain Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which later proved to be very valuable after they have had been found in a trunk in somebody's attic in Saint Paul had been written by Captain Lewis not as a part of his regular duties on the expedition. 
    Captain Clark had been enjoined by President Jefferson to keep careful notes and make a report because they realized they were working on the purchase at the time. 
    They realized that this would be of great future importance to the country, but what happened was that formal reports were duly sent to Washington, but then these other notes which Judge Nordbye in his beautiful opinion though somewhat long said was the private writings of Lewis. 
    And therefore when they were found in an attic and traced to an Indian office in Oklahoma where Lewis was between then -- between his expedition and his retirement, stationed in the office of Indian Affairs, these were pieces of personal property that belonged to his successor who found them in the old desk in Oklahoma, took them home to Saint Paul and he retired, and the descendant of his found him in the attic. 
    They didn't belong to the Government and its important Your Honor that in that case, the United States really got in there and pitch. 
    They made a great claim for these documents and they lost the case.
