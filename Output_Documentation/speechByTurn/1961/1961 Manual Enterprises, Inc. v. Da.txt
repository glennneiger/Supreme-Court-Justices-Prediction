Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- Manual Enterprises, Incorporated, et al., Petitioner, versus J. Edward Day, Postmaster General of the United States. 
    Mr. Doolittle, you may continue your argument.
speaker="j_william_doolittle" startTime="11.763" stopTime="174.767">
    Mr. J. William Doolittle, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Before I begin my argument this morning, I should like briefly to clarify the circumstances chronologically concerning the initi -- initiation of these mailability proceedings, particularly in response to questions yesterday of Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    Since these facts are not in the record and since I'm not sure that they're completely clear, I do want to make sure that there's no confusion with respect to them. 
    Now, you recall as pointed out yesterday that the General Counsel of the Post Office originally informed the mailer, in this case, petitioner, that in his opinion, the matter was nonmailable and also that it was not of sufficient value to warrant a hearing. 
    Now on the 11th of April, the mailer appealed this decision to the Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department according to regulations, informing him that the magazines that actually been deposited in the mail were not the only thing at issue. 
    These were only part of the issue of the magazines and that therefore there were great many more that would be affected by a determination of nonmailability and on the basss of that representation, the judicial office held they were sufficient value to warranty hearing. 
    And he made that decision on the same day, April 11th and it was also on that same day that mailer when into District Court and got ex parte, a temporary restraining order, so that these things all happened on -- on the same day. 
    And then it was on the morning of April 12, the following day, the Government went in and had this temporary restraining order stayed in order that they might respond and eventually, argument was held and the complaint was dismissed without prejudice to petitioner's going back in if the administrator proceedings were not completed by a date certain. 
    Now, as we have pointed out in our brief, there is no basis at all in this record for the suggestion that the mailer, the petitioner here, in anyway force the Post Office Department to hold a hearing. 
    The Post Office regulations provide for a hearing, procedures prescribed in those regulations were followed in every respect in this case.

    Well, the record doesn't reflect that. 
    Frankly, I can't state certainly that the Judicial Officer was unaware.

    Mr. J. William Doolittle, Jr. 
    Precisely so Mr. Justice, precisely so. 
    Now, I should like to argue it first that procedures employed by the Post Office Department were required by Congress, and secondly that they did not constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint. 
    In 1921, in the dissenting opinion in the Milwaukee Publishing Company against Burleson, Mr. Justice Brandeis made this statement. 
    As a matter of the administration, the Postmaster General through his subordinates rejects matter offered for mailing or removes matter already in the mail which in his judgment is unmailable. 
    The existence in the Postmaster General of the power to do this cannot be doubted and we submit that that statement is as valid today that it was 40 years ago when Mr. Justice Brandeis made it. 
    The 18 U.S.C. 1461, which was first enacted in 1865, unequivocally declares that obscenity and I quote, Is declared to be nonmailable matter and shall not be convey in the mails or deliver it from any Post Office or by any letter carrier. 
    It seems to me clear from the face of the statute as well as from the legislative history which we have set forth on pages 59 to 61 of our brief.

    We suggest too that this power is confirmed by various other legislations such as Section 39 U.S.C. 4001, which I've already referred to. 
    Now, 4001 (a) is the provision that declares that various items will be nonmailable and then 4001 (b) provides that mail that is not refused by the post -- local Post Office when it is offered, but managed to reach the offer -- office of delivery shall be disposed of as the Postmaster General shall direct. 
    Now, furthermore, this provision is part if comprehensives scheme in which a variety of matters, all of which is referred to in Section 4001 (a) by reference and including such items as explosives and disease germs, are declare to be nonmailable matter and precisely the same language.

    Mr. J. William Doolittle, Jr.

    Well Mr. Justice --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's a very different problem.
speaker="j_william_doolittle" startTime="692.698" stopTime="704.367">
    Mr. J. William Doolittle, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas -- of course, there had been qualifications in the area of granting or denying, second class mailing privileges, but of course that's an entirely different question. 
    As you may recall from the Hannegan case --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="704.367" stopTime="705.297">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I beg pardon.
speaker="j_william_doolittle" startTime="705.297" stopTime="890.048">
    Mr. J. William Doolittle, Jr. 
    -- there you were dealing with something that was conceded to be mailable under these provisions, conceded to be mailable under the -- the nonmailability provisions, but in spite of that fact, a second class mailing privilege was denied and this Court speaking through your opinion said that could not be done. 
    Now, we submit that if the Post Office authorities are thus require to exclude obscenity from the mails, it must also follow that they must refuse to carry questionable matter pending a determines -- determination as to whether or not it is mailable because the time required for the transmission of mail is always going to be less than the time within which a full and fair hearing with adequate notice can be conducted and if the material must be allowed that can be conducted in the mails during this hearing, the proceedings to determine mailability would variably become moot and the Post Office would be without any power whatsoever to enforce this congressional declaration of nonmailability. 
    It would also be required not only to violate this requirement of Congress, but also to a -- in the commission of the crime of conducting of sending obscene matter through the mails. 
    And now, in addition it has always, always been the consistent practice of the Post Office Department to refuse to carry matter deemed to be obscene, unless and until it was authoritatively determined to be mailable and we've set forth the details of that administrative practice in our brief on pages 63 and 64 and this has been true as I say from the very outset. 
    This longstanding interpretation, developed by those who were charged with the responsibility of administering this law and then in -- interpretation which as we point out in our brief, Congress has been made fully aware of, we submit would be entitled the great weight even if the statute were as clear on its face and in its history as this one is. 
    And we submit that in view of the wording, the history and the context of 18 U.S.C. 1461 and of Post Office Department's consistent and longstanding administrative interpretation of it, there can be no serious question of the Post Office -- of the Postmaster General's authority to refuse to carry matter deemed obscene pending a determination as to whether it is obscene or not. 
    I might add that over the years. 
    In a long serious of case -- cases beginning with ex parte Jackson in 1877, this Court has made clear it manifest assumption that the Postmaster General did have this power. 
    Mr. Justice Brandeis' statement albeit in dissenting opinion, was but one instance of -- of many and which this Court has indicated its assumption on that point. 
    We've set forth this --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="890.048" stopTime="893.116">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, you say albeit in the dissenting opinion a fortiori.
speaker="j_william_doolittle" startTime="893.116" stopTime="1074.448">
    Mr. J. William Doolittle, Jr. 
    Well, that's true. 
    That's right and these cases we have set forth and discussed in pages 75 to 79 of our brief. 
    Now on the point prior restraint, the contention that the procedures involved in this case, did involve a prior restraint go to fact that as I've indicated the Postmaster General refuses to carry matter deemed, obscene pending a determination of its mailability, we submit that this contention is wholly without merit. 
    In the first place, this procedure does not have prior impact within the meaning of the prior restraint doctrine, and this is principally for the reason that it operates not prior to publication of the material in question, but only after it has been printed and offered to the public. 
    There is nothing under this procedure that need be submitted to the authorities in advance. 
    The onus is on the postal officials to initiate any action that is to be taken and the administrative determination involved in these cases has no future effect. 
    It covers only the material that has already been published, deposited in the mails and then determined to be obscene. 
    Thus, the procedure employed in these cases is wholly free from the vices that caused this Court condemned the procedures, for example that were issue in Near against Minnesota as prior restraint. 
    In the second place, we submit that this procedure does not work really a fully effective restraint within the meaning of the cases this Court has decided. 
    In Kingsley Books against Brown in 354 US, the Court upheld does not involving a prior restraint an injunction against the sale and distribution of allegedly obscene matter pending a determination of its obscenity. 
    Now, the restraint involved in these cases of course far less severe. 
    It may -- it -- the allegedly obscene matter in this case is merely denied the use of the mails pending that determination. 
    The mailer is free to sale and distributes this material in any other way he's able to do free and I suggest this is important, free from the possibility to hazard to contempt prosecution and in this case, we submit that the feasibility of this alternative is really quite clear. 
    These magazines as the record indicates are not by and large are sent through the mails to individual subscribers. 
    They are largely sent in bulk to news dealers who then sell them on newsstands and it would seem that they could very easily be shipped by express or some other type of carrier.

    Mr. J. William Doolittle, Jr. 
    Now, we certainly recognized that there is some measure of restraint involved in denying the use of the mails to this mater -- material pending a determination of its obscenity, but we submit that to the extent at these procedures do involve some restraint on the publisher. 
    They are surrounded by sufficient procedural safeguards as not to interfere with the free flow of constitutionally protected non-obscene matter. 
    The guidelines to be applied in attempting to determine whether or not this is so had been largely spelled out by this Court, by the contrast between Marcus against Search Warrants in 367 US and the Kingsley Books case that I have discussed. 
    Now, I think it's important to point out that in Kingsley, the procedures there were being balanced against and injunction against sell and distribution. 
    In Marcus, there were being balanced against complete seizure of the materials, here against refusal to carry in the mail. 
    We submit that while the fact that some restraint is involved does necessitate some safeguards, the facts that it is only refusal to carry in the mails does there significantly on what will constitute reasonable safeguards in this instance. 
    Now, the Post Office procedures in this case suffer from none of the critical defects that the Court identified in the procedures in the Marcus case. 
    In Marcus, the proceedings were instituted on the basis of conclusory assertions of a single policeman. 
    Here, the questionable matter is initially pass on by a local Postmaster and then by legally trained Senior Administrative official, fully schooled in the decisions of this Court and of a lower courts in the law of obscenity, before any mailability action is instituted. 
    In Marcus, there was no identification of the specific matter being proceeded against. 
    Here of course, the material that was at was an issue was identified fully and completely from beginning to end and there was not possibility of the findings going beyond the material that actually was in issue.

    Then you started to explain it namely, that why -- that this was -- which led me to ask you was the ironic and you didn't care for that adjective, I don't blame. 
    I didn't try put it in the vernacular and said was he kidding, didn't he mean it.

    Mr. Stanley M. Dietz 
    Well, as you asked me the question Mr. Justice, I'm not an expert on the inside of his mind, but in my opinion, I would say that he meant it in part.

    Well, this -- this is just one photographers worked Mr. Chief Justice. 
    You will notice in the back of directory of the magazines, there are some 40 or so names listed as contributing photographers to these magazines, but, this -- this counsel has trouble in my own mind, with this -- this problem. 
    I -- I mentioned that yesterday, even if these magazines are beamed -- magazines which are at homosexuals, if there's such a thing as a class of people named homosexuals, if these magazines are beamed off, then what does this One, Inc. versus Olesen case stand for? 
    Are homosexuals allow to receive the pick ups or literature that they may chose to purchase or -- or they to be censored out of that because we, as so called normal people don't like homosexuals. 
    It's not --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3117.510" stopTime="3163.519">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Your principle argument is Mr. Dietz, is it not that these publishers have -- have the right to -- to beam to the homosexuals of the country, these things that appeal peculiarly their prurient interest and that if we do not do that -- if we do not permit that, we are denying to them that which is given to -- to other people because some other things that are in circulation do appeal perhaps to -- to the sex motives of -- of those people.

    When you say where that there -- to go to homosexuals to appeal to their prurient interest. 
    I don't go this far, you see because I don't -- as I see the testimony and the psychiatrists, I don't feel that it holds that far. 
    Now, the Government -- I didn't want to get in to this particular -- you put me on the spot, but --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3189.933" stopTime="3193.684">

    Mr. Stanley M. Dietz 
    I didn't want --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- we were denying to homosexuals the right to have what's comparable with other people to pin up, pin up girls and -- and you said that if we did that, if we took away from them the right to have something that it would appeal to them in the same way that the so called girlie magazines appeal to the -- to the normal persons that we would depriving them of something to which they were lawfully entitled.

    -- 27 -- the Government claims that I give in the record on page 28, but if you will examine page 27 of the record, you will see that when I was questioning this witness, I started all my questions as appear on 28 were of the magazine -- using the magazine One Incorporated, which this Court had ruled upon in its prior case One Inc. versus Olesen. 
    I had used this magazine to show, to compare with the psychiatrists in my cross-examination of him. 
    I showed them the magazine, this picture in the magazine, Is this worst in the pictures in our magazine? 
    He said, Yes wanted appeal --

speaker="stanley_m_dietz" startTime="3362.488" stopTime="3443.633">
    Mr. Stanley M. Dietz 
    I also showed him the Sunshine &amp; Health Magazine. 
    This is also in the record, which this Court had ruled to be not obscene or at least mailable and the photographs that were therein contained and in that magazine and he also testified and it's in the record that that these magazines would be -- even more appealing to the prurient interest of a homosexual because of a complete nudity of the particular model. 
    And Mr. -- Mr. Justice Stewart hit the nail right on the head when he said that he assumes at the Empires State building would appeal to some erotic interest in some people. 
    Well, this was my argument and it appears in the record that there was so many myriad of different things that would appeal to homosexual that you could not possibly have any sort of a photographic magazine without appealing to -- to some different face of homosexuals which goes back to what I argued to the Chief Justice yesterday that you cannot have any standards, because there was so many different degrees in this category of people and Mr. Kinsey phrased that out and we've argued that in our -- in our brief.

    I don't think that -- in this particular case or that you have mentioned, I don't think that the Post Office would have that right.

    It was merely because in the foreign language?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I have reach to that point. 
    I'm asking you whether they could find out what the -- what the -- what the figures or holographic are which are in the foreign script. 
    Could it translated into English, could it be translated? 
    But if you don't want to answer, that's alright too.

    Mr. Stanley M. Dietz 
    I -- I'd like to be able to answer. 
    Let's say that they --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Suppose the equipment is French, suppose a lot of French stuff comes in, can the Post Office in order to find out what the contents are have the French translated into English? 
    Well, that seems to be too difficult a question I (Inaudible).

    No I did not and I did not -- I did not ask for a jury trail in the administrative proceeding. 
    It wasn't provided in their rules as I said yesterday. 
    I tried to play ball by their rules even though they didn't play ball by their rules and I see all a lights are flashing on me but --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Could you answer my question?
speaker="stanley_m_dietz" startTime="3657.218" stopTime="3806.075">
    Mr. Stanley M. Dietz 
    I would like to -- I did like to -- all the Justices seem interested on the Government's examination, the Government's argument, about the sequence of events here. 
    Well, now I have before me and it's in the record, the letters of April 5th and April 7th and of course the letter of March 1st which was the first one that we had received. 
    As I stated yesterday, they stopped our issue. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Brennan asked question yesterday about Womack's conviction. 
    Womack was convicted in the end of January of 1960, I believe it was a 28th and 29th. 
    The next week, these magazines which would have hit the mail to the first week in February, they were stopped, although we were not notified of it until March 1st 1960 is the letter that we've received notifying us that these magazines -- that some of these magazines had been stopped, not all. 
    They were withdrawn from the mail. 
    That -- that was the first part of it. 
    And in that -- and it's very interesting that the Government did never rely on any other section of the code in any of these proceedings except Section 1461 and each time if they stop any raw material, they give us some of Section 1461 along with the rules of procedure. 
    Now, on April 5th and April 7th, they wrote to us and of course April 5th, they told us that they had stopped these magazines which had been mailed on the 25th of March and then they gave us 10 days in which to come in and object to their procedure, they -- and -- just time sequence. 
    So actually what we did was we went to the District Court and in the District Court, Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked yesterday why we didn't flood the mail with materials during the day and a half or two days that we had on temporary restraining order, in that case Mr. Justice Frankfurter, all that we went in to the District Court and asked for was an administrative hearing, which by the -- they -- they were apparently trying to deny us this hearing. 
    We were not trying to get around the hearing. 
    We came in to court and asked for a hearing. 
    And I have the original complaint here, the motion for the first --

    You asked the question --

    -- I've looked over the magazine again and the Reader's Digest article was not (Inaudible)

    Mr. Stanley M. Dietz 
    I didn't think so because I am very familiar for me with these magazines, although the gentlemen at the Post Office and this appears in the record, all -- the expert so forth call the experts on obscenity to Post Office (Inaudible) read one word to text for many of magazines. 
    Even the psychiatrist who testified that the use to change was supposed to have been so bad because it appealed to some advocates that wants to be changed up and beaten to the death. 
    This use to change in that photograph was illustrating an article pernicious. 
    I asked to gentleman -- the doctor, was he is ever heard a pernicious, know anything about it and this was article in our book and he confessed complete ignorance and then said that he -- he's not -- he's not expert on those kind of matters. 
    And then you also asked a question Mr. Justice Black which -- whether there are such things as the experts on obscenity, Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote in his concurring opinion in Smith versus California, a very strong concurring opinion which I have attempted to use in other case to get courts to listen to experts, but apparently, they don't follow this particularly. 
    They hold there's no such thing as expert.
