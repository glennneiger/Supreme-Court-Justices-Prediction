Kesler v. Dept. Of Public Safety

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 14, Harold Beck Kesler, versus Department of Public Safety, Financial Responsibility Division, State of Utah. 
    Mr. Skeen.
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="13.132" stopTime="358.883">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from a judgment of the three-judge court, denying injunctive relief against the enforcement of the Utah Safety Responsibility statute. 
    We contend that the Utah statute conflicts with Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act and is therefore void. 
    With the permission of the Court, I would like to read a brief reference from the section -- sections of the statute that we have in question here. 
    They are found on pages 3 and 4 of my brief. 
    “Whenever any person fails, within 60 days, to satisfy any judgment upon the written request of the judgment creditor or his attorney, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the court or the judge of a court which has no clerk in which such a judgment is rendered within the State to forward to the Commission immediately after expiration of said 60 days, a certified copy of the judgment.” 
    The following section provides that upon the receipt of the certified copy of the judgment, the Commission shall suspend the license and the registration of the judgment debtor’s vehicle and then follows a subsection, “if the judgment creditor consents in writing in such form as the Commission may prescribe that the judgment debtor be allowed license and registration or non-operating residence operating privilege, the same maybe allowed by the Commission in its discretion for six months, from the date of such consent and thereafter until the consent is revoked.” 
    The following section provides that such license and registration shall remain so suspended and shall not be renewed or shall any such license registration be thereafter issued in the name of the person unless and until such judgment is stayed, satisfied in full or to the extent hereinafter provided and until the said person gives proof of financial responsibility, then follows this statement. 
    “The discharge in bankruptcy following the rendering of any such judgment shall not relieve the judgment debtor from any of the requirements of the Act.” 
    The following section provides for application for -- to the Court for relief, but it’s not involved in this case. 
    Now, we take the position, Your Honors, that the provisions of the statute I have read give the creditor a measure of control of the suspension and renewal of the driver's license which in effect puts into operation a collection device and what in effect, write into the Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act another exception, which we contend would be clearly contrary to the constitutional provision granting to the Congress the right to establish the power and authority to establish a uniform bankruptcy law. 
    Section 17, Your Honors will recall, provides a discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all his provable debts. 
    The facts in this case are such as to squarely raise this question. 
    The bankrupt, appellant here, was sued in a state court. 
    A judgment was recovered against him. 
    The judgment creditor immediately requested that the copy of the judgment be sent to the Commission. 
    The Commission suspended his driver's license and registration certificate and the -- following that, the bankrupt or the judgment debtor, filed a petition in bankruptcy and he was discharged. 
    Following his discharge, the bankrupt made a written application to the Commission to restore his driver's license. 
    That application was denied and the letter denying it, which is in the record, the Commission stated that -- quoted this provision that a discharge in bankruptcy shall not relieve the judgment debtor. 
    The bankrupt then filed this proceeding in the bankruptcy court to assure to him the fruits of the litigation and to get injunctive relief through the bankruptcy court against the enforcement of the statute contending as I stated that the statute is void because it conflicts with the bankruptcy law.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Skeen, did the court below determine whether the petitioner had complied with the -- with the provisions of state law concerning the restoration?
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="373.182" stopTime="405.944">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    We submitted the case on a stipulated set of facts which outlined what the judgment debtor had done and it's clear in this case that there was a request by the judgment creditor under the statute and we think it's very clear that the -- before starting the proceeding, the bankrupt made a timely application to have his license restored.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="405.944" stopTime="419.173">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But did he comply with the Act? 
    Did they find that he complied with the Act in making his petition for restoration? 
    I think he could have under that Act could have shown financial responsibility and have had it restored --
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="419.173" stopTime="419.372">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="419.372" stopTime="426.356">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- at least notwithstanding. 
    Now, did he -- did the Court find whether he'd complied with that section of the law or not?
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="426.356" stopTime="455.305">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    The Court made no formal findings in the case we submitted it on the stipulated set of facts to the three-judge court and the -- it's certainly clear that there is no question about that based on the case before the three-judge court. 
    Now, this case Your Honor -- Honors --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="455.305" stopTime="513.934">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does that bar this Court from considering whether there isn't relief for him under the state law which he has not exhausted? 
    The fact that the three-judge court, that the litigation didn't take that element into account to which the Chief Justice has referred, does that bar this Court from considering whether in fact we have what might be called an abstract question here? 
    In other words, the implication as I get it of the Chief Justice's question is that if he could get his license restored under state law by an appropriate application from the state agency and he didn't resort to that, then haven't we got a situation in which the constitutional question is what might be called premature?
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="513.934" stopTime="559.672">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    Well, I might answer it in this way, Your Honor. 
    The bankrupt judgment debtor made a written request for restoration, setting up his discharge in bankruptcy and the relief was denied by the State not because he didn't tender performance under the -- by showing that he had insurance, but simply because the discharge in bankruptcy didn't entitle him to get the first base on the question. 
    That -- that factually stopped any further proceedings to get the license renewed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="559.672" stopTime="577.366">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, you're -- neither your state agency, your Supreme Court held that the debt was not discharged. 
    In other words, if he was sued for this judgment, debt, for discharging bankruptcy I'd take it would be controlling, wouldn't it?
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="577.366" stopTime="583.532">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    If he -- if he were sued on the debt, of course, the discharge would be controlling --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="583.532" stopTime="584.855">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that -- so that --
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="584.855" stopTime="586.130">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    There's no question about that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="586.130" stopTime="623.256">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that the -- what your state agency did as approved by your Supreme Court is not to say that the debt isn't discharged, didn't say that. 
    They said that in effect, what was said in Reitz namely that the State has another interest which isn't included in what -- in -- which isn't a consequence of a discharged debt. 
    The debt may be discharged and get some -- something -- some -- the State may draw some conclusion from the fact that the fellow didn't pay his debt although he doesn't have to pay it because of the Bankruptcy Act.
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="623.256" stopTime="637.593">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    Well, of course admittedly, the cases hold that the Bankruptcy Act simply destroys the procedure to collect the debt.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="637.593" stopTime="638.065">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Right.
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="638.065" stopTime="844.985">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    The debt is still there. 
    However, the position we take and urge is that the State has no right by this sort of legislation to inject another exception into Section 17. 
    And we contend that that's exactly what is happening here because of the element of creditor control in the case. 
    Now, in the Reitz case, the Court concluded that had the clerk by a force of law been required to certify the judgment in and had the creditor had nothing to do with the case that it would be -- would not contravene the Bankruptcy Act and would be a valid exercise of the police power and constitutional, but in that case, we had the same problem involved here except that in this case, we think that there can be no severability of the creditor controlled features of the law. 
    Your Honors will recall that in the Reitz case which involved the New York statute, the statute as originally enacted simply provided for the certification of the judgment to the Commission and the Commission was thereupon authorized to suspend the operation of the law for a period of three years -- or the license for a period of three years. 
    Then in 1936, New York amended the statute to permit the creditor, judgment creditor, to allow six months use of the suspended license and then in 1939, the New York statute was amended to provide for suspension only upon action of the judgment creditor. 
    Now, those two amendments, 1939 and 1936 are substantially the same as our statute laws when it was enacted as a whole. 
    We did not go at it piecemeal. 
    The entire statute was enacted as a whole and we think that clearly, there was no possibility of these creditor control provisions being severable from the rest of the statute. 
    If they were taken out of the statute, it wouldn't be what the legislature intended and there wouldn't be any sense to the rest of the statute. 
    So we take the position in this case that we have now submitted to this Court for decision the question that was not decided in the Reitz case because the Court took the position that the 1936 and 1939 Amendments were severable from the rest of the statute and that if there is a -- if they're unconstitutional, the original statute was constitutional and sustained it.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    But may I ask you not to mention --
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="846.968" stopTime="848.266">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    Sir.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="848.266" stopTime="876.846">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Your Act is not like the New York statute even apart from those amendments, is it? 
    You say -- your statute says that even though discharged in bankruptcy, the debt must still be paid in full and one cannot have the license until it is paid in full, whereas the New York statute put a limitation of three years on it, didn't it?
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="876.846" stopTime="901.995">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    That's right. 
    And there is another limitation, the judgment debtor may pay up to $10,000 as I remember arising out of one accident and be relieved if he -- for example, there happened to be a $30,000 or $40,000 judgment against him, he could pay up to a minimum and be relieved.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="901.995" stopTime="978.112">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What do you say to, apart from the difference that Justice Whittaker just called attention, what do you say to the consideration given by Judge Hand in writing in Reitz against Mealey for the three District Court -- for the District Court, what do you say to the considerations of Judge Hand that this business of spelling out in the statute that the creditor should ask a clerk to forward the judgment. 
    It's all eyewash because that happens anyhow, that the clerk wouldn't know whether debt was paid, that he would be nudged even though the statute said nothing about it, he would be nudged by the creditor who has chief interest so far as that goes in telling the unsatisfied judgment debt forwarded to the agency and that the clerk couldn't possibly know whether the judgment debt has been discharged without -- without calling upon the judgment creditor for all this information so that spelling out in the statute, the creditor must ask the clerk, he's merely spelling out what in fact takes place in life. 
    What do you say to that?
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="978.112" stopTime="1005.410">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    Well, that's of course is a good question. 
    However, and I would have to say that from a practical standpoint, there are some reasons for Judge Hand's statement, however, the statute doesn't stop there. 
    It goes right on and puts in the hands of a judgment creditor the right to restore the license for a period of six months --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1005.410" stopTime="1005.759">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But your statute --

    Mr. Skeen, that's the reason I asked you if that particular portion of your Act had been passed on by the court below?
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="1028.147" stopTime="1073.384">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    Well, the Court did not pass on the question as it's been presented to be here. 
    It's just been assumed throughout that his efforts to get his license restored had been nipped in the bud, so to speak. 
    He made a request for restoration and they rejected it so there's nothing else for him to do. 
    It'd been an idle act to go off and say, “Well, I can buy some insurance.” 
    That as a matter of fact, that's a simple matter to get insurance and that didn't come in to the picture at all. 
    They simply nipped his efforts to get his license right at the beginning.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1073.384" stopTime="1096.694">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, drivers who bring about sometimes gas or certainly loss of injury to one sort or another, dangerous ones at times, such drivers of greater hazard, if they don't have to pay any consequence for their negligence to disregard the rules of the road, isn't that true?
speaker="e_j_skeen" startTime="1096.694" stopTime="1096.899">
    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    That's true.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1096.899" stopTime="1145.442">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that the State has an interest in deciding who shall have a license. 
    And therefore, this isn't just the state capriciously, without any interest, saying, “Oh no, while the fellow is discharged, we're going to use the club against him.” 
    It's like the case -- the instance that Judge Hand gives. 
    Suppose -- suppose the State refuses to hire a man in a -- or discharges a man -- as a fireman refuses to hire him is solely because he didn't pay up a discharge, a discharge? 
    So the debt is discharged. 
    Nobody can make the fellow pay, but the city says, a fellow who lives beyond his means which is what not paying your debt means, is not a good risk for us as a firefighter --

    Mr. E. J. Skeen 
    That's right. 
    In the -- we think that if for example, a legislature through -- under its police power of the State passed a law to the effect that no judgment based on negligence on a public highway shall be discharged in bankruptcy. 
    Say, we -- a State had the nerve to enact such a law, that would clearly I think all agree would be contrary to the Bankruptcy Act. 
    Now this, as far as the practical effect of this statute is concerned, it's just the same. 
    The legislature has said that a discharge in bankruptcy shall not relieve the judgment debtor of the requirements of this Act and that puts a leverage on the judgment debtor that makes it impossible for him to either drive which is just about a necessity of life or pay. 
    And we have some states enacting such laws others don't and the purpose of having a uniform Bankruptcy Law in the United States is destroyed by this type of legislation. 
    We submit that this Court should reverse the three-judge court and strike the statute down as unconstitutional.

   Argument of Gordon A. Madsen
speaker="gordon_a_madsen" startTime="1415.727" stopTime="1574.614">
    Mr. Gordon A. Madsen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I believe that Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question fell out in the basic reason for the statute. 
    I would like to submit that there are two other bases however in addition. 
    First that the State, and we indicate in our brief at the outset, perhaps I should say by way of introduction first, we conceded that this Court -- or the three-judge court had jurisdiction in the matter and of course this Court as well and I should like also to mention two additional facts that were not touched upon by counsel for the appellant. 
    In this instance, this particular bankrupt, discharged, in addition to this particular judgment, a $502 small loan and a $290 attorney's fee, the attorney's fee resulting from the trial of his negligent action. 
    So that as a matter of fact, this bankrupt was principally discharging this particular debt in the course of taking out that bankruptcy. 
    And I also wish to point out that in response to this question of separability and what the legislature's intent is, there is no discussion in either brief about the legislative intent in passing this Act largely because there isn't any such record of it. 
    There are no reports of committee action that are printed by the legislature of the State of Utah except where there are some public hearing and there was none in this instance when this Act was passed in 1951. 
    The Act, as a matter of fact, is a copy of the Uniform Vehicle Code which has been widely adopted in many of the States in our country. 
    I point out on page 5 in our brief, in the Footnote, at the bottom, the 21 States, including Utah, which have so passed this Act. 
    It's also of interest to note that the Congress has passed this Act with these creditor control provisions in them for the District of Columbia. 
    And assuming the intent of Congress and knowledge on the part of Congress, that it is aware to the paramountness of the Bankruptcy Act when Congress passed this Act for the District of Columbia it left this creditor control in the Act, I presume, assuming that you can ascribe some intent to Congress knowing or believing that these provisions did not conflict with the Bankruptcy Act.

    I don't know where these controls originated Your Honor. 
    They must have come into being somewhere around 1936 or 1939 when they were put in the way of amendments in the New York Act as it was considered in the Reitz case.

    That is correct Your Honor.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1602.895" stopTime="1604.214">

    -- is it for period?
speaker="gordon_a_madsen" startTime="1604.214" stopTime="1633.977">
    Mr. Gordon A. Madsen 
    And I think the reasoning behind that and this is only my opinion but I believe the reasoning behind the business of making it permanent rather than for a limited period would be that if you make it for a limited period, the possibility of collection is thereby frustrated. 
    If in fact the judgment debtor can prolong for enough time the collection of his debt, he can get his license back by the simple expiration of time whether or not he had satisfied his debt or proved financial responsibility.

    That's just the point. 
    One criterion makes payment of a discharged debt, the criterion and the other makes the police power, namely some sanction for a negligent conduct, the criterion.

    Mr. Gordon A. Madsen 
    Yes. 
    I believe, however, that they can't be separated, Mr. Justice, in this particular that I think -- and this is getting to the basic point here which I think is controlling, what was the purpose of this Act? 
    Was it in fact a police statute as we contend it was and a proper exercise of state police power? 
    Is it primarily concerned with keeping a particular kind of driver from using the highway and I think that's what it based at? 
    I think therefore, when all of these creditor control provisions are written, they say not only must he pay the debt, but he must in addition demonstrate financial responsibility. 
    We're not simply, therefore, considering payment of an otherwise discharged debt. 
    We're considering that this class of drivers, we don't consider permissible uses of our highway. 
    The right to use our highway is a privilege we bestow and we therefore control and regulate reasonably. 
    While in some States, this is no longer called a privilege, but rather a property right even in the State of New York -- even the State of New York as we indicate in our brief on page 7 and 8 citing the most recent case even where New York recognizes the right to drive as a property right. 
    They still contend and hold that the State has the right to reasonably regulate this use. 
    Now, if the State, therefore, in the exercise of its police power says, we don't feel that people who can't meet these minimum standards of responsibility, should properly use our highway, we therefore say, we don't compel you at the outset to furnish your certificate of insurance before you drive at all, but that rather, if you have an accident, you must pay the damages logically resulting -- provably resulting from that accident.

    There's no question about that but my point being, and perhaps indirectly answering your question, Mr. Justice, is that the creditor provision, the creditor control as it's been called here, as a matter of fact, gets into the question of implementing the Act. 
    This does not change its nature as a police statute, but said this is one of the criterions. 
    It's true. 
    You've got not only to pay the judgment but demonstrate financial responsibility. 
    We are still presently concerned with financial responsibility and it's not enough to say that we'll take it away only for a while and you may or may not pay your judgment and then you can have it back. 
    No; either you will drive safely or you will be insured or as you get in an accident, you will pay the damages resulting from that accident before you can drive again and you must after such an accident demonstrate financial responsibility.

    It was obviated by the fact that he'd been denied by the Commission and that no justiciable controversy arose contesting that provision and that wasn't before the Court.

    Mr. Gordon A. Madsen 
    Through the drafts memora, but considering all of this creditor control, in summarizing, they are that the judgment creditor must initiate the action and Mr. Justice Douglas added and certif -- request that the judgment be certified up. 
    Then there's a provision for a consent on the part of a creditor to restore the license on from prescribed by the Commission and the showing of financial responsibility thereafter. 
    The provision it said the discharge in bankruptcy shall not affect it. 
    Then there's a provision that the limits are the minimum amounts up to $10,000. 
    And finally, a provision that if in fact the judgment creditor wants immediate or a complete payment that the judgment debtor in that instance can apply to the Court again in -- which the judgment was reduced, can apply to the Court to be permitted to make payments monthly on this indebtedness on whatever term of the Court in its discretion as opposed to the judgment creditor determined. 
    And there is no time limit set on it, no reasonable time period within which judgment has to be paid. 
    This is a matter of discretion for the trial judge who originally determined the indebtedness (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2171.307" stopTime="2171.629">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Was any (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="gordon_a_madsen" startTime="2171.629" stopTime="2387.626">
    Mr. Gordon A. Madsen 
    -- all of these provisions, if it please the Court, have the net effect not of becoming the principal concern of the Act but rather a concern for the judgment debtor to reduce the otherwise harshness of the Act had it been nothing more than the automatic revocation statute that was upheld by this Court in the Reitz case. 
    That is to say requiring all judgments to be docketed whether they had been paid or a private arrangement had been made to settle the matter or not that in fact these are safeguards and protection for the judgment debtor. 
    And if he finds a recalcitrant creditor, he first can go see him privately and say, “Can't we resolve this matter?” 
    And if he can do this, the judgment creditor fails to certify up a request the judgment setup, his license remains intact. 
    If he can't do this and the judgment is set up, he still has the right assuming that the creditor is doing what is contended here, go into Court and ask the Court to set whatever monthly payment he can afford to pay and thereby get a restitution of his license so that he can continue to drive. 
    These provisions are as a matter of fact designed to soften an otherwise harsh effect of the Act and that Justice Hand -- Judge Hand pointed out in the lower court's three-judge decision in the Reitz case, it is best calculated to do the clerk's work for him if you put the responsibility on the judgment creditor to see to it that the judgment is set up as Justice Frankfurter pointed out. 
    And the other basis if -- another analogy as pointed out by the court below in this case in which it argued in holding unanimously that this Act was constitutional that for example in a criminal statute, the complaining witness is the party, sometimes the aggrieved party, the injured party who has to initiate the beginning of the criminal action and supposing carrying it to the logical conclusion that it were to say a burglary and the complaining witness signed a complaint. 
    The burglar is tried. 
    He is convicted and perhaps placed on probation and one of the conditions of the probation is to make full restitution. 
    I reckon it could be there said that the complaining witness survived yet benefited directly, personally as a result of that order of restitution and having initiated this action. 
    But the fact that the complaining witness is directly benefited does not change the nature of the statute and make it no longer a police statute or a proper exercise of the state police power, the fact that he has benefited or recompressed is incidental to the proper exercise by the State of its police power. 
    And surely, if this Court is willing to say that where such a statute required mandatory forwarding of these judgments to the Commission as being constitutional at a proper exercise of the state police power, surely then, where there are other safeguards designed to facilitate and ease the burden on the judgment debtor. 
    This type of statute is unconstitutional. 
    It seemed to the matter of fact to put the Court -- put the State in the natural consequence of things if these Acts were to be held to be -- by this Court to be unconstitutional would mean that the State would thereby have to impose the requirement of insurance on all drivers.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2387.626" stopTime="2417.719">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But does it -- would you agree the case gets down to this that this Court has to decide whether the exercise by Congress of the bankruptcy power whereby honest debtors are discharged for inability to pay their debt preempts or does not preempt an interest that the State may have in its own like which by indirection may also involve putting some pressure on the discharged debtor.

    And later, the driver makes an application for restoration. 
    No part of that -- no part of that judgment has been paid. 
    Does the judgment creditor have the right to say, “Well, notwithstanding the fact that this isn't paid, I permit him to apply for and get a restoration of his license,” is -- can he do that?

    I agree Mr. Justice. 
    I don't know how we can avoid that fact. 
    There are incidental benefits to the creditor, but our position is this does not change the nature of the Act of the statute itself that it principally, primarily an exercise of the state police power, a proper such exercise, one which has been widely done and I should add further that not only the 21 states have adopted the creditor control provisions or the model act, but virtually all the other states have some kind of safety responsibility act and most of the remaining ones have the automatic provision, that is the one that just said the judgment shall be forwarded up the license, shall be suspended some for a limited period and many permanently.

    Now, it seems to me it's one thing and surely a state can say that one found guilty of negligently injuring another with an automobile shall suffer a certain sanction such as the temporary, at least, surrender of his license to drive. 
    But to say that one can never drive until he has paid the debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy is to revive the debt and thus to negate the Bankruptcy Act.

    Mr. Gordon A. Madsen 
    I believe, Your Honor that unless you have some kind of permanent revocation, it is no sanction at all, that is to say it is not affecting that cannot be easily avoided. 
    And I think this is our final point as a matter of fact on the other side of the coin that to permit a person to circumvent the purposes of this Act by the simple expedient of bankruptcy is to work an undue hardship on the person who happened to be -- that happens to be victim of the first accident. 
    Assuming for a moment we wipe out the statute, we declare it unconstitutional, so then there is no such creditor control, there is no taking away of a license for being in an accident even though you're uninsured. 
    So a party gets into an accident. 
    He is responsible. 
    He is adjudged the judgment debtor and subsequently discharges that debt in bankruptcy. 
    This then wipes out the judgment creditor in that instance while if in fact the same man gets into another accident within six years, he can't discharge that one in bankruptcy so that one can be collected. 
    So, what we're saying to everybody, you get one free accident in our state. 
    You can have one free accident. 
    You don't need to be insured. 
    You don't need to be financially responsible. 
    You can discharge it by the simple expedient of bankruptcy, but thereafter when bankruptcy can't be used as your shield, you're in trouble. 
    I don't think that this statute is designed to be frustrated in that fashion and I don't believe the Bankruptcy Act was designed to provide that of protection.
