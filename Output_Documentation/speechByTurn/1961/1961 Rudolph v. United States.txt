Rudolph v. United States

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 396, C.J.D. Rudolph, et al., Petitioner, versus United States. 
    Mr. Freling.
speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="43.857" stopTime="156.175">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case arises out of a suit for refund of federal income taxes. 
    Petitioner C.J.D. Rudolph works in Dallas as an ordinary life insurance agent for Southland Life Insurance Company, a major insurance company whose offices are also in Dallas. 
    In 1956, he and his wife attended a convention of Southland agents and officers in New York. 
    And their transportation, accommodations and their meals were arranged and paid for by Southland. 
    The basic issues involved in this case are first, whether or not the amount of convention expense allocable to petitioners which has been stipulated by the parties to be $560 is to be includable in their gross income and if that question be answered in the affirmative whether petitioners are to be allowed an ordinary and necessary business expense deduction for an equivalent amount. 
    Respondent contends that the convention trip was a bonus to petitioners and therefore his income and that their expenses were primarily personal and therefore not deductible. 
    We contend that petitioners were taken to New York by Southland for business reasons without regard to compensation and that the cost attributable to their trip are not income to them. 
    Alternatively, we contend that if they are charged with income, the expenditures thereby imputed to them were incurred for ordinary and necessary business reasons and are therefore deductible. 
    Once every year and a half for the past 20 years or more, Southland has sponsored a convention of the type involved here to which it invites certain of its agents and their wives and the top officers of the company and their wives.

speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="158.582" stopTime="161.406">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    That's correct, sir. 
    Once every 18 months.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Two every three years or so?
speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="163.031" stopTime="220.111">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    The agents invited to attend are selected on the basis of their having sold or prescribed minimum amount of insurance, which the company believes as the most appropriate standard for determining who has an aptitude for the business and who had benefit from the convention. 
    When an agent is invited to attend, both the agent and the company believes that it is part of his responsibility and a part of his job to do so. 
    If he fails to attend for any reason, he receives nothing in lieu of the convention. 
    The 1956 convention activities lasted approximately one week of which about four days were spent traveling on trains, chartered trains to and from New York City. 
    They spent about two days in New York, Friday and Saturday. 
    Friday morning was devoted to a formal program of speeches by the top officers of Southland to a panel discussion of agents and several lecturers on the agency program.

    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I hope to touch on that point expressly by an analogy. 
    It is our position that the cost of your trip shouldn't constitute income to you in the first instance.But if by some reason they're caught within the broad web of gross income and you should be allowed an ordinary and necessary business expense deduction.

    But the Government's position is that it is arguable that in going to those Christmas time meetings, the cost of going there, the railroad expenses in those days, by hotel rooms, etcetera was part of my income.

    Alright.
speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="464.867" stopTime="559.340">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    After the formal business program, everyone attended a luncheon at which Dr. Norman Vincent Peale gave an address on the subject of success through right speaking. 
    And the remainder of the time in New York was devoted to a group, a sightseeing tour, a breakfast and fashion show for the wives of the agents and a planned dinner at the Copacabana. 
    Southland also provided tickets for a special Christmas show at Radio City Music Hall and other periods were designated as free time. 
    In the suit for refund, the District Court for the Northern District of Texas sitting without a jury has sustained respondent. 
    And the Fifth Circuit affirmed per curium on the basis of its recent prior decision in Patterson versus Thomas with Judge Brown adding his dissent in this case to his prior dissent in the Thomas case. 
    Now, because the trial court held that the convention trip was in the nature of a bonus and primarily a vacation to petitioners, respondent would quickly reduce the issues in this case to simply whether or not the fact findings of the District Court are clearly erroneous. 
    We submit that the case is not so simple. 
    In our opinion, the case involves important and compelling questions regarding the very basic concepts of gross income and ordinary and necessary business expense. 
    We believe there is a need for clarification and refinement of the broad principles previously established by this Court. 
    As those principles are now applied to two phenomena of -- on modern business practice.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="559.340" stopTime="559.957">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I interrupt you?
speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="559.957" stopTime="560.577">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="560.577" stopTime="569.251">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is your position one that it's not includable in gross income or if it is that it's deductible also as an expense or it washes out?
speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="569.251" stopTime="766.059">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan that is. 
    We believe that that these principles now have to be refined as they are applied to two things which occur everyday on our business community. 
    First, the company convention and second the compulsion or the coercion by employers upon their employees that the employees participate and what the employer believes to be a legitimate and necessary business activity. 
    If we're correct in interpreting this need, then the responsibilities of the trial court in this case should be restricted to their narrowest sphere not expanded as the respondent would do to the utmost which might in some other circumstances be permissible. 
    With the law governing a tax controversy is undefined and particularly where the principles of law involved are far-reaching. 
    And the trial court has drawn inferences from the undisputed evidentiary facts or has decided ultimate facts which are dispositive of the case. 
    Then we submit that this Court or indeed any appellate court shouldn't hesitate to exercise its broadest powers of review because the danger is great that the trial judge may have approached his job without knowledge or consideration of the applicable law or even worst that his understanding of the applicable law may have been erroneous. 
    And that's exactly what happened in this case we believe. 
    We believe the findings of fact are clearly erroneous. 
    But we also believe that such findings were predicated on an error of law resulting either from mistake in interpreting the governing legal principles or the failure to recognize that those legal principles even existed. 
    In either event, we submit that this Court should not now restrict its reviews simply to determine whether or not the fact findings of the District Court are clearly erroneous. 
    In our opinion, the error of the District Court is apparent since he indicated that he wasn't concerned with the purpose of Southland in holding the convention. 
    And if it please the Court, I should like to quote very briefly from the record, on page 79 in the District Court's opinion towards the bottom of the page he states, "It is the purpose of the convention to the taxpayers which governs our action, not the purpose of the insurance company in holding them. 
    Yet, this would seem to be the single most important determination in the case." 
    And as respondent apparently agrees with us in his brief, and if my indulge the Court once more to quote from respondent's brief at page 11 he states, "Both parties are -- agreed that the relevant ultimate facts upon which the legal questions in this case turned are (a) the reasons why the company sponsored and paid for the trip, and (b) the reasons why petitioner and his wife took the trip offered by the company, and it slightly regard to the (b) part of the sentence. 
    He suggest elsewhere in his brief at page 28 that the purpose of Southland in holding a convention is vital and important in determining the purpose of the petitioners in attending.

    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    That is correct. 
    But the purpose, the subjective purpose of the taxpayers in attending the convention is gleaned largely from the purpose of the company, their employer in holding a convention and requiring them to attend.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="797.975" stopTime="822.969">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it would seem to me, and you tell me if I'm wrong and if so why, that when you're talking about whether or not this is income to the taxpayer, then the purpose of the company becomes a dominant relevance. 
    When you're talking about whether this is deductible, if income whether it's deductible by the taxpayers as a business expense. 
    Then the purpose of the taxpayer in making the trip becomes a dominant relevance, is that correct?

    Mr. Justice Stewart, that's correct that the purpose of the taxpayers on the expense side of the case is the ultimate question.

    I think we're very vitally concerned with it. 
    I think that the purpose of Southland, the company in spending time and money and effort in planning and paying for and holding these conventions goes to the very heart of the case because it demonstrates both the business purpose in Southland in holding the conventions and the reasons why they required the agents to attend and why the agents responded and attended.

    If I may jump ahead in my own timetable of argument, I hypothesize for a moment. 
    Suppose that the -- an employee of a Dallas based company is required by his employer to travel to New York City to close a long term loan with the Wall Street financial institution and that he returns immediately when his loan is consummated. 
    And suppose further that the employer arranges accommodations, his transportations and his meals while he was there and paid for them directly. 
    I don't think anyone would seriously contend that the cost of that trip should be taxable to the employee as income. 
    But the appropriate inquiry is why? 
    Well, we -- I think that the reason, the answer is found in precedent and practicalities. 
    The dominant business purpose of his employer was the reason why he took the trip in the first place. 
    The trip wasn't intended as compensation. 
    And his only gain was the subjective pleasure which he may or may not have experienced by virtue of his position.

    But there's another gain, he stayed at home, he would've had to pay for his own meal and board.
speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="1099.438" stopTime="1161.443">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    I think that's true, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    But I think that answer was resolved in 1921 when they enacted the statute and permitted the deductibility of all meals and lodging away from home. 
    So our position on the income side of the case is that there are limited exceptions to gross income other than those specifically enumerated in the statute. 
    And we state this board recognizing full well the perva -- the pervasive characters brought to gross income by this Court. 
    For it seems to us that those very decisions which established that broad character also recognized intrinsically that not every things received by a tax gain, not every gain in a classical economic sense constitutes income too. 
    We're not now asking the Court to restrict its broad definition of income. 
    To the contrary, we're asking only that the Court expressly recognize the non-taxability of something that lies beyond that definition, which we don't think has ever been precisely defined or delineate.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1161.443" stopTime="1165.055">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there a statutory definition of gross income?
speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="1165.055" stopTime="1167.644">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    No, there's not. 
    Gross income is just gross income.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1167.644" stopTime="1170.001">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Gross income is whatever gross income is --
speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="1170.001" stopTime="1170.398">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1170.398" stopTime="1172.500">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- need to be.
speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="1172.500" stopTime="1478.574">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Now, we believe that this rational and the law of governing the hypothesis which I posed is entirely consistent with the Court's decision in Commissioner versus Smith that compensation in whatever form constitutes income. 
    And we think it's also consistent with Commissioner versus Glenshaw Glass Company wherein the Court noted that the damages received for fraud or any trust violations resulted in undeniable accessions to wealth clearly realized and over which the tax per head complete dominion. 
    That the trip taken by the employee in my hypothesis wasn't intended his compensation nor did he clearly realize any benefit, any accession to wealth over which he had dominion. 
    He's actions were governed and controlled by the dominant business purpose of his employer. 
    We believe that petitioner stand in basically the same shoes as the employee in my hypothesis. 
    The only distinction being that they were personally involved in the business purpose of a company. 
    Thus, an effort must be made to isolate that business purpose from a simple intent to compensate. 
    But once it can be established as we believe the uncontroverted testimony as established here. 
    That the dominant motive and reason for the company sponsoring the convention was its own business purpose. 
    That the convention was germane to that purpose based upon long standing interest, industry-wide experience and that there was no intent to compensate petitioners. 
    And it seems clear to us that they received nothing which it constituted income, too. 
    Our position on the expense side of the case is similar too because we believe that the same basic facts that support an exclusion from gross income also when turned around confirmed the presence of ordinary and necessary business expenses. 
    The trial court ignored Southland's business purpose in holding the convention. 
    It ignored the compulsion upon the petitioners to attend. 
    It ignored the relationship between the convention and petitioners own business. 
    Instead, the court apparently looked only to the outward or extrinsic appearances of the convention in holding contrary to every bit of the oral testimony that the convention was in the nature of a vacation. 
    In the phase of what would seem the obvious, an overwhelming relationship between the convention and the agent, this would be exceedingly difficult to understand except for the trial judge's own admission that he wasn't concerned with the business purpose of Southland in holding the convention. 
    Now, respondent attempts to justify this fact conclusion on the basis of two erroneous legal premises. 
    First, he compares the times spent at the formal program on Friday morning with the total period covered by the convention as if this were conclusive of a non-business purpose. 
    The error in this approach is two fold. 
    It assumes first that informal activity at a convention cannot have a business purpose. 
    But the management of Southland testified that the program was expressly designed to permit the agents and the officers to mix and mingle together in an informal atmosphere and that the exchange of ideas occurring in this manner probably was the most important business benefit of the convention. 
    Shoptalk at a convention is a part of the business of a convention. 
    And it need not be conducted in an auditorium to be so. 
    In the second place, respondent's comparative analysis treats the travel time to and from New York as being a sterile thing which gain its tax character solely from the activities at the convention site but this couldn't be further from the facts. 
    Southland intentionally chartered special trainings on which it required the agents and the officers to travel together so that they would have an opportunity with little else to do to talk about the insurance business. 
    We believe therefore that the -- that the travel itself had an independent business purpose. 
    If we had the travel time to the formal time of the program, we have four-and-a-half days spent in strictly businesses compared to one-and-a-half days in informal activities which we also think have legitimate business purposes. 
    So, on the basis of respondent's own promise is that each expense should be deductible. 
    His next error is an ignoring the company's insistence that Rudolph and his wife attend the convention. 
    We believe it's legally significant when an employer required that an employee participate in what the employer in good faith believes to be a necessary business activity. 
    What is the employee to do? 
    What should any hardheaded business man do except to comply with the request of his employer? 
    Sure, he couldn't argue with his employer about whether or not the convention bore a sufficient business relationship to his own business to warrant his attending particularly where this has been an industry-wide practice for 30 years or more.

speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="1482.687" stopTime="1520.273">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Yes, he certainly could, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    I don't know what his employer's reaction might be. 
    We believe that when Rudolph accepted the company's invitation to attend the convention, he was acting in a way that was realistically indispensable to his business. 
    And I think that the evidence before the Court demonstrated that there was a reasonable business relationship between the convention and Rudolph sold in business as an insurance agent. 
    If so, his expenses were both ordinary and necessary and directly related to his business.

speaker="richard_a_freling" startTime="1546.377" stopTime="1578.354">
    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Yes, it does. 
    There is a standard prescribed that the agent has to meet in order to be eligible to attend. 
    But I wish to make this point although my time is running short, that every business must have a standard for judging which of its employees are going to be advanced or brought into inner circle or give a special training. 
    An associate in a law firm might be judged on the clarity of the contracts he writes. 
    But in -- an insurance agent job is selling insurance. 
    This is the only thing he does and it's the only method by which the company can judge his performance.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1578.354" stopTime="1599.049">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But why doesn't -- why doesn't it, the mode of selection show that it is -- becomes of function of reward rather than a compulsion of duty or a manifestation of requirement.

    If it's related to how much insurance you'd written and you therefore say, "You're a good boy.

    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    Well, it's not as simple as that Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    All they wanted to do was to pay a bonus to their agents. 
    They could just give him the money and tell him to go to Florida. 
    But they don't do that. 
    They plan a convention based upon years of experience with expressed business purposes marked. 
    And they require the agents to attend. 
    If the -- if it was their desire simply to give a bonus, they certainly wouldn't require that. 
    Furthermore, they still had to be invited even though they satisfied the minimum standard of selling insurance. 
    They still -- the record indicates that they still had to be invited by the company. 
    Third of all, there was no great agent among the agents as to how much insurance they sold. 
    One may have sold $2,000,000 and another $400,000 and they were still -- but they all still received exactly the same thing. 
    The emphasis, the dominant purpose on -- of the company was not to reward or pay a bonus. 
    Although, certainly that the petitioners may have enjoyed the trip but this wasn't the basic primary emphasis of the company, it was something else. 
    It was something much more complex indeed. 
    It was involved in modern business psychology and practices.

speaker="john_b_jones_jr" startTime="1723.254" stopTime="1820.240">
    Mr. John B. Jones, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Let me make clear at the outset that the Government does not dispute that there are some businesses assemblages which employees can attend and they can receive their reimbursement and there won't be any tax consequences. 
    And these business assemblages can take place at a resort spot or a tourist spot can be solely for the employees of one company. 
    These are not conclusive factors. 
    But the Government does insist that not every trip which an employer chooses to call a convention is a business trip. 
    There must be some tests which enable us to determine whether we have a business trip or a pleasure joint. 
    To take Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question which he asked that I addressed myself to referring to an annual meeting of presumably law school professors around the nation, if it is found that a meeting for program is conducted at the site of this meeting and if its further found that the law school professor goes to this meeting and participates to a reasonable extent has his discussions with his fellow professors and this is essentially business oriented. 
    Of course, we make quibble about whether he puts it in income and then deducts his funds or whether he never puts it in income at all. 
    But the -- it is clear that he has no tax consequences.But it is also clear that it would have irrational revenues.

    Would there be any difference in the statutory compulsion and the employer-employee compulsion?

    Mr. John B. Jones, Jr. 
    Well, I'd be glad to turn to that point because I think --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I'm just asking if that was --
speaker="john_b_jones_jr" startTime="2007.329" stopTime="2065.933">
    Mr. John B. Jones, Jr. 
    No -- yes, sir, but I do believe there would be. 
    One of the things we would suggest in terms of compulsion is that that is not a magic test. 
    And the easiest way I know to explain it is to give you the case of a man who's 48 years old working for the company. 
    He gets called into the president's office. 
    And the president says to him "Bill, you're 48. 
    And we want to give your promotion and some new salary", and he says "Heck, no." 
    He says "I like what I'm doing. 
    I'm having a fine time. 
    I just don't want anymore responsibilities." 
    And the president says, "Sorry." 
    He said, "You know, its company policy, you can't stay past 50 unless you come into the front office and we're going to insist you do it." 
    And the employee then further says, "Well, I -- I'll come to the front office but I won't take the money." 
    And he says, "No, we can't have that. 
    We've got to front. 
    You've got to take the money. 
    And if you don't, you'll lose your job." 
    The employee says, "Well, if that's the case, I'll do it." 
    Now, there's pure compulsion we believe everything he says --

    Mr. John B. Jones, Jr. 
    I think it -- well, I think this is important because this goes to the whole point of -- we -- the Southland Insurance Company here is being generous in the sense in compelling this, if we accept their testimony, compelling this four insurance agents to take a trip to New York. 
    They have to tell their wives and drag them along. 
    It's a very sad thing. 
    I don't really think that the case I posed is very different. 
    And I don't think that compulsion is the test. 
    Maybe one way to deal with it is to say that compulsion to be considered in the sense must be operative. 
    It must be that the man, not that the company said it's compulsory but that that's the reason the man went. 
    And when the benefit gets too great as in cash or a very pleasurable trip then we will take with a grain of salt and the testimony that the trip is required, if the company founds on it. 
    That isn't why he went to New York.

    Here the District Court laid his findings along the lines suggested by the regulation. 
    The Circuit Court has reviewed and found this in accord with its prior decision in Thomas and Patterson.

    Mr. John B. Jones, Jr. 
    Well, I would -- this goes to Mr. Justice Stewart's question. 
    I would like to suggest that determining whose point of view you look -- whose point of view you use to determine the business purpose is not the great hurdle which it would seem. 
    The point was made that the trial judge here looked at it from the employees' point of view and this is considered to be fatal error to our brief. 
    In point of fact, if you read the specific findings you'd see he looks to the company and what he had meant to do as well as the effect on the employee. 
    And I really think that what you have here is an alternative reference. 
    In the last analysis, if you can find a truly sufficient business purpose to the company, it matters not that the employee is happy to go. 
    And I can illustrate that by an example. 
    If the Southland Insurance Company had set up a crackerjack program with two hours of meetings in the morning and three hours every afternoon, meals and places where the employees could get together and exchange their valuable information. 
    Some recreation -- if they agreed the -- planned the program to do the kind of thing they said they wanted to do that would end it even though Mr. Rudolph said he'd go again tomorrow if his expenses were paid.

    Compensation is specifically included in income.

    The reason for including it in the employees' income has disappeared.

    Imagine in the usual case had more personal expenses than that of taking your wife along now there will be some exceptions on occasion. 
    I would just like to close this argument by reminding the Court that the regulations under Section 162 are quite clear explicit on this problem, recognizing that there will be trips that are taken partly for business and partly for pleasure. 
    And they do impose on somebody the task of determining which motive is primary. 
    That was done by the District Court here, was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit.

    I would -- the -- for the benefit of the members of the Court, I take it that -- to take a trip to preserve the security is something not done primarily for personal enjoyment. 
    That's what you're constraining on?

    But what is involved is the right of termination under a contract granting the employer the right of termination at will if the thing is at stake.

    Mr. John B. Jones, Jr. 
    As I've suggested before I think that misstates the question. 
    I think the -- the first question is whether the compulsion which I may -- if I may characterize as such, here described what's really operative. 
    And the record is clear here that that wasn't why he went to New York. 
    He went to New York because he had a good time. 
    He'd do it again tomorrow. 
    Now if we found in a given case that the man didn't want to go to New York and actually went because either expressed or otherwise, he was ensure of his job then this kind of consideration become important.

    But Judge Brown's view I take it implies that the surrounding circumstances negative what you've said. 
    You mutilate the complex of fact by saying he went to New York because he had a good time. 
    But Brown says the whole circumstance as the nature of his employment is that if he didn't go to have a good time, he might have no time at all with this company.
speaker="john_b_jones_jr" startTime="3685.256" stopTime="3705.281">
    Mr. John B. Jones, Jr. 
    Well, I think that Judge Brown is looking only to the testimony, if I may say, self-serving testimony of the company that would have this effect on them. 
    And I think the record is clear that that's not all that has to be considered. 
    And again as to him, he would be entitled -- he should give way to the trier of fact on that point.

    Very well. 
    Mr. Freling, may I ask you just one question and I know you've got a very little time but suppose that the employer in this case had said, "We want that all of these people who have written a million dollars worth of insurance last year to go to this convention." 
    We're not going to pay their expenses but we order them to go just the same as -- in the la -- same language that they did in this case, would that be deductible?

    Mr. Richard A. Freling 
    I'd like to address myself to some specific inquiries from the bench.Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Rudolph testified expressly that when he took a vacation, he like to get away from it all and do as he pleases. 
    This is in direct contrast to the enforced and rigid companionship and schedule at this convention. 
    Second of all, he testified that he would not wish to take this trip again unless his expenses were paid for by the company. 
    He did not consider it a vacation. 
    He considered it a business requirement of his as part of his job. 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, this convention is an outgrow for a product of some 30 or more years of experience in the life insurance industry based upon management studies and experts in the field that say it has legitimate and valuable business purposes. 
    It antedates the era of high taxes. 
    And the suggestions of respondent that this is just one of the category of expense account abuses which we've heard so much about simply isn't the case. 
    We feel that for over 40 years, these company conventions have been going on and yet no question has been raised. 
    This is apparently a test case. 
    And we think that obviously, it was intended to be pleasurable. 
    The company would be exceedingly unwise if it attempted to stimulate and motivate its agents in at atmosphere of rigid tedious requirements. 
    But this doesn't detract from its business purpose. 
    The business purpose is still the -- to gain stimulation in a way that couldn't be accomplished by paying the agents a bonus. 
    It's diametrically contrary to that. 
    The informal activity at the convention was specifically, one is designed as such, is a part of the business of the convention. 
    Why did the company charter special trainings and have people stay and enforced companionship for four days?
