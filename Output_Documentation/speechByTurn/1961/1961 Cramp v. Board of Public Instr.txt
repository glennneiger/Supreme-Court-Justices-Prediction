Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction or Orange County

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 72, David Walter -- Walton Cramp, Jr., Appellant, versus Board of Public Instruction of Orange County, Florida. 
    Mr. Simon.
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="46.072" stopTime="176.914">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court. 
    This is an appeal from the final decision of the Supreme Court of Florida, upholding the validity of Fla. Stat. 876.05 against the contention that this statute violated the provisions of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 
    This is the Act which requires that all public employees in the State of Florida, including David Walton Cramp, who is a teacher, execute a loyalty or expurgatory oath as a condition of his employment. 
    The pertinent provisions of that oath other than the ones that were in effect prior to 1949 which at that time simply required all public employees to swear loyalty to the Constitution and to the -- and to the United States, now require that the public employee swear that he is not a member of the Communist Party and I quote, “That I have not and will not lend my aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist Party; that I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of Florida by force or violence; and fourth, that I am not a member of any organization or party which believes in or teaches directly or indirectly the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence.” 
    Now, the appellant, Cramp, had been employed in Orange County as a teacher for nine years when just prior to the institution of this litigation, it was realized that through some administrative oversight, he had not executed the loyalty oath. 
    He was approached and requested to sign the oath.

    How long is this statute been on the books?
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="179.029" stopTime="181.007">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Since 1949 sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="181.007" stopTime="183.502">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So it was there when he first became employed as a --
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="183.502" stopTime="337.079">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Yes, that is correct. 
    Cramp refused to sign the oath on the grounds that the State could not validly and constitutionally require that he execute this oath as a condition of his employment and for no other reason. 
    He brought an action in Orange County under Florida statutes for declaratory relief to declare the statute invalid and to assert his continuing right to teach school without the necessity of executing this oath. 
    This relief was denied to him by the Circuit Court and this decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Florida and this appeal then followed. 
    I would like to state that the issue before this Court as I understand it is not whether or not Florida is to be required to keep communists in its roles of public employees nor is the question so ably put by my Brother that Florida cannot establish reasonable qualifications for its teaching personnel or other employees. 
    Because however, there is always and this Court has always recognized the duty of a State with regard to its public employees to establish only and stipulate only those qualifications which are reasonable and which are reasonably designed to fit the man to the job. 
    Because of that requirement, we state that the issue before this Court is whether or not the qualifications imposed by Florida are reasonable and whether they bear a reasonable relationship to the position itself. 
    Irrespective, I wish to point out at this point in the argument whether these qualifications were imposed through the procedural device or vehicle of the loyalty oath or whether they were imposed by statute. 
    I think there is no issue about the fact that a state cannot impose qualifications for employment which violate due process, equal protection and this Court has unanimously stated on many occasions.

    I just want to get -- focus my mind to what it is that I'm going to listen to.
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="466.866" stopTime="595.282">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    If I may direct my attention to the first of the clauses which Your Honor has indicated we oppose, and that is the question of that clause of the oath which states that I have not lent aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist Party? 
    Now, the State of Florida has specifically interpreted this clause to me that I do not presently lend aid, support, influence, counsel or advice to the Communist Party, but that I have never at any time in the unending test, done such an act. 
    Now we maintain and contend, regardless of the fact that this is included in a loyalty oath that this particular qualification is beyond the power of the State to require of an employee that he executes and makes such a statement as a condition of employment. 
    In the first place, it can hardly be alluded to as a qualification of a teacher. 
    We do not say that a State may not ask to secure this information but Florida has said blanketly that no person who has ever lent aid, support, counsel or advice to the Communist Party is suited to be a teacher or other public employee. 
    It is immaterial whether 30, 40, 50 years ago, an individual may have joined the Communist Party or lent aid, support, counsel or advice whatever those words mean to the Communist Party for one day and since that time, devoted himself to a program of rabid anti-communism, if you will, spent that time acquiring enumerable college degrees and presented himself on the doorsteps of our capital building in Tallahassee only to be told there that the law of this State disqualifies you from being either a public employee or a teacher.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="595.282" stopTime="603.948">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I ask you whether the Communist Party ever appeared on the official voting ballots of Florida?
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="603.948" stopTime="611.810">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Not to my knowledge if Your Honor please. 
    The progressive party was there and that, in some minds, is exactly the same thing in Florida.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="611.810" stopTime="635.025">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How do you jump the hurdle, the necessity of your argument of this part, how do you jump the hurdle if the Supreme Court of Florida said in view of the allegations of the complaint, which you said that he has never given any such aid or he had no standing as a matter of state law to raise a question, why isn't that an adequate statement?
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="635.025" stopTime="680.690">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, what the State of Florida said was that we had no standing to raise this as a matter of ex post facto. 
    They said that this law was not an ex post facto law with regard to this particular appellant and they may be right. 
    However, what I am saying here is that this particular qualification cannot be imposed as a matter of due process and he certainly has not waived his rights by merely stating that he has never done this under the Due Process Clause to assume this would mean to say for example that Torcaso had to be an atheist in order to obtain relief from this Court.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="680.690" stopTime="697.299">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Yeah, but the Court, the Florida Court as I read its opinion said, you cannot raise your Constitutional objections to this because you have no standing in light of your allegation with your complaint?
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="697.299" stopTime="795.439">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    I would respectfully submit that this particular question insofar as there is any merit to it and we do not concede that there is merit to the statement, but that any standing to sue is -- we do have standing to sue because this is a matter of due process that a man who states that he is not a communist and has never lent aid, support or counsel or advice to the Communist Party is nevertheless entitled as an American under the Due Process Clause to refuse to execute an oath which requires that he so state this. 
    A man for example, this Court has stated that a state cannot pass a law that no public employee may go to mass or no person who attends mass can be a public employee. 
    Now, I may not ever have attended a mass and yet I believe that this law is invalid and that I have a right not to execute such a note and that disqualification cannot be imposed by the State irrespective of my religion. 
    The fact that a law is bad, the fact that a qualification for employment violates due process, does not depend on whether the individual who is involved in the procedure, so long as he is in the class which is being effective, a non-public employee could not come to this Court and complain, but this man is a public employee.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="795.439" stopTime="802.732">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You argue in effect that this certain state ground is not one that we should recognize as an adequate state ground, that's the substance --
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="802.732" stopTime="803.319">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    That is correct.

speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="804.359" stopTime="828.131">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Yes sir. 
    And I also state that if there is any merit to it whatsoever, it is restricted to the question of whether or not Cramp can claim that he is within the class that can raise the issue that this is an ex post facto law, but we rest primarily on the proposition that the asserted state ground is not a proper one.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="828.131" stopTime="887.437">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I think you are casting your net too broadly if I may say so. 
    This Court has said again and again that if a particular individual himself, a particular individual himself could not be affected by a statute, he can claim injury on behalf of others who might be in the same class, but were not excluded by the record filed. 
    I think of the case in 204 U.S. I think of a lot of cases to which this Court has said (Inaudible) if somebody who is hurt by this. 
    I think the ground as you -- as you put it that he represents the class. 
    He doesn't represent a class if he is in a class by himself. 
    Why does he put that into his pleading? 
    I'm not saying -- I'm not suggesting, to be clear about it that -- that an argument can't be made but not your argument.
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="887.437" stopTime="888.056">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    The --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="888.056" stopTime="892.518">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's simply because he is in a class. 
    The point is he has taken himself out of the class.
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="892.518" stopTime="905.873">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    No Your Honor. 
    We submit that he is within the class that is being affected. 
    He is within the class of public employees who are asked to comply with a particular qualification. 
    Now, the reason why --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="905.873" stopTime="975.525">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But to go to the -- perhaps one ought to hear your objection, if you go to the objection of such a class, the objection namely that they can search way back into his life, I don't know how many years back, that's why I asked you when the Communist Party was established. 
    He is in Florida or he may have been a member of the Communist Party of the United States, suppose he take judicial notice that -- that's got on the way 1919 or 1920 which puts a judicial notice and the litigant party came in to being, your argument then is (Inaudible) that that means that he did anything from 1920. 
    And thereafter, did everything to oppose that which he did in 1920, he still would be within. 
    But if a man takes himself out of the class but there's no such danger, then I don't think your answer to Justice Harlan's question is adequate that he is in that class. 
    The point is he's not in that class because he's taken himself out of that class. 
    I think there are other objections possibly but not your objection that he's in that class.

    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Well, we respectfully submit that the mere statement, the mere fact that he has come to this Court as others have not done and have stated what his political beliefs are does not remove him from the protection of the Due Process Clause, Now this Court, I do not believe will take the position that there must be a doubt in the minds of Justices before they will give benefit of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the litigants.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1009.377" stopTime="1020.379">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Isn't a question of doubt in our minds. 
    It's a question of a litigant asking for a leave on the basis he's hurt by something and he says, “I haven't been hurt by this.”
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="1020.379" stopTime="1110.098">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Well, we submit that we are hurt because this is a man who should not be required to submit to a qualification which offends the Constitution regardless of whether he himself is a person who is being hurt directly. 
    We submit that there is an indirect hurt to him because he is a public employee. 
    I refer again to the example of Torcaso. 
    If Torcaso had come to this Court and stated that he was not an atheist, I suspect that the decision of this Court must necessarily have been exactly the same because Maryland cannot impose a religious test upon public employees whether atheist raised the question or non-atheist raised the question and I suspect that the Due Process Clause under which we are claiming here is as much available to non-communist as it is to those who have a lent aid, influence or support to the Communist Party or to those, I think this is basically the question who do not come and tell this Court as Torcaso did not come, as Garner did not come, as the attorney in the Konigsberg in the following case and test flow did not come and so this Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1110.098" stopTime="1140.120">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't accept your starting point, you see. 
    I can well understand that a man like Torcaso can file or his lawyer can file a complaint in which he said this is of no hurt to me. 
    It couldn't possibly make any difference to me to sign it. 
    I'd be glad to sign it but I just want to get a ruling from this Court on whether such a statute is constitutional. 
    Speaking for myself, I have the greatest doubt, but I would think that presents the case of controversy before this Court.

    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Except that in this case, if Your Honor please, this man did not sign this affidavit and the statements that he made in his complaint were not regarded by the State of Florida as a substitute for this affidavit. 
    And unless he -- and until he signs this affidavit, he is not in a position to draw on public funds and I would like to add the following. 
    The statements that he made in his complaint do not foreclose the issue because the language that is used in this particular clause of the oath that he has not lent aid, support, influence, counsel or advice to the Communist Party are so vague, broad, general as to be actually incapable of analysis or interpretation except as in a -- except in a completely subjective manner and the fact that he stated that in his opinion he did not do these things is not a guarantee because of the looseness.

    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    I had not at that point come to that argument Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1234.784" stopTime="1269.665">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What you're saying is that he might sign this oath and he might subject himself to prosecution of perjury and then at least would have to litigate whether what he did not 40 years ago but two years ago could be regarded on the appropriate charge by a judge to a jury as bringing himself within these terms support, advice, counsel and influence to deny that and therefore it's a case of perjury. 
    Now, I understand you.
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="1269.665" stopTime="1522.301">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    That is because the language of this particular section is incapable of actual definition and therefore as a matter of due process should not be included among the qualifications for teachers or public employees in Florida or in any other state. 
    The next clause of the oath is the clause which states that I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government of the United States and also that I am not a member of any organization which believes in, and this of course I think is impossible and so the persons who were at the statute added the words “word teachers, directly or indirectly the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence.” 
    To my knowledge, there has been but one other case in which the question of belief in terms of violent overthrow of the Government has come before this Court and that was some 10 or 11 years ago in American Communications Association versus Douds. 
    At that time, the Court by a three-to-three decision affirmed the judgment below. 
    Nevertheless, Justice Vincent, Mr. Justice Vincent in writing for the majority put a gloss on the word belief and stated that the only thing that this can constitutionally mean is a belief in the objectives of violent overthrow as an immediate objective rather than as a prophecy. 
    And this concept has come down to us since that time. 
    In Speiser -- Speiser versus Randall, although that dealt with the question of advocacy, this Court insisted upon and secured from the Attorney General of California the statement that the advocacy therein involved was advocacy not as an immediate objective -- not as a prophecy but as an immediate objective. 
    And if it is true for advocacy, of course, it must necessarily be true for inner beliefs which this Court Douds and all time subsequently stated are in violence. 
    This position was urged before the Supreme Court of Florida and was ignored, but we go on to state that regardless in our opinion and we so contend to this Court that regardless of any gloss, any shaving that can be made of this word believe that the concepts of belief and a man's beliefs are not the function or the power of Government to inquire into. 
    Neither this Court nor any arm of Federal Government, nor the State Government of Florida, can call into play and demand to know what are a man's beliefs as a condition of his employment. 
    And we submit that any requirement as a qualification for public employment that a man divulge his beliefs must be unconstitutional and invalid under the provisions of the First Amendment. 
    The old story of Dionysus who had a man killed for dreaming, that he killed somebody would I think follow in this case and I think that this Court should strike down any qualification for employment that requires an individual and especially a teacher fit within a stereotype concept of belief. 
    And again --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Aren't you making a pretty broad argument?

    No sir.

    The State cannot call forth any statement from him as to his beliefs as a condition of employment.

    Well, we state that in this particular instance, a man's beliefs as to violent overthrow, do not serve as a basis for excluding him from the faculty in a public school system in Florida for two reasons which we have stated; one, because the concepts of belief are beyond the power of the state to inquire into, and secondly, and certainly, and this Court has held on this point that the only type of belief in this area which can serve as some basis for inquiry is a type of belief or advocacy into the overthrow of the Government as an immediate objective rather than as a question of prophecy.

    Mr. Tobias Simon

    If a person is under consideration to teach and to be employed as a teacher of civics in a Florida institution, high school or college, and he has to sign an oath, I do believe – I do not believe in the oath of the Government of United States by force or violence, may the state exact such an oath or not.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2065.976" stopTime="2066.181">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Alright.
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="2066.181" stopTime="2069.225">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    Because this involves the man's beliefs.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2069.225" stopTime="2069.320">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Alright.
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="2069.320" stopTime="2458.162">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    And these beliefs cannot be for -- cannot form the basis of an exclusion from public employment. 
    Now, I have stated that these qualifications, the retrospective qualifications, the matter of belief and advocacy which are contained in the Florida oath are bad. 
    I maintain that these qualifications are invalid and are unconstitutional because they violate due process, there is no place for penitence or return, they violate the guarantees of the First Amendment which keep I believe a man's beliefs and right to advocate in violence and if these qualifications had been enacted by statute, those qualifications would not have been proper. 
    We further maintain that because these qualifications are embodied in a loyalty oath which is presented to some 40,000 public school teachers and many more times that number of public employees within the State of Florida, that the requirement of the loyalty oath itself as a procedural device is invalid. 
    Now, the reason why we maintain that position is because the requirement that a man execute and oath as distinguished from complying with certain qualifications, imposes upon him the necessity of submitting his associations, his beliefs, his concepts to the State in order for him to secure a position. 
    Unquestionably, the execution of a loyalty oath is a restriction upon the privileges and rights of association, thought and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment. 
    If we are to say that the interest of a state in prescribing qualifications are so important as to outweigh the interests of the individual then it might be contended that the means of achieving these qualifications, the means of establishing these qualifications in gaining this information, can be utilized through the means of the loyalty oath. 
    But this, I believe, runs afoul of the concept that was established or utilized in Shelton versus Tucker where this Court stated that where there are alternative means of acquiring information, where there are alternative means of achieving an end desired by the State, a second balance must be struck if one method utilizes less danger and less harm or establishes less harm for the individual's rights then that is the method which must be chosen. 
    Now, we submit that to -- that to turnover to the entire body of public employees in the State of Florida, an oath requiring that they give their associational ties and an expression of their beliefs and concepts even if for example, this Court were to say that they could have this information in the first place, that this is not the proper method of achieving this, that this has a chilling effect upon their rights, upon their associational rights as guaranteed under the First Amendment and this Court I believe has prescribed and has shown the method that can be utilized to prescribe these qualifications and that is the matter of the employer-employee investigation. 
    And this Court has on several occasions, in Beilan, Lerner versus Casey, Konigsberg, Anastaplo, Nelson and Globe cases has stated that an employee, if challenged or questioned must come forward and give full and frank answers. 
    And we submit that this is the method that Florida must utilize because if a teacher -- if there is a question about a teacher or a public employee, then it is well within the province of the State to rid itself of communists or other incompetent personnel to call the individual in. 
    Some due process at least must be observed, some type of hearing must be given; something is afforded this individual. 
    The interests of the individual can be protected. 
    The demands upon the state are small and this method can be utilized far better than the blanket loyalty oath because it is our position that if we give at this time, blanket support for the concept of a loyalty oath, then through this device, each and every employee can be required to submit to doctrines in which the school boards or the government officials feel are important. 
    We can be required to submit in signing oaths involving beliefs or disbeliefs or membership or nonmembership in organizations which are not the Communist Party, organizations which are unpopular in Florida or elsewhere.

    Without getting into this, the soundness or the unsoundness of your position that I was just trying to clarify; as I understand, what you're saying is that the Congress would have passed a law requiring all candidates for Congress or the Senate to swear that they believe in the operation of Government without any special discrimination against any group that that would not be a good requirement and -- but that it would be quite different if they required him to swear that he would not conduct his office in such way as to deprive that.

    And one of the important provisions of the Constitution is the mode by which things you don't like in the Constitution can be taken out of the Constitution and the mode in the Constitution which is set forth is that changes must be made in an orderly way and not by force and violence. 
    And you say that a state can say that you must at least agree that the changes that you want to have come into being, the things you don't like -- you don't have to like everything in the Constitution, but there's a provision the Constitution which says if you don't like it then get busy and get it repealed.

    Now, they don't carry, the laws don't carry that implicit thing in them for -- for repeal Mr. Justice Frankfurter has -- has been talking about. 
    But I suppose that when I took the oath to support the Constitution of the State -- Constitution and laws of the State of California that I wasn't saying that I believe in the wisdom and the policy of every law that was on our statute books. 
    I took the oath that I would support them because they were on the statute books and there is a difference between belief in what you will -- what you will do as a public official.

   Argument of J. R. Wells
speaker="j_r_wells" startTime="3346.251" stopTime="3449.224">
    Mr. J. R. Wells 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    It will be my purpose to take up the several clauses of this oath one by one but before I do, I want to call particular attention to the fact that we do not have in this case the kind of situation that was involved in the Wieman versus Updegraff where scienter was construed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court as not being implied in the Oklahoma statute because both prior to the time this oath was submitted to Mr. Cramp for execution and in the course of this case, the Supreme Court as well as the trial court here, specifically held that scienter was implicit in the provisions of the statute. 
    In going back to the Wieman versus Updegraff case, that was in 1952 that this Court held at an Oklahoma statute requiring a specified oath on the basis of -- was in that -- on the basis that the Oklahoma Supreme Court had held that knowledge was not a factor under the Oklahoma statute.

    We'll recess now Mr. Wells. 
    [Recess]
speaker="j_r_wells" startTime="3461.838" stopTime="3664.470">
    Mr. J. R. Wells 
    May it please the Court. 
    Just before adjournment, I made mention -- excuse me -- of the case of Wieman versus Updegraff decided by this Court in 1952 in which this Court held invalid an Oklahoma statute because scienter had been -- or knowledge had been held by the Oklahoma Court not to be a factor under the statute. 
    In the -- two times before this Court had decided the Garner case in which this -- in which knowledge was not referred to in the ordinance there under consideration, but the Court had sustained the ordinance stating we assume that scienter is implicit in each clause of the oath. 
    And in the Wieman case, this Court commented regarding the Garner case of -- that one of the attacks made on the oath in that case, that is the Garner case was that it violated due process because its negation was not limited to organizations known by the employee to be within the prescribed clause and then the Court said that this argument was objected in that case because we thought justified and assumed that scienter was implicit, each clause of the oath. 
    In 1957, more than two years before the oath was presented to appellant here for execution. 
    The Florida Supreme Court had before it the case of State versus Diez in which there was involved an indictment for perjury in connection with the making of an oath under a statute. 
    And in that indictment, there it was not alleged that the statements were willfully false or anything about the employee having the -- particular individual having knowledge of the subversive nature of the activities. 
    The -- in holding the indictment defective for one of those allegations, the Court said, this conclusion that is that the indictment was defective does not lead us to a decision declaring the act unconstitutional because we think it is inherent in the law that when one takes the oath, that he has not lent aid, advice, counsel and the like to Communist Parties represent an oath he had not done it -- with knowingly. 
    And the Court in the discussion in the Diez case discussed both the Garner case and the Wieman case when one of the complaints in the -- complaint by appellant here, in his complaint, was that the Florida statute did not have the element of scienter. 
    The trial judge said that that contention was not well founded and then quoted from the Diez case.

    But can you apply that rule of scienter to beliefs?
speaker="j_r_wells" startTime="3804.059" stopTime="3973.165">
    Mr. J. R. Wells 
    I apply it Your Honor that he's -- it's got to be a willfully and knowingly false. 
    In other words, that he has not -- that if he does not -- unless he is willfully and corruptly swearing to it that there could be a prosecution on it. 
    That's a way -- that's the way I apply it Your Honor. 
    In other words, there has got to be knowledge of the -- the facts that it is a false statement of belief that it's bona fide that there couldn't be a prosecution of it, but turning then to the allegations of the -- of the statements that have to be in the oath under the Florida statute. 
    I understand no question is raised with regard to the first statement after the support in the Constitution and so forth that I am not a member of the Communist Party that it is conceded by opposing counsel that that is not an invalid requirement in an oath of this kind. 
    So that brings it to the second clause or the next clause following that that I have not and will not lend my aid, support, advice, counsel and influence to the Communist Party. 
    Now, as I understand, the question is put -- is quite well eliminated as to any question that could be raised by somebody else, not a party to this suit. 
    In other words, as to whether this is a bill of attainder on ex post facto law as to somebody else. 
    It is not involved here where appellant has alleged that he has never lent aid, support, advice, counsel and influence to Communist Party. 
    But -- and in our brief, we have made the subsidiary contention that even if that were before the Court that that could be sustained but in view of the fact that it is so clear that he can't raise it, I'm not going to take the time on argument of going into that.

    He practiced in Madison and he had committed an abortion 15 years before the Act was passed and yet it was held to be valid to prevent him from practicing medicine and on the same theory on which the DeVeau case I believe it was, was decided two or three years ago by this Court involving the union officers on the Waterfront in which ex-felons were precluded from being union officers notwithstanding the fact that they had been convicted many years before. 
    Now, I realize that the (Inaudible) case involving an attorney in either Illinois, I believe Illinois or one -- some state has to be taken into account in connection with that where there was just the member of the Communist Party many years before.

    Well, I think from personal experience, I was once a chairman at a meeting in Boston way back, and the purpose of the meeting was to urge the Government of United States to recognize the soviet country, the present regime in Russia long before we did. 
    And we had all the parts of it or mix bag of speakers. 
    And I can assure you all sorts of inferences that might seem to you and did to me at the time ludicrous could be drawn from such chairmanship, was drawn. 
    Now, if I have to swear lawyer that I am, if I had to swear that I never hated the Communist Party because of the communist speaker at that meeting, in Nathaniel Hall or it was Faneuil Hall, the cradle of liberties so-called, I would fall even as a lawyer in saying I don't want to be -- oh yes, I know that I could not know sensible juries convict me but then juries aren't always sensible, no Supreme Court would sustain the conviction but then the Supreme Court aren't always sensible at least in the eyes of the various people in distant times.

    A perfectly clear cut case have reached -- have led the men in the jury box to reach a different conclusion and I'm suggesting that a lot of school teachers who aren't versed in the dialectics of the law might feel queasy and (Inaudible) naturally and justifiably queasy about running an affidavit that might lead them into -- into criminal -- into a criminal prosecution even if they're usually the defendant and whereas such a risk -- such a risk can be unfold upon by the state, it is as narrow as that --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If you have -- it shouldn't be fatal to the statute if you can give a really strong weighty counter consideration why this is the way that a reasonable legislature must deal with the problem with which it has a right to deal with, namely, that puts no time limit, refuses voguish words which is susceptible of ambiguous construction etcetera, etcetera.

    And that if this has a reasonable connection with a purpose which they have a right to achieve that it is something that they could have adopted. 
    Now, what is the purpose that they have a right to achieve so far as school teachers are concerned? 
    It is that in this sensitive area that persons not be teaching school where there is an undue hazard that they may be disloyal to the United States Government. 
    Now, this Court held in the Garner case, I think with seven out of eight of the participating justices agreeing that the provision of the affidavit plan to the effect that they were required to state whether they had ever been a member of the Communist Party, and if so, when? 
    Now, that went back to the indefinite past and yet that was sustained by -- by this Court, by an overwhelming vote of the justices.

    But I don't think that a person who says that he has never lent aid, support and so forth to the Communist Party can raise the question as to whether it's an ex post facto law or bill of attainder because it couldn't possibly be as to him.

    Yes, but suppose a man -- a man like Justice Frankfurter was talking about, a man who had supported certain causes that the Communist Party supports.

    I saw him when the communists were advocating this or advocating that.

    But I question that his constitutional rights have been invaded and also, I think that if a person is not in a very good position to say that I could not sign that oath as to whether to the effect that I've never lent aid and support because of doubt as to what might be considered aid-support and yet at the same time square that I have never lent aid or support.

    When you say fatally indefinite, I think if I may say so you're conjoining two very different things. 
    The statute isn't indefinite to defend that -- one doesn't know what it means. 
    It's often when one does know what it means, it raises difficulties which -- while we're here which raises a constitutional question whether you have a right to put a man in that situation. 
    It's perfectly plain what it means namely that you mustn't have been guilty of -- you mustn't have conducted yourself or to bring yourself within any of these rubrics.

    The -- I think I've been talking a little bit at large as to what the complaint says and what the courts held.
speaker="j_r_wells" startTime="6681.006" stopTime="6684.668">

    Yes sir.

    To be sure, paragraph 7, the complaint says, the plaintiff is a loyal American and does not decline to execute (Inaudible) oath of fear of the penalty provided by law of false oath. 
    And then it goes on in the next paragraph and says, “nevertheless he objects to it” because to require him to swear that he has not lent aid, support etcetera, brings him in the violation of the due process of law. 
    He doesn't spell out why it's a due process of law, but he has a right not to foreclose in making any proper inferences drawn from the (Inaudible) of what he does. 
    Now, your Supreme Court didn't say, which for me would make a very difference -- it'd be a different case, your Supreme Court doesn't -- hasn't said that in view of paragraph 7, despite his reliance on due process, he has said in effect that I have no concern with the consequences of signing this oath. 
    I'm not worried that any jury in Florida would -- could construe such an oath by lending aid and support, except to mean that I was a member of the Communist Party, that I have a definite organic relation with the party. 
    And if he wanted to say that then under Florida law, it should have been more particular. 
    For myself, I think Florida can -- if he chooses to continue the common law pleading which strict -- with all the strict technicalities of that system of pleading. 
    All your Supreme Court had said was this, “By the allegations of his complaint, the appellant under oath affirmatively denied any present or past associations which would preclude him from executing the subject oath.” 
    He stated in his complaint quote, “That he has not, does not and will not lend aid, support or advice, counsel or influence the Communist Party.” 
    That's all I find in the opinion of the court that you point out some things that I've missed as well I might have. 
    And therefore, all they gather from his disavow is that he was not -- that he did not have present or past association with the Communist Party. 
    Now, that for me still leaves open the danger he runs of having perfectly innocent constitutionally allowable conduct interpreted by a jury with the finding that he did give aid or support.

    That's just what I've been reading from Mr. Wells and that's all I find. 
    For myself, I think states can be as pugnacitive as they want to be so long as they don't use pugnacities as a means of defeating federal rights because they can be as exacting as they plead in pleadings, but I don't find that the Supreme Court here has made any such ruling.

    Mr. J. R. Wells 
    Well, I see that my time is nearly up and I'll just briefly refer to the clause of the oath. 
    I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government of United States and the State of Florida by force or violence. 
    I would like to call your particular attention to the fact that the language there does not contain the words that Mr. Justice Frankfurter felt to be particularly obnoxious in the Douds case with regard to where -- by unconstitutional or illegal means that they are not in the Florida statute and that this is limited to the violent overthrow by force or violence which I think would go far to eliminate the objections that was dealt in part in the Douds case. 
    Now, I think the -- on that clause, the validity of the oath might well depend on what is to be meant, considered to be meant by that expression. 
    In other words, does that refer to a belief in the abstract doctrine of the overthrow of Government by force or violence or does that have reference to the overthrow as an objective of the Government as presently constituted by force and violence. 
    And I think that it definitely has reference to the overthrow as an objective of the Government by force or violence -- as presently constituted and does not refer to any plea within the -- for some conceivable set of circumstances not now existing or some dictatorship or something of that kind. 
    Thank you Your Honors.

   Rebuttal of Tobias Simon
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="7056.830" stopTime="7187.155">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    The Court will note from the brief that this action was brought in Orange County, Florida pursuant to the provisions of Florida statute 87.01 which under Florida law permits an individual who is in doubt as to his status and his rights under a Florida statute to bring an action for declaratory relief. 
    Now, this is not a procedure that is available in every state. 
    It is available within the federal system. 
    And while this does not give an individual the right to ask for and secure an advisory opinion, it is something very close to that. 
    It does give him the right to have the Court adjudicate for him whether he is required to sign -- in this case, sign this oath or not. 
    I think it is important to point out to this Court that there were at least and not less than six points raised on our appeal to the Florida Supreme Court and the Florida Supreme Court answered all six points, five of them in a substantive manner. 
    They said, for example, that the question of scienter was no longer in the case. 
    They said that the question of preemption of subversion under the Nelson case is no longer in the case. 
    They ruled specifically on the question of whether we had to take this oath or whether the Constitution of Florida limited public employees to a constitutional oath. 
    They ruled and said specifically that anybody who can read English as to the requirements of the statute knows exactly what it means on the question of the so-called vice of vagueness. 
    They also said that due process and First Amendment provisions were not applicable and then and only then on pages 17, 18 and 19 of the record did they come to the question of ex post facto and bill of attainder and they said with regard to these questions and only these questions do we maintain that there is no standing to sue. 
    Florida did not say that there was no standing to sue with regard to the other questions.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    May I ask you Mr. Simon. 
    Is the effect of that argument to regard paragraphs 6 and 7 of the complaint as surplusage? 
    What effect have they under this argument?
speaker="tobias_simon" startTime="7204.051" stopTime="7293.945">
    Mr. Tobias Simon 
    It is not surplusage according to the Florida Supreme Court with regard to the questions of ex post facto and bill of attainder. 
    They said that this man cannot raise the question whether -- and they said specifically on page 19 of the record, there could not and I quote, “There could not possibly be a legislative adjudication of guilt for the simple reason that the complaint on which the appellant stands and set up firmly points out.” 
    They said the same thing that this statute could not constitute an ex post facto law as to this appellant but they did not say that this appellant was not permitted to raise the due process question and they did not say that this appellant -- of course they said that there was no denial of due process, but they ruled on that and they did not answer the other questions on this ground which if they have wanted to, they could have dismissed our entire brief and our entire complaint raising six assignments of error on this last one and they did not do it for the simple reason that the Florida Supreme Court did not hold that there was no standing to sue. 
    We submit that where this man's rights are being invaded as we maintain they are by forcing him to do something as a condition of his employment which he is not required to do, the fact that he is willing to show himself in a good life to this Court. 
    To come in as a sheep rather than as a goat does not destroy his rights.

    Mr. Simon before you sit down, in view of the breadth of your argument remain, I would like to ask you namely that no belief can constitutionally be inquired as to anybody who seeks office under the United States or state government, is that right?

    Let me -- let me put a case that is in regard to the President.

    The TVA Act has this provision, all members of the board shall be persons who profess a belief, just listen in what (Inaudible) this professor believes in, you must profess a belief in the feasibility and wisdom of this Act.

    My answer to that sir is that that particular provision in my opinion and based upon what I understand to be the decisions of this Court is that the federal government nor the government of Florida can reach into a man's mind and require it to be divulged as the condition of any governmental favor or employment.
