Silber v. United States
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="13.190">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 454 Bernard Silber, Petitioner, versus United States. 
    Mr. Rabinowitz.
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="13.190" stopTime="470.971">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    May it please the Court. 
    Mr. Silber is another one of those cases that came between the decisions in Wilkinson and Barenblatt. 
    He was called in the same inquiry, same investigation as Mr. Grumman in the immediate preceding case. 
    He was represented by me at the congressional committee hearing and at his trial. 
    He was tried a week or two after the Allen case, although his testimony before the Committee was some months before Allen's testimony. 
    He was convicted for violation of Section 192 on three Counts for refusal to answer three questions and received a sentence of four months. 
    The subject under inquiry as announced by the Committee was communist penetration into the communications industry. 
    It has been discussed by previous counsel on the previous case and I might add that this was the fourth hearing held by congressional committees on this very same subject. 
    The petitioner appeared subject to the subpoena. 
    He said that he had been employed by Western Union for 41 years. 
    He said that he had been a member of the Communist Party, that he had joined the Communist Party in 1948, that he had -- that hearing was in 1957, that he had been a member for about a year, that he had attended meetings he said rarely during that period of time and then he dropped out because he found that he wasn't much interested and that he was interested in other things. 
    Now, one would have thought that if this Committee was interested in sabotage, espionage, communist control of the communications industry, this man would have been affined. 
    He was a man who admitted having been a member of the Communist Party for a period of a year in the communications industry, employed by Western Union presumably in a position to give the very kind of information that the Committee was interested at. 
    No questions with relation to espionage, sabotage, communist control were asked. 
    Instead, the Committee following its incessant and unremitting quest for names moved immediately into that area. 
    The first question which is the subject of the indictment here Count 1 was, “Was the person who recruited you a communications' worker?" 
    And Mr. Silber had answered the questions up to that time but at least he bought and he said he must decline to answer this question. 
    I might say that Mr. Silber was an elderly gentleman, now on pension, not very articulate. 
    And when he said I must decline, the Committee counsel asked him why. 
    And he said on the basis of the Watkins and Sweezy decisions and also that Mr. Grumman who had testified two weeks before had filed a long statement with the Committee and he said, “I want to rely on all of the grounds that was stated by Mr. Grumman in his testimony which include the lack of jurisdiction of the Committee, rights under the First Amendment of vagueness of the resolution setting up the Committee, the lack of a Pertinency of the question.” 
    All of those grounds which had been suggested by the Watkins decision which is I say, had come down six weeks before. 
    And counsel at this point said to him, counsel for the Committee said to him, asked leave to -- “Explain to the witness why this question was pertinent.” 
    And he said, “This Committee is considering legislation to safeguard this nation from possible espionage or sabotage facilities by Congress.” 
    If the person who enlisted you which of the Communist Party was engaged in the communications field, that person undoubtedly would have some information which will be of used to this Committee in developing facts and respecting communist penetration of the communications facilities of this country. 
    And the witness was directed to answer the question again and I mean -- and witness said, “I'm very sorry. 
    My conscience prohibits me from answering this.” 
    And on three or four other occasions during the course of the hearing when other questions of a similar nature were asked, he repeated the grounds that had previously been given summarizing in a layman's fashion when he conceived to be the hauling for the Watkins case, conceived I regret to say incorrectly. 
    He said, “I'm sorry but I have a conscience.” 
    As a matter of fact, he said the same thing at sentence that his conscience prohibited from -- him from naming other person. 
    Count 2 was stricken. 
    Count 3 was, “Were there any officers of your union, members of the Communist Party at the time you were a member of the Communist Party? 
    And 3, “Were any of the present officers of your union, members of the Communist Party at the time you were in the party?” 
    Although, there was an explanation of pertinency with respect to Count 1, there was no explanation of pertinency with respect to Counts 2 and 4 except that after he had answered the question and had -- after he'd refused to answer the question and had been directed to do so by the Committee and he had refused to do so, Mr. Shera, a member of the Committee said, “And these questions were asked you for the same reason that Mr. Arens, our counsel gave you for asking the other questions. 
    They are pertinent for the same reasons that he advanced, namely that it would give the Committee an opportunity to cost deal other people. 
    Now, this is an illustration I think of the Committee's never ending quest for names. 
    The witness was not asked about his activities in the Communist Party. 
    He was not asked about espionage or sabotage or any of the other subjects the Committee is allegedly interested in. 
    All he was asked for was the names of other persons and although he expressed a perfect willingness and said, “I am perfectly willing to tell you everything about myself. 
    My conscience does not permit me to give the names of other persons.” 
    The name of other persons was the only subject that the Committee was interested in.

    Well, I think there are many reasons in the first place and one of the considerations is that a grand jury investigation is by law subject to secrecy.

    But this was not a lawsuit, this was a legislative investigation.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="557.822" stopTime="846.451">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    Because the purpose of a congressional committee had always understood was to secure information for legislative purposes, and not to engage in a program of exposure for exposures sake if I may quote language from -- I am sure some decisions of this Court either majority or minority. 
    This Committee asked this witness no questions about his activities in the Communist Party. 
    It was apparently not interested in anything that he did as a member of the Communist Party. 
    It said nothing to him about espionage, sabotage, or anything else. 
    All that was interested in was the never ending quest for names and names and more names. 
    And I submit that the purpose of this Committee and this is not the first time that this has been called, I am sure for the attention of this Court is not in my opinion, although I regret to say not the opinion of the Court, a true legislative purpose but as a purpose of exposure, a purpose of publishing as many names and more names and more names. 
    This matter has been considered by the Court. 
    It was considered by the Court in many of these decisions and this is a perfect illustration. 
    He was a witness who admitted membership in the Communist Party, was asked no questions at all about his activities in the Communist Party, was asked no questions about espionage or sabotage or all of those other things that we are told are the subject matter of the inquiry here. 
    All he was asked for are what are the names of other persons? 
    He even indicated their willingness and said, “I'm willing to tell you anything about myself, my conscience does not permit me to tell you about other persons.” 
    This it seems to me is a perfect illustration of the lack of true legislative purpose of this Committee. 
    Now, I realize that this Court has -- majority of this Court at least, has passed on this subject before and I'm not going to repeat the argument that I made in the Yellin case because among other reasons, I don't have the time for it and I don't want to go through the same the thing twice. 
    But here is a perfect illustration as I say of the Committee's never ending quest for names and names and names and more names. 
    And when it does get a witness who is prepared to say, “Yes, I was a member of the Communist Party, I'll tell you everything I want to know about myself but I cannot in good conscience answer about others,” they don't ask him about himself but they only ask about others. 
    At the close of the hearing, Mr. Doyle who was chairing a meeting complemented the petitioner on his frankness in admitting his membership in the Communist Party. 
    He complemented him on his good sense and getting out of the Communist Party when he did and he invited him to help the Committee and the witness said, “I'm sorry, I have a conscience to protect.” 
    The case was tried a few weeks after the Yellin case and it likewise resulted in the conviction this time in the sentence of only four months, the Yellin conviction had been for a year. 
    The petitioner urges several grounds for reversal here, and I am not going to -- oh incidentally, let me add one more thing. 
    At the close of the case, I offered the same testimony that Professor Emerson had given in the Yellin case as an offer of proof in this case for the purpose of proving that the -- well, the same purposes I had -- as I had in the Yellin case namely, issue that went to the question of just a cause for a congressional investigation and a balance of -- a balance of -- and the matter of whether there was balance of the interest involved in the situation. 
    The Court refused to accept the offer of proof, however, it is -- it is printed in the record as it is in the Yellin record that was submitted in writing and the same issues are raised here as were raised in the Yellin -- in the Yellin case. 
    I'm not going to reargue those. 
    We do contend, however, as we did in the --

    You better look and see.
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="867.565" stopTime="874.563">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    Oh yes, of course sir. 
    That relates really to the question that was discussed to some extent in the previous case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="874.563" stopTime="874.933">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="874.933" stopTime="990.308">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    I'll get to that very shortly. 
    My first argument is that the questions here were not pertinent. 
    This man had been out of the Communist Party for nine years at the time he was testifying. 
    He could offer no testimony as to the relevance of any matter that had been before Congress at the time that he was testifying. 
    He had no contact with the Communist Party for eight or nine years. 
    The only questions he was asked were questions which related to the membership of other persons. 
    The Committee showed a complete disinterest in his own activities in the Communist Party and asked him no questions concerning him. 
    And it is our contention that because of the remoteness of his membership and because mere listing of names cannot be pertinent, it's a sort of a discovery proceeding and not a legislative investigation that the questions were not pertinent to the subject matter under inquiry. 
    On the question that Judge Brennan asked namely the probable cause for the issuing of a subpoena to the witness. 
    Now in the Barenblatt case, you will recall that the Court said, and this was referred to in the previous case, nor did petitioner's appearance as a witness followed from indiscriminate dragnet procedures lacking in probable cause for belief that he possessed information which might be -- might be helpful to the subcommittee. 
    Now, it is my contention that the words probable cause have a meaning. 
    They have a meaning in our law and it's a meaning which is found in many Fourth Amendment cases and the meaning which is found in our criminal law --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="990.308" stopTime="997.806">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gathered the Government's position as whatever meaning it had does not have the meaning it has in Fourth Amendment cases or in arrest.
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="997.806" stopTime="999.356">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    That's true. 
    I can attend --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="999.356" stopTime="1000.624">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Did you say it does?
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="1000.624" stopTime="1110.897">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    I contend that it does. 
    I can send -- contend that the Court used the words probable cause. 
    It didn't use other words. 
    These are words of art and they have a meaning. 
    Now, let us see what the "probable cause" was in this case. 
    They did not ask -- Mr. Justice Stewart had suggested a little while ago, pick up every tenth -- tenth men off the street, that is true. 
    But we inquired at the trial at some length as to why Mr. Silber was called and we found that the following were the reasons that were given for calling him. 
    In the first place, he had access to the messages and facilities of Western Union which would present sabotage and espionage possibilities. 
    His position would be considered important. 
    He signed Communist Party petitions on behalf of Israel Amter and Benjamin Davis. 
    Now, there's no indication in the record as to when he signed those petitions for Benjamin Davis and Israel Amter. 
    Amter had a last run for political office as far as I can make out in the year 1939, so that was the last time he could have signed the petition for Israel Amter, 1939 would have been 20 years prior to his testimony. 
    Davis had run for Attorney General of the United States on a Communist Party ticket and had run for other offices on the Communist Party ticket in New York. 
    But the last time, he ran was 1946, so that was 12 years prior to the date that he ran for office. 
    The next reason was that --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1110.897" stopTime="1117.626">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I take it when you say he ran for office on the Communist party ticket, this --
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="1117.626" stopTime="1121.073">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    Mr. Davis ran, not the witness. 
    The witness had signed anonymity.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1121.073" stopTime="1123.271">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes I know, both Mr. Davis and Amter.
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="1123.271" stopTime="1123.373">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    Yes.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1123.373" stopTime="1126.406">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gather in those days, it was quite legal for the --
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="1126.406" stopTime="1126.422">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    Oh yes.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1126.422" stopTime="1127.745">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Communist Party.
speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="1127.745" stopTime="1227.018">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    Yes indeed. 
    And as a matter of fact both Amter and Davis ran for office and Davis was for a number of years, a member of the City Council of New York on the Communist Party ticket. 
    The next reason was that in 1940, the New York Times had listed his name as the name of a person whom someone had called a Red in the course of inter -- a factional dispute in the American Labor Party that was the other -- another reason for calling this witness. 
    And finally, his son whose first name is unknown, was also identified as a member of the Communist Party by a confidential source. 
    This, I suppose is the reverse of the sins of the father being visited on the son. 
    We contended and still contend that this was not within the meaning of the Barenblatt decision, probable cause for calling this witness. 
    The words “probable cause” have a meaning in the law, and I cannot believe that the Court used the words probable cause merely to mean that there was some sort of a reason. 
    It seems to me on the contrary that this was precisely and indiscriminate dragnet proceeding. 
    Thousands of people had signed Communist Party nominating petitions on behalf of Amter and Davis.

    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    And let me make a distinction between this case and almost every other case that has come before the Court. 
    I think that Whitman maybe an exception. 
    There is an exception of one of the cases that was argued this year. 
    In almost every other case that has come before the Court, there has been from somebody, sworn testimony that the man was a member of the Communist Party. 
    This was true in Braden. 
    You may not have thought much of the testimony but there was by somebody, sworn testimony that he'd been a member of the Communist Party. 
    There had been sworn testimony by -- in Wilkinson, there had been sworn testimony as to Barenblatt. 
    There had been sworn testimony as to Yellin. 
    There had been sworn testimony as to Grumman. 
    There had been sworn testimony as to almost all of these persons.

    It may have been --

speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="1316.526" stopTime="1402.844">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    That may have been the case. 
    I don't remember which one of the ones who were heard earlier this term in which there seemed to be a, "indiscriminate dragnet procedure." 
    Now so far as the signing of the petition for Davis and Amter were concerned, under the New York State law, a nominating petition for Davis would have required 12,000 signatures. 
    That means that if the Government is right, anyone of those 12,000 persons could have been called before the Committee and questioned or can be called before the Committee and questioned as to whether he is a member of the Communist Party. 
    And if this is not indiscriminate dragnet procedure, it is difficult for me to understand what those words could have meant. 
    I will not repeat here the constitutional issues that I argued a little earlier in the -- in the Yellin case, I think all of those constitutional issues are equally relevant in this case and --

speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="1442.039" stopTime="1674.539">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    No, in that sense, I am asking you follow what I conceived to be the ruling in the Barenblatt and Wilkinson and Braden cases. 
    The testimony of Professor Emerson which was incorporated in the Yellin case in which I've discussed this morning was relevant in this case as well. 
    And was as I say, admitted in the -- or it's in the record in this case. 
    Furthermore, what was the testimony which petitioner was being called on to give? 
    There had been four or five investigations over a period of years into so called Communist activity in the communications industry. 
    There had been several hundred pages of testimony taken over this subject and the naming of over a hundred persons in the industry who were alleged to have been Communists. 
    Many names were repeated over and over and over again. 
    The petitioner's membership in the Communist Party had been nine years before. 
    It had been casual in significance and remote in time. 
    Suppose he's been able to name two or three more people, suppose he had been able to say that instead of there having been a hundred persons in the communications industry who are members of the Communist Party, there had been 106 who had been members of the Communist Party of what legislative significance would this conceivably have had to the Congressional Committee which has been investigating this union now for a period of I think 11 years. 
    We have, on the other hand I think, very substantial rights of the petitioner and I've discussed this in the petitioner and also very substantial rights on the part of the public to -- well as I said in the Yellin case this morning, substantial rights on the part of the public to hear issues discussed and to engage in this public debate which is a debate that is proceeding throughout the world. 
    The petitioner here was in effect being asked to be an informant. 
    He was not being asked -- he was asked as to any of his own activities and in our opinion, the remoteness of the testimony being at best nine years old, the lack of probable cause here within the Barenblatt decision and the balancing problem which I have referred to a few moments ago all add up to the same thing. 
    There had been three prior hearings held by congressional committees on the problem of so called communism in the communications industry. 
    Hundreds of names had been recited, dozens of witnesses have been testified, this thing has been going on for 11 years, Congress still hasn't passed any legislation on the subject and there must be a time when Congress -- it seems to me and this Committee must be told that enough is enough.

    So the counsel at the -- the pertinency that was explained to him at the hearing was that he -- the pertinency that was explained by counsel was, “We want to know so that we can call these people and they may be able to give us information.”

    Well, you can look at the question by examining the reason for pertinency given by the -- by counsel at the time that the question was asked and the Government is bound by its explanation of pertinency. 
    The reason given by counsel was if the person who enlists -- the first question was who recruited you? 
    If the person who enlisted you into the Communist Party was engaged in the communications field, that person undoubtedly would have some information which would be of used of this Committee in developing facts, respecting communist penetration of the communication's facilities of this country.

    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    Yes, but the explanation of pertinency was that this would supply the Committee with the names of persons. 
    I assumed that the next question was -- would have been who and the witness must have assumed that too. 
    Otherwise, there is no sense to counsel's explanation of pertinency. 
    And I submit that as I have been pointed before, the Committee is bound by its own explanation of pertinency and I read again, and this appears at page 28 of the record. 
    If the person who enlisted you in the Communist Party was engaged in the communications field, that person undoubtedly would have some information which would be of used to this Committee in developing facts, respecting communist penetration of the communications facility of this country.

speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="1911.366" stopTime="2016.915">
    Mr. Victor Rabinowitz 
    I can't say what would have happened if that had happened. 
    All I can say is that if Mr. Arens, who was conducting this -- this examination had said, “I'm not asking you for the names. 
    I just want to know whether he was a communications worker.” 
    I, who was his counsel at the time, might very well have advised him to answer the question but that isn't what Mr. Arens said when he explained pertinency. 
    What Mr. Arens said was, “If the person who enlisted you in the Communist Party was engaged in the communications field, we could call him too” and this would be possible only if he were -- if their names were to be given. 
    Apparently, Silber so understood the question because he said, “I can't do this because it's against my conscience” and at the close of the testimony likewise, he said, “I cannot name the names of other people because it's against my conscience.” 
    It's true that now the Government says, possibly there would have been other relevance. 
    It doesn't say what that other relevance would have been. 
    But at the hearing, the relevance urged was that, “If you answer this question, we can call that person because he maybe able to give you the names of -- he may be able to give you information” and I quote “which would be of used to the Committee in developing facts to respecting communist penetration of communications facilities of the country.” 
    Now since Mr. Arens wanted these people, wanted this question answered so that he could call witnesses, it must have been for the -- it must've one of their names. 
    Otherwise, the explanation of relevancy is totally meaningless.

   Argument of Bruce J. Terris
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="2017.662" stopTime="2297.139">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think that at the start, I'd like to turn to just what the questions were, which petitioner refused to answer because they're almost identical with the kind of questions which Mr. Justice White suggested with the kind, it could be answered yes or no. 
    The first question, and this is our page 3 of the record, was he, and now that you have brackets, [the person who recruited defendant in the Communist Party] of communications worker. 
    The answer to that is yes or no. 
    It's not the name of a person. 
    Now the fact that the next question might have asked the name of the person, he should've -- if he was going object to identifying people, that was the time to object. 
    You can't start at the beginning of the hearing and say, “Well, I know what you're aiming at ultimately and that therefore, I'm not going to answer any questions even though the objection I've raised doesn't have anything to do with the questions you're now asking.” 
    In Count 3, where any of the officers of their union, members of the Communist Party at the time you were a member of the Communist Party? 
    Answer that yes or no. 
    It's not -- nobody's name could possibly be a direct answer unless you're going to elucidate the answer. 
    In Count 4 it's the same thing where any of the present officers of your union, members of the Communist Party at the time that you were in the party. 
    So none of these -- none of these questions involved the naming of names. 
    Now, it's true for pertinency purposes, it's arguable that we're bound by the explanation. 
    We have an argument that we're not bound. 
    But for First Amendment purposes at least, we're bound by what the questions asked for. 
    The questions did not ask for names. 
    The First Amendment issue here is whether a Committee can ask a witness concerning other persons after all, they're barely few questions that don't concern other persons unless you're going to ask the man, are you a Communist? 
    That's just about the only question you could ask him. 
    If you ask him, “What group you were a member of in the Communist Party?” 
    That concerns other persons. 
    If you ask him, “What are the plans of the Communist Party?” 
    It's almost impossible to think of any questions other than his personal membership. 
    And that kind of a question if it were the only thing that the Committee was interested in might well be just exposure for the sake of exposure. 
    Now, the context of petitioner Silber's refusal to answer is the same as that of petitioner Grumman. 
    And therefore, I will not repeat it. 
    The Committee was investigating Communist activities in the communications industry at large amounts of evidence seduced at this hearing about the danger from this kind of -- from Communist in the industry. 
    Petitioner Silber's contentions concerning the First Amendment are extremely similar to those of Petitioner Grumman and Petitioner Yellin. 
    Therefore, the Government's answer is virtually the same. 
    The facts are virtually the same as those in Barenblatt and Braden and Wilkinson and therefore, we submit that those three cases are controlling. 
    Government is obviously an important, vitally important interest of protecting the communications' network of this country from Communist subversion. 
    Petitioner Silber was not pillory. 
    The questions are clearly relevant. 
    Now, petitioner Silber's main contention and it's hard to say whether it's under the First or under the Fourth Amendments is that he was called as the result of indiscriminate dragnet procedures, lacking in probable cause to put -- to put his argument into the terms of the Barenblatt case, and I assume that means in the terms of the First Amendment and not of the Fourth Amendment. 
    I may say at the start, the petitioner, I believe, is wrong when he says that no other case which is been decided by this Court involves the witness which who had not been identified before a committee and sworn testimony as a Communist. 
    My reading of the Braden case, both the -- and I don't have the record here but the Government's brief certainly relied on no explicit testimony before the Committee stating that the witness was a Communist and there's nothing in the opinion which says that there was any such testimony. 
    Nevertheless, this Court stated the Subcommittee had reason to believe that the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party and that he even actively engaged in propaganda efforts. 
    As far as I can ascertain now, that statement is based on the sworn testimony of Committee counsel after witness's trial. 
    And we not only have that testimony here but we have additional corroborative documents which --

    Now, that would have in the record -- I can't positive but certainly the Government didn't rely at any sworn testimony. 
    Now, I would like to address myself very briefly, First to the Fourth Amendment contention. 
    Now, this is argued very extensively in our brief just as it was in the Shelton case. 
    The Government's contentions are essentially and very briefly three-fold. 
    First of all, the petitioner did not raise the Fourth Amendment before the Committee and therefore, we submit that he cannot raise it in this Court anymore than he raise the First Amendment issues, pertinency issues, quorum issues, any of the other kinds of issues which he may might have made before the Committee. 
    He did raise the First Amendment issue and therefore, if he was summoned as the result of indiscriminate dragnet procedures lacking in probable cause, I'm willing to assume that that would be a violation of the First Amendment --

    Now, we can think of no reason why Congress is to be treated worse than executive agencies or that the standard should be stricter for subpoenas to testify the subpoena duces tecum.

    I might say the start that this issue comes before this Court with the finding by the District Court on all the evidence that there was good cause to issue the subpoena had call the witness before the Committee and this finding was approved by the Court of Appeals. 
    And it seems to us that all we have to establish in this Court is if that finding wasn't so erroneous, that there was enough evidence in this record for our Committee to reasonably believe that the petitioner had information to contribute to the Committee's investigation. 
    Now, Committee counsel testified at the petitioner's trial. 
    If the Committee had information, the petitioner had been a member of the Communist Party engaged in the communications field. 
    That is the kind of statement with somewhat more detailed which this Court said in the Braden case, be sufficient to call a witness.

    I assume that's right. 
    In Braden -- the reason I say in Braden, there was less, is that in Braden all you have is the conclusion. 
    You had no idea where it came from. 
    Here, you have the conclusion and I assume most if not all of the underlying information if I might say Uphause and Wyman which this Court upheld a conviction under First and Fourteenth Amendment attack that there, there was many information that Mr. Uphause was a Communist at all. 
    All there was, is an indication and I don't think even that -- and there's assuming that from the opinion one cannot tell that this was sworn before committees, but there was information that Communist or people that were involved in Communist fun activities, well of course may not even be Communist, had been guest at the Summer Camp. 
    Yet, this Court held that there was ground to call Mr. Uphause to say who these people were. 
    I may say that there, they were asking -- they were asking for names which they were not asking for here. 
    The Government doesn't think there's any difference.

    Particularly of a man who wasn't -- that nobody has even charged this far as I know at least and nothing in the -- in the case indicates with being a Communist himself. 
    Mr. Silber is not only charged but he admitted that he was a Communist.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I don't think -- I think probably it's a technical matter that it is not eliminated, that the essential inquiry is what the Committee knew prior to the time.

    Well, it's not quite that clear from the brief.

    It's not slightest mentioned in Barenblatt of the Fourth. 
    If that's what he's relying at, we don't argue this without standing to raise the First Amendment issue. 
    He raised it before the Committee. 
    And we don't think that you could require a witness to raise all the particulars of your First Amendment issues. 
    So insofar, if this is the First Amendment contention, it's -- we believe that it's properly before the court.

    Well, let me tell the Fourth state, the four documents in which we rely. 
    The first is the petitioner handled the Government including secret government messages. 
    That means that if he was a Communist, certainly some reason to call, that doesn't help as some whether he was a Communist. 
    Second, the second one was the petitioner -- document showing the petitioner he participated in the nominating process of a person on the Communist Party ticket. 
    Now, we did it -- the Committee didn't call 12000 people. 
    He called a person that had participated in the nominee in process of which it had other information that he was a Communist. 
    The third or the second document which goes to whether he was a Communist was this news article from New York Times stating, I assume nobody has challenged its correctness so I'd rather not deal with the -- we're dealing with the New York Times. 
    I assume we're dealing with the fact that a lawsuit was filed by the American Labor Party against petitioner and others to oust them from the American Labor Party on the ground that they were allied, that they were affiliated with the Communist Party.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="3341.561" stopTime="3452.649">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    In our view, the Committee has reasonable ground to believe that either the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party or that he was closely allied to the Communist Party and we think it would've certainly been enough if he'd even been closely affiliate with the Communist Party, surely likely he would had information about Communist activities. 
    The Government has its second contention. 
    We believe that even if the Committee did not have a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner was a Communist, it certainly could reasonably believe that he had information to contribute to its investigation, which is all that Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson required. 
    The petitioner was admitted a long time member of the American Communications Association and a long time communications worker, 41 years. 
    The Committee had overwhelming evidence that the president, secretary treasurer, vice president, newspaper editor and other high officials of the American Communications Association were members of the Communist Party. 
    And therefore, we think he was reasonable for the Committee to subpoena petitioner even if he hadn't been a Communist to testify about what he knew about communist control of the American Communications Association. 
    This isn't an indiscriminate dragnet procedure. 
    I suppose if there's any -- that this man as much as anyone would know whether the Communist Party was directing and controlling the American Communications Association. 
    And it seems to us, that's all that Barenblatt requires, that the person reasonably have information, so even if he hadn't turned out to be a Communist, the Committee certainly was reasonable in subpoenaing him because of what he could expect was his knowledge of the American Communications Association and the industry.

speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="3457.778" stopTime="3533.551">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right and there's no -- and there's no indication that he -- that he was ignorant of the affairs of the American Communications Association. 
    After all, the Committee had before it indications, well the CIO's expulsion order for that matter, indications that the -- American Communications Association followed the Communist line. 
    Its high officers were Communist. 
    Somebody who was long time in the association certainly would be likely to have something to contribute, that at least he might have -- he might be able to answer the two questions involved in Counts Three and Four that he know of -- essentially, that he know of any of the person officers of the association were -- they'd been Communist. 
    I would now like to turn to petitioner's contention that the First Amendment was violated because the Committee was seeking information concerning other persons. 
    I've indicated briefly at the start of my argument that we think this intention is without any merit at all. 
    In brief, our argument is that --

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Mr. Rabinowitz is a much more skillful counsel then that Your Honor. 
    In all these cases, we have seven clear issues raised as to having the requirement that you state the subject under inquiry in the indictment, this case, it is not raised. 
    I don't know the reason why it isn't raised, but it isn't. 
    It's hard to believe that Mr. Rabinowitz meant his contentions as to actual pertinency in a price of a pertinency to go to the indictment. 
    If he did it, it's unusually unskillful such able counsel. 
    Petitioner Silber in our view has no special First Amendment rights because he was questioned about other persons, his rights are still freedom of speech and freedom of association which this Court held in Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson do not allow a witness to refuse to testify concerning Communist activities. 
    And in addition, petitioners own First Amendment rights could not have been infringed here, because he testified concerning his own activities. 
    Therefore, petitioner Silber is candid in admitting that it's essentially his argument rest on the fact that his self-respect and self-esteem require he claims that he not act as an informer. 
    The Government submits that this moral scruples worthy as they maybe in some circumstances, in some particular circumstances have never been recognized by this Court or as far as we've been able to ascertain by any other court as a legal defense under the First Amendment. 
    On the contrary, there's a well-established part of our jurisprudence that a citizen has a legal and civic duty to testify before properly constituted authority as to matters within his knowledge even if the expense of his friends. 
    And we submit that it's frivolous even to suggest that a witness whether it's before a grand jury, in a criminal trial or before a congressional committee can simply refuse to discuss the activities of other persons because he does not want to be what he calls an informer.
