    Mr. George H. Mitchell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First of all and I'd like to say that I don't want to give the impression that I'm attempting to read something into the statute that does not exist. 
    I agree fully with the holding in the Graham case that the proceedings under the statute are for identification only and I know of no reported cases in West Virginia where the question was raised as to whether defense, especially the one suggested by Mr. Chief Justice Warren, if interposed whether it should be considered or not at the hearing. 
    I know of no reported case that says it should be considered.

    If those four -- those prior three convictions were all voidable or unconstitutional or whatever you want to call them could be attacked say by habeas corpus because of the deprivation of a constitutional right, would you say that they nevertheless would be foreclosed that this man could go to prison for life on the basis of three judgments in which he had no lawyer, no one to defend him and constitutionally was entitled to a lawyer in those three cases or in one of those three cases or in two of those three cases.

speaker="george_h_mitchell" startTime="542.475" stopTime="675.216">
    Mr. George H. Mitchell 
    That's right sir. 
    As it had been pointed out by counsel for the petitioners, they say first that they were deprived of due process of law because they were not given notice that an information would be presented setting forth a prior felony conviction. 
    Our Supreme Court of Appeals has held in State against Blankenship, a 1952 case reported in 137 West Virginia, page 1, that in as much as a procedures set forth in the statute does not constitute a trial of prior offenses, no notice is required before presenting the bill of information to the Court. 
    As I understand due process, the primary purpose of affording a defendant notice is to inform him of the charge against him, and to give him a reasonable time in which to prepare his defense. 
    And it is our contention that such a reason for notice does not exist in this type of cases wherein we are concerned with the application of the habitual criminal act because this is not an information of an offense for which a trial has to be had, but is an information to ascertain the fact that is namely that the prisoner has already been previously convicted of offenses and this fact must appear either by his own confession or by a verdict of a jury before he can be sentenced to the additional punishment prescribed in the statute. 
    He's not sentenced for an offense distinct from the one from which he has been tried, but the only question is whether he is such a person as ought to be sentenced to the additional punishment and in that relation, we compare with the finding in the Graham case wherein we say that the proceedings under the statutes are for identification only. 
    They are clearly not for the establishment of guilt. 
    The question of guilt does not reopen at all in this type of proceeding.

    It is not so absurd that in this type of proceeding, due process does not require that notice be given in the same form as in a trial of a case. 
    In relation to Mr. Ginsburg's position there that notice should perhaps be given prior to the trial of the case, I don't see how it would be feasible. 
    Under our statute, it says after conviction, immediately after conviction, and before sentencing, the prosecuting attorney must file an information setting forth the previous convictions. 
    To give him notice that he would be almost assumed that he would be found guilty, he'd be convicted, but the statute anticipates a proceeding after conviction and before sentence.

    A contingence could be had if it did not extend beyond the term. 
    The statute says that this information must be filed after verdict, before sentence and within term, within the same term of court. 
    That's perhaps one of the reasons why they have a statute that gives the same authority to the warden. 
    If a prisoner comes there and has not been sentenced under the habitual criminal act in the trial court, he may file an information setting forth his previous convictions.

speaker="george_h_mitchell" startTime="1246.664" stopTime="1561.948">
    Mr. George H. Mitchell 
    In both of these cases as the records reveal that prisoners upon being informed of their prior convictions were given the opportunity to say whether they were the same person named in the information and they were duly cautioned as to the effect of admitting their identity, nevertheless, both readily admitted that they were the same persons and were consequently sentenced to life imprisonment under the statute. 
    In discussing this matter of notice the petitioners in their brief and in the argument have relied heavily on decisions from Tennessee and from the Third Circuit, in the court -- in the case Rhea against Edwards, a Tennessee case, which mention was made in our brief on page 6, the Court there held that since the Tennessee Habitual Criminal Act as interpreted by the Tennessee Supreme Court did not require that notice before trial be given a defendant who is to be sentenced under the act has violated the due process. 
    Now those cases can be readily distinguished from the cases now before this Court. 
    As pointed out in our brief and under the Tennessee statute that was in effect at that time it states that when a habitual criminal as defined in Section 1 of this Act, as charged by presentment on indictment by the commission of several enumerated felonies, he may also be charged in this same indictment with being a habitual criminal as defined in Section 1 or he may be charged only with the commission of such felony but in either case shall upon conviction be sentenced and punished as a habitual criminal. 
    Under Tennessee statute, it was possible as it happened in the McCummings cited in our brief, it is possible for a prisoner to go to trial and then the district attorney announced at the trial that he was going -- he is -- in addition to being tried for a specified felony, that he would also be tried as a habitual criminal. 
    Now under the West Virginia statute that's not possible. 
    Our proceeding is a separate proceeding and there's no question, once the information is filed as to what the proceeding is about that the offender is to be punished if he is found to be the same person named in the information as a habitual offender. 
    In the Pennsylvania case cited by the petitioner, Collins against Claudy, a situation existed there that could not exist in our statute. 
    In that particular case, Collins had been indicted for breaking and entering a store and stealing certain sum of money. 
    He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a term from five to 20 years. 
    His sentenced reheard. 
    The court sentenced a rehearing that it was pursuant to the act of assembly approved April 29th, 1929. 
    This was a reference to the Pennsylvania habitual criminal act. 
    At no point -- no stage during the proceeding that Collins knew that he was being dealt with as an habitual offender. 
    That cannot happen once again as I pointed out because on our statute, the ascertainment whether or not the prisoner here is a habitual offender. 
    It is done in a separate proceeding and is not done along with the trial shall we say. 
    Under the Tennessee statute that was in effect then, he was tried at the same time for being a habitual criminal and for the felony that he had committed and the jury, the same jury that tried him for the offense determined whether or not he was a habitual criminal. 
    That cannot happen under the West Virginia statute. 
    We say that those holdings are distinguishable from the cases now before this Court for that reason because I thought that the West Virginia procedure provides to a defendant ample notice that he is being dealt with as a second or third offender as the case may be and he has opportunity, sufficient opportunity to contest his identity as to whether or not he is that person.

    (Inaudible) Mr. Justice Harlan presupposes that one charge with the principal offense in your courts knowing of his own background but that the prosecutor thought that doesn't know of it, will plead guilty in the hope that he will just be given a single sentence not taking into account his past act -- sentences. 
    Well could that scheme ever work fine if the statute I'm referring to that sets forth on page 38 at Mr. Ginsburg's brief is a valid statute?

    Along with the question raised by Mr. Chief Justice, the petitioners contend in their brief and in their petition that they were denied equal protection of the laws and equal justice by the state of West Virginia because the state's habitual criminal law was being administered by an unequal hand and has been stated here this morning, in support of this allegation, the petitioner's quote extensively from several studies made of the West Virginia habitual law -- habitual criminal law with special emphasis being placed on those facts that tend to indicate that it's somewhat being applied in a discriminatory manner. 
    Now, we are not certain how accurate the surveys are but we are -- and we do say that the allegations contained in the two petitions then before this Court insufficient in showing the purposeful and intentional discrimination necessary and essential to show an invasion of the constitutional right to the equal protection of the law. 
    They do not -- they cannot put themselves in a class as the certain group of people being discriminated against.

    I think our Supreme Court in reviewing these petitions examined the Pennsylvania statutes and they found that the offenses, the crimes therein described were crimes punishable by a confinement in the penitentiary hence Pennsylvania so selected to punish the petitioner in their manner. 
    Larceny, according to the statute is a felony in Pennsylvania, that was a larceny of a $1250 car. 
    Burglary was made a felony by the statute in Pennsylvania and he was convicted of both of those crimes and they are punishable under Pennsylvania statute by a confinement in the penitentiary. 
    However, Pennsylvania has this other statute that allows certain youthful offenders to present to Camp Hill or whatever it is, an industrial school in Pennsylvania and they elected to send him there rather than to send him to the penitentiary.

   Argument of David Ginsburg
speaker="david_ginsburg" startTime="3561.968" stopTime="3678.400">
    Mr. David Ginsburg 
    I'd be very brief. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Certain questions were asked which I may be able to answer, one having to do with the Brown study. 
    The question was asked whether he had dealt with this problem of bargain justice and the two paragraphs which I regarded as relevant in this connection are quoted on page 21 of the petitioner's brief. 
    Brown says that in view of these figures, the statistical data which contained in these records, the records before this Court, on these cases, it is to see why the few prisoners who have been sentenced for life imprisonment under our habitual criminal law feel that they have been discriminated against. 
    This is one of the chief complaints against West Virginia's habitual criminal law. 
    Of course, the reason the law was imposed in many cases was due to the fact that the person plead guilty to the present charge in consideration of the law not being imposed. 
    Bargain justice enters the picture and the record doesn't show the whole picture insofar as the part played by the habitual criminal law in our system of criminal justice concerned. 
    Question was asked regarding the nature of the statistical data whether it is broken down by county and so on. 
    Those data are contained in the record in this case. 
    In the Oyler case in pages 37, about 20 pages going on, they identify the prisoner, they identify the county, the number of prior convictions and the sentences which were imposed. 
    There's a recapitulation by county on page 59 of the Oyler record. Question was further asked whether what action was taken by the state legislature. 
    In the Oyler record on page 36, there is the statement, this document was offered to the state legislature in 1957 and one house voted 98 to 2 in favor of abolishing, amending or correcting the habitual criminal statute that the issue was not pursuant to a crime (Inaudible). 
    I think --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Ginsburg (Inaudible) indicate what was the (Inaudible) --
speaker="david_ginsburg" startTime="3690.790" stopTime="3855.281">
    Mr. David Ginsburg 
    Not to my knowledge sir but perhaps in the data which the Attorney General's office will supply, we'll find the answer but in the published material there is no answer to that question as I've seen it. 
    Reference was made to the case of Collins and Claudy, this was Judge Hastie's opinion of the Third Circuit and it was that opinion which led to the State of Pennsylvania to reverse itself on this issue of notice. 
    It is quite true as the -- my Brother Mitchell indicates in Collins and Claudy, there was no notice of any kind to the prisoner that he was being dealt with as a habitual offender. 
    Judge Hastie's reply there was as follows, “We cannot see how any subsequent showing that the accused did not have a good defense can excuse the failure to found one part of the sentence, it's more than the other from the normally prerequisite procedure of notice and hearing. 
    We are satisfied,” he says, “that fundamental fairness and judicial procedure required the court impose an enhanced penalty only upon the basis of a supporting judicial determination of the essential facts made after the defendant has been informed of and heard upon the issue of recidivism. 
    That decision led to the State of Pennsylvania to reverse itself. 
    The state had had decision in effect similar to the one in the Blankenship case here in West Virginia which says that no notice is required, so also Pennsylvania had concluded that no notice was required. 
    Following Collins and Claudy, however, Benzing and Myers that's referred to in the brief, there was a petition for habeas corpus seeking release from the Pennsylvania state penitentiary. 
    Benzing had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter and there had been an enhanced punishment. 
    He was told at the time of sentence just as ordering peremptory were told here that the habitual criminal act was being invoked but he was not told that he had a right to a hearing and time to prepare. 
    It was held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that although the act doesn't in terms provide for notice or hearing to avoid constitutional problems, the act would be reinterpreted. 
    And it's shown there as here that neither the petitioner nor the counsel objected when sentence in that case was doubled and the judge did not inform Benzing that he had a right to hearings. 
    It was held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that there was no waiver when the petitioner did not know that he had any right. 
    He was not released at courts, it was sent back for re-sentencing and so also I think it would be appropriate in the cases here.

    Could I ask you one question? 
    Assuming that the statute is not to be construed as limiting the power of the judge on a request for adjournment that had been made, what is your answer to the question of waiver, a suggestion of waiver in the Oyler case, the counsel's failure, waiver arising from the counsel's failure to ask for any further notice or adjournment.

    Mr. David Ginsburg 
    What actually happened in Oyler was that after the trial and after the motion for a new trial was denied, this information was brought before the Court. 
    I agree with my Brother Mitchell that the law has understood, the law as written provides that you may contest the issue of identification but that's all you can do. 
    I don't believe that he waived any rights which he didn't have. 
    He didn't have a right to raise this in Oyler and he didn't. 
    I don't believe either counsel or that counsel was culpable in that case.
