    Mr. David B. Rothstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, now, I just want to summarize in a few minutes the -- what we feel we could show if the case were to be remanded in District Court conducted a hearing. 
    We think that we show generally the facts that have been discussed earlier with respect to the existence or non-existence of any statements or reports and in addition, the receipts themselves which we concede our statements but which we contend are too remote in the circumstances of this case to be held to relate to the direct testimony of the witness. 
    Now, these receipts would only show two things, most of them would only show amounts of money paid. 
    The nine would show amounts paid and in addition, certain itemizations. 
    Now, the amounts paid on all the receipts would be reflected and is reflected in the schedule that the Government offered to produce and which was refused by the defense. 
    Moreover, all the testimo -- all that would be shown by these receipts, as to payments received, was already in the record in the form of the direct testimony or the cross-examination testimony of the witnesses, both of whom had, as we indicated earlier, readily acknowledged that they had been paid for services and expenses and they gave the amounts that they had been paid. 
    So that the receipts, insofar as they reflect money received, could not be further used to impeach the impeaching testimony already given by the witnesses. 
    Now, in addition, as we've also indicated, we -- we feel that -- that we can show and that there is substantial reason to believe that the trial court upon examination of the itemizations would agree that considering the overall testimony, considering the nature of these receipts and the itemizations listed, would agree that the items do not relate sufficiently directly to the matters testified about -- by the witness on the -- on his direct examination. 
    Moreover, even if in the two respects in which we have suggested in our brief, at pages, and we've discussed them at pages 33 and 34, that two or three of the itemizations in these receipts might, in a very general sense, be considered to have related to direct testimony to matters about which the witness testified. 
    We feel that there is good ground for the argument that any error, if there was error, in that turning these itemizations over, was harmless and that there was no possible prejudice to the defendant in not having had access to these particular itemizations. 
    And of course, the reason, primary reason for that is that he had the narrative reports that the witness had furnished to the F.B.I. concerning these very activities.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    May I ask at the beginning that you can answer this at any time you'd like. 
    I don't see a discussion in your brief why we should adopt here a different test of membership under this statute than the Court adopted in Scales case that was foreshadowed by Yates neither of which are discussed in your brief, you can come at that --

    Why -- what the Court was -- what it's paying in the Scales to indicate that your nominal membership, passive membership could not have been within the purview of the Smith Act and there were passages indicating the constitutional overtones of -- that were present there and I -- I wondered why -- why that isn't discussed here?

speaker="david_b_rothstein" startTime="510.397" stopTime="587.395">
    Mr. David B. Rothstein 
    Well, Your Honor, I think that -- the statute deals with two things, membership and the party, for our purposes anyway, membership and the party or membership in an organization which teaches and advocates a violent overthrow. 
    Now, the Congress found that the Communist Party had reason to find it. 
    Communist Party was of -- of such a nature that it likely would interfere with interstate commerce through exercising its influence over its members who were union officers. 
    That is the -- is the legislative basis for the statute. 
    In a situation where you had an organization which teaches and advocates the overthrow and -- and the member signing the affidavit, of course, it would be a question of proof, you would have to show knowledge that the person executing the affidavit had knowledge that the organization of which he was a member did teach and advocate. 
    I don't think that's necessarily so where the Communist Party is concerned with respect to Section 9 (h).

    Mr. David B. Rothstein 
    -- or should be taken into consideration. 
    I don't think that -- I mean, many of these, standing along, would not support the ultimate conclusion that the person was a member because he did one of these things. 
    But these are certainly rational criteria to take into consideration in coming to the conclusion of whether or not an individual was or was not a member of a particular organization. 
    The fact that he attended meetings, the fact that he was an officer, the fact that he executed orders, the fact that he submitted himself to discipline of the organization, all those things, I think as a -- as a matter of logic, should be taken into consideration by any fact finder in deciding whether or not the particular defendant was a member of the party. 
    And of course, I think contrary to what has been argued by -- for the petitioners and in certain respects by the amicus, the Court did not permit the jury to conclude that membership was proved by anyone of these elements.

   Rebuttal of Basil R. Pollitt
speaker="basil_r_pollitt" startTime="1041.785" stopTime="1328.202">
    Mr. Basil R. Pollitt 
    With brief reference to Section -- to number 11 of the indicia which we used in argument to highlight a pervading error of all the indicia, I'd simply like to say in response to the Government's argument that it's my understanding of the Stromberg case, the Herndon case and the Winters case that when First Amendment -- the First Amendment rights of the defendant maybe entrenched upon, the question is not whether or not there is evidence which supports the verdict but whether or not under the instructions, the jury could have rested its verdict on those First Amendment rights, which I think is the case here. 
    Turning briefly to the question of Section 9 (h), the purpose and the meaning of membership in that Section, the forepart of the oath seems on it's face provide for guilt by association and that was argued before Your Honors at one time. 
    And to violate the doctrine that guilt is personal because members, all members of the Communist Party seemed to be denominated. 
    But as I read the opinion, the various opinions in Douds, if the oath is to be upheld at all, it can only be upheld because the kind of membership and the kind of affiliation involved involves a personal commitment to the political strike. 
    That was what we ask the Court to give and that was refused and we submit that the definition of membership and I might add the definition of affiliation, both of which fall short of that personal commitment. 
    That -- I beg your pardon. 
    I don't mean personal -- I mean personal and organizational commitment, organizational involvement which means that personal commitment. 
    And if it fall short of that, it doesn't meet the standards laid down by any of the six Justices on this Court who voted to uphold the forepart of the oath. 
    Turning now to the notes, the memoranda of which were destroyed, first of all, we'd like to clarify any doubts that maybe about -- as to our position. 
    This was evidence. 
    This was produceable evidence before Jencks, produceable evidence after Jencks. 
    In the argument of (Inaudible) which requested in your opinion, Mr. Justice Brennan, but the one, the Government conceded that we could, at all times, have called the F.B.I. agent who took these memoranda. 
    And since these memoranda were made in the regular course of business, it's his duty and his practice to make such memoranda. 
    We could have subpoenaed those memoranda. 
    So that it was evidence that the Government destroy even before Jencks. 
    Of course, under Section 3500, the Government concedes that these notes could, these memoranda could have been within this Section. 
    And once that concession is made, under the Campbell case decided last term, if those notes had existed, it would've been the duty of a trial judge to have -- to conduct a judicial inquiry into whether or not they can within the scope of Section 3500. 
    So that what the Government destroyed here was evidence whether it was before or after the Jencks decision, and by the way Your Honors, we raised this position before Jencks. 
    This was not afore to in this alliance -- reliance. 
    We insisted from the word "go" in his first trial that we were entitled to un-break his memoranda. 
    So that what the Government has done here is destroy and the police agency is to destroy potential evidence. 
    Our position is very simple, they have no rights or to do.
