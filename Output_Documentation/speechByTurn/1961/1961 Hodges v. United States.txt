    Thank you Your Honor. 
    Before I get into my argument, I want to say this that I entered a hypothetical question Your Honors as to what would happen if the District Court applied an erroneous standard. 
    It is a theoretical question in relation to this case and I don't mean to bind the Government for -- for some future case. 
    I said it would be a more difficult question. 
    I'm not sure just where we come out, but certainly, whatever difficulties they were, it would be if the standard that is applied was an unconstitutional thing that it not just grab an erroneous phraseology.

    Coercion has not been a major problem in federal trial. 
    There hasn't been the decision by this Court on the subject since Warne against the United States and there really have been very few in the Courts of Appeal particularly since McNabb and even before that, it was not one of the major problems in federal criminal law.

    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    Before recess, I was just pointing out that -- well, this admittedly comes before the Court in a fairly unsatisfactory fashion because of the change of counsel and then change of empathy and so on. 
    It seemed to us that when petition's allegations are read against the record, it is quite clear that he is claiming that the jury should have believed him and that his allegations depend on his own testimony. 
    And I just want to summarize briefly so that the Court will know what we base this on. 
    The Government evidence was that the Chicago Police, having received both information implicating petitioner and a confession by a codefendant implicating petitioner got a warrant and send it to Florida where they thought petitioner was, they then learned he'd gone to Chicago and so they called the Chicago Police and asked them to make the arrest. 
    The Chicago -- the Government brought one Chicago policeman to testify at the trial that was the man who was in charge of making the arrest and who participated in the arrest. 
    His testimony was that he was admitted peaceably and that he told petitioner he was wanted in Washington and that he asked whether petitioner had any guns and petitioner showed them to him and he seized the gun. 
    There was no -- it was completely a peaceful arrest on Sunday, April 29. 
    Now, petitioner was held from April 29 until May 1st. 
    He wasn't brought before magistrate on April 30th because the Chicago Police hadn't got a warrant, but at the time he was arrested, the petitioner said he would go back to Washington and on May 1st in formal proceedings before a Chicago Police Court Judge, he waived extradition and agreed to return to Washington. 
    The Washington Police got to Chicago on May 2nd, they asked the petitioner about the crime and he denied being implicated until he was shown the confessions of the two, his brother and another codependent at which point he made a confession. 
    The Chicago policeman testified that when he made the arrest, he talked to the petitioner about the warrant, but at the time of the arrest, petitioner made no admission and he said so far as he knew petitioner was not further questioned although he was off the next day because -- and he did say they had other things to do. 
    When petitioner was brought back to Washington, he repeated his confession before the victim of the robbery. 
    Now, petitioner at the trial testified that the Chicago police had their guns drawn when they arrested him. 
    He said that various officers, not the one who testified at the trial, had him in three or four lineups where there was no questioning and that he was questioned three or four times, never for more than 30 or 40 minutes while he was held before he was -- before he waived extradition on May 1st. 
    A cross-examination outside the presence of the jury not repeated before the jury, he testified that the Chicago police roughed him up a little bit, but admittedly he made no confessions or admissions to Chicago Police and admittedly, the Chicago police were very nice to him. 
    Now, the only real threat that -- to which he testified was the Chicago police did that he would be turned over to the Chicago Police -- the Washington Police said he should know -- the Chicago Police if he didn't confess. 
    The Washington Police denied any threat. 
    Now, there's a certain inherent incredibility in the alleged threats since admittedly from the time the Chicago Police picked him up, they told him he was in Washington and admittedly on May 1st, he's waived extradition. 
    On this basis, it seems to us that the claim of coercion was at best, a question for the jury which as I have said was submitted to the jury under instructions that were not accepted to, that were specifically accepted by trial counsel. 
    And for that reason, we think petitioner cannot allege, it's not merely a form of words, we think he cannot allege that on the undisputed evidence, there was coercion as a matter of law and therefore, we think he cannot even allege the denial of a constitutional right and that the Court of Appeals insofar as to discuss that question, discussed the hypothetical question.

   Argument of Quinn O'connell

    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First of all, I think there are certain things that we ought to get straight as to what is not in dispute here. 
    It is not in dispute that the petitioner did, in his petition under Section 2255, claim that his confession was admitted in evidence at his trial and used against him over the objection of trial counsel and that the rights of the defendant under the Constitution and laws of the United States were clearly violated by the above described procedure that being part of the procedure. 
    He did raise certain McNabb and Mallory questions, but he -- the point is that he did specifically allege that this confession was -- should not have been admitted as a matter of law. 
    The District Court on its hearing and whatever basis it arrived in its decision, we do not know because there is no transcript of that -- of that proceeding, held that the confession was voluntary. 
    We don't know the basis for this decision in that matter. 
    The Court of Appeals did not review this decision, and this is the decision that we say that the petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination of, was if an error as a matter of law to have submitted this confession to the jury.

    May I ask you one other question to get myself absolutely clear. 
    I'm not clear. 
    What I'm asking you especially for is not to discuss the merits and being implied on the merits because I want to see if I'm right as to what happens. 
    First, Judge Fahy wrote an opinion for the Court on the record as it then stood in which he did say that the man was not entitled to a hearing. 
    That's right, isn't it?
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="860.242" stopTime="861.840">

    That's right.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="861.840" stopTime="911.260">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Then a motion for rehearing was made. 
    The defendant asked for -- to supplement the record and raised for the first time clearly as I gather from Judge Fahy's second opinion, the question that had been a good excuse on his -- from his standpoint and failing to appeal, is that right? 
    Did the supplemental motion with affidavits attached raised a new or supplement and strengthen the claim that there had been a reasonable excuse -- a good excuse for not appealing if such an excuse could justify anything.
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="911.260" stopTime="924.775">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    That's right, but the way this came up Your Honor is this, the appeal was noted from the denial of 2255 hearing. 
    At the time of the -- well, there was a brief filed and it was vacated and counsel was dismissed.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="924.775" stopTime="926.593">

    But let me ask you.

    Yes.

    Then Judge Fahy said the papers filed with that motion relied upon -- include affidavits, this state in substance and after he was sentenced argued -- it was promptly taken away and so forth without opportunity of this counsel to advice him and to get his appeal. 
    Now, did he on the basis of this new -- these new facts which he said appeared in this motion say that this change of situation told that it raises the question as to whether if the -- if the failure to appeal was justifiable and it raised the constitutional question, the Court should have a hearing to determine in this instance first, was the failure to appeal a good reason so as to say that this now could be raised on a 2255 motion.

    I would assume that this would have been a proper thing that would have come up at the 2255 hearing. 
    Why didn't the fellow appeal? 
    I don't know what happened at the 2255 hearing, but it seems that it would be very unfortunate because of this lack of a transcript of the hearing which has ultimately come to the Supreme Court that because we don't know that he should be deprived of any opportunity to explain his reasons.

    The Government itself concedes that there -- that there are hypothetical cases which they can conceive where the failure to appeal might be such that it would not bar a collateral attack and they mentioned such cases as --

    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    No, we're not to decide those hypothetical cases Your Honor, but all I am saying that as a practical matter, effectively, those hypothetical cases so far as our petitioner is concerned, his excuses is just as great as those hypothetical cases if he didn't know of his rights to appeal. 
    If a person comes to sentence under 37 (a) (2), Rule 37 (a) (2) without an attorney, the District Court judge is obliged to inform him of his appellate rights and have the clerk of the court note the appeal for him. 
    In effect, this petitioner was in no different position than a person who had actually attended the sentencing without a hearing. 
    And this, as a practical matter, this whole thing could be avoided by the very simple thing of having 37 (a) (2) applied no matter whether counsel is present or not because this is a -- this 10-day appeal period is evidently caused -- causes a lot of trouble where counsel who have either appointed by the court or who is representing a person without a fee after sentencing, they've gone through the trial and they leave.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm just saying, was there anything before the court en banc that wasn't before Judge Fahy's panel?
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1386.965" stopTime="1387.627">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1387.627" stopTime="1388.079">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What?
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1388.079" stopTime="1395.475">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    The affidavits of the counsel showing the reasons for excusing to appeal. 
    Judge Fahy's panel did not have that before it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1395.475" stopTime="1413.467">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, that -- that counsel's affidavit merely says, not merely says, the counsel's affidavit said that they told the wife who had hired them -- who had retained them, I beg your pardon, who had retained them that he should appeal, is that right?
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1413.467" stopTime="1413.530">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    That is correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1413.530" stopTime="1431.983">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The only light we get on the non-appeal -- on the absence of an appeal from the original trial was counsel's affidavit to the wife to the person who retained them that they thought an appeal should be pursued. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1431.983" stopTime="1435.871">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    That's right. 
    And I say -- and I agree that it's an unsatisfactory record.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1435.871" stopTime="1447.417">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Alright. 
    That's -- that's the only difference between matters that were before Judge Fahy when he wrote the opinion for the panel and the matters that were before Judge Fahy when he wrote his dissent.
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1447.417" stopTime="1458.928">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    That's right, because Judge Fahy's opinion for the panel said, based his opinion on the fact that there had been no reason even offered for failing to appeal. 
    And this --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1458.928" stopTime="1459.418">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now the --
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1459.418" stopTime="1490.196">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    -- a reason had been offered prior to that but a different panel had rejected the offer to supplement the record and when it was brought out to the court that they were actually were reasons for failing to appeal, these affidavits were not filed after the -- Judge Fahy's opinion. 
    They had been prepared and a motion to supplement the record had been made when the case first went up before it was briefed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1490.196" stopTime="1492.531">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well then -- weren't they before the panel when Judge Fahy (Voice Overlap)?
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1492.531" stopTime="1537.812">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    Because a different penal of the Court in acting upon the motion to supplement the record before the panel had even been picked to hear the case on the merits had -- with the per curiam order refused to allow the affidavits into the record. 
    Then Judge Fahy, he decided the case on the ground that no attempt had been made to show why this appeal had not been taken. 
    Well, an attempt had been made but had been rejected by different panel and this is what we pointed out on the hearing. 
    Then Judge Fahy came around to the point where he said, “Well, if I had known that and now I do know it, then he has a right to determine whether or not this affidavits are true,” and if they are true then --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1537.812" stopTime="1541.875">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But they've accepted it. 
    Those affidavits were -- the affidavit --

    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1542.119" stopTime="1574.592">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- we have a case here that soon will have its fifth anniversary from the day of the trial and soon will have its fifth anniversary and today there has been a succession of three different lawyers at different stages adjusting themselves quite rightly to new situation in legal opinion such as the Mallory opinion. 
    New lawyers came in and adjusted themselves to the Mallory opinion. 
    They raised that then those lawyers, I don't how or why they disappeared but then you, as the matter of public service were appointed and now we've got some new grounds.
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1574.592" stopTime="1598.871">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    Well, I don't believe there are any new grounds Your Honor from this point of view. 
    At the trial, there was objection that this was -- this should not have been admitted into evidence that it should not have been submitted to the jury. 
    In his petition for -- under 2255, he claim that his constitutional rights were denied by admitting these things into evidence and that's -- that's the whole issue here. 
    But do we reach it? 
    Does he get it --?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1598.871" stopTime="1620.422">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If that is so, then we've got it all before us and we are just as competent to decide on what is on the phase of records as anybody else below. 
    Indeed -- indeed if what you say then it's our duty to say whether there was any traversable or any real so-called fundamental right involved.

    Well --

    I don't --

    -- and we must send it back to the judges (Inaudible). 
    Now, with another goal and case comes back here about two years from now.
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1630.449" stopTime="1646.867">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    Well, I am all for the prompt disposition of this case, Your Honor. 
    But all I say is that I -- unfortunately, we felt that the issue on certiorari was based upon the issues that was decided by the Court of Appeals and that's the issue we've tried to present it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1646.867" stopTime="1658.787">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But there was a lot of talk in the Court of Appeals. 
    They each got interested and there are great big issues. 
    Judges like lawyers like to be with great big issues.

    Mr. Quinn O'connell 
    Well, at least that -- it's that great big issue that we were here trying to decide -- have you people decide, and unfortunately, we have not briefed the other issue on the merits and we feel --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1668.535" stopTime="1703.696">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Voice Overlap) found the issue that Judge Fahy suggests which I agree. 
    What we would say was this, whether the record as it is with the supplement that Judge Fahy was unaware off when he wrote second opinion, sufficient to justify the findings that there was an excuse of the delay and then that forces us, does it not, to reach the question is to whether an excusable delay even would be sufficient to justify 2255 hearing.
speaker="quinn_oconnell" startTime="1703.696" stopTime="1706.170">
    Mr. Quinn O'connell

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Why wouldn't -- why weren't those affidavits there -- they were in physically existence?

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Voice Overlap) on the fact that Judge Fahy is a very competent judge. 
    He said this, in his petition for rehearing, Hodges brings to our attention that in earlier proceedings in this Court, he sought to supplement the record on appeal to show why he had failed to appeal (Inaudible). 
    The significance of this showing was not urged in briefs and arguments. 
    The hearing was led to the opinion of December 30th, 1959. 
    That's the one Judge Fahy had previously (Voice Overlap).
