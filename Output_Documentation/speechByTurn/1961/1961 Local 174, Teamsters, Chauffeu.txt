    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of this Court. 
    Your Honors, will remember that this is a case based on a strike to force the reinstatement of a discharged employee who five months after the strike, it was determined by arbitration to have been unsatisfactory in his service to his employer. 
    I would like to address my remarks this morning toward the contract aspect on which the court below based its opinion in its judgment.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Mr. Hoague, I would like to have you at some time in the argument, discuss the question of whether or not this judgment doesn't rest on two bases, (1) tort and particularly, that is the face of the case which for me is troublesome.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    You do it in your own way.
speaker="francis_hoague" startTime="100.058" stopTime="360.527">
    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    The -- I think I'll go to the contract and come back to the tort because there is a certain amount of interrelationship between them. 
    We start of with the realization that the heart core of both the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts is Congress' faith in the process of collective bargaining. 
    They felt that if unions were protected in organizing and collective-bargaining was made available to them by law that the free flow of commerce would be eventually fostered by the results. 
    The Congress did not make any effort to -- they were not interested in what the results of collective bargaining were in the sense of what the terms, the substantive terms of the contract would be. 
    They felt that that was up to the parties whether the contract resulted in terms that were harsh or easy, or for the employer or for the union or the employees was a matter of their relative bargaining strength of the justice of -- with which they were able to bargain at the table, and that was left to the parties. 
    In other words, in looking at the contract from the -- with the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts in mind, the intent of the parties was the matter -- was the thing that should govern rather than some preconceived notions of Congress as to what should be in the contract. 
    This of course does not apply to the closed shop provision which is outright, but as to the other terms, that was up to the parties. 
    So in looking at the contract, we try to carry on -- out the intent of the parties and try to ascertain what the intent was from a realistic standpoint. 
    It also was obvious -- it is obvious from the congressional reports that Congress was well aware of the very common use of the no-strike clause expressed in contracts. 
    It certainly -- all surveys show that most -- the great majority of contracts contained, expressed no-strike clauses. 
    It was also -- the history shows that Congress considered that the no-strike clause would be included in the contract or excluded from a contract as a result of collective bargaining. 
    They hoped that the no-strike clause would be included in a contract because that would normally lead to industrial fees, but it was to be included or excluded as a result of bargaining. 
    Our prime objection, our sort of basic objection to the judgment of the court below is that the court was unwilling to look to the intent of the parties in the contract. 
    They were unwilling to give sway -- full sway to the process of collective-bargaining where they felt that the contract should contain a strike prohibition, a no-strike clause, they attributed a strike prohibition to the contract without regard -- without regard to whether a no-strike provision was to be implied from a contract. 
    They state that expressly. 
    They say it is not necessary to imply a strike prohibition.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="360.527" stopTime="363.392">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    The contracts had an arbitration clause.
speaker="francis_hoague" startTime="363.392" stopTime="464.968">
    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    I'd like to come to that little later, Your Honor. 
    I think that's a very important part. 
    Now, with respect to our position is that strike prohibitions are not to be imported to a contract or not to be attributed to a contract unless they are to be found in the intent of the contract from a realistic standpoint. 
    We -- many times it has been said that the arbitration provision is the quid pro quo of the no-strike clause or -- it's generally stated the other way, that the no-strike clause is the quid pro quo of the arbitration provision, and this is a proper statement when there is no strike provision and there's no arbitration provision. 
    It -- or when talking about the subjects to be negotiated at the bargaining table, one is very frequently the quid pro quo of the other. 
    On the other hand, in looking at a contract to determine whether a no-strike provision should be implied, it certainly is improper to say where there is an arbitration provision, a no-strike provision will be implied. 
    In the first place, if that so, fairness and logic would say when there is a no strike provision and there's no arbitration provision, we will imply an arbitration provision and yet nobody would say that. 
    The --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I'm looking at it realistically, Mr. Hoague. 
    Of what value is an arbitration clause if either party can use its economic power in defiance of the arbitration clause?
speaker="francis_hoague" startTime="481.691" stopTime="501.146">
    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    A great deal of good in -- by having it in there, it -- people will -- the parties will resort to arbitration and do commonly resort to arbitration without a no-strike provision. 
    This sets up the arbitration procedure.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="501.146" stopTime="505.208">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But they could do it if they didn't have one, didn't they?
speaker="francis_hoague" startTime="505.208" stopTime="582.053">
    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    Yes, but they'd have to setup the procedure. 
    This is -- this is something that has been worked out in advance just like what's the point of having a grievance procedure short of arbitration, people can go to arbitration you say. 
    Well, people normally do use a grievance procedure before they go to arbitration because it's been setup there, even though it's not required to. 
    Even though they can say you're not interested in a preliminary grievance procedure. 
    The -- I can -- there's a very -- there is undoubtedly something very attractive about saying, “When there's an arbitration provision, necessarily, there is a strike prohibition.” 
    I submit that this frustrates the intent of the parties when the parties decide that there is not -- that they will not put in a no-strike provision. 
    The intent should govern regardless of the attractiveness of a -- implied a no-strike -- a strike provision implied in law rather than in fact.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="582.053" stopTime="608.588">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you saying that if you have nearly an arbitration provision or an arbitration procedure, no more than that, that is equivalent as though they didn't say the foregoing arbitration procedure does not surrender the right to strike and it is conceded, of course, the right to strike you deserve. 
    That's what you're saying aren't you?
speaker="francis_hoague" startTime="608.588" stopTime="609.045">
    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    You're stating --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="609.045" stopTime="625.514">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Not merely that there's an implication that there shouldn't be a strike, but there's an implication by not having a specific no-strike provision, you explicitly, for all practical purposes, it's what's written to the contract.
speaker="francis_hoague" startTime="625.514" stopTime="685.077">
    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    I think that the case of United States Steel Corporation against Nichols has -- is -- raises a situation that is applicable here. 
    In that case, the ‘shoe is on the other foot. 
    The employer was -- employee was suing his employer to -- for damages because he was discharged -- he was retired at the age of 65 and he said that the collective bargaining agreement did not reserve to the employer the right to discharge him at 65. 
    Actually, the agreement said nothing about it. 
    And -- well they -- the court for the Sixth Circuit Court properly said that is something that isn't dealt with, and therefore its right back where it would be, the situation is just as if there had been no contract in this respect.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="772.073" stopTime="790.686">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, then I go back to my question. 
    There must be some implied -- some implication that 65 is a cause for discharge. 
    Now that might be -- that might be -- has involved a college or university where it's rather a general rule to retire people at 65.

    Or surgeons, if he was a surgeon, I could see the implication there, but what implication is there that we haven't yet arrived at the Court where 65 is against to the -- suspend -- suspend the individual.
speaker="francis_hoague" startTime="807.704" stopTime="828.564">
    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    Well, this is one of the allegations was that he was -- he was still able to handle his job and therefore he was not being discharged for a cause and they said to the court -- and I think quite properly said, “Since this wasn't covered in the agreement, it should be left the way it was in the -- it would be in the absence of the agreement,” and I submit that the same thing should be done here.

    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In my brief, I cite the Bureau of National Affairs. 
    A study that was made, page 29 of my brief which showed -- 28 -- that from a 1957 survey -- four of -- it surveyed 400 representative contracts and found that 89% of them contained some form of expressed no-strike agreement, 37% provided an absolute ban on strikes, 52% were conditioned on various internal procedures or events.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="900.019" stopTime="902.731">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It is a constant source of bargaining there.

    Constantly, yes, Your Honor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="904.608" stopTime="909.931">

    And it's the question of arbitration as a constant source of bargaining.
speaker="francis_hoague" startTime="909.931" stopTime="932.300">
    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    I think that can be said too, yes. 
    And Your Honor will remember in Lewis against Benedict Coal Company, in the Mead case, Teamsters against Mead, they had a no-strike provision and bargained it away to eliminate it.

    That's constantly -- to have constantly bargained on that subject and put them in. 
    They have constantly bargained on the subject of arbitration and put that in, and you say that from that, it would -- you have argued that it would be a practical amendment of the contract to imply the existence of something which is well known in the bargaining field and is (Inaudible) guarded against as -- given they have the right to strike.

    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    I think that's particularly true Mr. Justice Black, in view of the fact the if we turn to page 208 of the record, there is the arbitration provision and it starts off with the first paragraph which refers to the arbitration as to the interpretation of this agreement. 
    And Your Honors will notice that the last sentences said, “It is further agreed by both parties hereto that --”

    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    208, “That during such arbitration, there shall be no suspension of work. 
    That is a no-strike provision as to arbitration of an interpretative issue.

   Argument of Stuart G. Oles
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="1478.965" stopTime="1528.433">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    First, let me address the Court on the issue which counsel for petitioner asserted yesterday is so clearly in his favor as to require no discussion in which he has suited the action of the word by not discussing it. 
    This is the old issue of preemption, an area which this Court has declared to be wrapped in Delphic Mystery. 
    Now briefly, this is whether the rule in the Garmon case applied here to deprive the courts of the State of Washington of initial jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case at least insofar as it related to tort. 
    Now that rule in the Garmon case may be simply stated as I understand that case --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1528.433" stopTime="1533.041">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You don't mean that the Garmon case leaves it in Delphic Mystery?
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="1533.041" stopTime="1534.538">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    Pardon Mr. Justice Black.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1534.538" stopTime="1538.927">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You don't mean that the Garmon left it in Delphic Mystery?
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="1538.927" stopTime="1544.384">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    It -- well, this is a question that I would rather leave for this Court to decide sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1544.384" stopTime="1546.191">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How -- decided by what?
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="1546.191" stopTime="1698.622">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    At least as applied here, I believe that the rule is clear, and I think that rule, and I say that in humility, I think the rule is that whenever a state court has before it, whether in tort or in contract, condone which is either clearly or fairly to be assumed to be, or arguably it's protected by Section 7 or condemned as an unfair labor practice by Section 8 of the Taft-Hartley law, that the state court should in that instance defer to the initial jurisdiction of the specialized tribunal of Congress created to deal with these matters, the National Labor Relations Board. 
    Now, we don't believe that counsel is very serious in asserting that their conduct in this matter was condemned by Section 8 as an unfair labor practice. 
    They have nowhere asserted just what section -- what part of Section 8 they're violating. 
    I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked counsel that question directly yesterday and said just what part do you mean? 
    He received no answer and we have received no answer throughout these proceedings. 
    We think, however, if there is any thrust of their argument at all, it relates to their contention that their conduct was arguably protected by the mutual aid and protection language of Section 7 of the Act. 
    So this is the question to which I would like to direct my first remarks. 
    I think that by reviewing a few of the facts of this case, it will become apparent that at the time this matter was presented to the state court, and the state court was asked to defer to the initial jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, it was not a matter that could be fairly assume to be or even arguably conduct protected by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. 
    And moreover, it is our position that this statement is based on facts which had already been found and stipulated to before the state court was asked to defer to the alleged jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. 
    Now, the facts have been pretty well outlined from time to time but some of them have been overlooked.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1698.622" stopTime="1700.982">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And you say stipulated?
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="1700.982" stopTime="1747.233">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    I'm about to document why I say that. 
    Lucas of course is a wholesale flour dealer with three or four employees, Local 174, and I think it‘s important to remember, it's an enormous local union with 400 or 500 such contracts such as we are dealing with here. 
    Collective bargaining in the sense that it is being used by counsel is not a very descriptive term of what goes on here. 
    The Exhibit 1, which is the contract, will be shown to be a mimeographed piece of paper, with the blank for the name of the employer, and the collective bargaining consists of signing and staying in business or not signing and staying out of business. 
    There is no other choice presented or suggested.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1747.233" stopTime="1749.230">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Everyone signed the same agreement.
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="1749.230" stopTime="1762.182">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    I assume that some of the big dealers in this business actually negotiate this contract, I don't know. 
    I only know that Lucas Flour Company has never asked to negotiate, nor is there any suggestion in the record that it does.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1762.182" stopTime="1765.767">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would that have any effect on the legal question?
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="1765.767" stopTime="1826.345">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    I think, Your Honor, in a general way, all of the facts and background are a substratum of any decision and I think that we have to face the facts as this Court dealt with it. 
    And specifically, I think that we are also concerned with whether this union acted, acted in such a way as to violate the National Labor Relations Act, and acted as they can in good faith. 
    I think the relative bargaining power does have some applications. 
    This is particularly true, Mr. Justice Black, because counsel has just finished an argument based on what he said is the intent of the parties to this contract. 
    Now, I submit that the intent must be found from the objective instrument before us in the light of the labor policy enunciated by this and other courts, not upon any actual implied or imputed intent which actually the parties never had at all.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1826.345" stopTime="1830.003">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, there's not any challenge to the fact if the contract was made, does it?
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="1830.003" stopTime="1834.073">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    None at all, none at all Your Honor. 
    We are concerned with what it means.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1834.073" stopTime="1835.422">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's right.
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="1835.422" stopTime="2054.571">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    And when we're concerned of what it means, we could as in the case of Congress, search back to the congressional record to see what they said. 
    Here, of course, I'm submitting that we do not have that avenue of research open to us. 
    Now here, Melvin Welsch is the name of this employee, he had been employed by Lucas about two years. 
    He was incompetent, so incompetent as to be dangerous not only to himself but to the company and his fellow employees. 
    The union would not let him be fired, not just on this occasion but the record shows on numerous occasions prior to this date when the company tried to fire this man. 
    The union said you fire him and we'll close you down. 
    This in spite of the fact that the union had, as I submit, imposed a contract upon this employer which reserved to the employer the right to discharge unsatisfactory employees. 
    Now all of these of course is why the employer in the ultimate act to discharge hemmed and hawed considerably, before reaching the decisive decision only when the union business agent called him up as the records shows, and said either you take him back to work we're going “shut your joint down” as the record indicates without dispute. 
    Now, it was this tyrannical conduct which finally triggered the discharge which led to this strike. 
    Not because the other employees were unhappy, the undisputed testimony is that the other employees agreed with management but Welsch was incompetent and dangerous, but nonetheless they were called off, they stayed home and the company was shut down, there were no deliveries allowed in or out. 
    In fact the Vice President of this local and its principal business agent personally chased one of the officers of this company when he tried to load a few sacks of flour into his automobile and deliver them about to town, chased him around town until he got lost in the traffic. 
    Why such enthusiasm to keep this one incompetent employee when 400 or 500 such contracts exist in the Seattle area with this vast local. 
    I don't think we'll ever know the interior answer to that although counsel has urged at every level that their motives were pure. 
    I do know that there was evidence undisputed that perhaps this company, the Lucas Flour Company had offended the union, because it had employed a man called Lawrence Anderson who had the (Inaudible) to be one of the group who are seeking an audit of the books of the union in a totally separate action. 
    And although he was a member in good standing, the union tried to get him fired. 
    And the union -- the company would not fire this man simply because he had a quarrel with the union officials, and this very possibly is why the Court decided at all levels that the union did not act for mutual aid and protection as a matter of subjective motive. 
    As I shall say in a moment, I don't think subjective motive has anything to do with it, but the counsel so asserted it was their principal defense at the trial of this case. 
    Now continuing our chronology of what occurred, and here, I'm trying to lay before this Court, the pictures that actually was presented to the state courts, the suit was brought in May 1958, immediately after the strike began, and there were various proceedings in and out of court, pleadings filed affidavits.

speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="2063.543" stopTime="2100.885">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    Very frankly, Mr. Justice Brennan, we commence the suit under the practice in the State of Washington which permits you to state a claim without identifying the theory in which you are bringing it which I think is also the principle of federal practice modernly. 
    Very candidly, we hope we would win on one ground at least. 
    To our happiness, we won on both, and have there been some third ground, we would have asserted that at the time of the trial. 
    All we pleaded I think you will find is the facts and hope they would bring us within some recognizable area of the law.

    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    They did not raise it early enough because factually, the matter had already been decided by stipulation by the time they raised it.

    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    You see, this is why I think it's necessary to trace the chronology. 
    The suit was in May following the strike immediately. 
    The Court issued an injunction which was conditioned upon the party's arbitrating. 
    The union in its response to the action for an injunction, asserted as its prime defense that this matter should be arbitrated, not asserting that it had demanded such, but simply saying it should be. 
    The employer did not disagree, and accordingly, the matter was in affect agreed by both parties that the injunction would be dependent upon an arbitration taking place.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2254.332" stopTime="2257.734">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I take if the Court had before it the agreement which included --

    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    It had --

    -- which included an obligation of it.
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="2261.074" stopTime="2329.040">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    Correct. 
    And the court felt, the trial court at that level which is -- this of course is not the case from which an appeal, not the proceeding from which an appeal is taken, but the arbitration came about because in the affidavits in connection with an injunction, it appeared to the Court that there was an arbitration clause. 
    The injunction was granted. 
    The strike stopped and the parties stipulated in addition to what the court had ordered that there would in fact be an arbitration. 
    That stipulation is set forth in the record. 
    And specifically at page 210 of the record, it says -- and this is what the party has stipulated to. 
    “It is further stipulated and agreed that the decision of the three arbitrators when reached shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto,” and it goes on to say that if they -- only two agree, the decision of the two shall be final and binding. 
    So that in September of 1958, it was stipulated between the parties that the issues on the merits would be decided.

    That answer is very simple Mr. Justice Black, because there was nothing prospectively to be concerned with at that stage. 
    Mr. Welsch, the employee in question had already decided to retire and taken retirement before this stipulation was entered into. 
    This is specifically decided by the Board of Arbitrators.

    I don't think there's any question, but that would have been an unfair labor practice. 
    They asked the Court, however, to decide this. 
    They asked the arbitrators to decide this. 
    They argued this matter and presented 180 pages of testimony on this issue to a Board of Arbitrators.

    My inquiry is this, if at the time that the -- you started to enjoin this trial, they've claimed that there was an unfair labor practice which had brought this, could the jurisdiction of the Board be escaped to pass upon -- its preemption be refused or rejected because six months later, there was an arbitration which decided the facts in a way that the Board might or might not have decided.

    Now, could -- even assuming, assuming that if omnisciently Garmon too has been foreseen by counsel and has been raised in the pleading, and therefore, the matter should arguably have gone to the full. 
    What I'm asking is this question. 
    Could counsel by free willing stipulation or agreement not change the course of the litigation which arose in 1959?
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="2882.839" stopTime="2886.649">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    Well, of course the only thing that the parties, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, can stipulate --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2886.649" stopTime="2888.820">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't think that conferred jurisdiction, I understand that.
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="2888.820" stopTime="2890.357">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    You can't stipulate jurisdiction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2890.357" stopTime="2899.390">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, no, no, I understand that, but couldn't facts or the ascertainment of fact have change, which changed the course of the litigation?
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="2899.390" stopTime="3122.463">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    This is precisely our position that by the time the matter was presented to the Superior Court of King County, State of Washington, at that point, the facts had already been conclusively stipulated and decided. 
    And those facts as conclusively stipulated and decided, did not present conduct which was arguably or could fairly be assumed to be a violation of or protected by the National Labor Relations Act. 
    That is why I started to quote what the Board of Arbitrators decided. 
    The Board of Arbitrators decided that this man was unsatisfactory, that he was fired for that reason, that he was fired in good faith for that reason. 
    And I repeat, too often perhaps, that this had been stipulated too in advance, that the parties would be bound to these facts. 
    Therefore, by the time in May 1959, when for the first time they asserted that there was a lack of jurisdiction in the Superior Court of King County, the facts presented to them were not arguably or could fairly be assumed to be anything but what they had been stipulated to be. 
    This so issue before the trial court on the case which is now before this Court was damages. 
    How much money should the union have to pay this employer, for what, under the admitted facts was a breach of contract. 
    Now, there was another issue injected into it. 
    It was asserted by the union at the time of the trial as an additional defense that its motives were good. 
    Its subjective motives were good. 
    We objected with vigor on the ground that that was irrelevant. 
    And parenthetically, let me say that it's quite obviously is if you reverse the positions, supposing the Board of Arbitrators had decided this man was wrongfully discharged because he was not unsatisfactory and was not discharged for that reason, would it be a defense to Lucas Flour Company in a suit brought by Mr. Welsch for several months of lost wages that the employer thought the man was unsatisfactory? 
    Quite obviously not. 
    We are forced to deal with the objective intent of the parties under this contract and it was decided by the arbitrators that the man was unsatisfactory and dis – and discharged for that reason. 
    In any event, the Court heard the testimony on the motives and decided even that issue against the local saying, “As a matter of fact, its subjective motives were other than mutual aid and protection and then awarded damages.” 
    Stating in it's decision, as the record shows that actually, it shouldn't even heard the matter on the motives and that the only issue before had been damages. 
    And of course, it is our point that it was until after that memorandum decision of the trial court was issued that for the first time, this union said, “You don't have jurisdiction.” 
    The initial determination of the facts should go before the NLRB. 
    That's what they said and that's what they say now after they had lost at every level including the arbitration which they stipulated would be final, conclusive, and binding. 
    So it is simply our position that at the time they raised the question, there was no jurisdiction to defer it to. 
    It could not be initially deferred to a body which had no jurisdiction at all since the facts had already been decided. 
    Let me note here that --

    Mr. Oles, before you sit down, it occurred to me that here, unlike the freedom you have under the -- what you tell us as the Washington procedure, here in this case for us, you will have to differentiate between the contract and the tort claim so far as the 301 suability in a state court is considered.

    The counsel -- the only law that's applicable to this question and still talking about preemption for a moment and the tort claim is that the protection of Section 7 is withdrawn if the strike is in violation of a contract. 
    I note that counsel has stated it very well on page 18 of the petitioner's brief, citing authority.

    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    The answer to that, you will notice, does not raise any issue and the answer is found at page 11 of the record. 
    The answer sets forth –- no contention that there was lack of jurisdiction although presumably they now argue that this is the result of it. 
    They did not so argue with them. 
    Now -- what -- may I ask further, could the Washington Court be expected to do when this motion was presented to it? 
    All it really had decided is the damages were to be allowed. 
    Something which of course it cannot defer to the NLRB because the NLRB has no jurisdiction to award damages, it's not concerned with it. 
    Had this contention been made of the outset of the case conceivably? 
    Conceivably, have they shown that this was a matter arguably protected or fairly to be assumed to be conduct protected by Section 7. 
    At that stage, the Court might very well have deferred the jurisdiction to the NLRB, an action or a proceeding could have been initiated by the employer in the –- in the local office of the NLRB and perhaps if we convince the regional council, some sort of an injunction would be issued to stop the strike. 
    By the time this contention was raised, however, and for the first time in the Superior Court of King County, already the strike was over and was moot, the injunction was moot, the trial court so states at the outset, the facts had become agreed and stipulated. 
    The only matter that was left was damages. 
    The employer had no complaint to file at that point. 
    There was no unfair labor practice then being committed by the -– by the union. 
    The union has never asserted there was an unfair labor practice committed by the employer in those terms. 
    And certainly, did not so argue at the time of the trial of this case. 
    They are asking the State of Washington to defer to a tribunal which did not have and I don't see any way in which they could have obtained jurisdiction or heard the matter. 
    So, all I'm asserting is that they stipulated to wait any contention that factually, this matter could be fairly assumed or arguably protected by Section 7 of the Taft-Hartley Act. 
    Now there are other issues in this case and there's two I would like to dispose very quickly. 
    One is, was this protected or was this condemned by Section 8 and I've already I think answered that. 
    There is nothing in Section 8 of the Taft-Hartley Act which renders an unfair labor practice that which was done by the union in this instance. 
    They only raised this argument for the first time in the Supreme Court of the State of Washington where they said, as they have said here, “Our conduct was an unfair labor practice.” 
    But they haven't shown why or how. 
    And frankly, I can only do what the Supreme Court of the State of Washington does if you will review what they say since nothing is said in the briefs or in argument to support this contention. 
    The State of Washington Supreme Court prints in its entirety in the opinion the Section 8 of the Taft-Hartley Act, condemning certain unfair labor practices by the union. 
    It says, “Here they are. 
    We have read them. 
    We don't see anything remotely relating to the kind of conduct which is the subject of this suit.” 
    I don't know how anybody could arrive at a different conclusion in reading it. 
    Now, another argument or issue in this case on which I don't wish to spend any time is the question of whether they failed to exhaust the remedies below. 
    I merely reiterate to this Court what is obvious that there was available to this union, a petition for rehearing before all nine judges of the State Supreme Court of the State of Washington. 
    There is no urgency shown, no reason shown why they should not have taken that remedy. 
    I suspect in all deference and in some sympathy to counsel that very likely he overlooked it. 
    I don't know his reason. 
    I do know that it is no answer to say that it is a routine technicality which would have been futile. 
    Many of such petitions are granted. 
    It is no more futile than in, for instance a state which has intermediate appellate court, where the right to this –- to be heard before the Supreme Court of that State rest on discretionary power in a State's Supreme Court. 
    Surely, no applicant to this Court for certiorari could justifiably assert that it would be futile –- “I'm not likely to get it anyway,” and say, that the Court --

    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    The practice is that within 30 days after a department hears a case, that is a department consists of four judges plus the Chief Justice. 
    Within 30 days thereafter, a written petition for rehearing maybe filed with the Court asking that the matter be heard en banc that is before all nine judges. 
    Such a rehearing is automatically granted if the decision of the department was three to two. 
    It is sometimes granted when it was four to one. 
    And I understand about 4% of them are granted if it was five to zero as it was in this case. 
    I wouldn't concede that's futile, but I will admit that the chances were reasonably remote that it would have been granted. 
    But nonetheless, they fail to file such a petition.

    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    No opinion had been rendered. 
    I assume that they split two and three. 
    I'm guessing. 
    I would like to know which were the two and which were the three, but I don't know. 
    Now, let me turn if I may to the more serious question of breach of contract which is correctly been pinpointed here yesterday as an alternative ground for the upholding of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington either tort or contract supports the judgment. 
    Now, in the Dowd case which was argued yesterday, it was asserted by the petitioner that Section 301 deprives the state court of all jurisdictions over breaches of contract of collective bargaining agreements in interstate commerce. 
    And I can only say as to that since I haven't been asked to argue that case that I read its briefs and hardly accord with the brief filed by the Attorney General of the State of Wisconsin amicus curiae. 
    I feel compelled because the result in that case would have such an effect upon this one, they had one comment. 
    It was argued in that case with much bigger that Congress expressly grants state's jurisdiction over a federally created causes of action when this is intended. 
    And there he cited Section 303 of the Taft-Hartley Act. 
    I can only respond that this is because the substantive jurisdiction of state courts to try any federal offense derives any federally created cause of action, derives from Congress. 
    The right to try a suit for breach of contract in the State of Washington does not derive from Congress. 
    It is the historic jurisdiction of the states. 
    It is so ancient and so firmly established that surely it would require an expressed statement by Congress to the contrary, to deprive them of that jurisdiction, and this I think is a distinction in which if I may say with difference to counsel in that case should have been made. 
    And I make it now only because I sat camping at the bench in the corner listening to it. 
    Now, returning to argue with my own case rather than that one, here, the petitioner only argues that the Lincoln Mill's decision substituted federal common law for a state contract law. 
    And both sides, I noticed in the Dowd case, took the same position. 
    So I find myself one against four because I don't agree that that is what the Lincoln Mills case said at all. 
    That was a case brought in federal court under Section 301 which conferred jurisdiction substantively, remedially or procedurally makes no difference which in fact conferred jurisdiction upon federal courts to try breaches of collective bargaining agreements in interstate commerce. 
    It was a case of that sort and the issue before this Court. 
    And the issue which as I understand that was decided in this Court is to what law should govern that kind of a case. 
    There is no discussion in the Lincoln Mills' decision or in any of the opinions filed with it which states what law should be applied to a state court determining under its historic jurisdiction, the breaches of contract cases that come before it. 
    In other words, the Lincoln Mills case created -- said that Section 301 created not only a form, a new form, for such cases, but also a new remedy, a substantive remedy. 
    It said nothing at all as I read the decision of that court as to what the substantive law of contract was, nor that it should be applied by the states. 
    I can only note that the majority opinion in the Lincoln Mills case refers with approval to Judge Wyzanki's opinion in Massachusetts where that judge makes a very clear and very persuasive distinction between substantive remedial law and substantive contract law. 
    In any event, however, I suspect --

    -- some controversy about what's remediable.
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="4296.856" stopTime="4452.104">
    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    I gather there was in reading the opinion, Mr. Justice Black. 
    I'm only asserting that that case didn't -- what it did not hold, I'm reasonably certain of it. 
    And what it did not hold is what everybody seems to have agreed three counts in a row and that is that the State of Washington is bound to apply a federal common law in deciding cases involving breaches of contract before it if they fall in this area. 
    Now, whether this would be true or not, however, it does not have to be decided by this Court in this case. 
    It's probably entirely academic because when it is asserted boldly in the brief of the petitioner that the State of Washington here applied state contract law, I see no basis or authority for that assertion. 
    The Washington State Supreme Court as a matter of fact in this case cited no legal authority for its determination that there was a breach of contract. 
    It cites no scholars and no cases. 
    I think the Court of the State of Washington was rather outraged that it should be contended, seriously, that it is not a breach of contract to strike -- to require an employer not to exercise the duties or the rights which are expressly reserved to him. 
    In fact, the Court makes this rather clear. 
    I submit that some fine construction of the words of the arbitration provisions of the contract here in question can be and were argued at all levels of this case. 
    But if it is true as counsel says that he stipulates that there was a no-strike provision if the arbitration involved interpretation of the contract, then I must direct his attention to page 214 of the record before this Court where the arbitrators are speaking. 
    And this is what the arbitrators held. 
    It will be recalled and I quote, “That under the working agreement, the employer reserved the right to discharge any man in his employees if his work is not satisfactory.” 
    The Board feels that a proper interpretation of that clause is that the right of discharge is preserved in the case where the man's services are not satisfactory to his employer but that the right must be invoked reasonably and in good faith. 
    During oral argument, counsel for the parties virtually agreed that such should be the interpretation although disagreeing as to its application under the facts in the record.

    Did the arbitrators interpret it? 
    I haven't looked at it carefully as I should. 
    Did they interpret the contract meaning, any part of its meaning, that the right to strike would be full borne?

    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    No. 
    They -- that question was not presented to them, Mr. Justice Black because it was moot by the time it came to them. 
    The strike was over and nobody contemplated it would be resumed.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4497.724" stopTime="4503.866">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It was moot so far as future responsibility or consequences was observed.

    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    Yes, you're correct in correcting me, Mr. Justice Black because they did have before them still the rightness or wrongness of what occurred in May 1958 and that they decided. 
    That's what was really before it and it involved interpretation -- argued interpretation of the contract and if Mr. Hoague's theory of what this contract means, and that it implies a no-strike clause only in one instance where interpretation is involved, then by his own theory, he clearly has a no-strike clause. 
    But obviously, the State Supreme Court of the State of Washington relied on no such narrow ground, and I would not desire too either, because had the Supreme Court of the State of Washington expressly followed such federal common law as there is in this area, that is the decisions of the various Courts of Appeal that have dealt with this matter. 
    It would find that with the exception of one case, cited by counsel in his brief and I believe in our own with only one exception every Court of Appeals to which this matter has been brought has decided that under these circumstances, this conduct constitutes a breach of contract. 
    Now, I have cited this --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4574.302" stopTime="4575.268">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Which conduct?
speaker="stuart_g_oles" startTime="4575.268" stopTime="4575.735">

    Pardon?

    Which conduct, the strike?

    Mr. Stuart G. Oles 
    The strike to force an employer to forego the exercise of a right reserved to him in the contract even though there is no expressed no-strike clause. 
    And those cases are collected beginning at page 13 of our brief and there's an extensive American annotated ALR citation, a very recent one on the subject, and we submit that it expresses what its common reason. 
    And certainly, it's common law if there is such a thing in this area as federal common law. 
    If we have to decide that there is, this is it.

    The Supreme Court of Washington says that the opening part of its opinion that it does not view that Lincoln Mills case deprived it of jurisdiction to decide the issue before it. 
    That it only decided that, as I've stated what I think it held, and that is that it gave a substantive as well as purely form creating influence to the law. 
    But it felt as I feel that it did not deprive the State Supreme Court of authority to decide a breach of contract case before it.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Oh yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4683.018" stopTime="4860.208">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You're quite right, Your Honor. 
    Let me add this word on this subject because it -- I think it should be said. 
    Are we going to hold that it is the law that a union can agree to a $3 wage to the employees, sign it solemnly, and the next morning call out its people and put up pickets demanding $4? 
    Because this is exactly what this local is saying, it has the right to do without breaching the contract. 
    Can it do so even though there is written into its contract an arbitration clause which says that matters in dispute shall be arbitrated? 
    Incidentally, there's been some argument at all levels of this case that after all, the employer didn't demand arbitration to start with. 
    Well, of course, all that the employer was doing was doing what he had an expressed right to do and do it to discharge a man. 
    There's nothing in the labor contract that says you shall never discharge a man or I suppose sell some flour without arbitration. 
    This reaches to absurdity. 
    The point is that the union exercise economic power, overwhelming economic power, conclusive economic power in this instance to force an employer to do something or to refrain from doing something which he had a clear right to do. 
    Or for that matter, could an employer agree to pay $3 an hour and cut the wages to $2. 
    Now, if the man wouldn't agree, lock him out. 
    Because again, this is exactly what this local says it can do without breaching contract. 
    Now, I recognize that this Court is confronted daily with profound and difficult conceptual problems particularly in this empty blackness of jurisdictional lines to be drawn. 
    I recognize that this Court has to deal with difficult relationships, but I also and reminded constantly in sitting here that this is the Supreme Court, the Highest Court. 
    And we do have before us a question of something that is fairly fundamental, a right or wrong. 
    Unless the Supreme Court of the State of Washington is upheld in this matter, in this case, a real and genuine injustice has been done. 
    We are holding that in effect, this respondent has no remedy and no solution, unless he had what he did take by arbitration and subsequently in the courts. 
    In other words, it is the duty of course of this Court to use its phrase to elucidate in litigation these difficult areas. 
    It has of course also a higher duty. 
    And we submit that in this case, it points very clearly to doing justice and equity in this case and thereby affirming this rather small and perhaps to this union a rather insignificant little judgement. 
    Thank you.

    Now, the obvious purpose for this was to raise the preemption issue and under our practice there, we allege -- at that time, allege the facts and not law -- if we had alleged that jurisdiction was in the Labor Board, it would have been stricken as a conclusion of law. 
    This third affirmative answer raised that issue and in the memorandum of authorities submitted to the trial court at the -- on the first day of trial which is not in the printed record but is in the unprinted record, we, as the third issue --

    I quote the much quoted thing if this conduct does not fall within the prohibitions of Section 8, it may fall within the purposes of Section -- protection of Section 7.

    Mr. Francis Hoague

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5210.519" stopTime="5220.763">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the quality of the discharge is on whether the strike was a protected activity, doesn't it?

    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    Not unless it's a -- it was a discriminatory unfair labor practice strike. 
    Every economic strike is to force an employer to do something that he has a right not to do.

    That he was --

    Suppose there had been, suppose they said after the litigation got underway, we agree that they had a right to discharge him, we agree he need not taken back, but we strike so that you should take him back.

    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    Yes, and that is -- that is on the matter of Mr. Oles' suggestion as to them making an agreement for a $3 wage and going out right to the next day.

    This was not a repudiation of the contract, but was an effort to enforce the terms of the contract which were --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5354.580" stopTime="5376.181">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It all depends because there was a provision in the contract that they may discharge a properly dischargeable employee.

    Because, once the Board has jurisdiction, that's been usable, this -- that must persist through all its synergy.

    Mr. Hoague, if you would like about three minutes to sum up your argument, to point to any other portion of your brief, you may do so.

    Mr. Francis Hoague 
    It's very kind of you Your Honor, I would. 
    The -- in the case decided by this Court, National Labor Relations Board against Mackay Radio Company, there was a strike to enforce a contract, to get it, to obtain a contract. 
    The -- this Court held that -- and the strikers were fired immediately. 
    This Court held that the wisdom of the strike was not an issue. 
    It's a protected activity whether it is wise or unwise. 
    That is by the Taft-Hartley Act is left to the parties to determine what action they will take, and I submit that this is a proper way. 
    Perhaps the strike was unwise from hindsight to -- I guess -- I guess it was. 
    At that time, it did not seem so unwise, nevertheless, that is a concerted activity, and the cases that I have cited on page 17 of my brief were all cases where the union went out on a strike to get a man reinstated. 
    Fairly foolishly they went out on a strike and still they held that that was a concerted activity and was protected by the Act. 
    And that the strikers could not be fired. 
    They could be replaced as Your Honors know. 
    But short of replacement, they could not be fired and they were reinstated. 
    And this has been the rule all through it. 
    That being so, the issue as to -- the issue as to whether this was a protected activity which doesn't come down to just the item of the -- that was determined by the Arbitration Board but comes down to what the union had reason to believe was happening. 
    In other words, did the -- did the employer mislead the union into thinking that they had to go out on strike and the arbitrators stated this and the lower court, the trial court stated that they were so mislead, that was an issue that should have been decided not by the trial court, but by the Labor Board. 
    Thank you Your Honor.
