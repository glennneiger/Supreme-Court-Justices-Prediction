    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    At the time of adjournment yesterday, it was manifest to counsel that apparently because of his own inaptness or perhaps too great of -- familiarity with the problem that he had failed to state to the court in a clear and distinct manner his position in this case, in connection with his motion to dismiss, counsel had stated that he thought it was a simple question perhaps because he deals with it quite daily and day in and day out and quite often in fact twice more this week, so with the Court's permission in a few minutes remaining, I'll try to present it, perhaps, I hope a little bit more clear than I -- clearly than I did yesterday.

    Well, Mr. Harp, if it just for me, you may go on to your other argument, I've read your -- I've read your brief and I know your position. 
    If you would like to state it, it's alright, but I don't like to take your -- take your time for it, unless you want to do it.

    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    It is the respondent's position that the petitioner in his petition for writ of habeas corpus failed to state sufficient factual grounds to justify the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond in issuing a writ of habeas corpus for a hearing returnable to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond wherein the previous judicial proceeding took place of which the petitioner complained. 
    This is because the petitioner failed to state in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus that when he requested counsel at the time of his recidivist proceedings that he was indigent at that particular point. 
    That is the point I was trying very desperately --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="112.711" stopTime="113.418">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="113.418" stopTime="264.076">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    -- to make on yesterday. 
    Now, the only thing which is before this Court for its consideration is this record which contains the petition for the writ of habeas corpus in two exhibits appended thereto. 
    That is the only thing that this Court has to rule upon. 
    An examination of the petition reveals that there is a bare allegation that this man was denied counsel. 
    There are no other facts alleged. 
    He does not contend he was indigent. 
    He does not contend that he was denied any federal constitutional right. 
    He does not contend that he was unfamiliar with court proceedings. 
    He does not suggest anything in connection with the proceeding that counsel could have done for him. 
    He does not allege that any of his previous convictions were unlawful or illegal or constitutionally invalid. 
    Indeed, in fact, he'd meant before this -- been through this proceeding once before as a second time offender in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. 
    Now, on that bare allegation, it is our position that he has failed to state a case. 
    My learned friend, Professor Meador, has suggested in his reply brief that it is unnecessary for the petitioner to avert facts in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 
    This is contrary to Virginia law as I pointed out yesterday in connection with Morris versus Smyth which is found on pages 3 and 11 our -- of our brief and Penn versus Smith which is found on page 12 of our brief. 
    In both of these cases, the Court said that the petitioner must state facts to the respond -- the petitioner rather in this Court has suggested that under Tomkins versus Missouri, and Williams versus Kaiser, that it is unnecessary for the petitioner to state that he was indigent at the time he requested counsel. 
    An examination of the opinion of this Court in those cases, opinions rather, reveals that the rule in Missouri is and it has been so stated by these highest court in the State of Missouri that if a man alleges that he was tried without counsel or was denied counsel, the highest court in that state has held that it will assume, that it will assume that he was indigent at the time he requested counsel. 
    There is no such rule in Virginia. 
    There is no case that says this in Virginia.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you suggesting in the -- are you suggesting that this case turns on a rule or law of local practice that there -- that this case turns on the state ground that certain requirements are made by Virginia for pleading or particularity of pleading in this kind of a case?
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="285.957" stopTime="340.432">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter that you have stated my proposition very succinctly sir. 
    That's exactly it. 
    It not only turns on that ground, on a state ground, but I know of no federal case and there may be many that I have not found, but I know of no federal case that says that you can come in and say, “Now, judge, I want a lawyer appointed for me.” 
    I know of none. 
    You've got to state that you're indigent first. 
    Now, there may be a limited number of situations as you Mr. Chief Justice pointed out during the course of my argument in Newsom case where a man has plenty of money, but can't get a lawyer but that is not applicable to this particular situation. 
    We are suggesting sir that the petition on its face even in this Court fails to allege sufficient grounds. 
    Now, as the cases progress --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that isn't -- that isn't the question.

    Well, suppose in denying it, they said, “We think the allegations are inadequate under our requirements.

speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="368.071" stopTime="370.183">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't see why you mix it up as to what the requirement on the federal law is because of the several other considerations come into play.

    That is true sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="377.483" stopTime="400.745">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if they just said that, this doesn't set forth then we have to decide whether the procedural ground claimed or avowed by the Supreme Court of Virginia is a procedural ground that the State may take or is an evasion of -- of a federal right. 
    That would be the question.
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="400.745" stopTime="417.316">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    Well, I would say this to the Court.

    -- assume that he has alleged that he was indigent and was denied counsel, that's all. 
    On those bare allegations, it would appear to me that he would not have alleged sufficient grounds even then. 
    As he had said, “I was indigent, I am ignorant --”
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="442.532" stopTime="457.466">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Sufficient grounds under the Due Process Clause or sufficient grounds under the requirement of Virginia procedure (Inaudible) or appellate that he hasn't made out of that more is required as the matter of allegation.
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="457.466" stopTime="462.369">

    This is a habeas corpus grounded on the fact that at the time an enhanced sentence was imposed, it was imposed on the conditions that deprived him of a claim, constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment, is that right?

    No sir. 
    I don't think that I am -- I haven't asked. 
    But, if it pleases the Court, I deal with this subject as I said before, ad infinitum and the fact of the matter is that this Court determined in the Newsom case last term and in that case, the same situation occurred, it was the same identical judge. 
    He has not done this since the Chewning case, because the Chewning case came after the Newsom case --

    I'd like to ask you two questions. 
    Forgive me. 
    What are we reviewing here? 
    Are we reviewing Judge Young or the Supreme Court of Virginia? 
    I'd like to ask both of you and Mr. Meador when he gets on his feet again.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So therefore (Voice Overlap) therefore, what is relevant to our purpose is the legal significance of that determination and not what Judge Young did. 
    We're referring (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    But if I might finish that sentence I started sir, you're reviewing as I understand it, the decision of Judge -- of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in connection with the denial, the bare denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus, that's what you're reviewing. 
    In a petition form, the petition itself forms a basis for the whole proceeding.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1049.857" stopTime="1066.275">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, alright, of course (Inaudible) it must have been in some pleading on the basis of which some judgment was entered, loose as pleadings are these days and generally be granted as they seem to be but people just wanted to abstract justice but that's the basis of this decision.
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="1066.275" stopTime="1066.585">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    That is correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1066.585" stopTime="1119.183">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's why we're here. 
    This case was brought here not from the Circuit Court of -- of Richmond, it's brought here from the Supreme Court of Virginia. 
    Maybe it was brought here improperly. 
    I don't know. 
    I haven't thought about it. 
    But if we're reviewing the Supreme Court of Virginia, then what we are reviewing is that judgment and therefore we must speculate, and if that judgment can rest fairly, not speculatively, but fairly on the state ground and (Inaudible) though the Supreme Court had written in the state ground. 
    The other thing I want to ask you before you sit down, you're about to sit down and you haven't said a thing, at least nothing that I have heard on the assumption that all this argument thus far is -- is decided against you. 
    You haven't said anything on the merits on the assumption that Chewning was an indigent when he was -- when he got his enhanced sentence. 
    Did you -- have you said anything on that subject?

speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="1143.763" stopTime="1164.779">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    My brief answer if I may make it to that question sir is that the bare -- assuming that he was denied counsel, assuming he was indigent, he has not alleged any other facts which would indicate that he was denied that he's rather -- that this particular proceeding, under the recidivist statute which is not --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1164.779" stopTime="1169.570">

    Mr. Daniel J. Meador 
    The Court states that the record had been materially considered and inspected.

    My next point and I would simply --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1319.389" stopTime="1323.244">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It was a dismissal on the merits or an opinion which discussed the merits.

    Mr. Daniel J. Meador 
    Yes sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1324.121" stopTime="1326.998">

speaker="daniel_j_meador" startTime="1326.998" stopTime="1327.369">
    Mr. Daniel J. Meador 
    Correct.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1327.369" stopTime="1335.404">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you understand it's our duty to try to find out that the Supreme Court of Virginia had a view that was trying to conceal from us?
speaker="daniel_j_meador" startTime="1335.404" stopTime="1397.574">
    Mr. Daniel J. Meador 
    No sir. 
    I do think it's open to this Court though to look and to see if there is any state ground, tenable state ground adequate to support this judgment wholly independent of the federal claim and I would say there is none and I would say the respondent here is resting with ghost so to speak. 
    He has not cited a single decision, a single rule of court, a single statute in Virginia which requires an explicit allegation of indigency in a habeas corpus petition. 
    And against that, we do have the view generally taken of pleadings by the Virginia Court that we take us through not only to the facts which are brought in the petition but facts which may be fairly inferred from those avowed and I would say indigency is one of them in this case and this Court itself has said so in several different cases. 
    So in substance, I say, you search the record, you search the law of Virginia, we find no state ground which can support this judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals affirming the dismissal of the petition.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well how -- how can you do that if the Court -- when this Court dismisses something and doesn't get rid, it doesn't conceal its reasons, it doesn't deem it's fit to give reasons, that isn't concealing and so you of course say what you said that this Court must see if there is a state ground which can justify what --
