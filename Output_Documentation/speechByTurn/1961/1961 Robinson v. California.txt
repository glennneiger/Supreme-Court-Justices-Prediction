    Mr. McMorris.

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The present case, Robinson versus California, is of challenge to and attack upon Section 11721 of the Health and Safety Code of the State of California essentially because we feel that it is a denial of equal protection and due process in that it punishes a status rather than an act or omission, that it punishes an involuntary status, that it punishes a status of physical and mental illness, that it is vague, indefinite and uncertain upon its face, that double jeopardy is inherent in any crime of status and certainly in this -- the present one and that this statute is unwarranted and unconstitutional infringement upon the freedom of movement, that it is ex post facto and that it imposes cruel and unusual punishment. 
    Now, because our case is essentially an attack upon the law itself, the most crucial fact we have before us is the nature and the content or the necessary and implicit application of this law. 
    However, because we have -- aside or collateral issue or a secondary issue challenge also the search and seizure aspect of this case under the rule of Memphis, Ohio, the recent decision of this Court and because we also feel that under Thompson versus City of Louisville, there is an adequate evidence to sustain the conviction or in fact no evidence at all and hence a denial of due process. 
    The facts of the case will begin with the arrest itself. 
    On a chilly or cold night in February of 1960, the present appellant was riding as a passenger in the backseat of a car accompanied by his lady friend and other party named Banks and his wife were in the front seat, Banks being the driver. 
    The arresting officers testified that they stopped the vehicle because of an absence of rear license plate illumination. 
    We feel that the facts as testified by the arresting officers, negative of their excuse for the stoppage and that they actually presented three or four different reasons. 
    Secondly, we said that there was a car that driving slowly upon a dark unlit street and finally that they -- that their -- the territory in question had a reputation for person action and -- interesting also that these officers were not traffic officers, though their original justification, the one accepted by the Court was a traffic stopping. 
    They were not traffic officers. 
    They're not in a traffic car. 
    No citation for the traffic violation was given. 
    Nothing was said to the -- to any party about driving too slowly, and this is admitted. 
    And as soon as the stopping took place, they began actually a search of the parties involved to see if they were narcotic addicts of which, they had no indication prior to the stopping of the vehicle. 
    So, since they were felony officers and were not traffic officers though we -- we do not question the right of any officer to make a traffic stopping or arrest. 
    Since they were not traffic officers and did not have anything to do with traffic and stopping the car, we suspect that we have here the typical arrest, aroused arrest for the purpose of search to find whatever they might have found. 
    In fact, one of the officers testified that when the driver Banks got out of the car, he shined his light about this person to find whatever he could find. 
    And this of course is an admission of a general ex -- search to see what evidence of any crime might have been there present. 
    But leave that as it may, upon the stopping, Banks left his vehicle and -- and met the officer halfway. 
    And at this point, although it was a cold night of February and even of course the California nights are cold generally, certain in the month of February, this -- this young man obligingly had his -- no jacket on and his shirt sleeves rolled up so the arresting officer could see a single mark upon one of his arms, the right or the left as the case may have been.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="283.215" stopTime="284.207">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is that the driver or the petitioner?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="284.207" stopTime="284.982">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    It was the driver.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="284.982" stopTime="285.388">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The driver, not the petitioner.
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="285.388" stopTime="316.233">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Not the petitioner. 
    Based upon the seeing of this single mark, the officers made an arrest. 
    And then having made an arrest, they ordered the other three occupants from the car, searched the car and then searched the three other occupants. 
    In the case of the present appellant, they had him take off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and then went about him with their -- with their flashlight. 
    They state, they also checked his eyes comparing it with one with the partner, the other officer. 
    This was denied by the appellant that his eye was so shady. 
    But any rate --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    This was all on the street?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="317.984" stopTime="318.456">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    I beg your pardon?
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="318.456" stopTime="319.450">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    This was all on the street?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="319.450" stopTime="583.473">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    All on the street, yes, public street of -- of the City of Los Angeles. 
    And -- so after having talked to the appellant, he had said that he admitted having used heroin some time in the past. 
    And several weeks ago or at least several days ago or previous Wednesday and he denied the admission but -- but they state that he did admit having used heroin upon at least one occasion on 54th Street in the City of Los Angeles. 
    And -- so, based upon this admission plus having seen scar tissue in -- in the arms of this appellant after having ordered to remove him his coat, he, like Banks, was also arrested and charged with -- with the offense of being a user under the influence of or addicted to the -- the drug in question or -- or a narcotic drug, the -- the actual which we granted. 
    Now, the testimony, the only testimony on the trial which showed or intended to show any narcotic use at all was on a police officer who was attempted to be qualified as expert. 
    The respondent says he was clearly qualified as an expert. 
    But because narcotics addiction is what is, that's a serious question in my mind as whether or not a police officer has distinguished from a doctor or nurse or something of a medical nature is -- is ever really qualified to tell whether a person is a narcotic addict or not. 
    This of course is -- is a question of arguable thing. 
    We cert -- we don't rely upon it. 
    But the only evidence was that of a police officer who stated that this appellant was not under the influence, was not an addict as far as he could see and he relies solely upon the use as shown by some marks on the man's arm. 
    Now, of course, the marks themselves are stated to have been from 3 to about 20 days old from one arm from 3 to 10 days and other arm 15 to 20 days as I recall it. 
    Of course, the appearance of the marks in the arms could not show where the narcotic had been injected. 
    And of course, we have the rule of venue. 
    I think generally certain in California on the case that we have cited that venue or the place where a crime was committed whether its murder or the injection of a narcotic must be shown. 
    So the expert did not rely upon either influence or addiction. 
    The court nevertheless instructed upon it and admittedly unproven aspect of the law, addiction as well as upon use. 
    So we here have a conviction, we did not show clearly to have been either for use or for addiction. 
    We know this more than the other, we must assume so because the court did instruct the jury that they must all find either use or addiction and not six days that he was user and the other six that he was an addict. 
    We cannot know which it was the jury found since the prosecution did not elect between the two of the several counts of Section 11721. 
    And so we -- we must of course challenge the -- the conviction under both grounds since -- since the -- we have no such election. 
    So then the -- there was no evidence of the place of use except an admission on the part of the -- the appellant himself who denied the admission but it was said by the officer to have state that he used heroin at his arrest and -- and while he was being interrogated by the investigating officer that he had used heroin in the City of Los Angeles sometime before. 
    This was, of course, a completed crime not in the presence of the officers and that it took place on Wednesday prior to the -- to the arrest. 
    So that is essentially the facts of the case, the arrest, and the evidence introduced. 
    The appellant denied that he ever used narcotics explain marks all over his body, having been occasion by oversea shots which never got over. 
    The young lady with him and he both stated that Banks had a jacket on and he was forced to remove his jacket the same as -- as of this -- this appellant had been and that his mother also testified explaining the marks all over his body, jury to show that he had marks on his back and chest and breast places and not just on his arms of a dark splotches which he -- which he testified with the same as though in his arms.

    The -- he revealed, he took his shirt off and showed the jury, he had dark splotches all over his body, not just in his arms and places where others, he first wouldn't be taking narcotics. 
    And it was no claim these others were narcotic marks but were in generally in evidence. 
    And the jury had acquired a magnifying glass before they could be satisfied that the marks have shown in the pit of the arms wherein fact narcotic marks.

    Yes, at least that.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I'm asking that question because it's -- I don't know if it's entirely clear in the record whether he was found guilty under that -- that part of the statute that proscribes the use of narcotics or that part which requires -- which proscribes being under the influence of narcotics or this third part being addicted to narcotics. 
    Is -- is it clear as to which one of those three?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="649.110" stopTime="650.433">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Well Mr. Justice --

    He was convicted of?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="650.946" stopTime="668.509">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Stewart. 
    As to -- as to the influence, the court exp -- expressly rejected that and that it was -- the court expressly charged the jury that it was not influence, no influence has shown. 
    It had to be either addiction or use. 
    The court did instruct as to those two aspects of three prolonged statute.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="668.509" stopTime="668.867">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Both, addiction and use.
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="668.867" stopTime="670.470">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Addiction or use.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="670.470" stopTime="682.036">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And there was evidence before the jury that he had admitted the use some 48 hours before the arrest that he admitted that he had used them some 48 hours before the arrest?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="682.036" stopTime="682.346">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Yes, there was admission --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="682.346" stopTime="683.659">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That was before the jury?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="683.659" stopTime="685.175">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    -- before the jury.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="685.175" stopTime="696.632">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So presumably the jury could've convicted him either of having been a user, having -- having in fact used them or -- or being addicted to them, is that correct?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="696.632" stopTime="698.710">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    That is true Mr. Justice.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="698.710" stopTime="700.385">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And there's no way to tell if the jury's verdict could have done?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="700.385" stopTime="708.536">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    No, it could be either way. 
    The court simply instructed that they had to go all one way or the other, not divide as between the two aspects of the law which is charged this point.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="708.536" stopTime="721.087">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Because as I suppose, I looked at one way if there was evidence of an actual use of narcotics, that's a little different difference from conviction on the basis of status, isn't it?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="721.087" stopTime="722.906">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Yes, it is. 
    It is.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="722.906" stopTime="743.292">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And I suppose you could -- if he had just did, there were just evidence that he was a user, was no evidence of actual -- of an actual of act of using then you'd have a -- have a status conviction. 
    But if there was evidence of -- of an act of using, then it would be something or somewhat different from a conviction based upon the status alone.
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="743.292" stopTime="751.815">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Yes Mr. Justice Stewart, the only problem is that that the judge fully instructed the jury upon -- upon addiction, so we're on the haunt of this dilemma -- of this dilemma.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="751.815" stopTime="751.921">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="751.921" stopTime="756.070">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    We don't know of which we are addicted. 
    So of course I have to challenge both possible convictions.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="756.070" stopTime="757.249">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I understand that.
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="757.249" stopTime="773.101">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    And as a matter of fact, I argue strongly at the trial and the transcript here that even the -- they had not contend basically that they had shown the addiction and yet we are -- and I challenge the instruction on that ground which was given nonetheless.

    No, there was no evidence whatsoever or -- or a withdrawal symptoms as I argue that -- no showing of it all.

speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="790.175" stopTime="798.404">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    No, he simply stated that he had oversea shots and this led to a general marking upon his body of dark splotches which changed color in the light and in the dark.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="798.404" stopTime="800.041">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Those had nothing to do with --
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="800.041" stopTime="801.436">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    With narcotics and such as --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="801.436" stopTime="801.495">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="801.495" stopTime="1569.968">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    -- as far as -- as far as it show. 
    So that's been, as I recall, consist -- is a fact of the case. 
    Now, because of the instruction of the court under addiction -- had the court not instruct yet on addiction, I would not have my basic approach here today, although I'm happy if the Court did so. 
    As a matter of fact, I'd be willing to -- to abandon or waive or withdraw from my arguments under points B and -- and C regarding the procedural denial of due process with respect to insufficiency of evidence and respect to the search and seizure. 
    Because to me, the crux of this case is the conviction underneath the narcotic law which makes narcotic addiction a crime. 
    Now, it is interesting that in only four of the States of the union as we point out from material from the alternative price annuals reports, only four of the States in the union punished narcotics addiction exclusively as a crime. 
    In a large number of states, approximately ten, it is punished solely as a sickness. 
    In the others, it is punished or it is treat, let me say or -- or treated as a sickness or punished as a crime. 
    So the general approach is and in California surely, it maybe approached either of the crime or under the Welfare and Institutions Code, a party maybe placed in a state hospital of some kind and treated as a narcotics addict. 
    We have no objection to such treatment in a voluntary compulsory and we feel that this is the proper approach. 
    We feel the legislature in this law took not just a why but certainly a constitutional step. 
    On the other hand, we have here a law which punishes out a crime the same status or condition which another law of California treats as a sickness. 
    In the first place, I might say in passing that it seems to me that those who are treated under the punishment aspect are denied equal protection as against those who are given the treatment under the Welfare and Institutions Code, which is purely a medical and psychiatric sort of thing. 
    But getting to my first major point under this that any statute which punishes a status as distinguished from an act or omission is unconstitutional. 
    At this point, may I call the Court's attention to an excellent article Vagrancy Reconsidered which appears in the New York Law Review, the most recent volume, it's -- it's in one of the -- the -- this -- in the January of this year's edition, Vagrancy Reconsidered by -- by the New York University Law Review which points out an answer up to the contention, though not intended to be an answer to the contends of the respondent who holds that both England and America have always accepted status as a proper ground for penalization, that the only basis of a survival, the vagrancy laws in California and of course as we'll point out later, this present law is a type of vagrancy law. 
    The only ground for a survival has been two centuries of uncritical acceptance by our legislatures and courts of outmoded English precedent which has been rejected by England itself. 
    And this is fully pointed out in this article which I mentioned that England no longer has a vagrancy statute. 
    They have evolved from vagrancy to -- to conduct, to disorderly conduct which is what California in our most recent legislature changed to and Illinois at the same time. 
    We know have two States but I think would start up -- would become a trend to get away from punishing the condition and punish specific acts of the inherent wrongness of punishing a person's condition or status is that we are here punishing the possibility of crime, is suspected intent to commit crime, even not an attempt or an act. 
    Normally, throughout our history or in -- in most laws everywhere, a person who's convicted of crime if he does a thing or attempts to do a thing. 
    We go beyond the actual completion and do punish the attempt. 
    At the same time, we have a constitutional mandate against even an arrest on suspicion merit. 
    But the vagrancy laws of which this is one permits a police officer not just to arrest upon suspicion or because a person might intend to commit a crime because of his vagrant status but he can even be convicted upon suspicion. 
    So we have just -- and the antithesis or antithesis of the -- of our search and seizure rule which forbids an arrest except in the presence of an actual crime or -- or proper suspicion there as. 
    Here, we have a conviction for the suspicion itself. 
    Now, under California law, it is time honor under Section 20 of the Penal Code that we must show either act or omission plus intent. 
    So here, we have neither act n4or omission and we submit no intent. 
    In that under 0.2, this is a -- this is a wholly involuntary status. 
    Now, the respondent assures the Court that every addict intends to become an addict. 
    However, I think it is clear that an addict no more intended to become that than does an alcoholic intend to become an alcoholic because he may have like to drink socially or because the person intended to acquire venereal disease because he may have voluntarily committed some other act contrary to our -- to the laws of a sexual morality. 
    The point I'm getting at is in -- these three things are -- are similar. 
    The -- a person intends to take a drink, intends perhaps to take shot of heroin or smoke a marijuana cigarette or intends to have an illicit sex act. 
    None of these intended to acquire venereal disease or to become an alcoholic or to become an addict. 
    As a matter of fact, the intent does not go beyond the initial voluntary act which is not the status which -- which comes from the repeated series, perhaps the voluntary acts. 
    No one, I submit, intends to become an addict. 
    And I think this is clear from our medical discussion which we have and present here the authorities, both from Europe, Dr. Hesse or Hesse, a renowned German physician and two American authorities, American doctors Mower and (Inaudible) and it is uncontradicted that we do have a peer, a condition of mental and physical illness. 
    As a matter of fact, the respondent admits or the appellee admits that this is a mental and physical illness and then goes on to say, however we may punish. 
    The statement properly punish a mental and physical illness and compares it with -- with alcoholism or -- or drunkenness let's say which -- which appellee says he'd be punished, compares it also with kleptomania, the sickness requiring one to steal and with the arsonist who may be ill as distinguished from one or perhaps he's burning his house to collect insurance. 
    I -- in a recent speech by the Judge Mirto of the New York bench and California in -- in San Francisco under a conference he had at a baffle time this Court granted this appeal in this case in November of last year, they had a conference on alcohol and American civilization. 
    Judge Mirto stated that he feels that to treat alcoholics as criminals is not only contrary to good social policy but it's unconstitutional and made with respect to alcohol to the point of drunkenness, the same contest that which we are making here with respect to narcotics addiction. 
    We of course hardly agree with the judge and feel that -- that a recent development in our history of our jurisprudence in this development will be that even certain things as kleptomania and arson or whatever, if it can be shown to be actually the product of mental illness as distinguished from a voluntary act will be an illness to be treated so and not a crime. 
    Our jails are overcrowded with people who voluntarily and under their own control have done such thing as commit arson or rob, and such people properly belong there. 
    But if a person does in fact commit the act of theft or an act of arson or any act because of a -- a probably medical condition such person, I think, should be treated and not punished and certainly in the case of alcoholism or a narcotics addiction even more so than the -- than -- than the other categories perhaps because these are clearly and totally mental and physical illnesses which -- which cry out loud for help, for treatment, for hospitalization rather than for -- for the type of punishment which -- which we here apply. 
    Now, we are not alone and respondent assures the Court, appellee assures the Court that we cannot -- have not present any case in which status has been held not a proper subject for legislation. 
    However, in the case, the Belcrasto -- Belcrasto case from New York, People versus the Belcastro which is cited by both sides, the court throughout a gangster type vagrancy statute, the New York Court because it held that this was unconstitutional. 
    In Lanzetta versus New Jersey, this present Court took the same approach to a New Jersey statute. 
    Recently in California, our State Supreme Court in the Newbern, the famous, now famous Newbern case throughout the common drunkard section of our vagrancy laws which is point 11 and -- of which -- the law of which narcotics addiction was originally point 12. 
    Originally, this law was a part of our vagrancy law and was later deleted and put in the Health and Safety Code as a specialized vagrancy ordinance that give a specialized treatment. 
    The vagrancy or status aspects remain. 
    But in -- in Newbern and California, Section 11 of 647 of the -- of the Penal Code which in 1961 was changed from vagrancy to disorderly conduct, the appellee, will all the sudden completely solve the problem I think. 
    The Court held that the terms common drunkard was too big, indefinite and uncertain to constitute valid penal legislation. 
    One of the ground given was that the degree of drunkenness as I recall the -- that the legislature had in mind was not clear from the terms common drunkard. 
    And under our heading that the present law is vague, indefinite and uncertain, we make a similar holding with respect to addict. 
    And certainly, the term "addict" of all our three terms which are use one, two be under the influence of and three, be addicted to a narcotic. 
    All three are subject to -- to disagreement among reasonable minds particular with respect to -- to addict. 
    Consider this, the legislature in -- in a section of the Health and Safety Code which we cite by typographical error, we had it wrong and the appellee was kind of give the Court the -- the correct section. 
    The Legislature of California has legislated that a -- an addicted person is one who has a compulsion to use a substance, which to me is the only proper definition of an addiction as distinguished from habitual use or a single use. 
    In other words, not merely habit or custom but a compulsion, a physical compulsion which is explained by the doctors, "As actually such a physiological changed that the body will not function normally in the absence of the substance of a narcotic. 
    When you reach this part, you have a clearly disorganized body which if it has a -- in a proper withdrawal may collapse or even die and this is the kind of treatment we get in the cold turkey California penal treatment of narcotics addiction which every doctor quoted here and certainly generally state must be given medical treatment or -- and a hospital situation, a general taping off or a deep sleep treatment or the application of methadone in order not to have to go through this terrible violent withdrawal which we feel is such abstinence of the application of what we know about the medicine psychiatry that it is in fact cruel and unusual punishment for the condition of addiction which a person is found.

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Not at all. 
    This is an appeal, a standard appeal. 
    And it's a higher state court in which the appeal as a matter of right but we can't go by habeas corpus prohibition or certiorari other -- other roots to the higher courts as I did in this case to leave no stone unturned. 
    Have we had a previous experience in Lambert versus California not done so and the court has its justice. 
    So -- now, the -- ex po -- ex post facto aspect, the appellee contends that as to our particular appellant, we do not show that the law was ex post facto. 
    We feel, however, that once having challenge a statute squarely as applied tools a particular appellant, the such appellant may then show the entire scope of the laws and the constitutional standpoint. 
    And this is the holding of the implied boarding of Thornhill versus Alabama and Lanzetta versus New Jersey and that we did not have here a just moot case, we had a case in which as the law was in fact applied to this appellant and which it did go beyond its actual application to show what the law consisted of upon its face. 
    This ex post facto aspect occurs on the face of the law. 
    And that it punishes person whatever addiction and clearly because of the change in our -- in our approach to a narcotics addiction within the lifetime of most of us or many of us and because it was legal and because there is no known cure for it, there -- there are many who will be subjected to this particular law who either acquired the condition which we know not -- not how to treat prior to the law or who may have been even acquired during the war with many of our voyage did acquire and appellate going to overseas having to take narcotics injected from an area and other things. 
    It then become a criminal automatically and it will come out in uniform and to state of life. 
    And this kind of thing seems to be is ex post facto. 
    I repeat, again, that I feel that the cold turkey treatment which is a necessary and adherence approach under -- under the penal treatment of this -- of this condition which leaves an addict to suffer and nearly die and sometime in fact die.

   Rebuttal of William E. Doran
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2273.767" stopTime="2278.524">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Doran.
speaker="william_e_doran" startTime="2278.524" stopTime="2581.506">
    Mr. William E. Doran 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Mr. McMorris stated the appellant herein was convicted of 11721, Subsection of Health and Safety Code of California. 
    And also has he stated, the cause went to the jury only on two issues, use and addiction under the influence of that aspect of the -- of the Section. 
    The court took from the jury my instructions. 
    I may say first getting directly to Mr. McMorris his main contention of purported unconstitutional status. 
    This addiction statute first became criminal in California in 1929 when it was added to the Penal Code as part of the Vagrancy Section. 
    In 1939, it was deleted from the Penal Code and the Vagrancy Section and put into the new Health and Safety Code which is connected I think at that time. 
    Since then, it has remained in the Health and Safety Code and has been amended from time-to-time in minor details. 
    In the briefs, both appellant and appellee have referred consistently to vagrancy probably because it's the closest or the -- the most usual, shall we say, statute under which a status is involved. 
    Now, its appellee's contention that when this Section was removed from the Vagrancy Section in California and put into the Health and Safety Code, the only remaining aspect of vagrancy or even comparison to vagrancy that remained was the aspects of its status. 
    And it is our contention that thereafter, the ordinary ideas of vagrancy such as a -- a tramp or a ne'er-do-well or a wonderer and such of the many common known types, we are not involved with the situation like that at all. 
    We are involved with a man who is putting a foreign fire into his veins, and it bears no relationship that we contented. 
    There is no further relationship to vagrancy except -- except the peculiarity status. 
    Now, counsel has cited many of these vagrancy cases and of course we have cited them, too. 
    And he has referred to two particularly Lanzetta against New Jersey and Edelman against California. 
    The Lanzetta case involved vagrancy decided by this Court and it struck down the -- the statute but not on the ground alone that it punished the status. 
    They struck him down because it was vague and indefinite in trying to define the status, it was going to punish. 
    The same in Edelman which this Court having taken jurisdiction didn't decide the case on the merits but they were two dissenting opinions that went to the merits. 
    And the same thing shall I say happen there. 
    The California Vagrancy Statute was attacked but -- on a very peculiar circumstances by which California or the City of Los Angeles in this instance utilized a Section 6475 of the Penal Code which proscribe, lewd and dissolute conduct making such person a vagrant, that's the statement of the statute. 
    However, in that case, the Edelman case, they didn't plead lewdness. 
    The pleading went only to dissolutes. 
    And it was an unfortunate situation no doubt because what they were trying to reach was something that the word "dissolute" as the two dissenting justices here held just shouldn't reach. 
    And peculiarly enough and about the same time, the Appellate Department of Superior Court of Los Angeles from which the appellant of -- from which the Edelman case came, decided another case unreported case of People against Dragna where they assumed practically the same position as assumed by the dissent in this Court to the effect that lewd and dissolute were used in the statutes anonymously. 
    And meant -- they meant the same thing and as you couldn't state an offense merely by the word "dissolute". 
    Statue was aimed at lewdness.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Could this -- could this statute be a fact on vagueness in light manner because there's no distinction made between whether this was voluntarily done or involuntarily done? 
    I mean, the status was acquired voluntarily or involuntarily. 
    I think it's known that there -- that there are people who have acquired to have it in hospitals due to treatment and -- and for some disease and when they get out, they're addicts just as much as if that they've been hoodlums who had -- who had gone into it.

    Yes, but sometimes, I -- I'm taking the position where a doctor has treated him for a disease or -- or some great pain of some kind and as administered narcotics and then when -- when that condition is cured, he -- he turns him loose and -- and he is an addict and -- and he can't get anymore -- anymore narcotics from a doctor but he's an addict just the same.

    Well, we have those two, Your Honor. 
    But it didn't go to -- to the aspect of status at all. 
    The Newbern case, it went merely to the vagueness and indefinite of the word "common. 
    But getting back to the other question that was asked of Mr. McMorris, as to the possibility of a person's serving 90 days under this -- under a conviction under the statute, then coming out and being picked up again immediately for addiction. 
    I might say that such would be impossible under the methods of prosecution at least that I'm familiar with in California. 
    For this reason, all of these addiction prosecutions are based upon circumstantial evidence or mainly they are based upon circumstantial evidence of the scabs and marks that appear from the body of the defendant, usually on his arms over the veins. 
    The expert testifies that he sees so many marks and he -- he explains how old these scabs are and how old the marks are and establish is that as a present condition, the person is addicted and a current user. 
    Now, if a person is in jail for 90 days, I am sure the reading of the expert testimony of the gentlemen who testified in this page at page 54 of the record, Mr. Lindquist, but I'm not going to read with but it will reveal that by the time a person has served 90 days in jail, all current marks will be removed from his body and he just couldn't be convicted again without acquiring new marks or by the testimony that it wasn't true one or the other. 
    Just we just -- the prosecution just could not establish the circumstances indicating his addiction.

    Mr. William E. Doran 
    -- in many cases, it's indispensable for this reason under a case of People against Garcia which is cited in -- in I think Mr. McMorris' brief. 
    It was held that to convict for use, you must establish venue which in California would be in the particular county in -- in the municipal court. 
    Now, as a practical matter, there are no -- you -- you wouldn't charge a person with use if you saw him using it. 
    Because if you saw him using it, you would have found him in possession of the narcotic a felony and a lesser charge would of course be ignored. 
    Therefore, the only way we can prove user is by the admission of the defendant himself as took place in this case. 
    Beyond that --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, let's point this that under your statute as construed by your courts, you can get a conviction if you get an expert to let him see the defendant's arm and say, "As an expert, I can tell the jury that he is an addict, whereas under the use part of statute again as construed by your court, you have to show an act of use in a particular place otherwise you have a problem of venue.

    Mr. William E. Doran 
    Correct, Your Honor, exactly. 
    And for that reason, the addiction part of the statute is the most important part of it in at least 85% or 90%of the cases except --

    Mr. William E. Doran 
    The addiction takes place in the county or in the jurisdiction where the person is apprehended.

    Getting to the -- to the actual, factual aspects of the case, and may I say so on the light most favorable to the -- to the prosecution, this automobile was apprehended by the police department while driving down the dark street at night with no illumination on the license plate. 
    The driver of the automobile voluntarily got out of the car and met the policeman. 
    Whereas the policeman there looked for the flashlight, saw the mark on his arm and didn't arrest him then as has been contended. 
    He questioned him about his use of narcotics if any and the driver Mr. Banks stated that yes, he was a narcotic user. 
    Thereupon, he was arrested. 
    Thereafter, the other passengers of the automobile were removed from the automobile by his fellow officer and the automobile was searched. 
    The appellant here Mr. Robertson has -- Robinson as one of the passengers was on the sidewalk and the officer noticing a purported nervousness and perspiration, asked him if he used narcotics and he has thereupon stated, yes, he did. 
    In other words, there was a completed mission to the arresting officers as to the commission of a crime prior to any arrest. 
    Thereafter the admission, the officer did order Mr. Robinson to bare his arms so that he could look at them. 
    The officer did look at them, noticed marks and thereupon arrested Mr. Robinson. 
    And it's our position that in this course of events, as they transpired, never did there occur any illegal search or seizure in any ways he performed. 
    It was all -- all of it developed from the officer seeing what was in plain site to be seen and listening to the admissions of the defendant as the transaction went along. 
    As to appellant's contention of addiction being an illness, of course, we agree but I might say this as to his contention that you cannot constitutionally punish a status. 
    California since this case has -- has been tried, has it not enacted a comprehensive new program of treatment for narcotic addicts added to Section 11 to the Penal Code. 
    The entire program depends upon the term "addiction" as do many federal statutes regarding the entry of immigrants into this country toward drug addicts it's prohibited. 
    The word "addiction" is used, the word statutes -- "status" is -- the term "status" is indispensable. 
    The same in the deportation of drug addicts from the United States. 
    This status, addiction is indispensable, we contend, in the control of the use of narcotics by the user. 
    If we --

    Addiction having -- one step further, a finding by the court of -- that someone is in imminent danger of becoming addicted which carries at even one step further. 
    And it is a process by which in a lower court -- a trial court, if it appears to the trial court that the defendant is addicted or in imminent danger of it, the cause is thereafter transferred to the Superior Court for hearings, it goes -- a determination is made and the man is sent to a hospital which is no one to be course of development for narcotic addicts.

    They need to be in hospitals.

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    This -- or a new -- a new chapter 11. 
    But it is -- as I said, though it doesn't define it which isn't too important perhaps -- though somewhat in the case of a civil or medical treatment but here -- here in the Court, there's definition aspect too. 
    Here, we can see or read my mind may be different. 
    Now, Mr. Doran I've known for years is a reasonable man but he insists that we can have addiction without compulsion. 
    I like to thank him --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3883.701" stopTime="3884.846">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Without what?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="3884.846" stopTime="4033.697">
    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Without compulsion, just to have it without the compulsive use, throughout the driving force to use. 
    That's the contention he's making here that -- this was construction legislature that addiction means habitual customary use as distinguished from compulsive use. 
    I think there's a distinction there. 
    The -- as a matter of fact, to break it down further. 
    I cite in my brief two New York cases, the application of Palmer and Palmer against Spaulding. 
    Spaulding, I think the same man Palmer. 
    In one case, a New York court stated that you must show compulsive use plus an actual deterioration upon the body. 
    I think this has to do with the doctor who was being disqualified because he was deteriorated while using the drug himself. 
    Another case held that the mere compulsion without a showing of deterioration is all that you had to show. 
    So here another court, we have the same conflict, we have in California here between the legislature of the courts because I insist that the California legislature in its only definition of addiction has said compulsive or beyond the power of control. 
    This is the only definition we have -- in -- is our legislature I think it's what they mean. 
    And that's what California legislature says an addict is. 
    Here, we have a court reading on a new definition in -- in the case cited, it was in -- in a vehicle code thing saying, Well, I know what the purpose of this code. 
    Well, the legislature does not define it and to another court, they do define it and say we -- it means compulsive use or use beyond the control. 
    We will say that for this purpose of this code, it -- it means only habitual customary use and this shows the conflict I suspect within the reasonable minds of the judiciary and the legislature. 
    Now, the same thing is true of the use of the -- of the term "use". 
    Mr. Doran, a reasonable man feels that a single use of -- of a narcotic is sufficient. 
    I think the Legislature meant a customary use. 
    But here again, the Dictionary, Webster has both of them as meanings for the term "use". 
    So here again, we have a conflict. 
    And as for the use beyond the influence of aspect, we have the Newbern Rule that just as the common was undefinable so -- and also because the Legislature did not show to what extent they have in mind with reference to -- to what extent drug has became common or what point it became common. 
    As to addiction, we don't know what the Legislature has in mind, as to what degree. 
    I would subject you to this felony of whether or not they -- so either they had in mind their own definition in the Welfare and Institutions Code which is a compulsive or use beyond control which is --

    I think there's new one which come out in 1961.

    We've always had the power to treat them in hospital but we never used, but please put them in jail. 
    The one's who are enforcing the narcotics law in California are the police not the doctors.

    Medical aside getting treatment but treatment of these people and the only way California will ever be required to use that law is to tell them we cannot just let them kick it cold turkey as you have the other provision here.

speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="4152.154" stopTime="4182.546">

    Well, I think it does apply for two reasons. 
    First place, the legislature does not define it in -- in the Penal Code. 
    And it does define it in the other code. 
    And secondly, when -- when the law was originally passed as a part of the Penal Code, it did define it in the same manner. 
    As it's shown by my -- in the appendix to my brief, the original passage of this law had -- from a court because it shows my point so well, the original vagrancy or -- or narcotics addict law in California read as follows, "Provided that --

    What page is that?

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Well, that is apparently the contention of the -- of the appellee that we -- we have two different two classes of addicts. 
    One in -- in the Welfare and Institutions Code, he go to hospital, he must be under a compulsive use or beyond his control. 
    But under Penal Code by the court's reading in their own definition not supplied by the Legislature, he may just be a habitual customary use.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4285.933" stopTime="4290.128">

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    That would -- could happen under the definition urged by -- by the -- the appellee here. 
    But here again as I said, since this is -- it's clearly showing of the disagreement among reasonable mind because we don't know what the Legislature had in mind. 
    And there -- and therefore, the -- the law is not complete in the Penal Code, but it is complete in the Welfare and Institution Code. 
    We have to guess in the Penal Code and Vehicle Code and so the court guessed that the Legislature had in mind a different definition on in the one code.

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    I'd like to answer too a question earlier of Mr. Justice Brennan as to whether or not a person could be presented up to -- the appellee could be immediately arrested in another county or even in the same county under the part of the instruction which is scratched out here is California law that this status is presumed to exist and the burden of proof is upon the defendant to disprove this presumption which means that if I do three months and get out tomorrow, I presume to continue to be an addict and I could be arrested when I hit the streets even though they may not as a fact permitted to do it. 
    This count occur under the law because my condition is presumed to continue indefinitely under these instructions which are here but scratched out because the court found that it didn't apply because they had no previous conviction (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    No, it comes pretty close to this. 
    They see this -- it's the same track. 
    These tracks last a lifetime Mr. Justice Brennan.

    When the person used it -- the substance for years, these tracks last for lifetime and at same track and convict him a thousand times.

    This is not at all be acquired under the law. 
    They may or may not be. 
    And that who can tell what hole is new and how long it has been there, where they got it. 
    But essentially, it is the track of -- that they convict the addiction for the single hole and as the appellee said it's not addiction.

    No, but it's on the face of law. 
    And the interpretation of -- of addiction by the California court that the condition presumed to exist which means that -- that -- and the burden of proof is in you. 
    So if you want show any previous con -- of conviction, you must now show that you're no longer an addict. 
    And I think this is hardly frivolous to California law. 
    In which why I stated that it can't be a thousand times punished for the same condition, as distinguished from new marks though as the practical matter, they -- they may wait for a new mark but it's not required under the law.

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Well, the -- as the state of appellee here, they may not show and -- and all they may not show that the condition continued over the same period. 
    In other words, if -- if I'm arrested today and due in 3 months -- 30 days or 90 days which the minimum then if I get arrested a day after I get out of jail, this my addiction which continue after I got out so we have a different cure but it's the same of addiction.

    Mr. Samuel Carter McMorris 
    Not squarely so because this one, I thought the judge did not give these instructions and scratched it out but my point is on the face of the law in California interpretation.

    That is true except that it's not adherent in the manner in which is adherent here because he said -- we have a presumptions and present in the law that this man's condition last a lifetime, and this is implicit in the law.

    As I understand the law that if it's apparent on the face of the law that -- that I -- that I -- I could show beyond constitutional face of the law. 
    Now, in this case, there's no double application. 
    I'll concede immediately up to this particular -- to this particular appellate. 
    There's no double application but on -- the law inherently amends itself to -- to any addict being treated -- being punished all his life for the condition which we admit by medical evidence, is a -- it's perhaps a lifetime condition once acquired. 
    I think the solution is to treat this illness and -- and to -- and to try to take (Inaudible) and educate people against it and prevent it ever happened. 
    Once it happened on the present medical knowledge, we have a lifetime criminal.
