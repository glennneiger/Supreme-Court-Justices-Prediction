speaker="john_cardinal" startTime="13.528" stopTime="596.441">
    Mr. John Cardinal 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court. 
    This case was argued on the general docket in the Spring that if I might, I would like to go through the facts briefly once again. 
    As you may recall it's an indictment and conviction for the violation of Title 18, 1505 of the US Code. 
    The facts which led up to the indictment of the petitioner are briefly and they begin with the filing or the serving of a petition purportedly that of the McClellan Committee on the petitioner on March 21, 1958. 
    The subpoena -- I'm sorry, I might have said the petition, it was the subpoena that was served on Mr. Presser, called for the all of the records of Joint Council 41 which is the -- an affiliation of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters for the northeastern and southeastern parts of Ohio, for a period of approximately 10 years from July -- from January 1, 1959 until January 1, 1958. 
    Immediately following the service of this subpoena upon Mr. Presser, it was affected with the Committee's field office in Cleveland an arrangement whereby the accountants and attorneys for Joint Council 41 gave to the field office personnel, those records demanded by the subpoena and for which the field office receipted. 
    This arrangement continued until at least September 5 of 1958 at which time Sheridan who had served the subpoena on Mr. Presser, again returned to Cleveland and served a subpoena upon Koza and Stoyer, the accountants and lawyers for Joint Council 45, demanding that the office files of that firm as they pertain to Joint Council 41 were to be displayed in Washington on September 9, five-four days from that day. 
    On September 9, Sheridan again returned to Cleveland and went to the office of Joint Council 41 where he testified that in as much as he was aware that some of the files had not been turned over to the field office, he attempted to examine those files still in Joint Council 41's office to determine whether or not they should have been. 
    After some conversation with Mr. Presser, the files -- the cabinets in the office were turned over to Mr. Sheridan and he examined those for a considerable period of time and determined that he would take four particular files. 
    In one of these files, there were, according to his testimony, two documents, one an invoice known as the Doich invoice and its ex -- the Government's Exhibit 12 upon which there were listed eight names. 
    The invoice was the counsel's receipt for the purchase of eight champagne buckets. 
    On the other document, was a list of names which included the eight on the Doich invoice but other names behind which were listed certain items known to the investigator to have been sums of money for or gifts, Christmas gifts. 
    These were contained in an envelope marked X-mas list. 
    Mr. Presser testified that he wanted a receipt for the four files that were taken out. 
    Because of the lateness of the hour, Mr. Sheridan said I can't do that, I will be back and they by mutual agreement, agreed to have the files photostated and Sheridan was to return on the 13 and pick up the photostated copies. 
    Mr. Sheridan's testimony was that there was no testimony -- no conversation concerning a receipt that Mr. Presser said that he would not let them go out until they were photostated. 
    At any way, on the 13th of September, Sheridan again returned the office and Joint Council 41, look through the files, and found that the Doich invoice had been mutilated to exclude the eight names listed on the left-hand corner and the list which include those eight names and others, was missing. 
    He immediately made some remark to Mr. Presser and Presser was too have said, “You have your job to do, I have mine.” 
    Mr. Sheridan left, taking the files, giving no receipts and testified before his committee on September 17th concerning this incident. 
    Now a year-and-a-half later on March 23, 1960, Mr. Presser was indicted for obstructing the Committee in its investigation and according to the indictment that the allegations are that the Committee at that time at all times material to the indictment was duly in the due and proper exercise of its investigative powers pursuant to its authorizing resolution and that in accordance with its own rules of procedure, issued the subpoena demanding the documents which the petitioner knew were relevant to the Committee's investigation and were demanded by the subpoena. 
    During the course of the trial, Sheridan took the stand and in the course of cross-examination of Mr. Sheridan, it was brought out that the subpoena which was served on the petitioner on March 21 of 1958 was in all likelihood prepared in Cleveland. 
    That the subpoena was signed, the blank subpoena was signed by Senator McClellan, Chairman of the McClellan Committee and was addressed by and filled in, the substance of the subpoena filled in by employees in the field office in Cleveland. 
    Now Senator McClellan also had taken the stand and with respect to the organization of the Committee stated with fairly good specificity the subpoena power of the Committee, nothing was said concerning this particular subpoena. 
    However, the likelihood of Sheridan's testimony was further bolstered when the supplemental subpoena issued on April 1 and in the record as defendant's Exhibit A was without qualification signed by the senator in blank and issued to -- and issued by the field personnel. 
    Now at that point in the trial, we asked the Court, we move the Court to quash the subpoena and the indictment and discharge the defendant. 
    On that particular point, the trial court held that this subpoena was valid and later the Court of Appeals held that it was valid, but that no subpoena was necessary in this instance. 
    Now our contention is that under the indictment and under the processes of the Committee, the Committee had to be in the -- in order to be in the due and proper exercise of its investigative powers had to have issued a valid subpoena for the production of these documents. 
    That the --
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="596.441" stopTime="600.734">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Is that because of the statute or because of the indictment?
speaker="john_cardinal" startTime="600.734" stopTime="775.791">
    Mr. John Cardinal 
    It's because of the indictment and because of the rules of procedure of the Committee itself. 
    There is rule four of the rules of procedure provides that the chairman has the right to issue subpoenas or he has the right to delegate that authority to a member of the Committee, providing that authority is delegated in writing. 
    So that issuance we contend provides not only the signing of a subpoena, but includes the address that would be the subject to whom the subpoena is addressed and the documents or the person's body who is demanded before the Committee. 
    The fact that issuance has a greater connotation than merely signing the blank subpoena is recognized at page 26 of the Government's brief. 
    And in as much as the Committee in this instance purported to act through its coercive power of the subpoena, we contend that the voluntary turning over of these documents cannot later validate original an originally void process. 
    We also contend contrary to the Government that such a process cannot then be ratified by the Committee because the Committee in this case instance, in this particular instance, could not have delegated to Sheridan or any employee the power to make cogent or validate a blank piece of paper signed by Senator McClellan. 
    We contend therefore that the trial court was in error that the -- in not discharging the defendant, that the Committee was not in its due and proper exercise of the investigative power authorized under its authorizing resolution, Senate Resolution 74. 
    it was in violation of its own rules of procedure that the subpoena was not a defective process, it was a void process and that the void process cannot be validated by ratification because it could not have been delegated in the first instance.

    Mr. John Cardinal

    Supposing no subpoena had been issued at all and the Committee has instructed the investigator to go around and tell Mr. Presser that he was going to be subpoenaed and that they were interested in his files and he's been gerrymandering this investigation and then the same currencies have taken place.

    That's right Your Honor but I was attempting to answer Mr. Justice Harlan's question. 
    I don't think that in the circumstances that you put that the -- that the petitioner would have been in violation of 1505 unless he voluntarily appears. 
    I believe that he -- if he voluntarily appears before the Commission -- the Committee and in a sense subjects himself to its jurisdiction that that isn't broken by something that transpires there merely because he's not under subpoena. 
    I do believe that the Committee might take some action by resolution or otherwise which could place him in a position where he was bound to comply.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, were you going to discuss the evidence of Senator McClellan?
speaker="john_cardinal" startTime="1432.632" stopTime="1645.955">
    Mr. John Cardinal 
    Your Honor, I had intended to. 
    We believe that the evidence of Senator McClellan was wholly erroneous in this instance, in this case broken down his testimony was organizational, a recitation from what was described is the interim report, the recitation from the Committee's report and certain conclusions that he drew from this testimony. 
    Now the Government attempted to justify all of these evidences on the ground that it tended to show that the Committee was really investigating under its authorizing resolution that the names on the documents were pertinent to that inquiry and knowledge of the petitioner to the fact that the Committee wanted those names. 
    Now we believe that following the organizational testimony of Senator McClellan, the entire evidence of the senator was self serving. 
    He begins by relating the special findings of this Committee to certain members of the teamster's union and certain other persons not connected with the teamsters union which are supposed to have apprised the petitioner that the bad character of those people which are read into the record at pages 42 through 46 that the Committee was going to want the names listed on this invoice. 
    He also was permitted to check or read the Committee's report of Sheridan's testimony concerning his visit to the Joint Council 41 office before the Committee on September 17th, that would be four days following his leaving Cleveland. 
    Now the testimony before the Committee by Sheridan was given under two subpoenas neither one of which is the one that forms the basis of the indictment. 
    So that when Sheridan then came on to testify, the testimony of Senator McClellan has already said has placed before the jury that this testimony does indicate that the Committee was deprived of evidence which would have -- documents which did impede the inquiry of the -- of the Committee.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1645.955" stopTime="1649.069">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And they introduced them on the grounds of pertinency, is that right?
speaker="john_cardinal" startTime="1649.069" stopTime="1706.496">
    Mr. John Cardinal 
    That was one of the grounds that they attempted to justify it on. 
    It -- grounds that these names listed on the invoice were pertinent because the special findings that had been concluded by the Committee prior to the issuance of the subpoena served upon the petitioner where in some form some manner connected with the teamster's union. 
    The petitioner was neither called before the Committee at that time. 
    None of the people other than this Christmas gift -- list were all known to him. 
    He was not present and the entire findings of the Committee were in a form of ex parte entered against the petitioner.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1706.496" stopTime="1709.845">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was that evidence objected to?
speaker="john_cardinal" startTime="1709.845" stopTime="1811.244">
    Mr. John Cardinal 
    The evidence of all of these was subjected too repeatedly. 
    Particularly the interim report which at first was sustained, the objection was sustained then the senator said, “The reason we want these names are pertinent is that we are interested in the use of the union funds for the payment of Christmas gifts. 
    The trial judge let it in for that purpose. 
    It's a completely none secretive because he talks about the rise of Dorfman to a power of eminence in the insurance field after the death of his predecessor referring that maybe the petitioner had something to do with Dorfman's predecessor's death. 
    That was led in for that specific purpose at the time that the counsel went over the exhibits that went into the record. 
    The Court at page 212 and 213 of the record refused to let the interim report go to the jury because he said he did not feel that it was pertinent, material to the matters that we have here. 
    But you may argue it and argue with the prosecutor did because at 335, he points out, I think it's 335, I'm not sure of that page, points out that the reason the put this in was to show that Presser had knowledge that they were investigating these men and therefore tore the invoice.

    He was convicted of defacing one document in concealing or destroying another. 
    The issue presented is whether knowing obstruction of this inquiry is excused because a subpoena for the documents was signed in blank by the chairman of the Committee. 
    As Judge Weinfeld in a similar case where there was no subpoena stated, it is here whether in effectiveness of inquiries depends upon “the result in a raise” between the marshal to serve process for the production of documents and those bent on their destruction in their endeavor to obstruct the administration of justice.”

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Petitioner also questions the admissibility of certain testimony by Senator McClellan as well as whether certain of that testimony should have been permitted to go before the jury. 
    Briefly certain facts are important. 
    The McClellan Committee was established by resolution to inquire into improper practices in the labor management relations field. 
    It was given powers in accordance with statute, statute quoted at pages 2 and 3 of the petitioner's brief, 2 U.S.C. 190b which includes the power to require by subpoena or otherwise the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary materials. 
    The Committee investigated the misuse of union funds to influence public officials, to enrich union officials and the domination of, the possible domination of unions by persons outside. 
    It issued in March of 1958 a report of finding with respect to the teamsters union. 
    Thereafter a subpoena was issued for the production of documents to Joint Council 41 of which the petitioner was the president. 
    At the trial of this case, it was developed that that subpoena was probably signed in blank by Senator McClellan. 
    Pursuant to the arrangements between the lawyers for Joint Council 41 and the attorneys for the Committee, there were several deliveries of documents pursuant to that subpoena. 
    That was in the time subsequent to March 1958. 
    In the late summer, while this inquiry was going on, the late summer of 1958, the Committee was informed by counsel for the teamsters union and its provisional president that a clean up Commission had been formed of which former Senator Bender was the chairman. 
    The Committee turned its attention in part as part of its inquiry in relationships or the possibility of relationships between former Senator Bender and the teamsters union and as part of the ongoing inquiry in Ohio the investigators of the Committee were instructed to pursue an inquiry into a possible relationship. 
    Pursuant to these instructions, the Committee's investigator, Sheridan, called upon the offices of Joint Council 41 to review documents, if any, which should not get and produce in response to the subpoena issued six months prior to that time. 
    The petitioner was agreeable to the inspection of the files in that office and the investigator spent the day reviewing those files. 
    He found an invoice described by petitioner's counsel as the Doich Invoice showing gifts to champagne masters, large champagne bucket in which you put a champagne bottle, expensive gifts to former Senator Bender to another Ohio political figure, to officers of the union, and others. 
    He also found a yellow memorandum page, yellow pad page, on which names of recipients of gifts were listed, including the recipients of the champagne masters as well as other names. 
    He asked the petitioner for permission to take four folders of documents included in which were these two papers; the invoice and the yellow memorandum page. 
    The petitioner stated that he was agreeable and then said that he wish to photostat the documents so that he needed to retain them. 
    The investigator said that that was agreeable and an agreement was made that the documents would be left and photostats would be made and they would be turned over directly thereafter. 
    Four days later, the investigator returned pursuant to telephone arrangements with the petitioner, returned to the office to pick up the four file folders. 
    Upon the arrival, the petitioner handed in the file folders and the investigator leafed through them and found that the invoice had been mutilated to tear off the bottom portion which listed the eight names of recipients of the gifts of champagne masters. 
    The yellow memorandum page was missing entirely. 
    The investigator called this to the attention of the petitioner and said, “I should have known better than to have trusted you” and the petitioner's response was, “You have your job to do, I have mine.” 
    Petitioner was indicted for concealment of these documents under Section 1505 of Title 18 which makes it a crime corruptly to obstruct the due and proper inquiry of a Committee Congress. 
    He was charged, pardon me, he was charged with concealment well knowing that the documents were sought, that they were pertinent to the inquiry and required to be produced and sentenced upon conviction by a jury to eight months confinement. 
    It is the position of the Government that Section 1505 of Title 18 does not require a subpoena. 
    The elements of this crime are four. 
    First, that the general subject matter -- pardon.

    What I'd like to discuss is rather fully and I think why. 
    I have issued a lot of subpoena. 
    Before issuing and trying to get a piece of paper even when I wanted them to consent I carefully drew up what was I consider to be a valid subpoena, gave it to him and notified him and told him that a great deal of time could be saved if they would simply let our people look at it. 
    And say wanted to, they can look at it there and didn't have to go to the extent and trouble bring it up. 
    But it never occurred to me at this time, I do not know that anyone saw that we could preempt people from doing what they feel with that papers merely by notifying that we would want them in the future.

    This is not a prosecution here for failure to produce the documents. 
    I certainly would not wish to say that where a subpoena which the respondent could show was invalid had been served that he could be prosecuted for failing to produce.

    I'd certainly say it's our position that it's a crime to hide from the process server and then take the time and go destroy your documents where the process seeks the production of documents. 
    The situation that we have is that the documents are destroyed. 
    They're no longer possible to be brought into the forum, the judicial forum, the Committee forum and the person has taken the law into his own hands to make them no longer available. 
    We're not saying that the objections and complaints which the person wishes to raise and the Committee's interest in the documents to its right to the documents cannot have full process before the Committee. 
    Here the petitioner chose to act in the time he bought by making an agreement with the investigator and to produce the documents after photostat and the time that he bought and destroyed it and by doing that, he brought himself within this statute.

    The petitioner's second question concerning the admissibility of certain of the testimony of Senator McClellan as well as whether that testimony should have been heard before the jury; on this the short answer in the view of the Government is that this testimony as can be demonstrated quite clearly from the review of it and it's covered in the Government's brief subsequent to page 36.

    Well the -- I think I really didn't complete my answer to your question. 
    The names and identification of the persons to whom these gifts were given also was important to show that these documents contained information which the petitioner would have a motive for keeping from the Committee. 
    I think it also is important that the Government had the burden to show knowledge on the part of the petitioner that these documents were sought by the Committee and were pertinent to its inquiry. 
    Now this report from which that statement was read also mentioned by name, Mr. Presser, and I think it was part of the Government's case or it was able to present to the jury that report as providing an inference that the report's contents came to the potential --

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Mr. Justice Brennan, the Court's charge and the statement of the prosecution in the record show a careful attention to that and I think it's important that every instruction requested by the petitioner was given by the Court and that he was asked twice whether he had objections in accordance with Rule 30. 
    He was asked in the presence of the jury, his lawyer, and after the jury was excused whether there were any objections to the charge, and he had none. 
    He received every instruction that he had a -- that he wished to request. 
    None were denied, although several of the Government's instructions were. 
    So I do believe that the jury was fairly portioned on the use of the evidence.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    I believe you're correct, Mr. Justice White. 
    I believe that there was a submission to the jury of the testimony from the report. 
    It's just that the Court said that the full report did not need to go to the jury.

    Mr. Pollak, what do you have to say about the question that was asked of Senator McClellan and his answer to the effect that what the conduct of the defendant had interfered with his Committee? 
    Now for a prominent man -- for a man of his stature to go before an ordinary lay jury and state as his conclusion, the ultimate fact that they were required to determine that the man had obstructed the work of his committee. 
    Do you think that's inconsequential or first, do you think it's -- do you think it was proper to ask that question to get that answer?

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Well I can't review --

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    I think that -- had the question not been answered -- asked that the Government's case would have been as well presented because I believe that the --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh no, that is -- that isn't the question. 
    I asked you Mr. Pollak, do you think it's a proper question or improper? 
    Then we can discuss whether if you say it isn't, then we can discuss whether it was prejudicial or not but do you believe that was a proper question and a permissible answer.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Well, I believe that in these proceedings, the counsel or not uncommon for the chairman of these committees to have been called as witnesses by the Government or the defense and I believe further that I can't testify from the records in those cases but that the course of the proceedings are testified too and that a question whether the loss of these documents was an impedance of the Committee's work is a proper -- is a proper question for the chairman of the Committee to respond to it. 
    Also, the statute here covers endeavor to obstruct and I do not believe that the answer to the question really caused any --

    During the course of Senator McClellan's testimony, there were general objections to perhaps --

speaker="stephen_j_pollak" startTime="3868.399" stopTime="3905.510">
    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Yes, there were general objections throughout and I was going to say I believe that probably have been objective to it, yes. 
    I do believe that the evidence given to the answer was merely cumulative to what was a matter which even this Court could determine that as a matter of law, these documents were pertinent to the inquiry of the Committee. 
    If pertinent, then their destruction was an impedance to the Committee or Government attempt to impede.
