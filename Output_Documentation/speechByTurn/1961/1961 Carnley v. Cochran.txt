Carnley v. Cochran

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 158, Willard Carnley, Petitioner, versus H.G. Cochran, Jr., Director of the Division of Corrections. 
    Mr. Mahorner, you may continue your argument.
speaker="james_g_mahorner" startTime="16.133" stopTime="345.446">
    Mr. James G. Mahorner 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    We have attempted to illustrate that there are no unu -- unusual happenings in the trial of the present petitioner which indicates an unfairness on the part of the court or the prosecution. 
    There is not alleged any feeble not -- or youthfulness by the petitioner. 
    There's one other factor that should be considered before this Court -- before this case can be said to be within the Betts v. Brady ground, and that is whether this particular charge, or the particular charge of the incest child fondling was so complex that it required a counsel to represent the petitioner, otherwise, he was not given fair play. 
    Now, there were some supposed complexities in this charge. 
    The petitioner was indicted on two counts, incest and child fondling. 
    It could be said that it should have been only one crime. 
    A coun -- counsel could have require -- might have persuaded the court to sentence on only one crime, but it was decided in the petitioners favor by sentencing petitioner within the permissible term allowed under either count rather than sentencing petitioner two consecutive -- to two consecutive terms, one under each count. 
    Now, it's been brought up that the Court had the discretion of giving psychiatric treatment to the petitioner. 
    However, it is not alleged and it is not the case that such psychiatric treatment is in lieu of sentence. 
    It's in addition to sentence. 
    It is something that takes place before sentencing. 
    Before trial, the man still goes on trial. 
    The Court could have exercised this discretion to -- to give psychiatric treatment that the man had no legal right to psychiatric treatment. 
    There is always present an element of discretion in the Court. 
    The Court could have sentenced the man to only one year, but the question of complexity comes up not in discretion, but where -- where the Court, where we have a legal issue, where it becomes mandatory on the Court to give this man a sentence on only one count because the two counts constitute one, where possibly there is no crime for assault to commit second degree murder, where there is a legal right involved and not where there's a discretionary right involved. 
    And we say here that there was no unusual dis -- legal right involved which was not in the ultimate decided in favor of petitioner. 
    Furthermore, in the case of Bute v. Illinois, the same crime was before the court -- before this Court. 
    And there was no finding that this -- this type of crime involves such complexities that a counsel per se was needed. 
    Now, we are faced -- we feel at this point that all we have is that conceding for the sake of argument, the petitioner did successfully alleged indigent so I brought it up that it was not alleged in his original petition and it's somewhat ambiguously alleged in his reply brief in reply to our response. 
    But assuming that he's alleged in a -- and assuming that he's successfully, which he definitely has alleged lack of education, we have no other factors which do not coincide with Betts v. Brady. 
    In Betts the man was indigent. 
    In Betts the man who was a farm laborer as indicated by the dissent which is certainly valid for supp -- supporting the factual situation surrounding the case. 
    The indication is, though not direct, the man as a farm laborer did not have a great deal of education. 
    We now come to whether Betts v. Brady should be overruled. 
    Yesterday, I had attempted to lay what turned out to be a fallacious argument because my original premise was wrong and ideas that Mapp v. Ohio did not have a retrospect effect. 
    We do just want to say in passing that unless the Court is prepared to release every man who is now serving any sentence no matter whether they were convicted 20 to 60 to 70 years ago if he's serving a life sentence on the grounds that at his trial, there was the illegably obtained evidence used or on the grounds that at his trial, there was lack of counsel. 
    And they are not prepared to give this great retrospect to -- effect to these two cases, assuming that Betts v. Brady is reversed, well then, they cannot consistently allow Betts v. Brady to be reversed on collateral attack by habeas corpus but should wait until it's being -- until there is a chance to reverse it on direct attack by a direct review of a lower state decision.

    Mr. James G. Mahorner 
    They probably would not, sir. 
    There certainly isn't enough to go around at this time for the – the backward places in Florida or they have less cosmopolitan. 
    Now, we're faced with this consistent argument of -- and the application of this argument of where a man is given the right to appeal, he must be given the – the right to appeal whether he is poor or whether he is wealthy. 
    However, the right to appeal is not a constitutional right. 
    It is something that has been given by the State. 
    I do not think this Court would hold it that if the Constitution specifically provided a right to hold property that the State was now under an obligation to give property to those people who did not have property. 
    There is a stronger argument where the State itself rather than in a Constitution, where the state tends to set out the mechanism that there is possible discrimination if the state does not carry it on through, and give it not only to the wealthy but to the poor. 
    But here, if it's an original right setup in the Constitution, such as property, could very well be by specific terms and possibly is by indirect terms, a direct specific term saying “You shall have the sacred right to hold property.” 
    I certainly do not think that reasoning would prevail that the State was now under an obligation to give the poor that right. 
    And likewise, where the Constitution said, “You shall have a right to have counsel,” the state should not be under the obligation to give the man that right if he himself cannot acquire it. 
    We feel that the background of England points that the – the common law background that this Constitution was originally constructed in points out that what this means in the same way that a term would have manically were given you the right to hold property where to meant that you have the right to acquire it if financially able that in -- in England at the time the Constitution was drawn up these amendments were put it in as late as 1838, a man was not allowed to come before the Court with counsel whatsoever regardless of his financial attributes, and at this provision the Constitution was put there for the purpose of overcoming this practice which was, by the way, highly criticized in England at that time. 
    Now, we further feel that a jury -- the right to jury could much more readily be interpreted as being required of the states than the right then that the states be required to appoint counsel. 
    Not only do you have to – apply in the counsel provision, not only do you have to first determine that you have the right to appear before a state court with counsel, which you have to do in determining the jury issue that you have this right to appear before the state court before a jury, but you also then have to go the further step of determining that if the man is indigent, the State must appoint counsel. 
    We further feel that an instrument such as the Constitution which provides that this man could serve as President of the United States or it could sit on this Court does not anticipate his being held to be in at able -- unable to defend himself when charged with a crime. 
    An instrument which gives him this much recognition certainly did not intend that he be held not able to represent himself when charged to the crime.

    The right to appeal is not given constitutionally. 
    It's given by the State. 
    It's something that is given by the State. 
    If the State sets it up then perhaps they should be required to care -- give it not only to one but to the other, but I say if the Constitution makes a provision giving you the right to hold property that now the State is not required to give you property so that you can exercise that right if as a matter of fact you don't have the financial ability to acquire property. 
    One place the -- the thing is put in motion by the State.

    Mr. James G. Mahorner 
    We feel that the State is not setting up this permission of counsel in all cases. 
    We feel that the Constitution has that – that the provision of the Constitution requiring counsel means -- in other words, you have interpreted different for your system -- for your particular federal system but you could have done that by rule of court, by rule of procedure. 
    What -- but it means that a man does have the right to appear before the court with counsel and we feel that the State could not remove this right, that the Sixth Amendment has done that, but it is something put in effect by the Amendment. 
    It is not something put in effect by the State such as appellate procedure, which is not put in effect at all by the Constitution but is only put in by the state.

    Now, if a man is to exercise an appeal, he has to come forward and show that he is indigent, otherwise, he in effect, has waived that right.

    We feel that under the Johnson v. Zerbst decision, they did not remand that case because there was lack of evidence that the man had waived but because there was no finding that the man had waived. 
    And the Court here, the Supreme Court of Florida did make a specific finding that the -- that the man had waived his right to counsel by not applying -- by not making a specific application to the Court for counsel as shown by the absence of such application in the record, in same manner that he would have waived any right to appeal by not making a specific application to the Court.
