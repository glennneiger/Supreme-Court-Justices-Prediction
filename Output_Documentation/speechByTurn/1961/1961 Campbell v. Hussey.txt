    Justice William O. Douglas 
    (Voice Overlap) you were saying just as we wrote yesterday that the presence of the blue ticket and the white ticket on a basket of tobacco meant that the basket sold for a lower price.
speaker="homer_s_durden_jr" startTime="26.484" stopTime="27.771">
    Mr. Homer S. Durden, Jr. 
    That is correct sir.

speaker="homer_s_durden_jr" startTime="35.539" stopTime="89.794">
    Mr. Homer S. Durden, Jr. 
    Frankly sir, I don't know unless we go back to the tobacco Act, Federal Tobacco Inspection Act in 1935, the Federal Act, where Congress stated that without uniform standards of classification and inspection, the evaluation of tobacco is susceptible to manipulation, control, and speculation and for that reason, it was necessary to have regulation by a single authority. 
    Otherwise, you have undue fluctuations in price which would impose an undue burden on interstate commerce for the sale of tobacco.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="89.794" stopTime="92.954">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    But the Federal Act doesn't regulate price, does it?
speaker="homer_s_durden_jr" startTime="92.954" stopTime="132.046">
    Mr. Homer S. Durden, Jr. 
    Oh no. 
    But the -- where you have dual regulation and we have for the Federal Act identifying tobacco in one amount and the Georgia Act identified in a different manner, the conflict is what led to what Congress said would happen undue fluctuations in price and I think that that Congress was -- you might say looking in a crystal ball and see and that this would happen, it did happen just like you said it would. 
    Have I answered the question sir?
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="132.046" stopTime="135.563">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Is this -- any of this in the record?
speaker="homer_s_durden_jr" startTime="135.563" stopTime="165.690">
    Mr. Homer S. Durden, Jr. 
    That was put in part of the Federal Act, sir. 
    Now, Mr. Cohn is going to handle the part of the case pertaining to the preemption by the Federal Government and in his brief and argument, he goes into the congressional record and to debate from the floor of Congress where these Congressmen expressed their feelings about the very point that you mentioned sir.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="165.690" stopTime="198.360">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    I can understand the difference in putting a blue tag and a white tag on, but why would that make any difference to the buyers of the big tobacco companies when they see the same constituencies and they know what the score is, why would they knock down 18 dollars a hundred on the same tobacco simply because it had a blue tag on it, rather than a white one?
speaker="homer_s_durden_jr" startTime="198.360" stopTime="235.176">
    Mr. Homer S. Durden, Jr. 
    Again, I was speculating sir. 
    It's not in the record. 
    We have no proof, but we have a condition in our tobacco growers where we have a huge number of growers with a small number of purchasers. 
    Those tobacco buyers know that where a man hauls his tobacco 400 or 500 miles to the market to sell it that he more or less has to take what they want to give him for it. 
    It would be prohibited for him to turn the sale down.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="235.176" stopTime="236.470">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    It does take it home.
speaker="homer_s_durden_jr" startTime="236.470" stopTime="284.025">
    Mr. Homer S. Durden, Jr. 
    That's right sir. 
    On the tobacco sales, the sale amount of tobacco is being sold, the floor man would put on the sheet the price and the purchaser's name or seller. 
    If I follow to that sale and I was not satisfied with that price, I would turn that sale by turning right there. 
    When I tear that tag that means that I'm dissatisfied with the price. 
    I can then take my tobacco up and carry it by home. 
    But if I haul it 400 or 500 miles, I can't. 
    It -- it'd be prohibited. 
    So they realize that they get offer me whatever they want and I more or less got to take it unless I live locally where I can turn it and bring it back and resell it tomorrow.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="284.025" stopTime="290.538">

    Mr. Homer S. Durden, Jr. 
    It could happen sir except for the fact that the blue tag is spotted as being -- tobacco has been hauled a long distance and they know just like when I use to have to haul my tobacco a 100 to 150 miles to South Georgia, I -- I would have to take a price a lot of times but I didn't want because I couldn't hold it back to my home and put it on market another time.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Durden, is there any -- is there any issue in this case as to the relative merits of the -- of this fruit type of tobacco that is grown in Georgia, and Alabama and the new so called New Belt on the one hand and that -- and that grown in the Carolina's or the other?
speaker="homer_s_durden_jr" startTime="637.517" stopTime="807.955">
    Mr. Homer S. Durden, Jr. 
    Maybe I can explain it to you Mr. Chief Justice in this way. 
    The appellants had a Doctor Sean, I believe what's his name, who is an agronomist from the Clinton Collage, he's a tobacco specialist and he explained to the trail court, that farther up the Belt you get the different nicotine content that you'd find in tobacco as a general rule. 
    Now there is -- there is no set rule. 
    In other words, I could plant ten hectares tobacco on my farm. 
    One side of my field, I'd have a light sandy lawn soil. 
    The other side, I have what we call a tipped and red pebble soil. 
    Well, the chemical characteristics and probably the nicotine content for the tobacco grown in the sandy lawn would be different from other. 
    There is no uniformity sir. 
    It's for that reason that this tobacco is aged for about three years after it's bought in the market. 
    Then as in this huge (Inaudible), then the chemist of the tobacco company, when they start of manufacture that into cigarette, they have to get in a sample of tobacco because you may have (Inaudible) tobacco just grown on 50 different falls. 
    And they take that tobacco and run that chemical analysis on the samples to see what must be added so that, they were getting uniformity of taste. 
    As you know, when you light up a cigarette, you smoke as one cigarette or one cigar, of course we're not dealing with cigar tobacco, which you smoke one cigarette because it has a taste that you like. 
    And when you light that cigarette, you expect to have the same taste that the previous cigarette that same brand have, so they must have uniformity. 
    And in order to get that uniformity, they run this chemical test to see what must be added to that tobacco. 
    And they add licorice, now honey, and the other flavors that make a Camel cigarette taste like Lucky Strike or Phillip Morris to get that uniformity. 
    So, there is -- there is nothing that you can say that is uniformed by tobacco. 
    It's -- you might say almost to carry an agent for this attitude -- added ingredients. 
    And each brand of cigarette has a certain percentage of what we call the premium grade tobacco and it also had a certain percentage of your rough trash you might say. 
    No one is monopolizing the -- cream of the crop you might say, but they -- they blend that. 
    It's a blend is what it is.

    No, you may have one auctioneer that would work for two different warehousemen. 
    He -- he is an employee by the warehousemen. 
    He gets a certain amount of each basket of tobacco he auctions on. 
    Your question sir, I don't know and I -- and I don't have the proof of why that first basket of tobacco sold for $61 a hundred pound. 
    And then when it realized that every blue tag tobacco, they refused to buy it at any products. 
    As you recall yesterday, I made the statement, that as soon as that buyer realized that it was a blue tag tobacco and he turned to the warehousemen, “I can't buy,” why, because it's blue tag.” 
    The next buyer (Inaudible) order, too much moisture content the he said, “Yes that's right” and it was at that point that we stopped the sale and had the Government grader to come back and regrade that part of tobacco. 
    And he regraded it, certified that it's in good order and we tried to sell it and we couldn't sell it. 
    Basket after basket after that, they refused to bid anything on blue tag tobacco. 
    Now, it has been stipulated that as much as $18 a 100 difference in the price of blue tag tobacco and the white tag tobacco. 
    On the first --

    Right. 
    Also, the (Inaudible) grade of Carolina tobacco by the Government grade, sold for less and identical grade of Carolina -- or Georgia tobacco until the blue tags are removed. 
    And the record will show that after the first two days, when we got a restraining order, when the Judge Collet signed a preliminary restraining order and the blue tags were removed that the Carolina tobacco sold right on par with the Georgia tobacco. 
    The price disparity disappeared. 
    They can no longer pick it out. 
    I wish I had the evidence sir, to answer your question. 
    I don't have it, but it is another case of where you have a huge number of producers with a small number of purchasers and it could very easily work into collusion, control, speculation and manipulation just as Congress said. 
    Now, we were selling to thousands of tobacco buyers.

    Mr. Homer S. Durden, Jr. 
    Thank you sir. 
    At the trial in this case before the three-judge federal court, I had my client go into warehouse and pull five samples of tobacco. 
    Two of those samples were taken from a pile of Carolina tobacco. 
    Three of those samples were taken from pile of Georgia tobacco that the government grader has said was the identical grade as far as the Government was concerned. 
    As I recall, they were grade B foil. 
    I could be wrong on that. 
    Every witness, including the warehousemen that we represented, the specialist in Clinton College, the Mr. Nutz who was the representative for the Universal Tobacco Company, we would ask them to pick out which tobacco came in Carolina, which tobacco came from Georgia. 
    They could not do it. 
    Now, the reason they couldn't do it so, most of this tobacco that we've grown, see the grown and gathered it in North Carolina and carried to South Georgia where it's planted in plant beds in the early December. 
    Those have to be kept under can, tobacco (Inaudible) and all up along in March, these commercial plant growers sell their plants. 
    They own up five or six inches high. 
    In the fall the buyers of those plants transplants that tobacco. 
    I may buy a truck load of tobacco plants from that farmer, plant it on my farm, under the Georgia Act, that's Type 14 tobacco. 
    From that same plant bed, grown from their identical seed, a man from North Carolina may plant -- this type 13 or type 12 or type 11, according to where he happens to replant it, it is the same tobacco. 
    Tobacco is nothing but a weed. 
    Now, these experts are good. 
    They can come along on the sale and they can tell whether it's the looks or the (Inaudible) or the tips. 
    You see, tobacco stock has some 20-24 leaves. 
    The lower leaves, we call the sun leaves and they can examine those. 
    The government graded can examine it and tell you right quick. 
    It's a sun leaves. 
    Then we have our prime leaves which are the middle leaves and they can be -- the difference from those can be told and then we have our tips which are usually much small. 
    So they know the tobacco. 
    It stands the reason at this cigarette company with a millions of dollars invested, they have to know tobacco. 
    And if there was any difference in the Georgia grown tobacco and the Carolina tobacco, they would pick it out, but they're just not. 
    If there is no other question, my time has run out. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Sherman L. Cohn
speaker="sherman_l_cohn" startTime="1290.580" stopTime="1292.384">
    Mr. Sherman L. Cohn 
    Mr. Chief Justice --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1292.384" stopTime="1319.271">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I wonder if you could take two minutes of your time to state explicitly and with as much detail as it's relevant just what the items of collision are between the Federal Act and its implementing regulations and the legislation which you say must fall because of the overriding authority of that body of federal law.
speaker="sherman_l_cohn" startTime="1319.271" stopTime="1587.225">
    Mr. Sherman L. Cohn 
    The Federal Act Your Honor has as its prime purpose and it is set out in the act, it is set out in the legislative history, the creation of a uniform, classification, standard system of tobacco. 
    Now, the Act itself says, “Uniform standards for classification and inspection of tobacco, Section 2.” 
    They repeat it. 
    The legislative history is build up with -- with the controversy between the proponents of the Act who claim that uniform standards of classification were necessary and the opponents who said, “No, this is a local problem, leave it up to the States.” 
    Congress in adopting the Act, adopted the argument of the proponents, and in fact as I said, put it into the Act itself. 
    Now, the Secretary of Agriculture, under the authority granted him in the statute has established seven different classes of tobacco, the 27 different types, perhaps there's as many as 200 different grades et cetera down the line. 
    He has also said, that the tobacco of the identical -- the characteristics, the same quality, and length, and moisture and so on and so forth shall be type identically, no mater where it may have been grown by the accidents of geography. 
    In other words, the tobacco grown on one side in Savannah, the River, the tobacco grown on the other side, if it has the same characteristics physically, it will have the same type whether that'd be 14 or 13 or 12 or what have you. 
    Now, the State of Georgia -- I mean, we continue one more point. 
    The Act also has as its purpose not just the establishment of classification and standards in vacuum, but the communication of those standards to the buyer and the seller in order to bring some order to the chaos that range at -- ranged in the tobacco markets before 1935. 
    Legislative history is full of descriptions of the way this, as my friend said, “The thousands of the tobacco farmers were --” well the words -- the one Congressman was subject to the wholesale of robbery by the few buyers and speculators mainly because the farmer did not know what type and grade of tobacco he had. 
    The buyers had their own systems. 
    The farmers might have a system and there was just mass confusion. 
    The Congress, as I said, wanted this information of the classification of a particular lot tobacco to communicate to the buyer and the seller. 
    It gave authority for this to the Secretary. 
    The Secretary set forth two requirements for the communication, one, that the type and the grade, now not just the grade but the type and the grade it says in the regulations, be on the warehouse ticket that is on the basket then secondly, that the auctioneer when he begins the auction of a lot of tobacco shall to publicly announce this information, so that the buyers and the sellers know what they are dealing with. 
    That is the federal statute. 
    The state --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1587.225" stopTime="1595.719">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All that def -- they're carrying out those two definitions as the type and grade, that's all pre-determined before the auction begins?
speaker="sherman_l_cohn" startTime="1595.719" stopTime="1703.320">
    Mr. Sherman L. Cohn 
    That is correct. 
    As I understand it, about an hour or so before the auction starts, one or more federal inspectors start to go down the road one-by-one. 
    There maybe one inspector to a small warehouse. 
    There maybe as many as three or five in a large warehouse and they inspect each basket of tobacco; they pull out different leaves from different -- different areas within the basket to get what they consider, a represented its sample. 
    And then they make this determination, what is the type, what is the grade? 
    Now, I might point out at this point that if an interest deportee, either the farmer or somebody who buys a tobacco is unhappy about the -- the typing and grading, he can ask the original inspector to re-inspect, to reclassify. 
    He can also call in that inspector's supervisor who is -- probably in the same warehouse if -- if not his in the same locality to re-inspect. 
    And finally, there is an appeal, the procedure to the Tobacco Division of Agriculture Department and they have the field offices with some one designated to do it so that there would be a day or maybe two days to lay that, but as you say, this is all done before the -- the actual auction. 
    At the time of the auction, this information is publicly announced. 
    Now, the Georgia has come in --

    You will not only one more, but you would have a different one using the same terminology. 
    You would also have -- you -- all that Georgia has done here, and I want to point this out because I think it is very important. 
    All that Georgia has done here is to set up a definition for type number 14. 
    If they are permitted to do this, I see no legal distinction why they cannot come in and set up their own standard for 168 different grades for type 13, 12 and 11. 
    I -- I don't see why North Carolina can't do the same thing etcetera and etcetera, going right back to where we start it from 1935.

    Well, it -- it may be in the sense that once the buyer and the seller knows what the type and grade is at a particular basket of tobacco. 
    Now, after all there are certainly impurely of grade, everybody agrees with that. 
    There is some controversy as to whether one type is better than another. 
    I -- I refuse to get into that, but the -- there are certainly impurely of grades. 
    There are grades that there are -- there's a tobacco that is water logged in which case it gets a certain grade or if it is too dry or if it's tore or what you have you, this all goes into the grading system. 
    So, once the buyer and seller know what the type and grade of tobacco is, they have the basis to bargain.

    Now, there was a purpose for putting that in. 
    The purpose was pointed out by the Secretary when he first promulgated these regulations. 
    The Secretary said that it is not possible without a considerable detail, to specify all of the sections in which a certain type is produced, or to include all the local names. 
    He went on that in the present classification, now this is the first time he promulgated these -- these standards, in the present classification, it has been the purpose of the department to use a sufficient number of names to identify each type of tobacco, to supplement this information, the principal sections in which each type is produced are also shown.

    -- because they used Type 14. 
    If they would only use grown in Georgia, then we would have a different situation. 
    But the fact is they have used a phrase the Type 14, which has a specific meaning in the (Inaudible) and what they are doing, even if they are coincidently -- even if they are assisting the Government and there are many cases -- I mean the Santa Fe Elevator case (Inaudible) and many others, where this -- this Court has said that where Congress has acted, the States cannot and assist.

    Could I put -- put that question for you a little bit. 
    Supposing Georgia had said, “We describe this tobacco in the very words of the federal regulation” according to page 8, but in addition, we want a blue tag to put on to make it easier to people to identify, would that come in to conflict with the federal regulation?

    Mr. Sherman L. Cohn 
    There is no practical conflict, but there is this. 
    There is a different requirement on the warehousemen. 
    There is the fact that they are coming into an area on which Congress through its own and through the Secretary of Agriculture as the fully (Inaudible) I mean there's no argument there. 
    The -- the Townsend case was brought up yesterday as an -- an example where the Congress under -- of this Act did not preempt a field, but that was a different subject in Townsend. 
    But in this subject, the subject or classification and identification of the -- of the tobacco who -- and Congress through the Secretary of Agriculture has fully legislated and as this Court has stated many times that the State cannot come in even to the aid of Congress that they cannot make any additional or supplemental regulations.

    Alright.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2939.095" stopTime="2956.498">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that you don't make sub two things that are different namely, (1) that the state has added or subtracted or qualifed a requirement of federal law.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And (2), a totally different problem even if the State had harmoniously supplemented the federal law may do so. 
    Now those are very different three -- very different questions and what I want to know is that the clarity that has not yet been conveyed to me at least which this case is has Georgia done anything to the regulations, implementing the statute whereby it has made in-roads upon those regulations, either by adding or subtracting or making a differentiation in the practical enforcement of what the Secretary has done and was authorized to do.

   Argument of Denmark Groover, Jr.
speaker="denmark_groover_jr" startTime="3507.632" stopTime="3578.484">
    Mr. Denmark Groover, Jr. 
    Thank you sir. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, let me say at the outset that if the federal inspector had classified the South Carolina and North Carolina tobacco as Type 14 and was dust-free and was precluded under the Georgia Act from having a white tag place their own, we have no case. 
    We cannot conflict with the Federal Government and with duly authorize the regulations all with the statute and we recognize it, but we say there is no conflict. 
    Let's keep in mind that the very definition that is described to Type 14 tobacco and may I say at the outset I hope the Court will keep firmly in mind that there is a difference between type and between grades. 
    A type is a broad general classification with that, we have adopted a -- the State of Georgia has adopted the federal government's definition. 
    There is absolutely no effort on the part of the State of Georgia in its acts or otherwise, to tamper with, change or in anyway communicate grade.

    Grade is merely a subdivision type?
speaker="denmark_groover_jr" startTime="3580.698" stopTime="3595.862">
    Mr. Denmark Groover, Jr. 
    Grade is a subdivision of type Your Honor and grade as said by Mr. Durben is the place where the -- where price is determined. 
    It's just like the difference between a Kansas City State Prime and a St. Louis Missouri State Prime.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3595.862" stopTime="3605.048">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    But how can you say there's not a conflict when the regulation says that Type 14 shall be made regardless of geographical or --
speaker="denmark_groover_jr" startTime="3605.048" stopTime="3634.143">
    Mr. Denmark Groover, Jr. 
    I'm saying Your Honor that that's supposing the possibility of a conflict and we have here a record before this Court in which there is not one iota of evidence to -- in the infirmity and indeed if the evidence is in the contrary that none of this tobacco that was brought down there, even on the 29.1096, the broad general classification would have or was classified as Type 14.

    Mr. Denmark Groover, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    He could classify there's Type 14 Your Honor but he has not done so and -- and the complainants themselves in their complaint said that there're all be inspector.

    Mr. Denmark Groover, Jr. 
    That's on the page 8 of the Government's brief. 
    He says that Type 14 and incidentally, the general broad, general classification is CFR 29.1096. 
    This is 29.1100 which follow. 
    Type 14 is, and this is Secretary's definition, that type of flue-cured tobacco commonly known as Southern Flue-cured or New Belt of Georgia, Florida and Alabama produced principally in the Southern section of Georgia and if I may interpolate, produced to some extent in Florida and Alabama. 
    Now, it seems to me that that absolutely excludes under the present pending definition.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3748.250" stopTime="3750.881">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, no, principally to me means principally.

    Yes, sir but if you don't --

    And if said -- say included those minor situations, Florida and Alabama and since in this record, if Your Honor please, defendant's exhibit one shows a map promulgated and it's identified as the defendant's exhibit one shows a map which outlines the various types and in this map it show -- itself shows that which has been described as an official determination of the Secretary of Agriculture shows that the Type 14 is grown only in Georgia, Florida and Alabama. 
    Now, I do admit sir that there is the possibility that a man across the Savannah River, right across could grow Type 14 tobacco and that the Secretary on the 10.96 might subsequently could classify it as Type 14, but if this Court said in (Inaudible) against the United States, we've got a set of concrete facts here that Secretary has identified it as Georgia, Florida and Alabama.

    No dispute and that's right and if of course because that would give raise to the passage of this act. 
    We can of course be in conflict regardless of how (Inaudible) the act maybe but we say Your Honor, we have not in conflict because this plaintiff has brought this case here, is a warehouseman. 
    So far as this Court knows, so for as the world knows, there is not now in existence any human being on earth who does produce even though he might produce Type 14 tobacco outside of the States of Georgia, South Carolina and Florida and it seems to me that the only way that this Act can be said to be in conflict is based on the outside possibility that at some future date, someone may come in to exist into on to Federal regulation would have Type 14 and would then be precluded on the Georgia regulation. 
    That's time enough for that person to complain as you said in the (Inaudible) against the United State. 
    Now, here's what they say and here's the real complaint, this is paragraph 12 of the complaint, which is on page 5 of the record and under which they come to this Court, this case gets to this Court, under the federal law just mentioned, official graders of the United States, official graders of the United States, Department of Agriculture grade each sheet of tobacco or pile of tobacco, immediately prior to it's sale so that said official grade may be established. 
    This grade is the official grade of the United States. 
    Now, the grade, if Your Honors will turn page 39 of the Government's brief and look at Section 511 (g), the grade of the tobacco is the thing that the Congress of the United States was interested in communicating to the purchasers for they say, and this is in the Act no and not the regulation, “Warehousemen shall provide space on warehouse tickets or other tags or labels used by them for showing the grade of the like covered, thereby as determined and authorized by the tobacco inspector. 
    The Secretary may prescribe by regulation the form in which sets the deep certification of grade shall be shown and may require that a copy of it. 
    Now, the Secretary has gone on and prescribed a regulation which includes type, grade and so forth but his employees have not put it on there. 
    No way on any of these blue tags that you have because they have designation that this is in fact Type 14 tobacco. 
    If it is -- if the South Carolina tobacco was Type 14 under the federal definition and has so been classified by their inspectors, we would've been in violation of the constitution in trying to put a blue tag on.

    No sir. 
    The -- the position of the Department of Agriculture as revealed by the record, I think we must imparted one its employees would not have been there testify was favorable to -- this act and that there was no conflict in our definition. 
    The map itself shows it. 
    The record also demonstrates that the Secretary or somebody pursuant to a party from the Secretary put the same proposition in, in the State of Florida and only lifted it when the temporary injunction was issued against the --

    Mr. Denmark Groover, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    Yes sir. 
    Your Honor, may I take this to say why? 
    This Court as I don't believe that we have given -- been fair to -- and telling you exactly what gave rise to this litigation, what's the dollars and cents about this as Mr. Justice (Voice Overlap)
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4489.659" stopTime="4492.039">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Because it has something to do with all their concerns, does it?
speaker="denmark_groover_jr" startTime="4492.039" stopTime="4800.729">
    Mr. Denmark Groover, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    Maybe too many dollars and too few cents on some, but this -- there are two things that Georgia was interested in -- in protecting. 
    Type 14 as it revealed by page 115 of the record has special qualities, just like if a man goes to the grocery store and he wants some garlic salt instead of some onion salt, he will pay more for the garlic salt than he would for the onion. 
    It won't fit in the recipe. 
    They -- they buy this tobacco as Type 14 and they ship it all over the world, 24 million pounds, the previous year of South Carolina tobacco had come on out in the market to the extent that they occupy 17% of our total market and thus Georgia was loosing its identity. 
    Now, the second and a very important thing is if we sell out tobacco in Georgia, Florida and Alabama loose, that is in tangled leaf form. 
    The other, the market sell it in tied form, they have to type by the in so that the machine -- the manufactures pick it up and can handle it manually. 
    Well with this tremendous influx of -- of the loose leaf tobacco that would normally be so typed, coming in to our market, we were threatened with the loss and as testified by an employee of the Department of Agriculture, we will -- we were threatened with a loss of our untied tobacco market. 
    Now, that meant this to us. 
    It meant first by our sense of pound if we could possibly type and second the record demonstrates beyond question that because of the show occurrences, we couldn't typed our tobacco so it is we passed this Act, and who were the people that come here complaining? 
    It's not the grower in South Carolina, the man who possibly could have full Type 14 tobacco. 
    I don't know. 
    It's not him but it's the warehousemen who have built their tobacco warehouses based on being able to sell other than any product properly identified. 
    Now, it may well be Mr. Justice Whittaker that the reason the buyers wouldn't pay on blue tag tobacco, the same price they would pay for it in -- for the white tag is because they wanted to discourage this loose leaf influx too on account manufacturing culture but does not state of Georgia's activity. 
    That maybe -- it maybe the counsel for the warehousemen, and the Department have a case against them for conspiracy, but not to strike down an Act designed and passed to protect the vital industry, the largest single of cash crop in our home state, and not to be stricken down if this Court pleases on this acquisition that at some future date, possibly that could arise a conflict. 
    Now, on the only question of preemption, if you look at the act itself I think it would be different -- it will be shown (Inaudible), shows that Congress did not intent to preempt it as to type and identification. 
    If I -- well, let me shows the appointment of inspectors in cooperation with other people, other States with the States. 
    511 (m) shows cooperation, 511 (b) gives to the man, the Secretary the Power to designate a market or to fail to designate a market and certainly Congress would not had left undesignated markets and refuse the State to act and to protect though, 511 (g) shows that the ticket is only to show the grade. 
    Now, on page 18 and 19 of the Government brief, it's demonstrated that beyond question that the -- what the Federal Government is interested in is caliber not classification and that was what they were interested in and what they were interested in, identifying caliber B and grade and type B in classification when that -- this act was passed, because Congressmen have for the majority says, “We won't -- it would be a service to have this tobacco graded according to United States standards of quality. 
    Tobacco Inspection will bring a more uniform class and spoke -- of the advantages of having a standard grade and either the acquisition. 
    They talked in times of grading and the only communication contained in the act itself required to be given under the Federal Act is -- that of a grade and Section 511 (i) (b) shows -- shows that 511 (i) (c) that shows the Commission for somebody else to put another type card on here just as long as it didn't say it's an official in the United States Court. 
    It makes it a misdemeanor for any person not an authorized inspector under this chapter. 
    The issue is certificate or reports stating type, grade, size or condition of any a lot to be in accordance with standard United States, therefore which is of search color, which is of search color, size, arrangement or wording as to be mistaken for a certificate issued under this chapter.
