National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Button

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 5, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Petitioner, versus Frederick T. Gray, Attorney General of Virginia. 
    Mr. Carter.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="16.680" stopTime="166.178">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Your Honor, on reargument, if I may, I think that it would be helpful for the Court to have a full statement of the facts in this case. 
    The one statute which is before the Court which we allege and contend is unconstitutional, was a Virginia statute which was enacted with the extra session in 1956 and which statute amended the Virginia bars to running and capping to include the -- an organization which retained an attorney or compensated an attorney in -- or attorneys in matters in which he’d have no pecuniary right or liability and which also made it a crime for organizations to solicit business for attorneys. 
    The statute subjected the attorneys who were involved to disbarment and made the activities on the part of the organization a misdemeanor. 
    On the theory that this statute was a part of a package of anti NAACP laws and was in fact aimed at the petitioner and designed to run the petitioner out of business and in fact to a part of the Virginia’s massive resistance plan to school -- to school desegregation, we brought proceedings in the federal court, attacking this statute and four others. 
    As the Court knows, three of these statutes were construed by the federal court in NAACP versus Patty. 
    Appeal was brought to this Court and this -- the judgment below was set aside on the application of the doctrine of federal abstention. 
    I might add that since that time, those statutes had been in the Virginia state courts and they have -- a decision by the City Court of Richmond has struck those statutes down. 
    Two of the statutes, one of which is presently here was declared by the federal court in NAACP versus Patty to be too obscure for authoritative construction and understanding.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    But this is only in line with these Court’s decision that they question of lobbying when there is a direct contact with the legislature and then on that basis, the statute was upheld; that phase of it was upheld and was construed only to apply to that kind of activity. 
    Now the two statutes that were left was the statute which I have referred to and another, the -- we took the cases through the state courts, seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction. 
    The Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the statute which is now presently here and which we contended is illegal but struck the other one down. 
    So I think the --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="256.649" stopTime="257.588">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So we have just one here.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="257.588" stopTime="379.558">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Yes sir, just one statute at the present time. 
    Now, the -- as the NAACP is organized and I know that this is familiar to some of you, but I think that I should -- in view of the number of cases that had been here, but as the Association is organized, we have in Virginia the only aspect of it that I think is important to an understanding of this particular case, there is in Virginia a statewide organization which is called a State Conference. 
    It's composed of approximately 80 or 89 branches of the national organization. 
    These are unincorporated Associations. 
    There are groups -- with the -- a group of lawyers at the time of this proceeding and numbered 15, they called themselves “legal staff” a legal committee of the Virginia State Conference. 
    The Virginia State Conference and the officers and members of the organization, advocate the attack upon statutes and regulations which are discriminatory. 
    They urge people to take action against them to assert their rights. 
    These group of lawyers have been working together and they are the persons that will panel litigation which the NAACP brings in the Court or sponsors in the Court or pays for which are brought in the Court on a matter of which there is a concern about the issue of racial discrimination, school segregation and that cases -- and cases as they come. 
    Now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="379.558" stopTime="403.335">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The NAACP also has been active in litigation of somewhat different kind -- they're -- in the record I saw references to NAACP lawyers who would -- have been acting in criminal cases involving perhaps a white victim or colored defendant or vice versa.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="403.335" stopTime="462.836">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    We -- the Association is active in cases in the broad outline where an issue of racial discrimination is involved to test the constitutionality of state action or statute and where the matter would be of concern to Negroes or the club. 
    It is also active in cases, in criminal cases in which the Negro defendant is involved in which by virtue of a -- of what we believe to be a denial of due process, the administration of justice has -- there has been a failure of the administration's suggestion of justice and we think that this kind of case would be helpful to Negroes in order to secure a higher standard justice, an even handed justice is applied to them. 
    So that the only basis in which the Association takes the case, it is that, it's whether or not its belief that the resolution of the issue will have some effects on Negroes as a client.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="462.836" stopTime="486.877">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It seems to me I remember shortly before I left the Court of Appeals, there was a case from Michigan and the facts were that the defendant petitioner was a Negro and the victim had been a white person but the issues in the case were whether or not he had been wrongfully deprived of the counsel because he has pleaded guilty and denied trial in Michigan, they will take -- still take cases like that?

    Yes sir.

speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="490.266" stopTime="519.368">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    The issues are not racial issues on the surface whereas for example in some of the confession cases here and the case that you mentioned, the fact that Negroes has been denied the right of counsel or has been involved in an issue of forced confession or it has been a confession that has been beaten out of him and so forth, we take that case on the grounds that this does affect Negroes as a class and this will have some effect on -- beneficial effect in terms of the administration justice.

    Now, insofar as the -- how a case gets to or litigation gets to the Association in Virginia, the record discloses that the matter will get to the Association in one of several way. 
    One that a person may come -- we have office in Richmond, a State Conference Office in Richmond, a State office in Richmond with a paid full time executive officer who is not a lawyer, persons may come to that -- to Mr. Byrnes, the name of the executive secretary, complaining about an issue of discrimination, complaining that some action, something has happened to them or some action has been taken against them which is violated -- violative of their constitutional right. 
    Mr. Byrnes will refer this matter to a -- one of the lawyers to determine whether this is an appropriate case for the Association to concern itself. 
    Or the matter may come directly to one of the lawyers, one of the 15 or 16 lawyers on the -- on the legal staff, persons may come to them as for example in Norfolk or some other place and say that we would like you to come and speak to some parents, we're concerned about the fact that our children are still attending segregated school so we would like to you come and advice us on this matter.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, I hope this is -- it is hard to estimate that in various estimates given of it, Mr. Justice Clark, I think that the average is on some of these cases that it would cost between $5,000 and $10,000 at the present time to bring for example a school desegregation case prosecuted in the courts up to this level. 
    However, as you well know when the initial school desegregation, the matter was brought -- it required a considerable amount of -- larger amount sum of money. 
    And these things depend in large extent upon how many appeals have to be taken and things of that kind. 
    But I think in the record, the estimate is at one point or another that was about the present time about $5,000 to $10,000.

    The -- as I was referring now, the -- the second ways -- the certain manner in which cases are sponsored by us or the fees are paid by us is when the matters come to a lawyer and this lawyer will determine with the -- a chairman of the legal staff that this is a case of corporate or association intervention and the Virginia State Conference will then decide and determine that it will pay the Court cost and will -- counsel pleas.

    The cost would be paid to the attorney who is involved in terms of what his fee is and the payment would be made for whatever the brackets and briefs and court cost will be involved in this.

    We're dealing with a statute which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in which in my judgment at least, indicates and flatly asserts and construes the activities in which the Association is engaged in is a violation of the -- of the statute which is now before this Court and that we are engaged in what they say, running and capping and in the solicitation of business for attorneys and for that reason that we are guilty of [Inaudible] and the attorneys who are associated with us in handling of this kind of litigation would be subject -- subjected to disbarment.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Yes sir. 
    Now, I think that what has to be kept in focus it seems to me in the -- in any fair appraisal of the -- of this statute and this -- at the present time, is the fact of the Negro status in American life. 
    I think that this in terms of an interpretation of whether -- whether these activities are valid or invalid or whether they amount to [Inaudible] and so forth, I think that this has to be kept in focus because the -- as we know, in terms of the Negro in America and particularly in the South is that -- is an individual who has been economically and politically deprived and disadvantaged. 
    The Negro has not been able to have any effect upon the executive or legislative process, the state government for a long time. 
    This is changing because this certainly has been true. 
    And as a part of the effort for a Negro to secure equal rights, equal citizenship rights, his only the effective method up until the present time, has been largely to an attempt to bring test cases or have test cases brought which would determine whether various acts of the Government -- the state government were valid. 
    It should also be remembered that in this effort, the Negro as a class is arrayed against the whole panoply of state power and that the Association in the effort to encourage Negroes to assert their rights in an effort to find a way -- ways and means of having these rights adjudicated so that they can be [Inaudible], is in fact, it is -- it has to come almost -- the NAACP and the Negroes in terms of their rights are arrayed against the state government and that most of these actions and the fact of the matter was the action that's involved in this record which is before the Court, is an action involving the reach of state power whether or not the various acts are discriminatory or not. 
    This is not a -- any litigation that involves -- of the Association sponsors which involves private action or involves individuals as private persons. 
    What is involved in the litigation is -- is the question whether state action or state regulations as it affects Negroes, conforms the constitutional requirements. 
    And I think that it also has to be kept in mind in asserting the -- whether this constitutes [Inaudible] or not that these particular statutes which are now before this Court, the origin of the statute, its antecedents have to be kept in mind because this statute was a part of a package of statutes which were in turn a part of the effort of the State of Virginia to interpose massive resistance to the fundamental law as declared by this Court in respect to the school desegregation cases and of course, some of the statutes have been struck down and --

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, in the first place -- in the first place, I don't believe that the Association, in fact, channeled anything to any group of lawyers. 
    What really occurs is that in terms of this kind of litigation that we support is that persons come to the Association and there are lawyers who have -- who have been working, voluntarily working with the organization and have handled these kinds of things before have worked together on them before, either people come to them or they come to us, and in turn, we ask the lawyers to look into the matter to tell us what we should have.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, the fact to that matter, I don't think that there's anything in the record that would sustain the fact that we go to people under these circumstances at all. 
    What we do, do, and I think that the record is before the -- before the analysis of the record or the evidence in NAACP versus Patty which is the record is number 127 which was before this Court and the analysis of the record in this case and by the state court is entirely different. 
    The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, found that the calling of Mr. Hill for example, is one of the attorneys, a group of parents calling Mr. Hill to come to speak to a group of parents about an issue of discrimination or school problem, was going to autistic in and out. 
    And as a matter of fact, what has really occurred is that these people know and do know in most of these matters that we have a concern for these things and our branches have had meetings and all of this kind in terms of talking about the illegality of segregation. 
    The people get in touch with some person on the staff or a lawyer and say that we want to fight with action. 
    Now --

    On the bottom of the paragraph -- the paragraph that begins on the bottom of 15-A and runs over into 16-A, the Virginia Court points out that the difference in the evidence in this case, the additional evidence of this case, additional to that that was before the federal court in NAACP against Patty, is that inaccurate or incorrect?

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, let me put it this way, Your Honor. 
    The evidence that was before -- there is some additional evidence before the Court which the Court in reading the record will see before the state court in addition to the evidence before the -- before the federal court. 
    The evidence in fact shows that when the -- the item that I've mentioned to you before and that's a question that they had, a number of people testify that they had incomes of $5,000 or $4,000 of dollars. 
    That's in addition to the evidence before the federal court. 
    The other --

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    No sir. 
    I -- the -- we've made no issue of that. 
    The other matter which was before the Court was dealing with the -- with the kinds of issues which we had brought up in the school cases, showing how -- more in detail how Mr. Hill and some of the other lawyers and the Association got involved in the case. 
    But I think that any reading of the evidence on this fact that Mr. Bank's testimony before the federal court, Mr. Hill's testimony for the -- before the federal court, reveals that there is no difference in this regard in respect to the evidence into court.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, there were several instances testified about it and let me take just one of them, the case involving Charlottesville. 
    The evidence in the -- in the -- before the state court show, the issue was, how did Mr. Hill got involved in this. 
    Mr. Hill indicated that he had, for many years, had been known about the problem in Charlottesville, that he was active in the Association and that the people had been calling him, and at one point, when this particular case came up that the president of the branch, the local branch in Charlottesville, asked him to come to Charlottesville to speak to some parents who wanted some legal advice and who wanted to talk to him about that particular problem. 
    Mr. Hill went to that meeting and the issue was the question of segregation and Mr. Hill advised them as he had been advising that the only way they could have secure equal education opportunities was to -- was in his judgment was to make an attack on segregation. 
    Authorizations at that time were signed. 
    Some of which were addressed -- had his name on them, others were the forms that were out and he filled them in later and he then went to the NAACP State Conference. 
    There was this -- this decision was made and we should support the case and this is how we were involved.

    In this respect, Your Honor, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, seems to say exactly that, and I think in all fairness, I'll have to admit it does say that. 
    Although I may have this caveat that what it does say is that all of our activities that they have found them are violative of the statute. 
    It does say -- it says where we would find that would curtail our activities is to the extent that the NAACP in handling these kinds of cases only has a limited amount of funds. 
    It has attempted to use these with as much -- to make them go as far as they can. 
    This decision would seem to indicate the best lawyers, the lawyers who are connected with the association who know most and about the whole issue of racial segregation and the law who are most interested in this matter would be the lawyers who could not handle cases of the kind in this field.

    I think that our operation would be crippled for several reasons, one, I think that the knowledge and interest in the problem is limited. 
    The particular lawyers, for example, if it would require that the association would -- could not have lawyers who are interested in their -- in having litigation before them is this group of lawyers that manifested an interest, work together on the problem, discuss the whole issues of segregation, discuss ways and means and to pick up ways of means to attack the whole problem and to use their expertise in a particular manner who spent part of their time learning about the whole question of the reach of the constitutionality of racial discrimination, how it can be attacked, how it can be brought sharply to the issue presented to this and other court squarely, we would, it seems to me that this would interfere completely with the -- with the whole thrust of the Association's operation because there would be no group of people who would devote their time and effort and study to this. 
    There would be some lawyers who would be out outside who may or may not be interested in this particular field.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, no sir. 
    Let me explain, if I may take a moment to attempt to explain that. 
    The Association, and this is particularly -- will be particularly illuminated in the -- on the issue of the criminal cases, when the Association supports an individual who says that he has been convicted by coerce confession or the exclusion of Negroes in the jury, the Association would -- and its lawyers would underwrite this case and bring the case up if necessary to this Court. 
    If at a -- at some point, and this has occurred, where the Court would decide on some other basis that this person would get a life sentence or some judgment that would be binding on him until his benefit and he has no interest in further prosecuting this constitutional question, the NAACP naturally adheres or the lawyer handling the case would adhere to his wishes. 
    Now, in the -- in the -- this is where it's -- and when you get to the question of school segregation, what the -- what the respondents are saying is, that because the NAACP says that we will not sponsor litigation unless it involves an attach on segregation per se that this in itself is controlling on the grounds that some Negroes who might be on the South would be happy inside this [Inaudible] argued separate with equal facilities. 
    But all I'm saying, Mr. Justice White, is that we make that decision before we entered the litigation and after that, the issue as to whether or not the particular litigant is going to pursue the case. 
    For example, the litigant may decide if they have in a number of instances --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2793.587" stopTime="2797.848">

speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="2797.848" stopTime="2840.431">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    That's right. 
    The lawyer handles that and the litigant, as many of them have, have found that the -- by being plaintiffs in various cases that it made them uncomfortable, their life is uncomfortable and they have said, “We don't want to go on any further.” 
    Now in all instances of this kind, we have of course -- the lawyers have of course withdrawn. 
    They're not representing anybody who does not want to pursue the litigation. 
    So that my difficulty as I say with this statement with the conclusions that the Court has drawn is that they're not based on my judgment on any facts, any evidence that can be supported in this record. 
    And that I -- I think that we do not.

    No sir. 
    I think that the -- I don't believe so. 
    I think as a matter of fact that the insurance liability companies are able to handle cases of -- cases of this kind in Virginia and this particular statute exempts them from this operation. 
    And on this phase, we contend for example that the statute is a denial of equal protection because the reach of the statute is based upon the property right and property interest of pecuniary right of liability of the particular concern. 
    And that this would cover liability insurance companies and would allow liability insurance companies to control the litigation and have lawyers handle it and would not in the case of our kind in which the issue is a civil rights and the individual rights of the parties.

    Denial of equal protection, yes sir. 
    This is one of the grounds for our attack. 
    The brief currently, if I may, the other ground of our attack is that if it's a denial of due process on the grounds that the standards which are applied here in terms of the -- of when a person maybe able to assist in litigation have variance with general standards that are at the bar and that throughout the United States, the whole issue of being able to bring -- test the litigation is important, is one of the things -- it's one of the -- Because of the way in which this Court, for example, in the federal -- the federal court handles cases, test litigation is essential because no matter how illegal it is, public officials are free from interference by any of their activity unless a case or controversy is brought in the federal court to handle it so that -- and finally, I think that in terms of our objections of the statute is that we contend that this statute being a part of the massive resistance program of Virginia that its purpose was to destroy the Association and to prevent it from enabling persons, aiding persons to contest the state power to maintain the status quo and that is if -- if the statute is upheld that our operations will be impaired and in this effect, we think that this is akin to race discrimination because as a matter of fact, the Association -- without the Association being able to assist persons in contesting the validity of the action of state officials in attempting to maintain segregation in the state, add variance with this cost opinion, then the whole issue of the movement of Negroes in Virginia towards security, equal rights and equal justice will be impaired.

    Mr. Henry T. Wickham 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, as I said last year in our open argument, we're not here today to complain about the success or failures of the petitioner. 
    Those results are not before this Court is not at issue, but it appears that what is in issue here today is whether or not this petitioner must follow rules that have been long laid down by many courts for the conduct of the practice of the law. 
    It seems to be the local fusion about the terms and provisions of Chapter 33. 
    Chapter 33 amended Section 54-74 of the Code of Virginia and Section 54-78 of the Court of Virginia and for purposes for conformity only amended Section 54-79, I believe in the Code of Virginia. 
    And Section 54-74 has been on the law books of Virginia since 1849 in some form or other and it deals with the unprofessional conduct of licensed attorneys. 
    The 1956 Act, amended and reenacted Section 54-74, carrying with it the same provisions that were heretofore found in the statute, namely that is unprofessional conduct to solicit business directly or indirectly in amount of the Fifty-sixth Amendment added, I might say, another definition of unprofessional conduct though frankly, it's my view that it was included in the first and it was not actually needed because it simply said that unprofessional conduct is also the solicitation or the taking of business from someone who the attorney knows is guilty of violating or running in statute, the running and capping statute of Virginia. 
    To me, that didn't add anything to old 54-74. 
    It didn't take a thing away from me.

    You've got to have solicitation plus the fact that there's no pecuniary interest or liability involved and so you have solicitation in each part of Section 54-78.

    I mean you could get the insurance company if it was unlawful solicitation and they could be or might be exempt under the amendment of Section 54-78 but why would they -- they would not be exempt under the first part of 54-78 which is the real definition of the words running and capping.

    It was a bottom wall disbarment proceedings before the federal court and he said that they are exceptional cases but very few exceptional cases when the Association may procure a lawyer for a -- it was an indigent defendant in this case and even -- and then get out, the lawyer is paying -- got no fee from anyone. 
    Another instance is the Gammons case against Carolina Bar Association, I believe in which the Bar Association took the lead in urging the citizens down there to fight these user laws and the lawyers of the Bar volunteered their services to fight that particular case.

    Mr. Henry T. Wickham 
    Our Court of Appeals? 
    It seems to me that when you consider much again these facts as a whole, as I pointed out, this is not a -- this is a suit for declaratory judgment. 
    We're really deciding this case in a vacuum of whether or not Mr. Hill would be disbarred, suspended or reprimanded. 
    They've got a procedure for that before a three-judge state court. 
    Tomorrow, he might do something or I might do something, I might be before the Third District Committee which the Richmond Bar Committee. 
    He might -- a petitioner affidavit might be filed against him with the Court, but how do we know? 
    We can't sit here and really determine what Mr. Hill did in Charlottesville back in 1955 or 1956, 1957. 
    It doesn't mean that he's doing that today. 
    I just can't say how the NAACP might be operating in Virginia today. 
    I don't know. 
    I just say this that it seems to me clear that our statutes or not unconstitutional per se because really -- that base really on our counsel legal ethics. 
    And number two, it would seem to me that the plaintiff's contention here is that -- really that it just don't apply to their activities. 
    And I say to this Court if you read this record as a whole, it is clear that the petitioner has violated Section 54-78 of the Code of Virginia either prior to or after the amendment or has violated the Canons of ethics as the court below has held and that certain attorneys or certain records, certain evidence in the record, indicate that certain attorneys have violated Section 54-74 of the Code of Virginia prior to the amendment or after the amendment or with no statute on the Canons of ethics and it seems to me in conclusion that for this Court to reverse the Court of Appeals of Virginia, it must reverse -- in effect reverse many State Court decisions not only in Virginia but in other states which had been cited in the respondents brief and also by the Court of Appeals and hold that solicitation as shown by this record is not proper. 
    If it does do that, this Court on the other alternative, it seems to me, would be to say that when Negroes are urging their constitutional rights, the Canons of legal ethics in section -- statutes such as Section 54-74, do not have to be followed. 
    We have an exception in that type of case or we can just simply say that the petitioner may have its own set of rules and the rest of us will continue under the old set of rules.
