    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please? 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    It presents only one very simple question and that is whether or not the Federal District Courts have the jurisdiction to enjoin peaceful picketing allegedly being conducted in violation of a collective bargaining agreement containing an alleged no-strike clause in view of the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

    Mr. David Previant 
    Yes, I --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="83.684" stopTime="88.472">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Why don't you say some members of this Court have considered it more difficult?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="88.472" stopTime="345.573">
    Mr. David Previant 
    They probably still in most cases. 
    The Federal District Court in this case and the Court of Appeals in this case found that the answer was very simple and they held that the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not preclude the District Court from issuing an injunction under those circumstances. 
    The facts too are simple and in large measure undisputed. 
    The petitioner here is the local labor union in Wichita, Kansas. 
    The respondents here are some six carriers of motor freight, common carriers, who are engaged in the “for-hire transportation” of motor freight between the states and all of whom have a terminal in the City of Wichita, Kansas. 
    The employees of all of these carriers in the City of Wichita, Kansas, that is the drivers and the warehousemen are members of the petitioner union. 
    The office and clerical employees are not. 
    The union and the employer, I'll use the singular for the sake of simplicity, have entered into collective bargaining agreements, one which covers their interstate transportation of goods and one which covers the local transportation of goods in the Wichita area. 
    They are known respectively as the over-the-road contract and the local cartage contract. 
    These agreements are multi-employer agreements. 
    They are negotiated over a wide area with many employers. 
    It is the identical agreement which was before this Court in a different posture in the (Inaudible) case. 
    Pertinent to these proceedings are two provisions of that contract. 
    One is a so-called protection of rights clause which provides that it shall not be a violation of the agreement if employees covered by the agreements refuse to go through a picket line. 
    The second provision is a rather lengthy grievance procedure. 
    It provides that there shall be no strike or legal proceedings without first using all possible means of settlement as provided in this agreement. 
    It should be pointed out here that the contract itself was in the record in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals, but the contract itself is not here and this particular article of the contract was not unfortunately printed in extenso. 
    I say this because there are some suggestion that this contract contains as a terminal point, an arbitration provision, it does not. 
    It provides for a series of appeals through the Local and Area Grievance Committees which are comprised of both employer and union representatives. 
    It further provides that in the event of a failure to resolve the grievance at the last level, the parties may submit the matter to an umpire, but the parties, both parties must agree and if both parties do not agree then it provides that either party is provided all lawful economic recourse. 
    In other words, the union could strike in the event they did not agree to submit to umpire handling. 
    Now that particular provision is not necessarily crucial to the determination in this case, but since there has been so much talk about no-strike clauses being quid pro quo for arbitration clauses, I think we ought to set this picture in this case right, that we do not have here a clause which requires the union to submit its grievance to arbitration. 
    The clause does require the union to submit to an arbitration or rather a grievance procedure.

    Mr. David Previant 
    The -- only a part of the clause was printed in the record. 
    I don't think that counsel would differ with me as to what I say that the clause does not require arbitration. 
    I say that the contracts were in the record in the court below. 
    They were physically in the Court of Appeals. 
    In preparing this record, unfortunately, there was some reference only to the contract as it appeared in the findings and therefore the entire article was not printed.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="388.011" stopTime="392.282">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Did you say Mr. Previant, these are the same contracts we had in [Inaudible]?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="392.282" stopTime="751.477">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Yes. 
    Yes, they -- and the grievance procedure clause is essentially identically the same as the record [Inaudible]. 
    Well, in July of 1959, during the life of this contract, the union decided that it wanted to organize the unorganized office and clerical employees of the employers with whom it had this contract. 
    Accordingly, a letter was sent to the employers. 
    The letter advised the employers of the union's interest in the -- in the office and clerical employees. 
    It stated among other things that to induce your employees to join this union, we shall picket your establishment on or about the 27th of July, stated among other things and engaging in this picketing campaign we're speaking for the members of our organization who are employed in businesses like yours and who feel the brunt of unfair competition of your unorganized employees. 
    The letter did emphasize that it had no quarrel or dispute with the employer. 
    It was making no demands upon the employer. 
    The letter acknowledged that until such time as the union obtained the majority representation status, it could not make any such demands upon the employer for recognition. 
    Thereafter, within several days, the picketing started. 
    Picket signs said merely organize. 
    They urged the office employees of this terminal to join Teamsters Union Local 795. 
    This picketing was peaceful at all times. 
    Drivers who were members of the union and employed at these terminals upon approaching the picket line and identifying it as a picket line, established by their Local Union, or other members of Teamsters Unions in other parts of the country who might had been interchanging freight at these terminals refused to go through these picket lines. 
    Members of the Union refused to work behind the picket line. 
    The result was of course, the business being conducted by these employers at these terminals was disrupted. 
    For all practical purposes, I guess the record would permit of a conclusion that it was just as though their employees had gone out on a direct strike. 
    An ex parte restraining order was entered by the District Court upon application of the employers. 
    The Union was restrained from violating the existing contract, from picketing in the premises of the employer and from otherwise tying up the operation. 
    I think it is important to emphasize here also that the employers in presenting their petition to the District Court made no claim that this was a matter which was subject to the grievance procedure. 
    They did not ask that the matter be submitted to the grievance procedure. 
    They did not ask for arbitration. 
    On the contrary, their theory was that there was absolutely no dispute between the employers and the unions. 
    There was no grievance and that accordingly, the union's activity was in violation of the provision of the contract which said there shall be no strike until all means the settlement have been exhausted. 
    The union of course denied that its activities constituted a breach of the contract and it challenged the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court under the Norris-LaGuardia Act. 
    After a hearing on a permanent injunction, the court found that the picketing had caused a concerted stoppage, that the stoppage was a strike. 
    That there was no controversy between the union and the employers that the picketing which caused the strike was in violation of the contract, that the picket line clause upon which the union relied was not applicable, that the court did have jurisdiction under the Norris-LaGuardia Act because in the lower court's opinion, the suit does not involve or grow out of a labor dispute. 
    And a permanent junction enjoined, restrained and prohibited the union and its officers from violating the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement by engaging in picketing activity. 
    When no labor dispute is dissolved -- is involved and which causes its members to engage in a concerted stoppage or interruption of the work. 
    On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth confirmed. 
    It found that there was a breach of contract, that these activities did violate the contract. 
    It further found that although the controversy might come within the literal reading of Norris-LaGuardia, but nevertheless, the jurisdictional limitations found in Norris-LaGuardia must now be read in light of the provisions of Section 301 of the subsequent Taft-Hartley enactment and found that the policy expressed in 301 would confer upon the courts a jurisdiction to restrain a violation of the contract even though it involved picketing and strikes. 
    Well, the Court of Appeals did -- did not concur in the finding that there was no labor dispute, but found that 301 nevertheless superseded or repealed or had to be accommodated to the Norris-LaGuardia and that in breaking that, the combination or comparison, there was a legislative intent to carve this kind of strike and picketing from under what had previously been the hospitable scope of Norris-LaGuardia. 
    This opinion of the court --

    Mr. David Previant 
    I think it could be best summarized that they believe that 301 does not touch Section 4 rights. 
    Whatever other effect 301 may have had upon other injunctions or restraining orders which might appear to come within the literal language of Norris-LaGuardia, I think they have accepted the holding of this Court that 301 creates substantive law.

    Do I make my question clear to you Mr. Previant because I believe it's important whether the court that withheld [Inaudible] and you did not -- we don't have to go underground that they go, whether the courts and or you suppose that whatever scope is left for judicial construction or evolution out of 301, it can't touch Norris-LaGuardia or that construing 301 as a mandate of the courts to make appropriate national labor policies, it would -- it would derive from 301 or from its own notions of wisdom, legal wisdom that Norris-LaGuardia is a good national policy.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In other words, that not allowing an injunction, denying the federal courts the right to issue an injunction, is still an application of 301, you don't have to bother Norris-LaGuardia, is that it?

    Mr. David Previant 
    No. 
    No, I misconceived your question, I'm sorry. 
    I do not believe that they -- that they has taken that position. 
    I think they have taken the simple position that there are certain kinds of injunctions like requiring an employer to arbitrate, requiring an employer to bargain with the unions under the Railway Labor Act, requiring a union to cease discriminating against its members because of race. 
    That while these types of restraining orders are mandatory injunctions, although they might come within the literal terms of Norris-LaGuardia, were not contemplated by Norris-LaGuardia, and therefore, the court would not have to apply the stringent requirements of Norris-LaGuardia in testing jurisdiction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1052.875" stopTime="1057.919">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's because of 301 that you don't have to construe Norris-LaGuardia that way?

    Mr. David Previant 
    No. 
    In order to come to the result of 301, they tried to make what this Court has called an accommodation with the Norris-LaGuardia Act. 
    They feel that this was not the abuse, the type of things which I have enumerated. 
    They feel are not the kind of an abuse which was contemplated in the enactment of Norris-LaGuardia, but that Norris-LaGuardia stands unchanged insofar as basic Section 4 rights are concerned, the right to picket, the right to strike directed into -- this other.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Because -- I don't mean to be dialectic about this, but just to me there is a great deal of difference, whether my problem is that 301 doesn't touch Norris-LaGuardia despite the large at leave that Lincoln Mills gives me in construing its scope, that 301 doesn't touch it because Congress has been specific for -- that applying 301 and forgetting all about the Norris-LaGuardia except if there's a light on policy out of 301, disallows such injunctive power.
speaker="david_previant" startTime="1123.847" stopTime="1147.776">
    Mr. David Previant 
    I believe it would be fair to say that except for the area which is indicated by 301, they believe that the congressional intention was clear that 301 would not touch Norris-LaGuardia. 
    They do not rely upon 301 to come to the conclusion that Norris-LaGuardia and particularly the Section 4 rights maintain their [Inaudible]

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't think you mean not to answer my question specifically, but still I don't understand whether I am to make an independent judgment on the power that is left to the judiciary under Lincoln Mills in construing 301. 
    So construing it, I would say, it's a bad business to enjoin this kind of a thing or -- and I'd say I don't have to bother by 301, Norris-LaGuardia is a specific statute, this falls within it, never mind 301, I put that undecided.

    Mr. David Previant 
    Well, insofar as the opinion might reflect the process to which these courts have gone through, they have first, I believe, laid Norris-LaGuardia down next to the facts and they have said that this is clearly a Norris-LaGuardia case. 
    They have then said in view of the determination made by this Court in Lincoln Mills, we now must consider whether Congress in saying that these contracts shall be enforceable in a court of law intended to sap Norris-LaGuardia. 
    I think that is the process which they go through and that's probably what the decisions would indicate, what the opinions would indicate. 
    In all of these cases, there was no real dispute as to whether or not there was a labor dispute. 
    There was no real dispute as to what the result may have been or could have been absent to 301.

    That's – I will get more enlightened as you go along.
speaker="david_previant" startTime="1273.786" stopTime="1706.379">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Alright. 
    I would, in view of our discussion, just past, overheard either fact that the dispute demonstrates the -- all of the practical accouterments of a labor dispute under Norris-LaGuardia both the dispute between the organized and the unorganized employees and people in the same industry and I would pass on to -- and I would pass also the point that the injunction clearly, clearly restrains the exercise of rights which under Section 4 was -- were too at that, complete immunity under any view of Norris-LaGuardia providing there is a labor dispute. 
    I would also pass over rather hurriedly the question as to whether or not Norris-LaGuardia did apply in the past to contract violations. 
    We have set forth the conclusion in our brief that the United Mine Workers case is a clear example of the attempted application of Norris-LaGuardia to a dispute involving a breach of contract and although the decision of the court was not in harmony in the case, certainly I believe all of the justices who participated in that case felt that this was a Norris-LaGuardia case. 
    The other question was whether or not it applied to the Government. 
    I think that we then get to the point which one of our brothers mentioned this morning, since the lower court looks to Section 301 to determine whether there has been any erosion on Norris-LaGuardia. 
    We look at the statute on its face and see what the comfort we can get from examining that. 
    We believe that the examination of the statute itself demonstrates that Congress knew what it was about, that what it intended to repeal or set aside the application of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, it did so specifically and unequivocally and that we would conclude from that that any other provision of the Act that which Congress did demonstrate, this intention, if it intended clearly that Norris-LaGuardia Act shall continue to apply. 
    We point out in our brief that the secondary boycott provision for example, the Taft-Hartley, is -- provides that it -- in fact provides mandatorily that the National Labor Relations Board shall after investigation and upon concluding that, there is a violation of the Act, go into the Federal District Court. 
    It provides as to on a provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act that it has the discretionary power to go into the District Court upon a finding or a belief that there is a violation and we find a specific provision that in exercising either the mandatory or the discretionary power to go to the District Courts for relief from alleged violations of these particular provisions of the Act that the jurisdiction of the District Court is not to be limited by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the specific provision so holding. 
    Then we -- we get to the national emergency provisions and we find similarly that after the procedures that are required under the national emergency provisions had been exhausted, there may be an injunction for a limited period of time and again a specific provision that the Norris-LaGuardia Act shall not apply in the application for such injunction against the national emergency strike. 
    The Taft-Hartley Act further has a provision in connection with trustee funds that in the event there's been a violation of that Section and Section 302, then there may be a restraining order applied for it issued in the Federal District Court and again, expressly stating without regard to the Norris-LaGuardia Act. 
    I must note it that in each instance, the Government is the party and not the private party, except in the last instance which is not really a dispute kind of a situation and we believe that this demonstrates a considered congressional judgment that if the Norris-LaGuardia Act is to be set aside in any way or in any manner, it would be done only under limited circumstances and it would be done specifically. 
    We also, certainly on the case of this evidence, would have to conclude that we're not dealing with one of those statutes that one of the courts referred to as obscure or generally forgotten so that we might loosen up on our application of a rule of -- still by implication but this was certainly a statute which was foremost in the minds of the Congress in revising the Wagner Act of 1947. 
    That appears on the face of the statute itself. 
    Then move to the other handy like tool for interpretation and look at the legislative history and again we find that there was in the legislative history attempts made to relax the provisions of Norris-LaGuardia particularly in contract violation cases. 
    That history is set forth in our brief. 
    That history incidentally is set forth in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's appendix to his opinion in the Lincoln Mills case. 
    What it shows is that the House Bill 3020 provided specifically that a suit for a violation of the collective bargaining agreement could be brought in the Federal District Court and that the Norris-LaGuardia Act specifically by title would not apply. 
    The Senate approach and this was a problem, as this Court pointed out in the Lincoln Mills decision, this problem of adherence to contract, the Senate approach was that in the event -- that a contract violation would be an unfair labor practice and would be subject to adjudication by the courts and then -- but then normally follow that under its discretionary power, if and so that a particular contract violation created some situation was -- which would require action, it could then go under the discretionary injunction procedure and the Norris-LaGuardia would not apply in that instance. 
    These two differences among others have to go to conference. 
    And when that came out of conference, Conference Report repeated the fact that 3020 has specifically set aside Norris-LaGuardia and that the Senate version did not, but it went on to say we have retained only part of that provision and the only part that was retained was a provision that would set aside Section 6 of Norris-LaGuardia which imposed a rather strict test that this Court will recall on imposing liability upon unions for acts of their agents. 
    This is all that came out of the legislative bill with respect to Norris-LaGuardia and they said that they would then leave the enforcements of contracts to the normal judicial processes.

    As I remember, you would correct me Mr. Previant, but in the course of legislative history that you know, at least relating to the subject matter you've just traversed, those are separate provisions, but there was -- was there any -- were there any amendments proposed with reference to 301 itself dealing with this problem which said that this should include the right to [Inaudible] --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes but there wasn't anything with reference with 301 that tied it up with the question of an injunction. 
    The problem of enforcing; two problems, one, whether a violation of a contract should itself be deemed a labor -- unfair labor practice; two, what the remedies were put for independent subject matters not relating to 301, is that right?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="1762.826" stopTime="1778.394">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Well, I think that 301 grew out of this. 
    Again, there was no parallel provision in the law as it existed.

    One of the limitations which was desired at that time or rather one of the impositions which was required -- was desired was that both management and labor be held to the contract and the House version and the Senate version were the respective approaches to that particular problem.

    I think that the debates, however, in addition to the -- what finally happened to the Senate and the House version, the debates themselves I think are clarifying and that you had repeatedly a statement by Senator Taft, by Senator Ellender, by Senator Thomas among others. 
    I think they knew what kind of a political hornet's nest was involved in trying to do violence bodily to all of Norris-LaGuardia.

    Mr. David Previant 
    That's right. 
    While I am on that subject, I think it might be well to point out that there were always instances under Norris-LaGuardia when it was felt that the result was harsh. 
    People perhaps weren't looking to the policy of the Act and that is to get the federal courts out of the injunction business, but they thought that there was a harsh result and added pressure with respect to those harsh results build up, you did get amendments in the National Labor Relations Act to meet that, the secondary boycott, the jurisdictional dispute, those things where they felt that it was unfair that there was no way of getting relief in the federal courts, all of those things that Congress eventually caught up with.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2050.804" stopTime="2055.993">

    Mr. David Previant 
    Yes. 
    Yes it did in connection with --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2058.775" stopTime="2063.050">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there under no circumstances ever can you have an injunction to labor disputes?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="2063.050" stopTime="2476.026">
    Mr. David Previant 
    No. 
    I did not say that, certainly not. 
    It said under those instances where there may be one that will ever go to avoid strict standards. 
    The legislative history, we are satisfied just would not support a finding that such an important and controversial, at least initially controversial piece of litigation like Norris-LaGuardia was amended sub silentio or pro tanto or by implication because the Congress was constantly aware of the existence of Norris-LaGuardia and problems under it. 
    But when it adopted 301, even though there had been the proposals which (a) would've either brought the contract violation cases under Norris-LaGuardia -- in the federal courts without regard to Norris-LaGuardia or would've permitted the labor board to go to the federal courts without regard to Norris-LaGuardia. 
    They finally wound up with the simple statement that the federal courts could -- that suits for violation of contract could be entertained by the federal courts regardless of residence and regardless of the jurisdictions involved. 
    The problems that have arisen in connection with Norris-LaGuardia bear not only upon whether or not 301 has -- made the breach, but whether as a result of this Court's decision in what is known as the Chicago River case, a breach maybe made. 
    I would recall to this Court and in the Chicago River case, it dealt with the problem under the Railway Labor Act, it was a -- what is called a minor dispute. 
    It involved grievances which were then before the board, the National Railway Adjustment Board which had been created by the Congress to handle minor disputes. 
    Nevertheless, a strike to hurry up the board I suppose took place and a question arose whether or not under Norris-LaGuardia that particular strike could be restrained. 
    This Court held it did, but it did so upon the peculiar and unique history of the Railway Labor Act, the circumstances under which it was adopted. 
    The agreement of all of the parties, both those who favored it and those who were opposed to it that the Congress was actually imposing compulsory arbitration in the railroad industry in cases of contract interpretation grievances and a specific provision and subsequently, the court in explaining it, I think made it clear that they were dealing with a particular industry as distinguished from industry in general, a particular legislative act as distinguished from the general act and found that there was just no basis for a holding that to restraint this strike under this law would cause a breach in Norris-LaGuardia. 
    Now we suggest that the differences here are manifested. 
    We have here -- and in the Railway Labor Act, you had a complete absence of history with respect to what was intended with regard to Norris-LaGuardia and that is why the Court was confronted with this problem of accommodation. 
    Here in the face of the history which I had just recited briefly, it would seem that there is no room, there is no requirement that an effort be made to accommodate. 
    It is not the kind of a case where we act -- we are at a loss with respect to congressional policy because we say the statute on its face and the legislative history is clear that whatever erosions or intrusions or inroads into Norris-LaGuardia were going to be made, were being made specifically and in a very limited fashion. 
    And I don't believe that on the basis of that kind of a showing, we can assume that other erosions were made that were not referred to. 
    There are other cases which this Court considered, I believe in Lincoln Mills in which what appeared to be an injunction covered by the literal language of Norris-LaGuardia was held not to be and these other railway cases to which I referred earlier. 
    There of course what the Court was trying to do was to accommodate the legislative declaration as to the requirement of the railway employer to bargain, to require labor unions to represent their members fairly. 
    It found that the kind of injunction that was considered was not the kind of injunction which was before the Congress when Norris-LaGuardia was being discussed and found that the Section 7 test were clearly in apposite and therefore concluded that there would be no erosion, there would no interference with Norris-LaGuardia, there'd be no violation of Norris-LaGuardia Act in the event that injunctions were issued in those cases, I would -- I would emphasize here as distinguished from Lincoln Mills and the other railroad cases other than the Chicago River case that we are dealing with that kind of act which under Section 4 of Norris-LaGuardia is not to be restrained in any way. 
    And Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, of course Norris-LaGuardia does not inhibit the federal courts from exercising jurisdiction in all labor dispute cases. 
    That is so, but it does say to the federal court that it has no jurisdiction with respect to particular kinds of activities which are peaceful, non-violent, non-fraudulent, picketing and inducing their right to strike and striking being those kind of activities. 
    So, we're dealing here with rights which had it special in a particular shelter under Norris-LaGuardia and surely those rights are not to be set aside because a right of action for a breach of contract was placed in the jurisdiction of the federal courts.

    The other point that is still pendent in connection with this question of mootness is that the union, after having been restrained by the District Court, used the grievance procedure for the purpose of taxing its cost to the employer claiming that when the employer went into court without the employer having invoked the grievance procedure, the employer violated this contract and that it was put to damage. 
    Before that particular grievance could be processed, the employer brought the matter back to the federal district judge who held that all of these matters were simulated within the judgment which he had entered and restrained the union from proceeding in its claim for damages because the employer has violated the contract in going to court rather than submitting to grievance procedure.

    Mr. David Previant 
    May I reserve, Your Honor. 
    I would make -- I would make this final observation, if the Court please? 
    The respondent's brief makes a very moving argument. 
    Now, what respondents considered to be the injustice of any rule which would permit the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements under Lincoln Mills against the employers and against the union, but not to the full scope of equitable relief. 
    This is a question which this Court probably knows has been particularly alive since Lincoln Mills, since Bull. 
    There's a question however that we very, very earnestly suggest is to be presented to the conference. 
    It is a question which goes to policy not to judicial inventiveness. 
    We have shown, we believe by the legislative history here, that the Congress was aware of the problem. 
    It handled it in the manner that it did. 
    As I suggested in the past, when the Congress felt that certain problems required treatment because of certain injustices which may have arisen as a result of Norris-LaGuardia. 
    It found ways of relieving in that pressure doing very little violence to the principle which underlies Norris-LaGuardia. 
    The principle here is a strike, its picketing, and I would emphasize again, it is a non -- a strike or picketing because there has been a claimed wage violation or hour violation. 
    It's a strike and picketing to organize -- unorganized workers, the precise situation contemplated by the framers of Norris-LaGuardia. 
    We say under these circumstances, impassioned and moving pleas against injustices which may result should be put to the forum which in our opinion is the only one that is competent to undo that which it did in 1932.

    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please? 
    Like in all matters that come before the Court, we come here with some knowns and one big unknown. 
    We know that the union in this case violated its contract and tied up the respondents' businesses so they had no businesses. 
    We know that in doing so, they did so when they stipulated in court that it caused irreparable injury, that the employers had no adequate remedy at law and could proceed, if at all, under the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 which the Court provided as all Your Honors know that either unions or employers can in industries affecting commerce and that includes the one we have here before you now, go to the federal courts to enforce labor contracts. 
    Our question is, does that statute mean what it says? 
    Can we enforce the labor contracts which the union had with the employers here? 
    The District Court said, “Yes.” 
    The Court of Appeals said, “Yes.”

    Yes, I -- but I didn't --
speaker="malcolm_miller" startTime="2985.251" stopTime="3209.227">
    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    But the entire contract, I will tell you how it has occurred in all likelihood although I had nothing really to do with the record in this Court being the respondent here. 
    The contracts themselves are printed, one over the road contract and one local cartage contract. 
    They were under the rules of the Court of Appeals filed in sufficient copies for all the judges rather than reproduced as a record in the Court of Appeals. 
    They were already printed, we just sent them up five copies each and as counsel indicates at the time it was -- the Court of Appeals worked it in this matter. 
    And I'm sure -- that sure that the certiorari record here has the entire contracts which are printed attached to it. 
    But the -- the printing done in this Court only includes the excerpts which Your Honors obviously all know across. 
    But to answer Your Honors' question as good as I can answer it, I think the grievance procedure is very broad in its beginning that any dispute between the parties, they will endeavor to settle peaceably following the grievance procedure. 
    Whether or not there is compulsory arbitration, I think depends upon several things besides that contract. 
    I don't think the contracts have to go to arbitration. 
    It says they have to go through the grievance procedure. 
    Here though, if Your Honors please, we don't have any dispute with them. 
    They didn't make any demand upon us. 
    They just tied up the whole business. 
    If we had anything to do at all, it was to go to court under the Labor Management Relations Act to seek relief and what we sought was the only relief possible to get in our situation which was an injunction. 
    Now, the Labor Management Relations Act says that either the union or the employers can go to federal courts that the federal court has jurisdiction without requirements of diversity in the amount of controversy so long as the case is one to enforce a labor contract. 
    It does not say that you bring a suit for damages. 
    It says you bring a suit to enforce the labor contract. 
    Now, actually, there's only one real way to enforce the contract and that is by equitable power. 
    There is nothing in 301 that says you -- the court should not have that to be in order to reach the idea, they come up with the theory that under the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, there is no -- there are no equity power. 
    Counsel must go back to 1932 and look at Norris-LaGuardia. 
    Keep going back to an older act to try to say that the plain words in 301, a later Act do not mean what they say. 
    They say the federal court shall have jurisdiction to enforce labor contracts. 
    They go back to Norris-LaGuardia and say, “Look, the breach of a collective bargaining agreement is protected activity under Section 4.” 
    It's a labor dispute under Section 13 of Norris-LaGuardia. 
    I submit to Your Honors, it cannot be. 
    It would be the strangest anomaly yet. 
    If the Norris-LaGuardia which was passed to ensure a more equal mutual bargaining between unions on the one hand and employers on the other, so that they could arrive at collective agreements, were used to ensure that collective agreements once arrived at could be brief within hearing.

    For the first time, passed a public policy statement right, in line and right along with the Norris-LaGuardia Act, Section 2 of the Act in which they pointed out that the court had gotten into labor relations where the Congress felt they should not be and had kept the real forces which would make for mutual bargaining between [Inaudible] from taking place. 
    They pointed out that it was the policy of Norris-LaGuardia to ensure that workers could band together, could join unions so that they could collect doubly, bargain with the equality, but the employer --

    Yes, I know it says that with the driving forces, you will read the most powerful speech in the Senate, for that matter in either house in support of that Act, it is from Senator David Reed from Pennsylvania, one of the most conservative men then in politics who spoke that of -- practitioner of extensive practice on behalf of heavy industry in which he said forth his experience why it was undesirable to have things -- this kind of litigation in the federal courts.

    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    Well, I understand Your Honor that you -- your point is that the federal courts were not to enter this area. 
    I think the public policy statement bares it out. 
    They followed it in Section 3 that the Congress itself and they provided that this is what should be read by the courts in construing this Act, that the contracts not to join unions, not to collective bargaining would be unenforceable. 
    But if Your Honor please, that's not our situation as we're here before you today. 
    The Congress has spoken again, they spoke in 1947 and this time, they also had a policy in mind. 
    They changed their minds. 
    They decided there was a place for the court in labor relations and that ways -- was one [Inaudible] narrow one so far as we're here and that was to ensure that labor contracts once they were entered into would be enforceable.

    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    I would very gladly go to that one right now. 
    Most certainly, the House believed in mutuality of remedy so far as a labor agreement, once the bargaining process was over, the labor agreement was made for any in violation of that rule, there's no question this is true, they specifically so provided in what they passed in the first instance. 
    The Senate version was somewhat different. 
    It's certainly also true. 
    They provided both for suits in federal courts and for administrative action so that you go first to the board and from the board to the federal courts. 
    With the difference between the arguments, the matter was referred to Congress, but if Your Honor please, they had both determined already that the courts had a place in labor relations and it was to enforce with injunctions if necessary labor contracts so that neither the employer or the union would violate those contracts.

    Now, Norris-LaGuardia wasn't that keeps such agreements from being made. 
    Most certainly, no one ever suggested that in the legislative history of Norris-LaGuardia certainly indicates, no one, I'm certain to suggest that those collective agreements, the unions were so anxious to have the right to make and that Congress agreed most certainly, this is a good thing. 
    They were supposed to then violate. 
    They were concern to Norris-LaGuardia although you're going to violate a collective agreement.

    Really Mr. Miller, they were concerned in Norris-LaGuardia no matter how [Inaudible] the agreement is, you cannot get in an injunction in a labor controversy in the federal court subject to qualification but must go to the state court because you don't want to embroil the federal courts in this kind of business.

    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    Yes, and I think there comes the second question I mean, since Lincoln Mills, when you have agreed to proceed in this manner is, is there in the law which Your Honors maintained must grow up in this area. 
    Does this contract really provide for compulsory arbitration, albeit, it doesn't say so in so many words.

    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    I think this is correct Your Honor. 
    I think there is another theory we could also go on. 
    As long as -- and this one aside from the arbitration cases, that if a union by -- or an employer and hasn't -- this is not a one way street I am arguing for, if a union or an employer violate its labor contract, its collective bargaining agreement, one with the other, either one, the injured party may go to court to obtain an injunction restraining such violation. 
    It may well be and I am aware that they -- we are here -- it's very difficult to make a pure case for it because there may well be a problem as to whether or not the contentions of the parties show that there is a matter which needs to be arbitrated before the Court can determine whether there is a violation of the contract. 
    We don't have that in this case and I therefore have not gone into that which I consider it's quite a matter by itself.

    The Section is itself called to the court's attention. 
    Now, I think it is -- the case has been withheld every time you go under the step, you refine it a bit more. 
    And by the time it gets down to the argument here, sometimes it's -- it looks a little more appealing from where it began.

    When we file such a complaint, we must, number one, forget Norris-LaGuardia with me for just a moment because it has this -- there's a two-edged sword here. 
    We must number one show we're entitled that relief in any event. 
    This of course depends on many things, as everyone of us are well aware, you're not entitled to go to equity as long as you have an adequate remedy at law. 
    We plead we did not have one. 
    The union agreed with us that we did not have one. 
    They said most certainly, “We'll agree” and they did stipulate in open court that we were caused irreparable injury and had no adequate remedy at law because the union had no funds with which to refund the damages. 
    Therefore we got down to one problem where we had two before, now we just have one, does 301 allows the court to issue an injunction?

    Well, I'm just wondering why wouldn't that come before you finally got to the ultimate of a -- of the injunction.
speaker="malcolm_miller" startTime="4723.336" stopTime="4856.359">
    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    Well, if Your Honor please, I think because of a principle of law which we went into below which nobody has brought up or even made a point here until Your Honor brought it up and I thought this is what Your Honor was getting at in the first instance when you first started asking these questions. 
    There is if one side first violates a contract here, striking to that going to grievance, that what duty the other side has to go to grievance is excused because of the first violation and there is quite a body of law in this area and I don't mean to get around with Your Honor's question at all because I think this is one other way of going at it. 
    For example, let's assume that they go into arbitration in the first instance, and I'm aware that we have compulsory arbitration because this is a bit different than -- which Your Honors asked in Lincoln Mills and the arbitrator had determined that there was not here any dispute between the parties, that's the most certain they had agreed that they weren't going to stop the works. 
    In the light of this contract, they were going to remain on the job if they wanted to advertise and get other people in. 
    They're going to have to make a deal with their own union so that they did work behind those banners. 
    And notwithstanding that they determined this, the union had members decide, “We're not going to work behind those banners will also lost the job” then I think we would again have the problem of [Inaudible] -- to try this specifically enforced the arbitrator's word or you can try to get it. 
    It was pending and had (Inaudible) -- an injunction from the court restraining and holding the status quo until it has then determined. 
    But I think in -- while those are definitely procedures that might take place, if -- and this matter comes here with this already determined, if there has been a violation of that collective agreement, of the labor contract, the big problem we have to answer is, can the federal courts enforce that contract whether they go into arbitration or not, is at this point I think not material, it might be.

    I maintain and it is of course my position that you can't read out the broad version of 301 passed in 1947 by the Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932 particularly when you've got to keep in mind, we aren't trying to keep the union from bargaining the thing which Norris-LaGuardia was brought.

    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    Well, I cannot say that that's true if Your Honor please. 
    There's no doubt in many ways to state it but I think that you've got to start with the -- what 301 says and it says that a union or an employer may go to federal court and that court does have jurisdiction regardless of diversity to enforce labor contracts, that's a broad conviction.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Every question -- every question that comes here usually has a multiplicity of factors which have to be dealt with and because 1947 is later than 1932, it doesn't mean that the language of 1947 has such commanding literalness of meaning that that is the overriding consideration.

    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    I don't mean to suggest if Your Honor please that that is the only consideration. 
    I think that's the starting point. 
    Most definitely I agree with you that then you must examine Norris-LaGuardia Act to see if in fact if on its face, from its public policy statement, from the contracts it maintains are not enforceable which most certainly aren't collective agreements?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5205.055" stopTime="5224.115">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But when you come to -- come to the question when we deal with the question of construing a statute and we construe it one way rather than the other, I suggest respectfully that it isn't the most illuminating way of putting it to say that you read out the construction that you find is not in it.

    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    Well, but if Your Honor please, you're not -- you aren't getting what I thought I would say. 
    What I say is that to maintain that the Labor Management Relations Act does not include injunctions, requires you to read something in that statute that isn't already there.

    Because as I say, it's a question of construction, and when I have one statute which clearly has to be considered with another statute, I don't begin with either the reading out or reading in. 
    I go through the elaborate complicated process of finding out what that statute means and when I have found that in relation to all of relevant factors, I haven't read anything out that I have concluded isn't in it.

    Mr. Malcolm Miller 
    And I maintain that for two reasons. 
    The Norris-LaGuardia doesn't do it, doesn't stand in the way of enforcing the contract by the injunction and it's because a violation of a collective agreement which we have here. 
    That's the matter we have before the court isn't Section 4 protected activity or a Section 13, may be a dispute and if there is any real question of that, that you must read the two statutes together and see if you can't do harmoniously, harmonize the two to make -- to ensure that the purpose of Norris-LaGuardia and is for a basic purpose to promote collective bargaining agreements. 
    If not, curtail and I submit it would not be by enforcing the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In an ordinary Norris-LaGuardia in a conventional regarding the ordinary -- leave out 301 altogether where there is an agreement and an injunction is sought which was enforceable by injunction up to 1932. 
    All the things that you stress so much that you have a collective agreement that you've got an enforceable agreement -- enforcement. 
    All those things are planned. 
    And then Norris-LaGuardia came along and put a barrier against enforcement to injunction not because you didn't have an ironclad agreement, but because -- in my point of view, I cannot repeat it too often because the federal courts were not to be pulled into that kind of a controversy.
speaker="malcolm_miller" startTime="5497.012" stopTime="5504.298">
    Mr. Malcolm Miller

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- in 1932 from what it wasn't, 1947 as today, but even 1932, there were outstanding collective bargaining agreements. 
    To my knowledge, the unions that I know most about, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers and the Dress and Waste Industry, the United Mine Workers, they were collective agreements outstanding and an injunction was brought to enforce those agreements and they were enforceable by injunction and specific performance. 
    And 1932 came along and put a stop to it not because Congress wanted to minimize the integrity of contracts or the duty to obey them, but because they didn't want there the federal courts in that kind of litigation. 
    And that can't be said to all.
