   Argument of James E. Kennedy
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="20.247" stopTime="59.710">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    The complete answer to the problems involved in this case is found in the examination of the voir dire examination, the empanelment of the trial jury. 
    That jury was very carefully questioned by the court and counsel for both sides and each of the jurors that finally served on that jury had no continuance, no preconceived disposition for the defendant in this case. 
    And we're able to act impartially and all parties accepted those jurors. 
    None of those were challenged for cause. 
    Now, petitioner's position in here is that --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="59.710" stopTime="64.641">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is that (Inaudible)?
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="64.641" stopTime="93.882">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    None. 
    With the exemption that prior to even commencing the empanelment, challenge for cause interposed towards the panel in general, just everybody in general, but then the jurors were called. 
    They were examined, some excused for various reasons and the 12 that finally sat and heard the case, none of those were challenged for cause. 
    They were all accepted by the court and both parties. 
    Now, petitioner had claims that the publicity from these --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You mean, that's the final answer?

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Yes, I do.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="98.112" stopTime="123.739">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I infer from that that you think because the petit jury was fairly selected unassailable in its competence and that the trial was not subject to a constitutional attack. 
    That is of the final answer to your advice in the selection of the grand jury.

    Is that your proposition?

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Yes, that's my proposition.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="125.849" stopTime="154.209">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So what do you do with the series of cases going back 75 to 80 years beginning with Neal against Delaware, 103 U.S. which says that if a grand jury is selected in disregard of a fair and appropriate selection of colored members of the community, that vitiates the grand jury indictment?
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="154.209" stopTime="173.959">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    I think the answer there is that the objection to exclusion because of race is state action which is a direct violation of a mandate of the Constitution. 
    Any state action taken in -- discrimination based on race is just void from the start as to it --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="173.959" stopTime="192.679">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Then you think a -- do you think a claim under due process that a grand jury must be a fair-minded body and not be hell-bent on indicting, I'm assuming -- I'm not suggesting that's this case. 
    There is – does this raise a constitutional question?
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="192.679" stopTime="194.612">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    I'm not sure I understand your question. 
    You're saying --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm assuming that a grand jury must be disinterested and not on indictment propelled unfair minded body, I'm starting with that as the starting point.
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="206.494" stopTime="207.772">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Starting with that premise.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="207.772" stopTime="220.105">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    With that premise. 
    Well, that's the premise of -- after all; the Constitution doesn't say a grand jury must have a fair proportion of colored citizens, it doesn't say that at all.
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="220.105" stopTime="225.253">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    No, but it says that states cannot discriminate against person because of race.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="225.253" stopTime="229.496">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And it also says that states can't try people without due process of law.
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="229.496" stopTime="230.197">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Yes, it does.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="230.197" stopTime="240.509">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And due process of law is a great big concept filled in by a lot of notions of what does or does not constitute fundamental unfairness.

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    I agree with that --

    Now --

    It does not apply in this case.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that -- you mean the facts don't substantiate them.

    No, they don't.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the fact that it does go to your complete answer because as I understand you said this is a complete answer to say that the petty jury was fairly selected.

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Yes, in this case.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And if that's no more of a complete answer in one case than in the other so far as I can see. 
    Mr. Justice Jackson would -- I must -- I'm bothered to say with a great deal of course thought that all -- all those cases were wrong. 
    I don't understand that argument getting with me or not in the brief. 
    But if you start with those cases, I do not see the answer that you've just made in a situation in which -- starting with an assumption that the grand jury was biased in the -- selected so that there couldn't be a fair judgment by it which to me may well be fall under due process. 
    How is that any different from a biased grand jury before colored citizens on it, although no objection is taken to the petit jury and no claim is made that the petit jury trial was unfair?
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="315.635" stopTime="345.296">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Well, the cases in which a -- state courts have been reversed because of racial discrimination including the jury panels, the grand jury panels, but that is state action which is void. 
    If it discriminates, it's based on irrelevant invidious criteria in selecting jurors on which you're going to accuse. 
    Now, when you get to that problem of, is this person accused by a biased body or not, there is no such protection in the State of Washington.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="345.296" stopTime="372.088">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There is a protection in the federal constitution of due process and the claim that you must support is that it is -- that a biased -- a concededly -- for purposes of this argument, the (Inaudible) that a concededly biased prejudiced propelled grand jury is unrelated to the requirement of due process, you must say that.
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="372.088" stopTime="397.502">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Well I'm -- I refer the court to the decisions of this Court which have held that illegal action of state officers prior to trial are relevant under due process and equal protection question only if that action affects the trial on the merits. 
    Now, the only exception I'm able to find or that I find in the briefs here is this question of racial discrimination.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="397.502" stopTime="405.630">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But, I don't think you can sustain that proposition you've just enunciated in your recent petitions to this Court.
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="405.630" stopTime="414.597">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Well, then I'll proceed and try to sustain the proposition that this trial jury was fair and then I can proceed and perhaps answer the rest of the questions.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    We wasted a lot of time in discussing whether all of hearsay evidence is sufficient to justify an indictment if what you say is so. 
    I can't imagine a clearer case of -- if bias is immaterial, I mean if -- what I call an indictment for a fair grand jury. 
    That's -- doesn't depend on due process, then what difference does it make. 
    Why should we inquire to what's before the grand jury?

    I think that that -- read with the other grand jury statutes reveals that this is a type of thing -- a basis why a private prosecutor who presents the bill to the grand jury to have somebody charged cannot deliberate. 
    That's expressly forbidden by our statutes also, and I think this is to give a person -- this contemplates a person who is held -- who has a charge filed before a magistrate or elsewhere and he's held to answer and he says now, “This juror dislikes me extremely. 
    He will bring an indictment anyhow. 
    He is in the position of a private prosecutor seeking to get me indicted.” 
    And that person then held to answer to interpose a challenge individually because it's based on the proposition that there might be some person on that body that -- is the attitude that stands in the position of a private prosecutor and he would return an indictment through hatred, envy or malice which is the jurors have to be sworn not to do.

    Now, to support that contention, petitioner cites the -- there was several, quite a few, seven or eight or more that admitted when being examined on voir dire that they had prejudice which stemmed from the publicity arising from the McClellan hearings. 
    But in contrast to that, there was at least 11 that indicated that publicity did not have such an effect. 
    As to them, you have examples of individual people, have before the court, the Juror Cox.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="934.409" stopTime="935.979">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Of the trial jury.
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="935.979" stopTime="1371.213">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    It was a Juror Cox at record page 70 who stated the opinions he heard in discussions about the McClellan hearings where jocular toward petitioner rather than showing any animosity. 
    Juror Dagrine at the Record 78, had heard no hostile statements arising out of this. 
    Juror Ryan at the Record 90 to 92, he had not read about this case and he had no prejudice against anyone taking the Fifth Amendment. 
    The only thing he remembered about the McClellan hearings is that McClellan was mad at Beck for taking the Fifth Amendment. 
    There was Juror Kraatz at the Record 102, he thought that Beck was perfectly right in taking the Fifth Amendment in the McClellan hearings. 
    Juror Wallace at Record 126 couldn't recall seeing any hostile articles. 
    Juror Eakin, at the Record 128 just had no particular interest in the case. 
    Juror Hookichan, at Record 135 had heard both hostile and favorable opinions and thought it proper that he -- that the petitioner took the Fifth Amendment in this particular case, in the McClellan hearings. 
    There was Juror Wood at the Record 145 to 146. 
    He approved that some things that Beck had done and didn't approve of other things. 
    Juror Arlington at the Record 149 was just never much interested in the case. 
    Juror Hickline at the Record 267 had never had enough interest in the case to form an opinion. 
    And Juror Hill at the Record 290 had just never paid much attention to the case. 
    Now, these statements of these jurors would support the argument, that publicity from the Senate hearings just did not have such an inflammatory effect on the public. 
    And further, to examine the jurors who were excused for prejudice would indicate that also. 
    There were a number of them excused from prejudice arising out of the Senate hearings, but there were four who were excused for prejudice -- from other things. 
    Juror Loot said at Record 63 thought he should be excused because of great labor relations between Boeing Airplane Company and the Teamster Union. 
    Juror Brown at Record 168 to 169 stated he had prejudice towards Beck which arose over a period of years, but it was not from anything in the McClellan hearings, and he didn't think he could be impartial. 
    There was Juror Myers at the Record 198 to 200. He said he was biased because of his business. 
    He employs truck drivers who were Teamster Union members and there was Juror Sanderson at Record 207 who said he was biased dating back to 1943. 
    Now, this illustrates of course all the more reason why the continuance not -- should not have been granted in this case. 
    Dave Beck was a very prominent and a controversial figure. 
    He was a labor leader. 
    He admittedly had done a great deal toward securing many concessions, many benefits for the Teamsters. 
    He actually stepped on a lot of toes particularly in the area of businessmen. 
    Almost anything he did at anytime was news. 
    There was just no probability or likelihood that any publicity about him would die down in the future. 
    The proper thing to do in such a case is not to postpone this indefinitely or change the venue to another place equally exaggerated as it's called, but the thing to do is take the practical approach, find out if in fact a fair jury can be obtained and in this case, this record pretty conclusively shows that it was. 
    Now, the petitioner argues that when there is too much publicity or a great deal of publicity, the jurors' answers cannot be relied on in this regard. 
    Petitioner argues from cases containing similar language. 
    Now, I think petitioner's argument misses the whole point of those cases. 
    The most recent I believe from this Court is Irvin against Dowd in 366 U.S. reports I believe. 
    In that case, I think it was over 90% of the jurors examined had a preconceived opinion as to guilt or innocence, but said they felt they could set that opinion aside and decide the case on the evidence produced in court and it was held that in the set of circumstances presented there that the jurors' answers that they could set aside their opinion could not be relied upon because they subconsciously would not be able to do so. 
    That is entirely different from jurors who do not have an opinion, who have no bias and say they can act fairly and impartially. 
    There was no basis whatsoever for saying you cannot rely on those jurors' answers. 
    And also in regard to the voir dire examination, in the Irvin against Dowd case, it was -- the test was reiterated that just because the juror might have some preconceived opinion does not necessarily disqualify him, but to test is whether he can set that aside and decide the case on the merits. 
    Now, in extreme circumstances when almost the entire panel is in such a position and that newspaper coverage is so inflammatory and so widespread, if you have all the jurors saying, I already have an opinion on the guilt, but I can set it aside then you can't rely on it. 
    In this case though, we did in fact select 12 jurors who had no opinion and in effect in the examination here petitioner was even given two extra peremptory challenges. 
    Juror Cox at Record 71 to 73, he stated in answer to questions by counsel that he had a general prejudice against the petitioner, but it would not affect his fairness in deciding this case. 
    He was excused for cause. 
    Now, under the test set out in Irvin against Dowd, he was an acceptable juror and one which counsel should perhaps exercise a peremptory challenge against, but he's not subject to being excused for cause. 
    There was at -- Juror Hubbell at the Record 195 to 196 stated he hadn't formed a definite opinion. 
    He was little doubtful about whether he had an opinion. 
    He stated he was sure he could be fair and impartial in this case, but he could understand why Mr. Burdell would have doubt about him because he had heard a lot of publicity and a lot of things and a lot of questions asked and he was excused for cause and he said he was absolutely certain he could be fair and impartial in this case.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Assuming that the -- that there is a constitutionally protected right to an impartial state grand jury, are you going to address yourself to what it is that --

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    I'm just about to get to that. 
    I have one more point to make here. 
    So the examination, the voir dire examination pretty conclusively shows that the trial jurors were fair and impartial and had no preconceived opinion. 
    Also, I believe it was the Handy case that set out the test that when this Court is asked to reverse a state court because of a prejudiced jurors that that must be shown to be a demonstrable reality and not a mere opportunity for prejudice. 
    Now, I would submit that this record is scarcely sufficient to even show the opportunity for prejudice, looking at the newspaper coverage in this case. 
    The indictment returned on July 12, in this case, didn't go to trial until December 2nd, it was almost five months, 10 days short to five months. 
    Now, during that time, it was after indictment, after the McClellan hearings in regard the petitioner were all over there was not much publicity about him. 
    The newspapers were amazingly objective and factual in reports. 
    There was no editorializing. 
    There was no attempt to try this case in the public prints, and almost the only publicity about this particular case was generated by petitioner himself in his various pretrial maneuvers which he necessarily had to make to protect his record, but still he is a public figure and anything of that sort he does is news. 
    Still it wasn't particularly played up. 
    It was simple report of matters of public record which the petitioner himself had made as matters of public record. 
    Also, there was a considerable amount of publicity about the petitioner's activities in his union affairs, his membership campaign and news conferences he had in regard to these things. 
    There was nothing inflammatory or prejudicial about those, but still again he is a prominent public figure any of these things he does is news, and they're going to be reported. 
    There is no place in this entire record from the date of the indictment to the date of the trial is there even a hint of any attempt by the newspapers to try the case in print. 
    There are no press releases or statements by the prosecuting officials.

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Yes. 
    It's set at -- it granted him a continuance of a little over a month or something for a time to prepare defense and denied the motions for continuance on grounds of prejudice. 
    That order was entered on October 11 and was argued prior thereto. 
    The local practice in King County is that when a person moves for a permanent relief and some portion of it is granted that person prepares the order for signature in the light of language the court indicated by its oral ruling. 
    Now, I think that language of course, I believe you'll find it presented by petitioner's counsel.

speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="1872.729" stopTime="1891.114">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Well, the specific ground for the motion was that the community prejudice would prevent the selection of a fair jury and that motion was heard and argued and denied. 
    I think implicit in the denial is the court's finding that there is not sufficient community prejudice. 
    I --

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    He clearly does not say that there was any prejudice existing. 
    Now, petitioner would have you interpret in there that the case is so hopelessly prejudiced already that there's no sense in postponement, they might as well deny his rights now. 
    I can't find words to answer that. 
    I can't feature any court even in the race cases making such a decision. 
    This motion was raised several times. 
    There were three different judges that ruled on these different motions and each denied them. 
    It was thoroughly argued on the basis of community prejudice and that the court was correct, I think it's fairly clearly shown by the voir dire examination. 
    But even if the court had not made such a finding, the Washington rule of course is that if the lower court is correct for any reason, his order will be sustained even though he might not have recited the correct reasons. 
    He might be wrong in the reasons he recited, but if his order is correct, that will still be sustained. 
    Here, we have demonstrable proof that the order was correct because 12 jurors were accepted by both sides. 
    They also said that they could be fair and impartial. 
    Nobody challenged them.

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Well, if I did say that I was obviously mistaken. 
    There was certainly, maybe still is. 
    The point is this is out of -- I'll put an illustration of my brief, I've assigned 35 pages per day per paper as a nominal average that gives over 5000 pages of each paper much to glean these articles, many of which of an inside pages and only remotely relate to the matters at hand and some of them only remotely relate to Beck himself. 
    Now, I think I pointed out in error is an exemption, there was a good deal of publicity during the trial of his son which occurred in November a couple of weeks before his trial commenced and it was a companion case on substantially identical charges that was embezzling money from car sales which (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2215.960" stopTime="2217.313">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    This car sale?
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="2217.313" stopTime="2458.731">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Well, it was different car sales but they're substantially identical and that again there was no editorializing. 
    It was factual reporting and the petitioner's trial had been set for prior to his son's and at his request it was put over to afterwards. 
    That was the request for time in which to prepare defense, and the court granted that because the court thought it was reasonable and granted it but it was the petitioner's action that set this after his son's trial rather than before it. 
    And again, that was factual reporting limited to that particular case that -- on matters of public record; no surmise, no conjecture, no attempt to convict either one in the newspaper coverage locally at that time. 
    I'd like to also point out to this Court that there is no sufficient showing in this record that the grand jurors were unbiased -- were biased. 
    There is quite a bit of derogatory publicity surrounding these McClellan hearings and they were called as a direct result of that, I don't think it's disputed. 
    To digress on that point for a moment that is an established mode of procedure in Washington. 
    It is in fact that I'm aware of the only time the grand jury ever is called is for a specific purpose, either to investigate a public official who apparently is doing something wrong or to investigate a case of this sort with the normal procedures are not sufficient. 
    The access to these books and things cannot be obtained, and it is solely used as a tool of the prosecution, as an investigatory aid and it's an accusatory and investigatory body, in no sense a trial body. 
    And the specific reason it's called is just because it can secure these records and can get the evidence and they're always called for a specific purpose such as this one as this case was called. 
    Now, the petitioner on one hand claims that the grand jurors should have been examined as to bias toward him on the other hand, he complains that there was a reference made to him and a charge to the grand jury. 
    I submit that those positions are inconsistent. 
    Also, in regard to this empanelment of the grand jury, petitioner complains about the charge because it referred to the Senate hearings and this grand jury was called for the specific purpose of investigating officers of the Teamster's Union in regard to misappropriation of funds. 
    I failed to see how that can be prejudicial when a standard method of directing grand jury investigations in any situation is to present them with a bill charging somebody with a crime, actually claiming they did commit a crime and asking the grand jury to investigate that. 
    It certainly is far more prejudicial than the method utilized here where the jurors were told at least twice, they are to inquire into these things and determine the truth or falsity of them. 
    And they were sworn to present no person through hatred, envy or malice. 
    There is no indication here that bias or prejudice took any part in bringing these indictments. 
    I think it is not controlling of course at least a factor to be considered that the petitioner was convicted before the jury demonstrably fair on the evidence adduced by the grand jury. 
    It was obtained by the grand jury. 
    That was the basis for the conviction. 
    It'd be hard to find that they did not have sufficient cause to indict when that very evidence is the evidence which convicted petitioner before a jury who was acceptable to both sides.

    Well, I think that throughout the argument the briefs, all of this, it's -- the complaint is that we don't have a record of whatever is before the grand jury. 
    We do have the proposition which is pointed out by the lower court and I think both sides that the evidence used here was only obtainable through grand jury proceedings. 
    The petitioner has even made reference to the exhibits used to connect petitioner with the crime. 
    We have these references in the excerpts from closing argument where he points out that Mr. Beck did appear before the grand jury, and he said he authorized the sale of the car, I believe that's in the record around about 310, but there's no dispute that that was the same evidence that I'm aware of in this entire proceeding.

    One of the prosecutors was brought in to testify as to things that the petitioner had set in the grand jury proceedings on the basis of their admissions of him, and I think in that regard, and Mr. Burdell could correct me if I'm wrong, I believe that the court following I think the federal rule in these matters had that testimony also made available to the court to see if there are any matters where there are inconsistencies, so it would be available for cross-examination if the discrepancies indicated would be necessarily.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I'm in page 570 where the majority opinion seems to say, however, the premise is not correct, that is that the jury was not im -- the grand jury was not impartial. 
    Court says, “However, the premise is not correct unless, unless as the appellants argue our 19 -- our 1954, a grand jury statute requires the grand jury to be impartial and unfair. 
    That seems to me to be implicitly recognizing not taking issue with the merits of the claim of prejudice, but resting the decision on the ground that it made no difference under state law.
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="2748.931" stopTime="2892.946">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    They rested it on that ground but my recollection of the opinion that they specifically found that there was no proof or no showing in the record that there was bias, but they said even so, it would not be a ground before that line to affirm. 
    But, they also determined that there was not showing of prejudice in the record but that even if there were such a showing, it would not be sufficient and the other four tells that the publicity attendant upon it together with the method of examination of one particular witness compelled the conclusion that there was bias and prejudice involved in a grand jury proceeding and that dissent as it's confirmed by both sides is solely concerned with the grand jury proceedings and the question of whether there was prejudice around him and there was no disagreement indicated there with any of the determinations by the other four judges that the trial jury was there, that the trial was conducted properly and that a -- there was no error in the trial on the merits. 
    And I'd also like to refer the court to counsel -- he says that the grand jury proceedings infected the trial for the reason that certain evidence adduced there was available in various ways. Of course that is to start with the purpose of the grand jury proceeding is to get this evidence, but also this evidence, the impeaching of the witness or testifying to admissions by the petitioner, any of these things that counsel refers to are equally available in other criminal cases by either the testimony of investigating police or testimony of persons present at preliminary hearing. 
    Incidentally in King County, almost 95% of the criminal cases are -- have a preliminary hearing. 
    It's very, very few. 
    They are filed directly in the Superior Court, almost invariably in King County. 
    There is a preliminary hearing on a criminal case in which case you'd have the identical situation at the trial in the merits in regard to things that transpired at the preliminary hearing as far as matters of evidence.

    Now, he complains about certain language used by the deputy prosecutor which was in rebuttal argument. 
    Now, I'd like to just call the Court's attention to a bit of language which the deputy prosecutor was answering there. 
    At the record, page 308, this was Mr. Burdell's closing argument to the jury. 
    One of the things you told me was that you could consider this case on its merits and that you would not be influenced, you would not be biased, you wouldn't be prejudiced by the rumors and the gossips in a frenzied, insane propaganda that could've been created only by somebody with the insanity of (Inaudible) has created about Mr. Beck. 
    And further down that page, no matter what you told me, your minds must be subconsciously influenced by the tremendous amount of unfavorable publicity that has been circulated about Mr. Beck almost to the point of saturation of the public press in the radio, in the newspapers repeated and repeated and repeated the Nazi system. 
    Further down that page, he tells the jury, “He should not be convicted because some group of United States Senators find it convenient all of a sudden to utilize the airwaves in the radio and the television and the newspapers to somehow make some political capital and make political gain.” 
    Now, in 309 he says, “But nevertheless, Mr. Beck testified as he did before the grand jury, as he did before the grand jury without a lawyer, without a judge in the presence of four representatives of the prosecuting attorney” and further on, he says, “I wonder if some of you by now haven't discovered why it is important for people to take the Fifth Amendment.

Further down the page, but when you go before a grand jury or a court and all you can do is answer the questions put to you by the prosecutors and you don't have an opportunity to say what you mean, you didn't have an opportunity to explain, at that point, the deputy prosecutor objected on bringing in all of these things outside the record and asked the counsel be admonished to confine his argument to the evidence before the jury.

    No, it has never been a basis for any decision in the lower courts except to the extent that it was raised by petitioner of course at every stage of the proceedings --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well that --
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="3706.248" stopTime="3708.548">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    -- but the court has never based its decision on that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3708.548" stopTime="3709.641">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Never based -- never made this constitution --

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Yes. 
    It never even saw fit to comment on it because apparently there is actually in fact not a federal question here.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    My next question going to be, you do concede that the petitioner has raised this constitutional question at every stage of the proceedings, do you?
speaker="james_e_kennedy" startTime="3724.013" stopTime="3727.049">
    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    Oh, yes, I concede (Inaudible) particular record in that regard.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3727.049" stopTime="3730.090">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But you agree with me that it's not been decided by the state court.

    Mr. James E. Kennedy 
    No, it hasn't.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
