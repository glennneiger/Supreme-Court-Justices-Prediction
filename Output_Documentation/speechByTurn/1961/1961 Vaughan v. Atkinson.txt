    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    This is a case here on certiorari -from the Fourth Circuit involving a seaman in the characterization of Mr. Justice Story awarded the admiralty. 
    The uniqueness is that seldom the case of this import require the intervention or intervent -- interposition as some people might call it of this Honorable Court. 
    There are two questions involved and set forth in our petition, two principal questions, whether or not maintenance is the sto -- is designed to restore post-earnings of itself and the right to maintenance whether it should be unaffected by the incidental earning at shore while the seaman is a patient under treatment, unfit to do seaman's work. 
    And there's a second point as to where a shipowner for 23 months has held by both courts below at least in the minority opinion refers to the finding of fact which are conclusive both on the court below and this Court unless the Court goes back to the earlier theory of a new trial both in the Court of Appeals and here in an admiralty case where the shipowner refuses to pay maintenance for 23 months to a sick seaman and for -- thereby forcing the seaman to go to the trouble of an expensive in -- instituting a suit, obtaining a decree of the admiralty court for his maintenance during these 23 months period. 
    We say that the shipowner cannot escape paying damages merely because the seaman eventually gets well. 
    And in that, we are supported by the opinion of Chief Judge Sobeloff who wrote the minority orders sending opinion in the court below. 
    Vaughan, the seaman in this case, had been employed aboard the vessel on two previous voyages and -- where he's paid off on March the 2nd, 1957. 
    It's important to keep the dates in mind to show these 23 months dereliction as the trial court on the part of the shipowner for which the seaman was only recompensed to the extent of interest on the weekly payments, they should've had all during these 23 months of delay. 
    And incidentally, some six months of the final payment was made after the libel was filed. 
    The case was in court and the trial judge had to take the matter up on two separate occasions before the final payments were made. 
    Now, the -- when the man was discharged, he was given a certificate to enter the marine hospital at Norfolk (ph) which he did on March the 7th and he was examined on that day and told to come back on March the 18th.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The voyage had ended at the time he was discharged?
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="262.108" stopTime="470.826">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    The voyage -- the particular trip now -- Your Honors in a case some years ago divided on the question of whether or not the provision, the usual provision in a foreign voyage of a six -- termination, no less than six months or no more than six months rather. 
    Some of Your Honors minority opinion there held that the six months provision prevailed and the majority I think it was a five-four decisions. 
    The majority held that it terminated as Your Honor suggested, when the trip was over, he was paid off and got a discharge from the ship no matter what the article might have called for with regard to a minimum period. 
    In this case, he received his wages on March the 2nd and then given the certificate entitling him without any cost to either the vessel or to the man to be en -- to enter and be treated at the marine hospital that's covered by a fund that's created out of some of the taxes that the shipowner has to pay in entering and clearing the customs on foreign voyages. 
    Now, the man entered the hospital as I've suggested on March the 18th, 1957 and was under treatment until June the 6th, 1957. 
    And during that period under the law, he could not recover any maintenance because he received his board and lodging while he was in the hospital. 
    But immediately upon leaving the hospital, under the principles enunciated during the day of the (Inaudible), they started the -- the status of the seaman as I've said of being awarded the admiralty because primarily in those days, he couldn't recover. 
    They were killed, there were no death statutes and the -- in most instances, couldn't recover even for an unseaworthy vessel. 
    That doctrine came along a hundred years after. 
    But he -- from time immemorial got maintenance and cure and that's been thought or furthered away to some extent by the last principles that have been announced that they -- if he can't be cured, if he's beyond cure, then they -- the harsh rule is that the shipowner's liability stops that he -- the only time that the shipowner has to enforce to pay is when there is some possibility of his recovery. 
    And he must establish that he has been in the employ of the vessel when this injury or the sickness occurred. 
    And that's entirely separate apart from what Your Honors have heard under the Jones Act and under the unseaworthy doctrine as to the liability of the shipowner for damages or any negligent or injury whether willful or not or whether it's a -- as a result of the unseaworthiness of the vessel. 
    But this doctrine --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="470.826" stopTime="474.276">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    All you have to show is that the injury or illness or incapacity --

    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="474.635" stopTime="476.488">

speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="476.488" stopTime="523.727">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But we say and the Chief Judge in the court below agreed with us, that here and the -- the District Judge in entering up his judgment while he -- doesn't -- the use -- the vigorous language as the Chief Justice -- Chief Judge Sobeloff is -- agrees that this was a callous disregard of the rights of this seaman or any other seaman to recover maintenance under the circumstances unless that it in this case and at that disregard continued for some two months after the libel was filed.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="523.727" stopTime="528.464">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, Mr. Morewitz, let me get a couple of things straight in my own mind, cure is not involved in this case?
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="528.464" stopTime="534.716">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    Cure is not involved because he was under treatment, had outpatient treatment for as -- over two years, I think.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="534.716" stopTime="536.194">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right from the beginning that --
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="536.194" stopTime="540.115">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    And he was discharged finally as fit for duty --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="540.115" stopTime="540.415">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="540.415" stopTime="541.199">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    -- as a seaman.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="541.199" stopTime="542.139">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So cure is not in any way involved in this case?
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="542.139" stopTime="543.566">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    Cure is not involved.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="543.566" stopTime="544.730">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    All that is involved is maintenance?
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="544.730" stopTime="545.666">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    Is the maintenance.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="545.666" stopTime="553.500">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And now, what is it -- your position that -- the -- that it was the extent of the respondent's obligations so far as maintenance goes because --
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="553.500" stopTime="553.791">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    Well --

speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="555.570" stopTime="555.940">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="555.940" stopTime="560.842">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And I shall think of it at least be arguable that there was absolutely no obligation with respect to maintenance.
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="560.842" stopTime="591.551">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Your Honors availed in the -- from the days of Mr. Justice Story up to present, no court as far as I know had held that it ends with a trip because that would knock out all the benefits that a seaman would get by reason of his employment. 
    If you just cast him a shore and put him on relief or subject to charity the very thing that the initial principles when a seaman was a slave was created to prevent.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="591.551" stopTime="595.963">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right. 
    Well then how -- what's -- how long would this obligation to pay maintenance continue --

    Until he --

    I don't --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="604.601" stopTime="608.430">

    -- would be -- he's either cured or it was shown that he was incurable?
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="608.430" stopTime="609.060">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    That's the principle.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="609.060" stopTime="612.327">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And the obligation to pay maintenance would go on until that point was reached?
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="612.327" stopTime="748.726">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now here, without any excuse whatsoever, I haven't heard a whole lot today and I was very much interested in the National Labor Relations cases with regard to the proposition of good faith on the part of the owner or the employer. 
    In the case at bar, it would seem to us that the burden was on the respondent's shipowner convinced both of the lower courts if he could. 
    He had a faith of any kind. 
    Good -- certainly, we have a right to argue as the -- intermitted by the Chief Judge's opinion, the case below that the shipowner's faith in this case was entirely bad that he had no excuse whatsoever and didn't endeavor to even argue much less establish in the courts below that he paid any regard to this seaman's rights with regard to maintenance, it's been long established, which doesn't require any contract of the courts and this Court have held in the ca -- the decision that's cited by both sides of Mr. Justice Cardozo with regard to the establishment. 
    The only thing that the seaman has to establish is that he's been employed onboard of this vessel and is given service on. 
    It doesn't go so far as to -- to be a self-infatuating insurance, but it goes pretty close to it and then in some respects even -- we think go to a lot further because I don't know if there may be some insurance policies that require the insurance company to pay forever if there's any chance of the seaman reestablishing himself but I think it goes to that extent in the case of this sort if there's any probable reason to believe that the seaman can recover so he can go back to work.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="748.726" stopTime="751.551">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Go back to work as a seaman or go back to work generally (Inaudible)?
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="751.551" stopTime="864.355">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    I think under the present day, the charge that he gets for them -- the hospital in which took over two years here to get, was that he was fit for duty as a seaman. 
    And in the meantime, what the shipowner is seeking to take advantage of here that he was employed as a part-time taxi driver and had some earnings during that period, during that long period while the shipowner wasn't paying him anything. 
    That shipowner under the trial judge's decision was able to deduct the maintenance from the -- deduct from the amount of maintenance that he was undoubtedly entitled to receive under a union contract which is unconditional if Your Honors will read it both so far as we referred to it here and I'll refer to it in a moment. 
    Under the union contract here which is contrary to what Your Honors have heard in the labor relations cases if necessarily be negotiated before it could be enact -- acted upon. 
    Here, there's no question about what the union contract had been negotiated and repeatedly renegotiated that what it contains and it's unqualified. 
    And yet, with all of the line, the plain language that it contains, the shipowner without making any attempt to rely on it prior to the time the suit was instituted, was able to convince the trial court and the majority of the court below that the amount that he earned when he was forced to work in order to keep himself going to in this period that he was a patient that that should be duc -- deducted from the maintenance that was due him under the contract.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="864.355" stopTime="869.216">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, now the contract didn't -- the contract specified the amount of -- for the --

    Well, that -- the -- as I --

    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    To be paid weekly. 
    And it was to be paid without any question as through the position of a lawyer that even ignored any lien that a lawyer might have or any course under the statute of the United States that Your Honor probably familiar where that -- they -- you couldn't attach the wages of a seaman under any circumstances for any claim that the shipowner might have or anybody else might have.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="925.084" stopTime="925.101">

    But --

    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    That when he is entitled to wages under the law as laid down for nearly a 100 years by Congress that they -- you can't arrest his wages and you certainly couldn't arrest his maintenance. 
    You can't even do that on a workman's compensation. 
    But they -- here, the court below said that the -- and the trial court held that the prevailing opinion of the majority opinions supported the view that it could be deducted. 
    We say that the majority opinions were the other way and that on reason and authority, it's the other way. 
    And I come --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now I would -- I should think, it just appears to me that the respondent could take an even more extreme position.

speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="986.252" stopTime="998.564">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    That would be true if he was reestablished in the status of a seaman so he could earn what he was able to earn as a seaman.

    And they -- there the -- while I have great respect for Judge Soper, we've been on the bench for a long while, he doesn't attempt to discuss the main propositions that Chief Judge Sobeloff sets forth at some length. 
    As a matter of fact, the opinion of Judge Soper, I think it's about no more than two pages and refers to the decisions in the Second Circuit as being a better view than the decision in the Third Circuit. 
    The fact remains that the principles that are applicable to the case that we have here are enunciated as firmly as it could be by Chief Judge Sobeloff.

    Whatever judgment of this Court is, it will affect seamen at large because as I've pointed out, the proposition of maintenance and the -- and their refusal to take care of it for some 23 months as in the case at bar would be a whole lot worse in the case of a foreign seaman if he were cast ashore and put in an American hospital and no way of getting home and beaten in any such way as this.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1312.837" stopTime="1314.166">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let me suggest some --
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="1314.166" stopTime="1314.650">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    I --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1314.650" stopTime="1421.523">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let me suggest some. 
    There's a general principle of law that from the point of view of the public interest, we're dealing here with a public interest, namely the protection of a seaman. 
    There's a general principle of law that damages of a legal in -- of a person may be entitled to them must be reduced. 
    The man can't fold his arms and say, We'll take a good number of contracts where cases have arisen. 
    The man is employed by a company, so much for years and he's unduly discharged, he was unduly fired. 
    I suppose the doctrine is universal that he can't just say, Well, you charged me unfairly. 
    I'm going to sue you. 
    I was -- demand a salary of $20,000 or $10,000 or $5000 or $50,000. 
    And not only can't he just collect all that he would've earned if he stayed there but there's almost a duty to reduce the damages because society -- it's the society's interest not to have economic weight. 
    This Court adopted that -- applied that doctrine in the labor cases where an employee who however affluent he may be in this questionably affluent society, isn't too affluent so he can't fold his arms. 
    And we held that the employer who disobeyed the Wagner Act must make good but not to the extent that you can't deduct what the employee earned or reasonably could have earned. 
    Now, please tell me why that doctrine doesn't apply to this situation?
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="1421.523" stopTime="1448.356">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    I refer again to Judge Sobeloff's opinion and say to Your Honor this, that there's a vital distinction between wages earned particularly on shore and maintenance such as -- as implied in the contract for seamen because he's entitled to maintenance plus wages. 
    The seaman is entitled to wages plus his maintenance as long as the voyage continues.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1448.356" stopTime="1452.329">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, but maintenance is full of purpose, namely that he should be sustained.
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="1452.329" stopTime="1453.042">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1453.042" stopTime="1478.347">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And if he can sustain himself or has sustained himself by earning otherwise, why should the law which is law imposed, law enforce, why should the law say, Although you were maintained by having a job nevertheless, they think the fellow efficiency, owner's duty, the ships duty is to maintain you although you have been maintained."
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="1478.347" stopTime="1479.666">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    But Your Honor, in this case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1479.666" stopTime="1487.567">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So you're sustained, you're also entitled to maintenance because we are here to determine whether you're entitled to maintenance under these conditions.
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="1487.567" stopTime="1508.633">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    But, the position that we take, supported by Judge Sobeloff is that the shipowner can't take unilateral action to force a seaman to be employed so as -- in order to create a windfall if you want to term it that, in the reduction of what is undoubtedly due under the seaman's contract. 
    He doesn't --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1508.633" stopTime="1512.842">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that you can't say the exactly the same thing regarding the employer --

    Yes sir, but if --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The employer has fired him and the employer was entitled to earn wages that felt stodge, but in the meantime, he earned -- he had an income otherwise, I don't mean of an income because the rich uncle died, an income to working otherwise and you might say the employer had a windfall.
speaker="jacob_l_morewitz" startTime="1535.431" stopTime="1554.448">
    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz 
    But now here, the contract says that this payment shall be made Your Honor, regardless of whether he has or has not obtained an attorney, filed a claim for damages or taken any other steps to that end and irrespective of any insurance arrangements in effect between the company and any insurer.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1554.448" stopTime="1556.709">

    The difference made no attempt and supposed to paid rigidly on a weekly basis. 
    But here, he paid nothing --

    Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz

    That's also -- he loses that too so the net result is that he gets very little -- what his contract call for in the face of the contract which says that the attorney's obligation should be disregarded.

    Whether or not as between solicitor and client as set forth by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in this Ticonic case sometime ago, whether that's an -- the court there -- in that case in a footnote referred to the admiralty rule which was disregarded by both the majority opinion and the trial court's opinion that attorney's fees as between solicitor and client are recoverable in the case of this sort. 
    And this is a vital question that isn't the -- this -- I don't imagine Your Honor for a grant of certiorari to begin with.

    Now, if the shipowner -- I'd go this far -- if the shipowner had paid this man anything at all or even made a refusal to pay, they didn't even acknowledge his letter, sending him a copy of the hospital report when he left the hospital, registered mail. 
    They didn't even acknowledge that.

    Mr. Walter B. Martin, Jr. 
    -- the articles. 
    I wasn't citing it for -- they're my statement of the facts. 
    Upon release from the Public Health's Hospital in June of 1957, the seaman immediately went to work for his brother who owned a taxicab company in Newport News, Virginia. 
    He wrote a letter to the shipowner, sent him a copy of his medical discharge certificate from the Public Health Hospital, requested a payment of maintenance. 
    The owner investigated the claim. 
    He contacted the master of the vessel. 
    The master of the vessel said, The man had never made any complaint onboard his ship. 
    The law again presented the case. 
    The man had been discharged in the normal course of his employment. 
    The slip sent by the man to the owner showed that he reported to the hospital more than two weeks after his discharge from the vessel. 
    Now, this was an admission on -- omission on the part of the seaman and that he did not tell the owner of his original contact with the hospital. 
    When he had first gone there, they had told him to come back some week or six days later. 
    With these facts, the owner denied any liability and no further contact was heard from the seaman for a period of a year-and-a-half. 
    For a year-and-a-half, he did not report.

    Was the formal denial, is that in the record?
speaker="walter_b_martin_jr" startTime="2185.652" stopTime="2189.793">
    Mr. Walter B. Martin, Jr. 
    No, there was no formal denial. 
    It was denial and that they did not reply.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2189.793" stopTime="2191.149">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Didn't reply?
speaker="walter_b_martin_jr" startTime="2191.149" stopTime="2587.205">
    Mr. Walter B. Martin, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    A year-and-a-half, the seaman did nothing. 
    He worked and then he had paid the services of an attorney and he filed a suit. 
    A motion for interlocutory decree for award of maintenance was brought on before the District Judge. 
    It was heard and argued. 
    The District Judge, in an order requiring the shipowner to pay the seaman $8 per day less what he earned as a taxicab driver. 
    Now, the shipowner complied with that decree promptly. 
    And he complied with it all along. 
    And this -- I think is of interest. 
    The judge did not say to the seaman, You have to continue working as a taxicab driver, but after the decree was entered and after the maintenance pay much were paid, the seaman continued to work for a period of some four months until he had been declared fit for duty as a taxicab driver. 
    And all during this period of approximately two years while this seaman was an outpatient, he was being treated at Public Health Hospital at periodic times, primarily with X-rays. 
    He had a suspected chest condition that it was never -- they were never able to determine exactly what it was. 
    He was being treated with the knowledge of the physicians that he was doing this particular this type of work. 
    It was not injurious to his health. 
    It was a type of work that he had spent most of his adult life doing. 
    In fact, it's not in the record but he has continued to do this work since his discharge from the marine hospital. 
    He has not gone back to sea. 
    But they say he's not a professional seaman. 
    As to the law here involved, and I think on the law, we stand on a very firm pedestal. 
    The doctrine of maintenance and cure is an ancient doctrine. 
    It has its origin in the laws of the Mediterranean lands existing before the time of Christ. 
    The principle basically was that the seaman employed on a vessel was entitled to be cured at the expense of the owner if he was injured or if he incurred an illness in the service of the vessel. 
    This doctrine came down to our early admiralty courts through the English admiralty courts. 
    It was first enunciated by this Court in the Osceola in 1903. 
    It had been followed by the law of admiralty courts in this country since after the revolution. 
    The Osceola redefined the right of maintenance and cure saying that the shipowner owed to the seaman the duty to furnish him maintenance and cure until he was fit for duty or until he had reach the form of maximum cure. 
    Following the Osceola in 1904, this Court handed down a decision in the Iroquois which involved a sailing vessel bound from South America to the United States where there's seaman onboard who had suffered an attack of appendicitis. 
    And the question was whether the master should've put in to the Port of Valparaiso in order to give the man more immediate medical care. 
    And there, the court in dicta said that the shipowner had this particular duty to furnish him maintenance and furnish him cure as promptly as possible, that if he did not furnish these elements, that the seaman might have a right of action. 
    That was dictum. 
    Some 28-29 years later, 1932, this Court handed down the Cortes decision in which a seaman died of pneumonia onboard a vessel at sea. 
    The administrator of the seaman's state claimed that the vessel should've been put into port. 
    And there, this Court held that the right of maintenance and cure was a contractual right. 
    It was a right that grew out of the contract. 
    It was an implied provision of the seaman's contract. 
    And that if this provision of the contract was breached, then the seaman's administrator in this case had a cause of action for damages, just as you would for the breach of any contract, the damages that naturally float from the breach which would be expensed that the man had to incur for his own maintenance or for the cost of his medical care that he had to employ or for the damage that he may have suffered in the case of Cortes, of the seaman that died. 
    Now, the finding in this case was that the refusal of the shipowner to furnish maintenance and cure did not cause this seaman any physical or mental injury. 
    In fact, the requiring of him to go to work was probably a very good therapeutic thing for him to do. 
    If he had suffered any injury, he would have a right of action but he has suffered none. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals below rested its decision primarily on a very learned decision, handed down by the Second Circuit, Wilson against United States, a decision written by Learned Hand, Judge Lumbard and Judge Medina in which they held that the right of maintenance was contractual. 
    And it was so contractual that the seaman had a corresponding duty to mitigate. 
    And in that case which I say was on all fours with this particular case, the Second Circuit said that the seaman's earnings, I believe in that case is a dishwasher, were to be credited against the $8 a day that would do him for maintenance.

    This is a suit under a contract, under the implied agreement of a shipowner to furnish maintenance and cure.

    This is a doctrine that grew as you know out of trick principles of contract law but whatever it is, it was a theory that they owed this man long vintage start to pay him equity in good conscience.
