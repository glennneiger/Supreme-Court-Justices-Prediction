    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Appellant appealed to this Court pursuant to Title 28, Section 1253 from an order entered by a three-judge District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Western Division on February 10th, 1961. 
    The order which was entered after a trial on the merits state all further proceedings in this cause pending suit for declaratory judgment by the appellant for construction of the state statute under consideration. 
    In this case, appellant challenges the refusal of the appellee, City of Memphis and its lessee, Dobbs Houses to serve Negroes in the main dining room of the Dobbs Houses' Restaurant which is located in the Memphis Municipal Airport. 
    The appellant's claim is that such refusal in the light of the conceded facts in this case and set of law violates rights secured to him and members of his class by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and that he was entitled to the issuance of an immediate permanent injunction. 
    However, in view of this Court's decision on yesterday in the case of Bailey against Patterson, holding that three judges are not required, when as here, prior decisions by this Court make frivolous any claim that a state statute is not unconstitutional on its face, appellant request this Court to dispose of this case in the same manner in which it disposed of the Bailey case or in the alternative to consider the papers on this appeal as a petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit before judgment where there is presently pending an appeal from the same order sought to be reviewed by this Court. 
    And in support of this request, appellant --

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes, sir, the exact same order and the same record is now before the Court of Appeals because we had some doubt that this was properly a three-judge court case. 
    It's to protect ourselves. 
    We perfected an appeal to the Court of Appeals.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="225.909" stopTime="235.853">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And now, I gather your position is, therefore our decision yesterday is satisfied that an appeal here has not lied that should have been a single judge determination.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes, sir.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right sir. 
    However, we would like the Court, as I indicated to treat this case as it did the Bailey case that is, to determine the authority of the District Court which we say in this case, the only authority the District Court had in view of the fact -- that the view of the fact that the facts were considered and the law was settled was to enter permanent injunction. 
    And there really would be no purpose served in sending this case or sending us to the Court of Appeals because there is nothing to the Court of Appeals to do, we say, except to direct the entry of a permanent injunction.

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="354.424" stopTime="368.753">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, you know, the regulation here on its face, either required or permitted segregation and we say that there is no construction which the state court could give to that regulation.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, we would still have the constitutional question here that is the reference of the state court would not dispose of a constitutional question whether this lessee is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment so that we say there was no need to refer to the state court for that construction.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    The -- yes, the constitutional issue would be not be mooted or eliminated from the case if the state court should hold that the regulatory agency was without power to issue such regulation because, you see, Dobbs Houses says, quite apart from any state order or statute, we segregate on our own as a matter of business practice. 
    So the question here is whether they can being this kind of lessee.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mrs. Motley, is this case, in your view, ruled by Burton against the Wilmington Parking Association?

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="437.817" stopTime="483.568">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that's what I had assumed and in that regard, the difference from the Bailey case because in Bailey case we were dealing with the conceded public utilities. 
    In the Burton case, the Court had to go through an examination of the relationship between the restaurant and (Inaudible) and the question of statutory authorization or direction was -- did not trouble the majority, it was not involved in the majority but Court ruled in that case. 
    Now, in this case, are there any questions, could any questions arise similar to those which had to be canvassed in Burton before the decision was reached?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="483.568" stopTime="510.113">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    I think in this case, they conceded in effect that this was Burton because they conceded that this was a restaurant in a municipally owned airport, the purpose of which was to serve the public. 
    There was no question here that the public was served in this restaurant. 
    They attach to their answer a copy -- the city attached to its answer a copy of the lease and --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The -- the court of -- the District Court, the three-judge court, am I right, doesn't -- was this decided, was this ruling made with the decision of the District Court before or after the Burton decision here?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm just trying to find out whether this is like Bailey in that -- the starting point of Bailey was a series of decisions which didn't leave the question open that deemed to be open by the District Court in Mississippi. 
    Now, what you are saying is the same situation is here?

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes.

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="624.460" stopTime="632.818">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, I think here, the -- it's like Bailey because this Court had decided the Muir case which again was a lease of a public --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="632.818" stopTime="633.491">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What's this?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="633.491" stopTime="679.005">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    The Muir versus Louisville Park Theatrical Association in the same Circuit. 
    This si -- was a Sixth Circuit case and that case involved the lease of amphitheater in a public park. 
    The Sixth Circuit held that the lessee in that case was not subject to the Fourteenth Amendment and this Court in 1954 immediately following Brown reversed or vacated the Sixth Circuit's decision and sent it back for consideration in the light of Brown, and the provisions which then prevailed. 
    So that it was settled, I think that any lease of public property used for public purpose, there is no question if you were using this facility for public purpose, has been settled.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="679.005" stopTime="692.677">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But when say the Court -- when you say the Court sent it back to reconsider in the light of Brown, you're implying, are you not, that this Court didn't say this is so, didn't do in that case but we did in Bailey yesterday?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="692.677" stopTime="698.101">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well in Bailey, yesterday, there was also an airport restaurant involved and the lessee and this Court --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, but --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="698.390" stopTime="705.275">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley

    You see, the Jackson Municipal Airport is a party defendant in Bailey.

    But if --

    Oh, that was said in Bailey unless I'm mistaken, the Government transportation.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    I believe there is only the Hendrik case and the Coke, District Court decision. 
    In the Coke case in Atlanta, the same restaurant was involved Dobbs Houses and the District Court there ruled that that lessee arrangement was subject to the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    In the Hendrick case which we cited in our brief that involved an airport facility in South Carolina in which the Court ruled that we were entitled to an immediate injunction in that case.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What is it that you -- you ask of this Court, Mrs. Motley?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="823.522" stopTime="879.198">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    We ask this Court to do one of two things; either refer this case back to the District Court pursuant to its power to determine the authority of the District Court and say to the District Court, “Your only authority here was to issue the injunction prayed for because the facts were conceded. 
    This was a public restaurant in a public airport” and the law was settled that where or is now settled by Burton that where you have a public facility which has been leased for public purpose or public use concededly then that lessee is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We think as this Court pointed out in Bailey yesterday, although it doesn't have jurisdiction of this appeal, it does have jurisdiction to determine the authority of the District Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="879.198" stopTime="922.871">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well that -- I didn't -- I didn't hear and therefore could not -- couldn't understand what are answer was to Justice Harlan's question that if the District Court now, in light of Bailey and all that preceded, might pose that in fact Memphis didn't have power, that the regulation is ultra vires to specific powers and go on that ground which is a very different thing from striking down as invalid an exercise of power. 
    So, the District Court might do that, would it not?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="922.871" stopTime="932.559">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, he might that but he would still have to say, in addition, I think, that this lessee is -- is a Burton case that wouldn't be --

    To me, that makes no difference.

speaker="frank_b_gianotti_jr" startTime="1485.243" stopTime="1621.984">
    Mr. Frank B. Gianotti, Jr. 
    Well, we will, of course, concern as to the position that counsel would take. 
    I'm not quite sure that I -- I fully understand it. 
    On the first reading or second reading or three readings of the Bailey case, it might appear that -- that part of the ground had been lifted out from under our position. 
    On the other hand, we would like briefly to make this statement, in an attempt to point out the difference as we see, as indicated already by Justice Frankfurter in the Burton case, which as has been stated, was not on the books at the time Judges Martin, Boyd and Miller filed the decision in this case which closely followed Harrison versus NAACP. 
    In other words, the District Court, three-judge court felt that on the basis of the expressions contained in the Harrison case, the fact that the -- all sides of the case were apparently fully discussed among the members of this Court, that the premise seem to be present to the three-judge court, that Harrison should be followed. 
    We're having at some concern frankly in -- in trying to analyze the case decided on yesterday where no mention is made of Harrison. 
    And the language used not only in the majority opinion but also in the dissenting opinion in the Harrison case, it seemed to leave no doubt but that where you had statutes that had not been authoritatively decided by a state court and to meet the test usually applied in abstention cases, some three or four are member. 
    There hasn't a friction for instance. 
    There's one, as I remember, and some others at the -- the matter should be decided by a state court. 
    If I may digress for just a moment --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1621.984" stopTime="1623.373">

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That wouldn't be necessary, would it, if in the facts to both sides who admit it, showed beyond dispute that the situation existed in connection with the transportation facilities which existed in the Bailey case? 
    I could begin --
speaker="frank_b_gianotti_jr" startTime="1638.264" stopTime="1656.312">
    Mr. Frank B. Gianotti, Jr. 
    I necessarily, Your Honor, it's already been indicated here. 
    May it please Your Honor that for example, it might well be contended that the regulation, you see there two statutes involved. 
    Originally, it was a city ordinance which is out of the record. 
    Well, I will be gladly explaining it if the Court --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1656.312" stopTime="1667.467">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would it -- would it bother you -- would it bother you to state precisely at this time what you think the record shows that we have to consider as the facts from each sides?
speaker="frank_b_gianotti_jr" startTime="1667.467" stopTime="1668.258">
    Mr. Frank B. Gianotti, Jr. 
    From each what?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1668.258" stopTime="1680.760">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    From both parties. 
    The common ground between them as to the effects on how this is operated, this facility, is it an interstate facility?
speaker="frank_b_gianotti_jr" startTime="1680.760" stopTime="1695.133">
    Mr. Frank B. Gianotti, Jr. 
    Yes, it takes on both interstate and intrastate. 
    In other words, the rest of it and Mr. Heiskell, of course, will speak for himself on that but, briefly, patrons use it who are not in interstate commerce.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1695.133" stopTime="1695.496">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do interstate --
speaker="frank_b_gianotti_jr" startTime="1695.496" stopTime="1826.727">
    Mr. Frank B. Gianotti, Jr. 
    It is an attractive place for people who go and dine and watch airplanes take off and land. 
    So -- this complaint made no point that the plaintiff Turner was an interstate commerce. 
    There is no statement in the record other than in the affidavit in connection with an application for summary judgment. 
    The original complaint as filed made no mention of the interstate commerce whatsoever. 
    Now, the point I was trying to get to in order to develop our thinking on this one point and has been briefly have mentioned I think by Justice Frankfurter or one of the other justices when they talk about the -- the basis for the regulation. 
    Now, it could very well be that this regulation as adopted by the Department of Conservation in the State of Tennessee has nothing to do with sanitation. 
    In other words, it's distinctly unconnected with it or completely unconnected with it in every way so that it is quite possible as did happen in the Streetcar case which this Court had in New Orleans, Evers versus Dwyer. 
    The facts briefly veiled that when this Court sent in it back because of this standing, and by the way Evers versus Dwyer, as Your Honors well know is referred to in the Bailey case. 
    It's one of the points, but when it went back, the transit company which was then owned by a private operation, decided voluntarily to desegregate. 
    I -- I'm trying to point out, may it please, Your Honor, just how quickly sometimes these things will resolve and you don't have quite problem that you think you do but you have to do it under a judicial manner. 
    As elected or as appointed officials, it is in my very humble opinion, almost impossible to take a position. 
    You neither agree -- you neither satisfy my friends on the left nor do you satisfy your friends on the right.

    The state has bar -- has required segregation under law of the State in this airport which people use by interstate and then transit passengers to come into and get served?
speaker="frank_b_gianotti_jr" startTime="1875.042" stopTime="1993.410">
    Mr. Frank B. Gianotti, Jr. 
    On that particular sta -- statute, the answer is yes. 
    The other statute involved is a permissive type statute which gives to Dobbs House its right to serve whomsoever it may choose to serve. 
    Now, we would like to keep in mind the fact that the cases cited in counsel's brief and the cases alluded to by this Court, the Boynton case and the Burton case have both been state cases. 
    They're going up through the state processes and that was a way I was trying -- a point I was trying to make just a moment ago. 
    When the criminal courts of Shelby County refused to issue warrants against local transit officials for violating the segregation bus laws, still on the books of the State of Tennessee, segregation on buses automatically ended in that particular case much quicker, much faster than the method suggested by Ms. Motley in this case. 
    In other words, we found ourselves in an entirely different position that is the City of Memphis, we were abiding by the -- the three-judge court of Martin -- Judges Martin, Miller and Boyd in Evers versus Dwyer which also was an abstention ruling and an order to that effect in that case. 
    It is out of the picture. 
    It has since -- the case has since been disposed off by a motion to dismiss it, but my point is that the action which terminated bus segregation in Memphis came about as the result of the action of a state court rather than a federal court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1993.410" stopTime="1999.516">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or -- as a result of inaction of the -- of the executive part of your municipality, is that it?
speaker="frank_b_gianotti_jr" startTime="1999.516" stopTime="2114.828">
    Mr. Frank B. Gianotti, Jr. 
    Well, the faith -- no, well, in action, yes, on the part from a recommending standpoint on the office of the City Attorney. 
    In other words, if I may briefly say, it -- it felt -- we felt that it was more than we should assume to say to the Chief of Police or to his honor or anyone, “Yes, you have a right to issue a warrant charging X with viola -- violating the segregation laws of the State of Tennessee.” 
    We would not make such a statement. 
    When we refused to make it, those who have different ideas from the ideas expressed and contended for by Ms. Motley and her clients, they went into and attempted to get warrant issued but our local courts refused to issue the warrant. It's been the policy of Tennessee in numerous cases. 
    Judge Neill in the Old United Artist case and the famous Curley case, which came to this Court by a certiorari, certiorari was denied but Judge Neill in that case specifically point out that color was not a factor and would not be considered by the Supreme Court of the State of Tennessee. 
    In a very recent case where (Inaudible) which was cited to the briefs and a covenant involving the sale to colored people, the same position was taken by the Supreme Court of Tennessee. 
    So I think we should have no fear if the Courts of Tennessee will decide these statutes, both of them, the permissive type statute somewhat similar to the Burton statute in Delaware and the other statute. 
    If that statute on its face is -- is bad, then, they should have no hesitancy in doing what the three-judge court directed that they do, simply file the suit in the state court.

    Mr. John M. Heiskell 
    The Dobbs House restaurants operate the airport restaurant in Memphis under a lease from the City of Memphis. 
    One of the provisions of that lease provides that it shall be used -- both portion of it shall be used for an unlawful purpose. 
    In the third offense set up by the City of Memphis in answer to the complaint filed in this cause, they state the regulation issued pursuant to statute by the Department of State Government which requires the segregation of restaurants in Tennessee, which regulation may not be constitutional but which has not then passed on at this point by any court with regard to its constitutionality. 
    The city sets up that regulation as existing state law and says as a part of their defense that if Dobbs Houses desegregates their restaurants, they will consider it a violation of Clause 20 of the lease which is the Unlawful Use Clause and that the lease will be subject to forfeiture. 
    Now, we have sought on behalf of Dobbs Houses and we thought the doctrine announced by the three-judge court was appropriate in that the constitutionality of that regulation should be decided by a state court. 
    We are still at that opinion, but we have been brought in -- in the position and are in the position that if we desegregate the restaurant without having that regulation passed upon, the city has announced in the formal pleadings filed below that it will seek a forfeiture of the lease which Dobbs Houses holds. 
    Now, we have said that we think it is appropriate for the state courts to pass on it. 
    The ju -- declaratory judgment procedures are available to these plaintiffs that we -- we don't want to be in the position of litigating with the city or being prosecuted in the state courts if that procedure is followed then it has been declared that they consider it violative of the law of the State of Tennessee if we permit the restaurant to be operated in that manner. 
    And we say that we are very definitely of the opinion that this is a matter for the state courts. 
    The State Courts of Tennessee have shown no reluctance to follow the mandates of constitutional law laid down by this Court and other cases and we think that is the simple and expeditious way to dispose it. 
    Thank you.

    Well, It's -- it's not strictly speaking that defense may it please Your Honor because he says this defendant as above stated is advised that they are doing it under the 1875 Act. 
    It's not anything that the City of Memphis does.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No, you don't say advice. 
    You say this defendant averse that even if the ordinance is voided, that Dobbs operates the restaurant at the Memphis Airport as a private facility to which the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply and the operator has the legal right to enforce any rules and policies which it deems desirable to regard in the seating of patrons and so on.

    I'm like -- is an officer to this Court, if I can limit my position that way, I am bound by the same statement that Mr. Heiskell is bound. 
    Of course, that defense was raised prior to other decisions of this Court. 
    Does that answer Your Honor?

   Rebuttal of Constance Baker Motley
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="3047.489" stopTime="3209.883">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    May it please the Court. 
    I would just like to summarize the appellant's position and that is that we feel that this case is governed by Bailey in that here also is involved a transportation facility and that as this Court pointed out in Bailey, its prior decisions which were in existence when this answer was filed made clear that any state enforced segregation in a transportation facility was unconstitutional. 
    So that we think that the law was settled at the time this answer was filed in this case as result of the prior decisions of this Court. 
    So that we are asking the Court to dispose of this case in the same manner in which it disposed of the Bailey case by sending it to the District Court and saying your own -- your only authority in this case, in light of our prior decisions and certainly now, in the light of Bailey and Burton is to grant the criminal injunction requested because the facts are conceded. 
    And we've set forth in our brief all of the facts which we think make this case almost identical with Burton. 
    These are the facts which the Court sees from the lease in this case which the city attached to its answer. 
    And when the city attached that to its answer we moved for summary judgment that there was no dispute that this was a public restaurant. 
    Now, the plaintiff got a three-judge court in this case over his objection. 
    The record makes it clear that we argued that this was not a three-judge court case and the argument and summaries that's in the record and we pointed out that we -- we thought the law was settled that no three-judge court was required here so that they -- when we got these three-judge court, we got to delay in the enforcement of the constitutional right involved here which was not the full to the plaintiff. 
    And we think that they require us to now pursue the appeal in the Court of Appeals when the question here is well settled and will only penalize this plaintiff or appellant further with more delay which was not caused by the plaintiff in his original pleading. 
    We argued against it. 
    We did not ask for a three-judge court. 
    We got it as a consequence. 
    We got this long delay in the enforcement of a simple constitutional right which I think was clear from the day we filed this complaint that this appellant was entitled to.
