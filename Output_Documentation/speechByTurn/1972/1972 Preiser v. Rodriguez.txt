    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The question presented by these cases, is whether state prisoners complaining about the matter of their confinement should be able to obtain equitable relief under the Civil Rights Act given the applicability of the federal habeas corpus statute. 
    When these actions were commenced, each of the respondents was confined in a state prison. 
    Each was in custody pursuant to a valid state court judgment of conviction. 
    Each have been deprived of good-conduct-time-credits by the Department of Correction as a result of a disciplinary action of each and each immediately proceeded to the Federal District Court with a combined petition for a writ of habeas corpus and civil rights complaint. 
    In each case, the District Court held a hearing and granted relief on the merits rejecting the State’s argument that the actions were in the nature of habeas corpus applications. 
    Each of the respondents was released from physical confinement as a result of the District Court’s decision. 
    Individual panels of the Second Circuit heard appeals by the State taken in all three cases. 
    The panels which reviewed Rodriguez and Katzoff reversed the District Court on the ground that the applications were in the nature of habeas corpus petitions and there had been a failure to exhaust state court remedies. 
    Before Kritsky was decided, a motion to en banc Rodriguez and Katzoff was granted and Kritsky was ordered included in the en banc consideration. 
    Counsel were directed to brief and be prepare to argue two specific questions unrelated to the merits of these cases. 
    The first was the applicability of the doctrine of abstention and the second was the need to exhaust state court remedies. 
    After this Court’s decision in Wilwording against Swenson, the Circuit Court reversed the panel decisions in Rodriguez and Katzoff and affirmed the District Court in all three cases. 
    It is evident from the eight opinions that were written by the court below that until this Court decided Wilwording. 
    The second Circuit was evenly divided in considering this case by vote of 66 on the question of whether the claims raised should first have been presented to the state courts. 
    And what’s even more interesting is aside form the diverse opinion -- the division of opinion between the members of the Court is the fact that even among those who were very firm in their belief that the state should first have considered these claims. 
    There was no agreement as to whether exhaustion of remedies was required under the habeas corpus statute or whether exhaustion of remedy should be required under the Civil Rights Act. 
    Judges Friendly, Mansfield and Mulligan believe that these are all habeas corpus petitions and that the exhaustion requirement of Section 2254 is applicable. 
    Judges Lumbard, Moore, and Hayes believe that these might be considered as civil right actions but that in any event, despite the earlier decisions of this Court exhaustion of state judicial remedies was an order. 
    After Wilwording, a majority of the court below felt that they were bound to accept the inmate’s choice of remedy. 
    And based upon these earlier decisions of this Court, held that exhaustion of state judicial remedies was not required in these cases. 
    Petitioner seek reversal of the decision below on the ground that choice of remedy should not lay with the inmate as it presently does because any claim that he may raise regarding the legality of his custody is essentially in the nature of habeas corpus. 
    Custody is at the heart of the habeas corpus statute. 
    Section 2241 says, “The writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless he is in custody in violation of the constitution.” 
    Section 2254 says, “That a Federal Court shall not entertain an application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court conviction only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution. 
    The decisions of this Court which we cite in our brief make it clear that custody as it is used in the statute refers not simply to the reason -- the inmate is being confined, but to all the incidents of confinement as well Wilwording against Swenson reaffirmed this in the context of the Eighth Amendment claims that were there raised. 
    Actually, the respondents in this case do not deny the validity of this classification. 
    So much as they fear the application of the exhaustion requirement of Section 2254 and the arguments which they raised in reply to the question which the state has presented to the court and which is really not so much the invention of the state in this case as it is the concern of the Circuit Court which en banc these cases relate to the exhaustion requirement and whether or not there is any detriment to the inmate. 
    The reason which they emphasize the most and which I believe to be the least tenable was that there will be a delay to the state prisoner in reaching a federal form. 
    The reason I feel that this is the least tenable is that delay in reaching a federal court for a state prisoner or for any citizen has relevance only in so far as there is no adequate state court remedy.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mrs. Cohen, is this a question that should be decided by this Court just on the basis of competing policy considerations or it is basically statutory inquiry as to what congress has provide?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="375.832" stopTime="409.868">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Well, I commenced my argument with the reading from the statute of sections that I am sure this bench is very familiar with. 
    I think that initially, the proper classification of this case is determined by statute. 
    In this case, you have a habeas corpus statute. 
    The essence of that statute is custody and its custody in the context of a state court judgment of conviction and the sentence which follows. 
    Therefore, I think that the jumping of point for any consideration of where state prisoner claim should be presented is the habeas corpus statute. 
    Of course --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="409.868" stopTime="413.378">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Even with a state prisoner isn’t attacking the judgment under which he is concluded?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="413.378" stopTime="475.317">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Yes, I think that based upon the decisions of this Court, we have passed the point where conceptually the habeas corpus statute or legally the habeas corpus statute is devoted simply to a state court judgment of conviction in sentence. 
    I think this Court made that clear as I said in Wilwording against Swenson in the context of Eighth Amendment claims it did so on the context of Johnson against Avery which raised the question about the constitutionality of the -- a state prison regulation. 
    And as I say, I don’t believe that respondents really denied the appropriateness of this classification that if you -- they don’t claim that these cases are not properly habeas corpus. 
    I suppose if you ask them which category they would prefer to the end, they would say that if they have to really choose one of the other -- their choice would lie with the Civil Rights Act, but that simply because the decisions of this Court today are that the exhaustion of state judicial remedies would not be required.

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Not on the pure damage question and we did not argue that in our initial brief when we set forth the way in which we believe the damages could be handled.

speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="528.130" stopTime="544.872">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Yes, but in one situation, what we are saying is that it’s the claim that in the nature of equitable claims which should be properly treated under the habeas corpus statute because of the custody considerations and because of other policy considerations as well. 
    The pure damage action will commend in Civil Rights Act.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="544.872" stopTime="574.152">
    Unknown Speaker 
    As I understand -- do I misunderstand you when I understand this that your claim is that first of all it’s limited to cases involving prisoners in state custody. 
    And secondly, that when the complaint is either of the custody of itself or of the conditions of the custody and when the -- and in so far as the relief is either release or correction of the conditions of those custodies, then habeas corpus is and must should be an exclusive remedy?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="574.152" stopTime="585.064">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    That’s a perfect summary of the position which we adopt and which is consistent with the decisions of this Court. 
    This Court has made it clear that habeas corpus law is exactly for this kind of claim. 
    Now, --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="585.064" stopTime="590.716">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And that questions of damages are -- can properly be left to the civil action [Voice Overlap].

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    That they can and not only that but the damages --

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    That’s right.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="595.482" stopTime="598.009">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Not kind of a relief that the habeas corpus petition can deal.
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="598.009" stopTime="613.668">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    That’s why I believe that what we are asking the Court to hold in these cases is not always revolutionary as counsel for respondents would suggest. 
    But also important given the nature of prison rights litigation is the fact that damages really play a very small part in prison rights litigation.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="613.668" stopTime="623.205">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, let me see then Mrs. Cohen, I gather am I right in my history the extension of habeas corpus to state prisoners came in about 1867, did it not?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="623.205" stopTime="624.029">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Yes.

speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="629.729" stopTime="630.143">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Yes, that was about 1871, I think yes.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="630.143" stopTime="646.869">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Was that about 1870-1871. 
    Is there anything in the legislative history of either to indicate that Congress -- that’s we’re dealing with two federal statutes, that Congress meant that the prisoner should have to take one and couldn’t go the other --
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="646.869" stopTime="652.860">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    There is absolutely nothing in history of either statute to indicate that either statute was intended to reach these claims at all.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="652.860" stopTime="664.468">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, and then what basis do you suggest that we should say in the state prisoner that Congress said, that you have to go to a federal habeas in a situation, now, that you can’t and quote the remedy of 1983?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="664.468" stopTime="685.906">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    I don’t think -- I am not asking this Court to say that Congress said that the state prisoner should go to the habeas corpus statute. 
    What I believe is that Congress did not create the situation, which exists right now. 
    There is nothing in the history to show that either of these statutes should reach these prison rights claims. 
    The fact is that it’s only within the last ten years that these claims are considered --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="685.906" stopTime="689.409">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well then in what places are you suggesting that we should say to the state prisoner?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="689.409" stopTime="689.851">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Because --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="689.851" stopTime="697.345">
    Unknown Speaker 
    We have Congress’ variety with two remedies but you must take the federal habeas, you may not invoke the 1983?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="697.345" stopTime="729.362">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    To begin with, it’s on the basis of decisions by this Court that both of these remedies have been held applicable to these claims. 
    So, for that reason, I suggest that it lies with this Court to remedy the situation that is created. 
    I would also point out that there is nothing in either of these statutes to preclude the consideration of challenges to conviction in sentence under the Civil Rights Act and yet I don’t think anyone would suggest that seriously nor with this Court consider seriously that the Civil Rights Act was available to challenge your custody in so far as your conviction may have [Voice Overlap] obtain.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="765.203" stopTime="766.023">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right or --
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="766.023" stopTime="768.820">

    Or the incidence of their custody in any context.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="768.820" stopTime="770.896">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="770.896" stopTime="795.427">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    And as I say, you are not depriving the inmate of anything by saying that he is restricted to what is really the appropriate statute. 
    The argument that’s relied upon by respondent as I indicated before is the alleged delay in reaching the federal form. 
    But, given adequate state remedies, the delay is not a source of prejudice to the inmate. 
    In the case where you have --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="795.427" stopTime="797.931">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But of course if they are not adequate he doesn’t need to exhaust him?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="797.931" stopTime="845.956">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Not at all, exactly. 
    That’s exactly the standard for the operation of Section 2254. 
    For example in Wilwording against Swenson in this Court held that Missouri provided no remedies to state prisoners for the presentation of this type of claim. 
    Presumably, if since the Wilwording decision, Missouri has not created any new remedies or any remedies at all. 
    Every state prisoner in Missouri could come directly to a federal court and present his claims by way of habeas corpus. 
    There is not a question of any delay. 
    On the other hand, whereas you have state like New York which has remedies, we believe that the interest of a state and its responsibility for these cases require that the application of the Section 2254 requirement apply. 
    You have --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="845.956" stopTime="847.902">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Administrative remedies?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="847.902" stopTime="849.387">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    I am referring to both remedies here.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="849.387" stopTime="854.227">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, does he have to pursue if their alternative, does he have to pursue both?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="854.227" stopTime="867.649">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Well, administrative remedies would not apply in every situation in any event. 
    I think that if you had a situation where an inmate was challenging the constitutionality of a regulation, you would not --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="867.649" stopTime="868.724">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He’d go to a court?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="868.724" stopTime="895.658">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    He would go directly to a court because it would not lie within the power of the administrator to review it. 
    So, in that context, the administrative exhaustion would not result in any delay either. 
    On the other hand, if he is going to be suing the Department of Correction on the ground that a regulation was improperly applied to him, it seems to me that the claim is not right until the Department of Correction has taken some action with respect to it. 
    Now, --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="895.658" stopTime="902.539">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I will and that would then involve in exhaustion of the administrative process including judicial state -- judicial review if any?

    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Oh no, because the one thing that the decisions of this Court have made clear in expanding the custody concept for the habeas corpus statute is that release is not the sole relief that can be granted under the habeas corpus statute. 
    The habeas corpus statute says, “The court shall deal with the situation as law and justice require.” 
    And that means that he would be relieved to the illegal restraint under this remedy. 
    He need not be release from physical confinement, it’s in the statute.

    The -- well, the view we take is that habeas corpus is actually a better remedy than the injunctive proceeding because presumably the inmate would come in and seek a preliminary injunction under the Civil Rights Act so that he would get his food. 
    But, the habeas corpus statute would provide him with just as expeditious review and it would give him a final determination expeditiously.

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Well, there is -- it depends why are you talking his -- about filing his habeas corpus. 
    For example in New York, New York has an injunctive remedy. 
    If this inmate who is not getting his food in New York went into court, under the injunctive remedy specifically applicable to constitutional claims raised by state prisoners, he could get his injunctive relief right under that statute. 
    It’s designed to reach that kind of claim.

    So if you want some immediate relief, how can you get it in habeas corpus as swiftly as you can by temporary restraining order?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="1081.217" stopTime="1097.614">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Because when he comes into federal court on a habeas corpus petition, the statute -- the habeas corpus statute requires that that application be expeditiously decided. 
    Unlike the Civil Rights Act where there is no legal injunctions in the statute that the action has to be specifically decided.

speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="1106.509" stopTime="1114.787">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    But that only assumes that state remedies are inadequate and what I’ve been referring to now is an injunction proceeding that’s available by statutes specifically to this type of claim.

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Well, he would have to and but in that respect it wouldn’t be any different than if he were a federal prisoner before he can come in to a court, any court or federal court and seek and any relief from his confinement must pursue his administrative remedies.

    He can’t come in under 1983 because if he is suing a federal administrator if there is no state action.

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Yes, we are saying that if there are administrative remedies available, that the inmate who was being deprived of food. 
    Suppose you have a situation of a very vindictive warden as Mr. Justice Marshall suggested that he will give food to redheads. 
    There’s nothing to prevent the correction of that by the Commissioner of the Department of Correction upon an appropriate appeal. 
    The case meant never reach a federal court based upon that assumption. 
    But in any event and as I say, if this were a federal prisoner who had the same grievance against his warden, he would have to pursue that remedy before he could come to a federal court for an injunctive relief and that is a disparity which respondents have never answered except to say that Section 1983 doesn’t apply to the federal prisoner. 
    Why is it so much more onerous for a state prisoner to have to exhaust available administrative remedies which really go to the rightness of the claim? 
    And that is --

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Well, that’s what I am asking this Court to reconsider in this case because to the extent that 1983 has been extended to state prisoners for purposes of equitable relief. 
    That seems to me that that’s an inappropriate extension and that it should be withdrawing.

    I have yet to see a pro se application for preliminary injunction. 
    They initially will follow, there maybe in cases where counsel is representing the petitioner. 
    But in pro se cases, they will file a civil rights complaint.

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    There’s nothing to preclude the operation of the habeas corpus statute in that way. 
    There is nothing that says that the judge has to wait for a response from the State and in fact in upstate New York, typically that state is not putting any opposition in these cases. 
    They are decided right off the cuff by the judge to whom the petition is proceeded.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1431.153" stopTime="1462.400">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, I can’t put my thinking on what happens in upstate New York or upstate (Inaudible) talking about the general difference between habeas corpus and temporary restraint orders and preliminary injunctions. 
    And I know you can get a TRO without any notice in not in (Inaudible). 
    And I’ve never heard of writ of habeas corpus being issued without giving the other side an opportunity to open its mouth.
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="1462.400" stopTime="1481.556">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    And based upon the experience that I have seen in my office and virtually every habeas corpus application upstate and probably the reason we windup with so many appeals in the Second Circuit is the fact that we never put in a response upstate. 
    Those judges get the petitions and they decide them without any response from the state. 
    So, there is no uniform [voice overlap].
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1481.556" stopTime="1483.543">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And has soon do they decide?
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="1483.543" stopTime="1485.341">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Well, the very study that was cited --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1485.341" stopTime="1491.017">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I think we are so far out of the record in this case, I don’t mind going that one step further.
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="1491.017" stopTime="1646.382">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    I don’t have specific figures except that the study that cited by respondent indicates that in some cases the averages of four months but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be sooner and it doesn’t mean that it can be later. 
    The average in the ordinary civil rights action has no comparison, it’s much slower. 
    The reason that petitioners are urging this Court to hold that an exhaustion requirement is applicable is because it is -- it places the responsibility with the state which is where I belong. 
    It’s the state court which placed these people in custody. 
    It’s the state which should decide the limits and the incidence of the sentences it imposes. 
    The good-conduct-cases are perfect example of this because as we heard in the prior case considered by this Court today, things like good time parole eligibility, all enter into the sentencing process. 
    There is a direct relationship there between sentences has imposed by state court and how sentence is carried out. 
    It’s in that situation that we think that the state court have the responsibility to decide on these cases first. 
    Another example, our case is involving the place of confinement where a man is claiming that, “I should not be in a state prison, I should be in a hospital or I should be in the narcotics addiction control center.” 
    Here, you are talking about the very justification for sentence and you are talking about something where the responsibility lies with the state courts which impose these sentences. 
    And similarly, the reason -- another reason for requiring this is that the state is regulating virtually every aspect of the inmate’s confinement. 
    Unlike, any comparable situation for the ordinary citizen you have the state, a situation where virtually every action which is taken with respect to the inmate is state action and lends itself to litigation. 
    If there is no exhaustion requirement, it seems to me that the federal courts are going to have to bear the burden of these cases and there are going to have to become involved in this very complex regulatory scheme. 
    The need to have some guidelines for considering these cases, I think was expressed with great urgency by the court below. 
    And I think that they are asking this Court for guidance and we believe that the answer to their problem lies in the habeas corpus statute not with Congress, but with the statute which is already on the books and which is applicable and that cases challenging conditions of confinement no less than cases challenging conviction share a common denominator which is custody and that they belong under the habeas corpus statute. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Herman Schwartz
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1646.382" stopTime="1652.692">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mrs. Cohen. 
    Mr. Schwartz.
speaker="herman_schwartz" startTime="1652.692" stopTime="1854.703">
    Mr. Herman Schwartz 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I should first like if I may to take a minute or two, to give some of the facts underlying these cases. 
    Because although the only issue before this Court is the jurisdictional issue, the only issue on which cert was granted. 
    The lower court, the Court of Appeals and its en banc decision affirmed all three cases on the merits. 
    And the merits were argued in several bound. But the first two cases, Kritsky and Rodriguez involved very serious disciplinary due process issues in which men were denied good time on cases which the District Court and affirmed by the Circuit Court found were grossly deficient procedures. 
    Mr. Katzoff who received relief very quickly by the way was punished with 60 days good time loss and 60 days in a solitary confinement for writing two mildly with derogatory comments, “creep and cigar-smoking S. O. B.” in diaries which he did not circulate and which as the Court of Appeals and District Court found every institution in which he had been permitted him to keep. 
    Those are the merits, now, and each of those three cases, the Circuit Court affirmed on the merits after discussion and consideration of both. 
    Now, what the State is asking in this case is really very simple. 
    It is asking the Court to repudiate a long line of well-established principles most reasonably reaffirmed last term in two cases in Wilwording and in the footnote in Humphrey and Cady footnote 18, to the effect that a state prisoner can challenged the conditions of confinement under 1983. 
    We are not urging this Court to reclassify every case of 1983. 
    We do not deny that habeas corpus may be available, this Court set so last term and that’s not the issue in this case. 
    The issue in this case is whether every habeas corpus case shall every prisoner’s rights case, every 1983 case shall be carved out of the jurisdiction of 1983 and construe not the way this Court, not the way untold the lower court have construed this namely as 1983 cases. 
    But you can construe them as habeas corpus cases requiring an exhaustion requirement. 
    And we say as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out, the statute was enacted in 1871. 
    It was obviously no thought at that time, I am quite sure to deal with prisoner’s cases. 
    They obviously were dealing with problems of friction between federal and state courts as it was pointed in Mitchum and Foster quite clearly. 
    And it was very clear that they gave a federal form and what was then and almost revolutionary change in the federal jurisdiction. 
    A federal forth of federal rights and without having to go all the way through the state system and in 1961, in Monroe and Pape and in every case since then including three prisoner cases Houghton and Shafer, Wilwording and Humphrey and Cady which raised the related problems about the proper place of confinement for someone committed under the -- was Wisconsin Sexually Deviant Act and every one of these case, this Court has said flatly there is no requirement of exhaustion of either administrative or judicial remedies.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1854.703" stopTime="1864.700">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Schwartz, do you think in the 1983 action would lie to challenge a judgment under which a man was being held to state court judgment depends on constitutional?
speaker="herman_schwartz" startTime="1864.700" stopTime="1977.899">
    Mr. Herman Schwartz 
    No, Your Honor, that’s very clearly habeas corpus position not because of the nature of the classification, but because of the policy involved in the exhaustion doctrine. 
    The policy in the exhaustion doctrine is very clear, it’s to avoid friction between the judgment of a state court which it has entered or which has its holding somebody in custody and the judgment of a federal court. 
    That was the basis to correct Ex parte Royal and that’s what involved and that’s why several court have said that when an attempt was made to challenge a conviction under 1983, that was really in attempt to evade and we would say, we quite agree. 
    An attempt to evade simply should not be permitted because then it’s time to evade the exhaustion requirement. 
    But what we are dealing with here and this is the essence of it. 
    We are dealing with administrative action which of course in a variety of settings with the variety of consequences and with the variety of remedies. 
    The question about damages was absolutely on point in terms of what’s at stake here because these are damage actions as well as equitable actions. 
    It depends on whether the thing is monetary, but whatever benefits are sought to be gained from an exhaustion requirement would immediately be defeated by that and not because it’s a question of evading it but because according to the state’s own argument both remedies are available, always both forms are available and every 1983, every challenge to conditions can obviously be a challenge for monetary damages. 
    The fact is that the state in its brief go somewhat far did they went in oral argument because what they said is if there is a damage claim, one has to go in to the state court to get the merits decided and then into federal court to get damages. 
    Now, the claim is like this is habeas corpus because it’s custody.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1977.899" stopTime="1985.985">
    Unknown Speaker

speaker="herman_schwartz" startTime="2033.043" stopTime="2065.119">
    Mr. Herman Schwartz 
    Well, if that’s the case then the entire policy of what they are urging which is the burden on the courts, friction, all of the rest goes out the window and there is no point to it at all. After all classifications whether or not one is going to carve out an exception and again I would say Your Honors that the statute gives the right to a state prisoner under 1983. 
    They are going to carve out an exception and the exception is in order to avoid federal state friction, in order to somehow avoid the burdens on these courts.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2065.119" stopTime="2078.781">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But you said the statute gives the right to the prisoner under 1983, if you read 1983 literally without regard to the habeas corpus provision, you could use it to challenge the state judgment of conviction, couldn’t you?
speaker="herman_schwartz" startTime="2078.781" stopTime="2155.382">
    Mr. Herman Schwartz 
    That’s quite true Your Honor and it’s at that point that the fundamental policy involved in Ex parte Royal comes into the picture such a policy does not apply here. 
    What we are dealing with is administrative action. 
    After all in 1948 when Judge Parker try to get the habeas corpus statute amended a more -- the problem that he raised was that of a federal district judge sitting in judgment on the Supreme Court of the State. 
    What the State is urging would produce precisely that because it would require that there be a state recourse, state judicial remedies in fact they go further. 
    They make prisoners do a double job contrary to what this Court said in Wilwording that state prisoners are not held to a higher standard. 
    They would make it doubly higher. 
    First, the administrative jump which is difficult to see it from their argument as to habeas corpus and then the judicial job. 
    And what would then happen is that a Federal District Court would be sitting in judgment on a state Supreme Court’s ruling on whether or not there was a violation of the federal constitution. 
    Now that, will -- if anything exacerbate the federal state relations because that’s precisely the kind of problem that some of the movements for amendment of the habeas corpus act produced --

    Mr. Herman Schwartz 
    That’s right but essential what we are dealing with is still action by a state court. 
    That’s the problem of the friction, that’s what gave rise to Ex Parte Rom -- Ex Parte Royal deals with the prejudgment situation. 
    It deals with the lawyer who is confined before the trial, but and in so far as we are dealing with review of state court action as the state court accrue the exhaustion doctrine applied. 
    But if we are dealing with good time, a simple hypothetical will illustrate it. 
    Suppose the state has a rule that prohibits black and white prisoners from mingling together and two such prisoners, two white prisoners or black prisoners do. 
    One man is deprived of good time and the other man will say, loses a good job and those things happen all the time. 
    The first man challenging exactly the same conduct, we’ll have to exhaust and go through the entire state system. 
    The second man will not if one makes to turn a good time and if somebody else chooses to sue damages for this kind of thing, again the very same state interest, the very same state action simply puts a different remedy he will then have to go in and sue -- he will then be permitted to --

    My position is that this case raises the question of whether 1983 is available. 
    If I had to choose, I probably would say, these were essentially challenges to administrative action, official state action. 
    Therefore, 1983 would be more appropriate. 
    On the other hand --

    If I well, that’s a choice if you are forcing me say that it be, if you are asking me to say the choices are either an exclusive 1983 or habeas corpus then clearly I choose an exclusive 1983. 
    Because that’s precisely what the 1871 statute was established for.

    Unknown Speaker 
    But you also I gather, don’t you imply that a view that if maybe that both remedies are available and it up to the prisoner to choose which?
speaker="herman_schwartz" startTime="2449.330" stopTime="2479.973">
    Mr. Herman Schwartz 
    I am saying that that’s what this Court has said, that’s precisely what in the Wilwording -- part two of the Wilwording decision opens precisely with that line. 
    Part two says, moreover although cognizable in federal habeas corpus see Johnson and Avery, petitioners pleading may also be read to plea cause of action in the Civil Rights Act. 
    And I am saying that this Court has given them that right. 
    This case does not raise that issue of whether he has a habeas corpus right, in this case, what --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2479.973" stopTime="2484.855">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You mean to agree with the state here, are you suggesting we have to overrule Wilwording?
speaker="herman_schwartz" startTime="2484.855" stopTime="2485.444">
    Mr. Herman Schwartz 
    Absolutely.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2485.444" stopTime="2487.764">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Or just a valid at least to that sentence?
speaker="herman_schwartz" startTime="2487.764" stopTime="2741.148">
    Mr. Herman Schwartz 
    Absolutely, not only that, but you would have to move directly backward from what you did and what courts have done in Wilwording and another cases. 
    What courts have done frequently is to say that we will construe the habeas corpus as 1983, what the State to say construe 1983 as habeas corpus. 
    Now, there are claims that the federal courts were being overburdened and that is obviously a very appealing and important argument. 
    If the federal court is overburdened with one kind of case, it means justice is denied to every one. 
    But the problem with argument is first of all the 1871 statute or any statute has never been construed to allow a carve out because of that problem. 
    Secondly, the whole question of burden is something that we agree we don’t know. 
    The statistics in the ABA brief and as you know the ABA filed an amicus brief in support of the respondent’s position. 
    The ABA points out that some like 3.4% of the civil cases are prisoner’s Civil Rights Act cases. 
    The statistic show that takes up very little time, well, be that as it may the fact is that these complicated questions of burdensomeness of appropriate remedy or appropriately for Congress. 
    These involves studies, they are about studies of what is a proper alternative in some cases as the ABA points out properly, the Congress has decided to introduce an exhaustion requirement such as with, you would say utility regulation. 
    In other cases, there maybe many other devices to handle these problems, but certainly as we discovered in the mid 60’s in connection with habeas corpus, the burden was not what it seemed and over time it even doubt and flattened out and that would be true here as well. 
    The most -- in some ways the most interesting aspect of the state’s argument is the request for an exhaustion of administrative remedies. 
    If this is habeas corpus, where does that come from? 
    What this Court is really asking what the stage is really asking this Court to do, is to overrule the long line of decisions in 1983 cases and the line of recent prisoner decisions in 1983 where the exact same issues were raised. 
    The exact same arguments were presented and dismissed in pre curiam. 
    They are asking this Court to repute. 
    In Houghton-Shafer, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania said, present cases are unique and this will produce multitude in this litigation. 
    This Court rejected that argument unanimously and pre curiam. 
    In McNeese, the Attorney General argued that education is unique and therefore we have to have special exhaustion requirements this Court rejected. 
    Now, I think I have probably said enough to respond to most of the points that seem to me to be worth mentioning on this. 
    I would say only with respect to one other thing and that’s this. 
    Our prisons today are in a mess. 
    Nobody has made that point more clear than the Chief Justice and the President. 
    And there are signs of change and those signs of change as Maurice Sigler, Chairman of the Federal Parole Board said, are in part of result of the action of the federal courts doing what the 1871 Act said they should do. 
    And, that is to make the constitutional apply to areas where the States are not fulfilling constitutional mandate. 
    For this Court now to repudiate this long line of cases, let’s say 1983 is not available is to say to the prisoner not merely that you are second class citizen which all society says anyway. 
    But to say to him that you are second class with respect to access to federal courts and with respect to federal rights. 
    And it seems to me that that would be a devastating thing to say at this time in our history when they are beginning of signs for some improvement and this is change. 
    I --

   Rebuttal of Lillian Z. Cohen

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    I believe I have --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2926.737" stopTime="2928.270">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mrs. Cohen you have about three minutes left.
speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="2928.270" stopTime="3044.692">
    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Okay, that’s fine. 
    There are two points that I would like to reply to. 
    First, contrary to what counsel has suggested, we are not asking this Court to overrule the Wilwording decision. 
    The specific holding of Wilwording is entirely consistent with our position. 
    The claims there were habeas corpus claims, the question was whether or not the exhaustion requirement applied and this Court held that the claims were recognizable as habeas corpus claims and in fact that the exhaustion requirement applied. 
    It is the dictum in Wilwording that we are asking this Court to reconsider and just as a point of interest, I would like to tell the Court that in the Wilwording, on the remand despite the dictum of this Court, the parties and the Court are still considering these cases as habeas corpus petitions because of the res judicata problem. 
    The second point I would like to reply to is the figures that were cited by counsel with regard to the numbers of cases that are being brought in the federal courts right now. 
    The fact is that the figures cited in the American Bar Association Study seem to show a drop in the rate of increase of prisoner’s civil rights actions. 
    And to me that suggests a real -- a substantial reply to the concern of counsel for respondents that these claims are not being reviewed. 
    Prison conditions have not changed overnight, the prison population has not decreased overnight and yet there are less of these claims coming in to the federal courts in the last two years. 
    Then must be being decided some place and it seems to me that what is happening is that in line with the change that has been reflected in recent decisions, it’s not only the federal courts but also of the state courts. 
    You are getting prison conditions corrected by state administrators and or by state courts and I think that’s a response to the exhaustion object that’s being raised today.

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Not at all. 
    And I don’t believe that in any point in these cases we have argued that the numbers of cases is illegal justification for action. 
    At most, we have suggested that as a consequence of the approach which we suggest, there maybe a reduction in the numbers of cases brought. 
    But that strictly fall out. 
    That’s not a legal argument.

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    Well, I think what they have done is emphasized the relevance of how the statute should be construed.

    Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen 
    I don’t think it’s a legal justification, no. 
    No.
