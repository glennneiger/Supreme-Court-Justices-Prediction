    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Valder.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="2.797" stopTime="80.636">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Thank You, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    My name is Michael Valder. 
    With me are Mrs. Jean Camper Cahn and Mr. Dan Bowling. 
    On behalf of the petitioners, we request this Court to reverse the judgment of the lower courts and to remand this cause for consideration of preliminary injunctive relief and trial on the merits. 
    But more important, than a reversal and remand, is our request that you declare the law which will govern this case. 
    The issues presented compel, we believe, several declarations by this Court. 
    First and perhaps, more importantly is the declaration that the federal courts are open for the business of adjudicating petitioners claims based on the Constitution and the Civil Rights Laws of the United States. 
    Secondly, a declaration that the Speech or Debate Clause protects no one, Congressman included from defending a suit for violation of constitutional rights to privacy. 
    The decision in the Gravel case we believe indicates that Speech or Debate Clause immunity extends only to valid legislative acts. 
    Gravel expressly --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="80.636" stopTime="94.588">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But the speech on the floor of the House that was libelous per se invading the privacy or some person in a very gross way, is there any remedy for that?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="94.588" stopTime="100.235">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    The cases don’t indicate so, Your Honor. 
    We’re not faced with that here however. 
    Here it is --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="100.235" stopTime="112.114">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    [Voice Overlap] interesting on a right of privacy claim and I am assuming now the grossest kind of libel you could imagine on the floor of the House and the speech by a member.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="112.114" stopTime="116.851">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    I suspect that that case would be taken to Court and this Court would be asked.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="116.851" stopTime="119.854">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And having to decide that some of them been taken to Court?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="119.854" stopTime="179.572">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    I believe so Your Honor and the speeches on the floor have been held to be immune under the Speech or Debate Clause. But here as in Gravel, we’re dealing with activity not on the floor. 
    We are dealing with subsidiary activity in committee by committee staff, by investigators and it seems to us that, your teaching in Gravel that invasions of citizen privacy or illegal or unconstitutional actions by legislators or their staff are not immune under the Speech or Debate Clause. 
    I believe the technical language in your decision in Gravel in Mr. Justice White’s decision was that the Speech or Debate Clause should not be extended to protect the illegal or unconstitutional actions beyond those which would prevent executive control of legislative speech debate or legislative activity.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Can I ask that -- let’s assume that the group of publications had gone -- been in the congressional context or just a newspaper or an author or a magazine and simply gone around pickup the same information from the same sources and had published? 
    Now what right of your clients would have been infringed?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="201.889" stopTime="204.286">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Their constitutional right to privacy.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, are you claiming are there anything inaccurate about any of the statements?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="210.670" stopTime="218.158">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Absolutely, Your Honor that they were inaccurate. 
    We never had a chance to correct those inaccuracies. 
    We never had noticed that this publication was --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Are you saying they were libelous?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="220.513" stopTime="228.292">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    They are libelous, they are invasions of privacy. 
    They are violations of constitutional civil rights protected by the Civil Rights Act of 1871.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="228.292" stopTime="241.344">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know but you talk about privacy. 
    Are you -- you are asserting the role of whatever right it is to sue for libel. 
    For damage to reputation?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="241.344" stopTime="259.185">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Right. 
    All of the allegations we would make if the respondents were private persons are being made plus additional claims and that is that the deprivations here were by and under color of governmental authority and that the bill of rights as a protection against governmental access.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="259.185" stopTime="267.738">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I’ll put it to you this way. 
    Do you think you have any right at all against anybody you have to allege or assert that the statements were false?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="267.738" stopTime="272.853">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    No, Your Honor no. 
    The statements could be true. 
    It is still a violation of human rights.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="272.853" stopTime="279.264">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Where do you find any constitutional right of privacy unless the statements are false?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="279.264" stopTime="281.195">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Well, I believe we could --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="281.195" stopTime="289.705">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Where do you find that the statements as long as they are true are not protected?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="289.705" stopTime="298.005">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    The common law right of privacy is a private tort. 
    The manners disclosed can be true, they can be false.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="298.005" stopTime="307.417">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What would be your answer though to the defendant who treated the First Amendment and said “I am protected in making these statements unless you can show their faults?”
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="307.417" stopTime="329.171">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    I think we are in the law of privacy where even if true there are areas of our lives as citizens where others cannot disrupt or destroy or breach that privacy, you get into the additional sanction of libel and slander if the statements are false.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="329.171" stopTime="358.479">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    As you said, you are relying on all the law that would be available to you if the -- if these defendants were private people such as defamation law, common law, statutory law of defamation plus constitutional claims since these defendants are Government, the Federal Government and surely, I don’t suppose the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment have anything or whatever to do as truth or falsity, do they?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="358.479" stopTime="422.202">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    That’s correct Your Honor. 
    I believe the Griswold case in Mr. Justice Douglas’ opinions and other opinions in Griswold constitute a clear majority of the Court at that time perhaps even of this Court that there is a constitutional underpinning for the right of privacy, independently of truth or falsity that there is a private sphere it was known at common law and the Constitution included that within the special protections of the Constitution so it is private common law tort plus it is constitutional. 
    And here if there’s still a third-degree of liability and that is the whole doctrine of governmental access that the Constitution protect citizens more against governmental access than excesses are overreaching by private parties and that of course brings us to you that is we submit your role, your special and peculiar role in this case because it is the Government which is responding in its officials.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="422.202" stopTime="449.912">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But who would have the same allegations on the same thrust to your complaint I take it if instead of having the invasion of privacy that you claim made up by written reports of the Committee, one of the members had made a speech on the floor of the House saying using all of the same words revealing all of the same information, would you not.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="449.912" stopTime="473.837">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    I believe we would bring that suit Your Honor. 
    We would bring it against his aides or his staff who procured the information assuming it was procured in the way this information was procured which was as alleged surreptitiously and clandestinely, and we don’t know what else because we were thrown out of court without a chance of discovery.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="473.837" stopTime="492.042">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I take it in the case Mr. Justice White would appeal where it appears in the newspapers, where you’ll be seen in the newspapers, and then even though it’s based on invasion of privacy in that sense. 
    You would be subject to the strictures of time and privilege.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="492.042" stopTime="492.509">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Yes, I see it.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="492.509" stopTime="504.919">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You can see it against newspaper. 
    But here you rely on other constitutional provisions because here you are involved in the alleged conduct of the Congress, is that it?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="504.919" stopTime="535.675">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    That’s correct. 
    Also, we are in the deep, deep privacy area no public figure possibilities or implications here whatsoever and also it is the question here that what was done in this case was never authorized by the Congress. 
    Never authorize. 
    Yes, an investigation was authorized and we can see that but the investigation resolution clearly spelled out how information was to be procured and that is adherence.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="535.675" stopTime="543.374">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well if it wasn’t authorize, then recap for me how it becomes government action -- governmental action.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="543.374" stopTime="545.072">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Right. 
    It’s governmental --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="545.072" stopTime="547.949">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Sometimes you say its ultra vires.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="547.949" stopTime="611.534">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    It -- what was done the manner and method of procuring and compiling this information and putting it in a report was totally outside the house rules and the Committee n the District of Columbia. 
    Those rules have safeguards which provide minimal due process protections. 
    None of them applied here. 
    The information was obtained by an investigator and a consultant to the Committee from teachers -- from a teacher and a principal. 
    So the obtaining of the information was not -- the method was not authorized in the resolution and the manner in which it was incorporated into a report. 
    This information was not run into a record through a hearing. 
    There were several days of hearings in this law, in this investigation but none of them dealt with this information. 
    This information we’ve called it hip pocket information came in by an investigator to a consultant and put it in a report. 
    The Committee never passed on the report. 
    It was merely sent to the speaker by the chairman of the Committee with the request that it be printed.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="611.534" stopTime="624.213">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you alleged that the investigator engaged in a little conduct in the course of gathering it like he entered any private files broke any lots or violate anybody else’s Fourth Amendment right?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="624.213" stopTime="650.409">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    To the extent that we know Your Honor and of course to spend no discovery. 
    We have alleged that the information was obtained by a District of Columbia police officer on loan to the Campbell Hill Police in turn on loan to the House Committee as an investigator by what authority he went about to schools whether he used his District of Columbia police credentials or his capital police credentials or was merely an independent --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="650.409" stopTime="654.953">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you don’t allege he engaged in any specific criminal conduct in the course of his investigation?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="654.953" stopTime="662.013">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    We alleged that he engaged than unconstitutional conduct because he participated in a breach of the privacy.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="662.013" stopTime="664.444">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    As I understand that but that’s just pre-stating a position?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="664.444" stopTime="669.375">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    That’s not a criminal statute, I don’t believe.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="669.375" stopTime="679.207">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, if the newspaper or there had done precisely the same thing using the same conduct then what would be your position?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="679.207" stopTime="690.253">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Our position would be that it was a breach of his right -- constitutional right of privacy and common law tort, breach of teacher-pupil privileged all of which would --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="690.253" stopTime="693.177">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would you direct that against the reporter or the teacher?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="693.177" stopTime="702.520">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Against both, the teacher because the teacher violated the rules and the constitution by disclosing information --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="702.520" stopTime="708.289">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You mean the reporter can violate the Constitution by asking questions?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="708.289" stopTime="731.985">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    I think he certainly can. 
    Most reporters get away with it but if it is a breach of privacy which is protected a cause of action lies for that breach. 
    Now most information is given to reporters mostly by those who have the complete interest in the information. 
    Here the students had an interest and they were never consulted.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="731.985" stopTime="745.727">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Will they cover the reporters if they have to rely on some common law theory, as I understand the Fourth Amendment, it protects the privacy to the extent it does only against governmental action?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="745.727" stopTime="765.516">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Well, one of the cases which we’ve cited in our brief as I recall was a case by a private citizen who was in an accident and was photographed evidently in some disarray, a lady and she successfully maintained an action for breach of privacy against the newspaper photographer who took her picture in the newspaper who published it.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="765.516" stopTime="768.787">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that’s not constitutional Brandeis warrant type, right?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="768.787" stopTime="839.537">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Positive yes. 
    Now, returning for a moment to the Gravel decision as we understand that case their can be Speech or Debate immunity for valid legislative acts and our position is that what was done here was not valid legislative act. 
    It was unauthorized. 
    The method used was contrary to house rules and contrary to procedural due process requirements and it was contrary to committee rules in the way in which the Committee report was processed and printed. 
    Secondly, to the extent that it was a valid legislative act. 
    The Bill of Attainder Clause speaks to a limitation on Speech or Debate immunity. 
    The Bill of Attainder provision of the Constitution is internal evidence within the Constitution itself that congressional action will not always escape judicial scrutiny so that if it is a valid legislative act it begins to partake of the Bill of Attainder and if it’s not a valid legislative act there is no Speech or Debate immunity.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="839.537" stopTime="845.202">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Then you say the Congress publishes report, it could be stopped?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="845.202" stopTime="848.043">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    We believe it can be. 
    It has been temporarily stopped.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="848.043" stopTime="853.061">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But certainly, you don’t have to go that far do you?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="853.061" stopTime="901.371">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Well, actually we don’t want to report stuck, Your Honor. 
    We want the students’ names exhaust. 
    It can serve no valid legislative purpose whatsoever to contain the students and their parents’ names. 
    We concede that every ounce of information in that report may be relevant and serve a valid legislative purpose. 
    But what purpose is served by putting the names of 12, 13 and 14 year-old students in that kind of a report. 
    The only justification offered in the lower court was a terse statement that the names lent credibility. 
    While we submit that credibility used in that context really means the interest that a gossiper has in knowing who is the subject of gossip.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="901.371" stopTime="910.699">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you say that everything was except the names served a valid legislative purpose? 
    Do you suggest that the information even though false shouldn’t be deleted?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="910.699" stopTime="922.814">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    If it may and it may not have served a valid legislative purpose. 
    We’re not challenging that. 
    Some of that information may be valid and useful other of it may not be at all. 
    We don’t really care.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="922.814" stopTime="929.649">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But Congress isn’t limited by gathering useful information in the process of legislating, is it?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="929.649" stopTime="932.577">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Probably most of the information that get turns out to be not useful.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="932.577" stopTime="947.417">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, isn’t that normal process of inquiry whether you are preparing for trial in a lawsuit or preparing to past legislation? 
    You get a great -- you do a great deal of sifting before you get any nuggets, isn’t that true?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="947.417" stopTime="1120.685">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    That’s true. 
    What I was focusing on is the Barenblatt-Watkins really line of cases where without authorization and with no legislative purpose whatsoever this Court has said the federal judiciary may inquire into what’s going on in Congress and that was the focus. 
    Here, no authorization to get the names and published them. 
    No ostensible or apparent legislative purpose. 
    In fact contrariwise, the constitutional proscription of violating privacy would indicate that those names shouldn’t be there. 
    Affirmatively that they should not be there not just negatively that there is no need to put them there. 
    Now, I might say that we are also requesting a declaration that the Bivens doctrine. 
    Bivens versus Six Unknown Federal Narcotics agents creates an independent cause of action against the federal respondents here. 
    Those respondents acting under color of federal law, we submit are suable and a cause of action lies against them under the 1971 Doctrine in Bivens. 
    Just as against the District of Columbia respondents, there is an independent cause of action under the 1871 Civil Rights Act. 
    That’s Section 1983 of Title 42 that 1983 severely limited the immunity available to local officials. 
    Now, I wanted to mention that we are aware of the District of Columbia versus Carter case which was argued before you about five weeks ago. 
    It is significant that in that case the District of Columbia Government did not bring to this Court the issue of official immunity which was decided against the District of Columbia by the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
    The only issue brought to you in that case was whether the District is a person within the meaning of Section 1983. 
    As noted in the dissenting opinion in our case, the Carter decision which have been decided before the Doe case was decided, clearly ruled on the question of immunity. 
    However, the majority opinion below did not even mention the Carter case. 
    It was discussed at length in the dissenting opinion and it is our position that the extent and degree and scope of official immunity in the District of Columbia has been refined and honed to a very sharp edge in a series of decisions beginning with Spencer, Elden and leading up to and including the Carter decision, and that the method of adjudicating official immunity questions has been set. 
    The District of Columbia has not appealed that method of adjudicating official immunity claims.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1120.685" stopTime="1125.606">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You’re talking about the District of Columbia defendants, and not about the congressional defendants.

    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    That’s correct.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="1154.450" stopTime="1168.729">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    I believe Judge Wright’s opinion makes clear that he was so much more concerned about the sweeping grant of authority to committee aides that he took that question of and dealt with it. 
    Now as you may recall this case.

speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="1183.377" stopTime="1229.541">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Our position is that certainly as to injunctive relief the federal courts have the power in appropriate cases to enjoin a congressional report that would be relief directed against congressmen. 
    Now the question of damages is stickier but we believe that we can reach the congressman respondents on the question of damages upon showing that they participated in a violation of our constitutional rights that as said in United States versus Lee, “no man is above the law, no one is” and if that means that you must exercise your most supreme power to touch the congressmen, we submit it must be dark.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1229.541" stopTime="1237.840">

    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    It would ask to the official immunity doctrine, Your Honor. 
    Let me recapitulate. 
    There are two doctrines of immunity operating for the Federal respondents the Speech or Debate --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1251.299" stopTime="1270.269">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Can you take the Barr versus Matteo type of immunity. 
    Now certainly in Barr versus Matteo, the fact that Barr may have been here in the District of Columbia did not lead this Court to say that it is the District of Columbia law is construed by the Court of Appeals that governs his immunity, did it?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="1270.269" stopTime="1288.529">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    No, it didn’t but in the District of Columbia the courts have in the past 10 years done a tremendous amount in several cases of expansion, contraction and redefining how the Barr doctrine is applied in the District of Columbia.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1288.529" stopTime="1300.808">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well then, buy if you’re going to urge that here is governing the congressional definite, you must it urge it on its merits. It seems to me, I mean we’re not bound by what the Court of Appeals says.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="1300.808" stopTime="1359.387">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    No, you’re not. 
    But we submit that the Court of Appeals was bound by its earlier opinions in this area and that it did not follow them under principles of stare decisis that Court, a different panel of that Court had just decided Carter, comes Doe versus McMillan, they don’t even cite it. 
    They disregard it and they ruled contrary to it and we are suggesting that you need not reach the Barr versus Matteo question. 
    You need only declare that in the District of Columbia stare decisis principles operate. 
    The doctrine as it has been announced and defined, and is operating should be applied in this case the same as in any other case.

    If I may, Your Honor. 
    In the line of cases in the District the doctrine of Barr was not played around with. 
    It was the way in which the courts in the city must apply it and that is they might take a look at the case. 
    They must take a close look at the precise governmental function at issue. 
    What the Carter’ case stands for is you can’t throw out the case the day it’s filed. 
    The judge has an important role to play. 
    He has to look at the function. 
    Is it discretionary? 
    Would it inhibit the proper exercise of the Government to hold this official liable for the performance of this function? 
    That was the point in the Court of Appeals, that it was not proper to throw this case out on the very day it was filed without any responsive pleading. 
    Without any chance to take a good look at the function at issue. 
    Now that’s the modification of District of Columbia. 
    It did not throw out Barr versus Matteo that’s still absolutely the law.

    Mr. Fred M. Vinson, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    My brief and that of my colleague Mr. Cramer is on behalf of those whom we referred to as legislative respondents, the members of Congress, the Committee members and their aides, the Committee staff who were named as defendants, the Public Printer and Superintendent of Documents. 
    This case involves an attempt by petitioners to selectively sensor by injunction a document of the Congress a Committee Report which was ordered printed pursuant to the rules of the House of Representatives. 
    The petitioners also seek damages against the respondents for their failure to delete the names from the report. 
    A House Resolution which is printed at page 5 of our brief authorized the Committee on the District of Columbia to conduct the full investigation and study of any instrumentality of the District of Columbia Government. 
    The resolution also empowered the Committee to require by subpoena or otherwise the production of documents as it deems necessary as further directed, the Committee to report to the House the results of its investigation and its findings and recommendations. 
    The report in question issued after seven months of investigations 14 hearings, all of which concerned in the District of Columbia school system and the report contained 36 specific findings and 27 recommendations. 
    It’s our position that the opinions of the Court in Gravel and then Brewster and all of the dissents in those cases, Cowles as a unanimous holding that the legislative respondents, all of them, are immune from questioning in any other place on account of the matters complained. 
    In short, we feel that the Speech or Debate Clause affords absolute immunity to the legislative respondents in the context to this case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1630.577" stopTime="1649.497">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Vinson, are you arguing -- are you urging any substantive deficiency in the plaintiffs’ case just as on its own bottom? 
    Do you feel you must turn to immunity or to legislative or otherwise?
speaker="fred_m_vinson_jr" startTime="1649.497" stopTime="1662.932">
    Mr. Fred M. Vinson, Jr. 
    I think it is best to turn to the immunity Mr. Justice because the Speech or Debate Clause was designed to prevent harassment of legislatures and --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1662.932" stopTime="1665.006">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or for even considering the substantive merits within merits?
speaker="fred_m_vinson_jr" startTime="1665.006" stopTime="1670.739">
    Mr. Fred M. Vinson, Jr. 
    Yes, that’s correct Mr. Justice. 
    The holding of --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1670.739" stopTime="1693.582">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In your theory Mr. Vinson, could the legislative people involved here have simply made no appearance at all in the District Court and stood on the Speech or Debate Clause as a complete defense even to having -- even being required to put in an answer.
speaker="fred_m_vinson_jr" startTime="1693.582" stopTime="1696.642">
    Mr. Fred M. Vinson, Jr. 
    Theoretically, I suppose Mr. Chief Justice that’s correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1696.642" stopTime="1704.148">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    It might not be a courteous thing to do with respect to the District Court but you say, you could do that as a matter of constitutional law?
speaker="fred_m_vinson_jr" startTime="1704.148" stopTime="2007.656">
    Mr. Fred M. Vinson, Jr. 
    It might neither be courteous nor prudent. 
    We feel that the holding of Gravel settled the question of who is covered by the Speech or Debate immunity and the scope of that coverage. 
    The scope extends to in the words of the opinion a sphere of legitimate legislative activity and the court’s opinion made clear that the clause applies not only to a member but also to his age in so far as the conduct of the latter would be protected legislative act if performed by the member himself. 
    Applying this test you have to analyze the nature of the acts performed by the members and by their staff to determine whether they are protected acts, first, the members of the House. 
    Now, there involvement in the complaint relates solely to the issuance of the Committee Report which was authorized by the House which was spread and distributed pursuant to the rules of the House and statute. 
    The members we feel are clearly protected by the Speech or Debate Clause of long line of cases running from Kilbourn through Johnson to Gravel unequivocally upheld that Committee reports are as much within the coverage of the clause as our speeches on the floor of the House. 
    Secondly, we return to the Committee aides, the Clerk, the Staff Director, the Counsel, a consultant and an investigator for the Committee which issued the report. 
    The complaint doesn’t allege that the clerk or the staff director or the counsel did anything with respect to the report. 
    It does allege that the consultant to the Committee was responsible for the investigation and that the investigator of the Committee conducted the investigations which were used in the report. 
    Now, exactly what actions are complained of? 
    Turning again to the allegations of the complaint reproduced on page 9 of the appendix it’s alleged that Seville who was a Junior High School Principal gave the investigator the copies of disciplinary letters and other materials. 
    It’s alleged that Irvine who was a teacher gave the investigator copies of attendance list, school test papers, and other materials. 
    So we have an investigator for our committee and he’s alleged to such in the complaint. 
    The Committee was authorized to inquire into the D.C. school system and further authorize to obtain documents by subpoena or otherwise if this investigator was given and that the words in the complainant given. 
    He was given school documents by school officials and petitioners now characterized the obtention of these documents as clandestine and surreptitious in attempt to avoid the holding in Gravel. 
    But they don’t really challenged the Committee’s right to interview school officials and obtain school records from them. 
    In the Court below the majority opinion at page 75 of the appendix state that petitioners quote, “do not challenge the propriety of the investigation or the issuance of the report generally – i.e. absently use of their names - nor could they” and the dissenting opinion below page at 104 of the appendix stated that “indeed, they the petitioners do not even challenge the right of Congress to examine and summarize the confidential material involved. 
    They only wish to retain their anonymity, thus we have a Committee aide receiving relevant documents in a most routine way. 
    We submit this as an enterable and legitimate part of the preparation for a legislative act. 
    The graveling of the petitioners complaint against the aides and the Congressman too for that fact really boils down to the failure of the Committee in the House of the Representatives to delete their names from the documents included in the official report and the Speech or Debate Clause affords complete immunity to the congressman and in this context their aides with respect to the Committee report itself. 
    As the opinion in Gravel says at page 17 slip opinion, a member’s conduct at legislative committee hearings may not be made the basis for a civil or criminal judgment against a member because that conduct is within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity. 
    As this Court said in Katz v. United States 399 US at 350 in footnote 5 virtually every governmental action interferes with privacy to some degree.

    Mr. Vinson, if there are allegations said in the course of gathering the information.

    Mr. Fred M. Vinson, Jr. 
    I think they claim a generalized right of privacy, a right of anonymity, or right to be left alone and asked what stated in Katz virtually every governmental action interferes with privacy to some degree. 
    The question in each case is whether that interference violates a command of the United States Constitution. 
    Many people who are named in congressional hearings and who are named in Committee reports would much prefer to be left alone to remain anonymous. 
    But that wish cannot and should not prevail in light of Congress’ constitutional mandates and the protection.

    Mr. Fred M. Vinson, Jr. 
    I don’t -- I would argue that it does not matter that Congress made the decision to publish this in a Committee report but I would urge upon use that it is not without the scope of the Committee in its enabling resolution. 
    The -- there have been other cases of speech on the floor and Committee reports that may have been unfortunate but as the court’s opinion in Brewster points out at pages 15 and 16 of the slip opinion. 
    The clause has even enabled reckless men to slander others. 
    But as the court said that was conscious choice of the framers. 
    The third group of legislative respondents is made up of the Public Printer and his subordinate the Superintendent of Documents. 
    The Public Printer was once officially titled congressional printer. 
    He is required by statute to print congressional documents. 
    Committee reports are required by rules of the House to be printed and a statute requires Congress to have its printing done by the Public Printer. 
    The printing of Committee reports I think it goes without saying is an absolutely essential part of the legislative process and the printer is as much in the process as the investigator or as is the Committee Clerk who collates pages.

    This case does not involve the Grand Jury inquiry nor private republication of documents introduced into a committee hearing as Gravel.

   Argument of William C. Cramer
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2796.369" stopTime="2804.128">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Vinson. 
    Mr. Cramer.
speaker="william_c_cramer" startTime="2804.128" stopTime="3069.847">
    Mr. William C. Cramer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Let me first put in focus as I see it Speech and Debate as compared to separation of powers. 
    Speech and Debate is a part of separation of powers and most specifically stated in U.S. v. Johnson “the Speech and Debate Clause serves a function of reinforcing the Speech and Debate powers to deliberately establish by the founding fathers therefore separation of powers is emphasized and it is reinforced by the Speech and Debate Clause and not limited by. 
    Then let me get it in, in view of the questions that had been asked and I would suggest, I would be most helpful to the Court the questions, some of the questions raise with regards to perhaps in spreading the information. 
    Once a Committee report properly printed by the Congress ordered by the Congress to be printed pursuant to a resolution of the Congress and unquestionably pursuant to the power of Congress because here we are dealing with the Congress as the sole legislator and sole governor of under the Constitution Article I Section 8 of the District of Columbia, and in those instances there is no question with what the Committee report itself is beyond question by this Court and by anyone else. 
    It is a legislative act. 
    Being a legislative act, it is beyond the province of this Court as it would be of the Executive to inquire into the motives of the members why they put in the information in that is the decision by the duly elected representative how he makes a mistake. 
    He is answerable to his constituents and that’s apparently in the House you are answerable every two years. 
    That is a pretty tough test and that is a good assurance to the public that their discretion is going to be properly exercised. 
    Now, as to the distribution of the papers, this is a report it is in the public domain and that Congress has a duty in representing the people, has a duty to inform the people otherwise how can the people can judge whether the legislator is doing a proper job, that Congress is properly representing him properly legislating for them. 
    So that Congress has a duty. 
    How else can the people determine what additional laws are needed and after all that Congressman is a representative of the people and, what we’re talking about here and what consumes me about some of the questions and some of the cases that I’ve read is that it appears that there’s an effort as my colleague has said balance, to balance what? 
    You cannot balance an individual’s constitutional right in the context of the duty of all of the Congress to legislate and the cases have clearly pointed this out. 
    Let me refer for instance the Methodist case which is a Circuit Court of Appeals by judge adjutant as Chief Judge, very find judge in which the court specifically said, “that the power to declare unconstitutional” and I think this is what causes a lot of the problems in the thinking of the judiciary. 
    Prior to the declare law unconstitutional does not support the conclusion that they the court may sensor language that they think is libelous and I say to this Court this is precisely what the petitioners in this case are requesting. 
    I say further that to accept their position would say would in effect say that this Court should balance the constitutional legislative powers in its broad sense not against one member as compared to a complaining U.S. citizen. 
    We’re talking about the broad sense when you are talking about the speech on the floor of the House, when you are talking about the contents of the document, when you are talking about an effort as these complainants are attempting to impose an effort to sensor because they’re asking them that you weigh the constitutional legislative mandate. 
    As a matter of fact, that comes almost within the doctrine of the major case recently decided relating to Powell. 
    The Constitutional mandate for Congress is to legislate and is a separation of past question when it is exercised and within the legislative act come at Once that’s determined there is no further question.

    No, sir.

    Although the information there was unconstitutionally acquired, this is the case in this instance that they are heeding although I disagree with them on that conclusion on the facts. 
    If it be insisted that this is the acknowledgement of a power whose plentitude may become a catechism. 
    The answer is that the Congress is as much a guardian of liberties and welfare of the people as the courts on their separation to power.

    Mr. David P. Sutton 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I represent the District of Columbia respondents consisting of the members of the Board of Education, the Superintendent of schools, a Junior High School Principal, and a Junior High School Teacher. 
    Our position is that simply stated that that the doctorate official immunity as interpreted and applied by this Court and Barr versus Matteo and Howard versus Lyons, and companion case forecloses the liability. 
    We like to take these respondents individually. 
    First, we’d like to take the Board members and the Superintendent of schools. 
    The gravamen of petition in this case as to these respondents is that they should respond to damages. 
    The failures would promulgate regulations governing the confidentiality of school documents really and they did. 
    We respectfully submit to this Court that this is of course our legislative function to top level function is clearly within the framework of Barr versus Matteo and it is not remediable in damages. 
    The teacher and the principal perhaps taken on a different light, in regard to their liability or alleged liability we emphasize at the very outset that unlike the Barr versus Matteo case. 
    This case in the context of the principal and teacher involves an intergovernmental dissemination or communication, a communication within the framework of the Government itself. 
    Let me illustrate that with the comparison. 
    Let’s assume that instead of giving this directly to congressional committee, the principal and teacher gave the data to the School Board and the School Board in turn published it. 
    Perhaps there might be an action to damages against the School Board but not against the principal and teacher for giving the information. 
    We submit that Congress, vis-à-vis the District of Columbia school system may be fairly viewed as a supervisory or senior school board, and as a kind of employer, it has plenary power to investigate the school system that controls its purse strings, it certainly may be analogize with the top level employer. 
    It is within the periphery then of an employer-employee relationship that this information was tended with some of its absolutely privileged even applying the standards articulated by then Chief Justice Warren in his dissenting opinion in Barr versus Matteo. 
    And we also emphasized that petitioners do not question the right of these officials to give the information. 
    Well its officials we would refer the Court to pages 35 and 37 of the appendix. 
    I am not going to quote chapter and verse but they emphasized that the trial court, we don’t question the right of Congress to get this information. 
    We don’t question the right of teachers to give it. 
    As petitioners said almost rebellion, they can’t go into schools; they can’t talk to people as they did. 
    About that we did not quibble. 
    What we complain about is the reproduction and the insertion of names while the insertion of names it so happens took place 12 hearings later. 
    Six months later.

    Mr. David P. Sutton 
    The hearing certainly would have been better but our position is it does not legally require it. 
    I would like to emphasize in a few moments I have left the proposition that the Civil Rights Act does not offer the immunity of the District of Columbia respondents. 
    Under the Civil Rights Act, petitioners urged that the Civil Rights Act should apply to the District of Columbia respondents because the District of Columbia was a state. 
    First of all, that question is pending before this Court and his D.C. versus Carter. 
    Petitioners rely essentially upon the statement by Judge Wright dissenting it should be noted that the courts have consistently held that the District of Columbia is a state of territory within the meaning of the statute Cf. Hurd versus Hodge. 
    We submit that this is not that clear, it is now pending before this Court that the Court has request a supplemental memorandum. 
    We would also submit that in the peculiar circumstances of this case, we have the constitutional power of Congress to legislate the District of Columbia. 
    We have Congress vis-a-vis the school system as a supervisory school board. 
    Under the circumstances, we submit that it would be inconsistent to apply Barr versus Matteo standard to the (Inaudible) Federal Employees, get a Civil Rights Act standard to the District of Columbia employees.

    Mr. David P. Sutton 
    We would also have the size and even assuming the Civil Rights Act does apply in this case. 
    Then the question would be prior to dimensions of the immunity doctrine under that Act. 
    Now this Court has not yet articulated the dimensions but lower federal courts have and we can take standards articulated by lower courts. 
    We can weigh competing interests certainly and we can come up with an equitable result. 
    Now, it seems that, in one of the spectrum you have the right of the Congress to receive information. 
    If there are another spectrum you have the right to privacy. 
    But the right of privacy is alleged to have been violated here, not in the context of the right of Congress to receive information but in the context of publication of information. 
    So here again, it’s a question of complete good faith as conceded by the petitioners and though the federal courts do hold that if this good faith the Civil Rights Act of 1871 does not alter the immunity of the Government, and we submit that that is fairly applicable here. 
    Well, another analogy that I would like to make it seems that there was a companion case to Barr versus Matteo and that was called Howard versus Lyons, that companion case involves the Commander of a Boston Naval Shipyard. 
    It so happen that the commander of the shipyard made a press release, gathered information to congress. 
    The information was not requested. 
    It was delivered unsolicitedly by the Shipyard Commander and who it was given up to a congressional committee but to the Massachusetts congressional delegation. 
    We submit that that case would indicate that the rules of the immunity doctrines as a fortiori applicable here for two reasons. 
    First of all, the principal may fairly be analogized as we say it to the commander of shipyard. 
    He has extensive duties within the periphery of the school system. 
    Secondly, and we emphasize this, we don’t have an unsolicited inquiry or unsolicited response to a congressional delegation. 
    We have a solicited response by a Committee of the Congress. 
    That leaves only to teacher, as we see it. 
    Now, the teacher we don’t find analogies with any prior decision of this Court we admit, neither with the Barr decision nor the Howard decision. 
    But it’s not without significance, it seems Barr was decided and before Barr was decided, many lower federal courts have applied the immunity doctrine to (Inaudible) line officials comparable a nature of position to the teacher. 
    Personnel officers, game wardens, treasury agents, we submit that those authorities well, obviously not a binding on this Court are persuasive. 
    So in all respects, we submit that the Court should apply the doctrine of official immunity to the District of Columbia respondents in this case. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Michael J. Valder

    Thank you, Mr. Sutton.

    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    First it is our understanding of the Freedom of Information Act that before disclosure of this kind of information is permitted authorized or required into the Act that names of private citizens must be excised. 
    I consulted with the counsel and it is our understanding we do not have a copy of this statute with us but that is our understanding the same Congress or the same institution is --

    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    If the Freedom of Information Act were applying to this information, I understood that to be the Court’s question. 
    What would be the standards and we understand the standards to require excision of the names.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3975.592" stopTime="3985.366">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I think Mr. Valder for this -- permits the agency to refuse disclosure where names are involved rather than requiring them to refuse disclosure.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="3985.366" stopTime="4016.342">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Your may be right, Your Honor. 
    I think the point is that the Congress showed a sensitivity in the Freedom of Information Act to that question and that there is a way to prevent breaches of the privacy or in anonymity. 
    Secondly, it is our understanding that the distribution of this report was virtually unlimited. 
    We called and got copies. 
    We, I don’t how many copies we have and Mr. Sutton says that they have copies. 
    I believe our clients --

    Where did you get it?

    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    On the pleading. 
    It went off the day our complaint was filed. 
    There wasn’t --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="4029.680" stopTime="4038.437">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    When you say in your pleading, I mean I presume that would be the most authoritative source for us is to whether there was or was not distribution.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="4038.437" stopTime="4053.067">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    I’m not sure of whether it was in the complaint. 
    I am quite sure that in the arguments that day on the motion for TRO there was some discussion that it was, it was becoming circulated. 
    There was newspaper coverage. 
    I believe that the local Washington stations had stories.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="4053.067" stopTime="4060.024">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you say anything about distribution in your complaint?
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="4060.024" stopTime="4101.267">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Your Honor, I am referred to paragraph 15 in our complaint on information and belief unless we strained defendants will continue to distribute and publish information concerning plaintiffs, their children, and other students, etcetera. 
    I’m not sure that’s as good an allegation as might have been made. 
    But I believe that was the thrust of the case in the one day it was in District Court. 
    That it was being distributed, that’s why we went for a temporary restraining order. 
    The next point I’d like to make, Your Honor is that the District of Columbia respondents are in error when they claim in their brief and as Mr. Sutton did in his argument that we made a concession in the District Court --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4101.267" stopTime="4110.689">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    May I interrupt you on the -- in paragraph 5 of your complaint said, defendants also caused the report to be distributed to the members of the public.
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="4110.689" stopTime="4112.483">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Okay. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4112.483" stopTime="4114.647">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="michael_j_valder" startTime="4114.647" stopTime="4268.126">
    Mr. Michael J. Valder 
    Thank you. 
    The concession is important because it’s a fundamental argument made by the respondents in the District of Columbia respondents. 
    The only concession that was made, was made by counsel at the hearing before Judge Sirica, when he said that he did not complain about the fact that investigators talked to the teacher and the principal, period. 
    He did not concede that the teacher and the principal had a right to give this information -- these documents to the investigators and that is pertinent distinction. 
    Talk? 
    Yes. 
    Disclosure and passing of documents with names? 
    No. 
    There wasn’t such concession on. 
    I’m sorry if there’s been some confusion on that. 
    But I -- and what’s more even if there had been that kind of that of a concession. 
    We submit that the procedures in the District Court were highly irregular. 
    We went to Court at 04:30, the day the complaint was filed on our motion for at temporary restraining order to be met by a sua sponte dismissal on the merits with the judge asserting he thought it was frivolous. 
    We had no idea, we were to defend a motion to dismiss or summary judgment that no one had made. 
    And even if there may have been a concession, we don’t think that it is a real concession but there was no concession on this teacher and principal giving the documents and I think you may have to read the transcript of the argument. 
    Another point is that, we submit that as to the District Court of Columbia respondents, Congress is not the ultimate superior. 
    The law is the ultimate superior of public officials and because of the peculiar relationship in this city between public officials and the House District Committee, it is tempting to say that the House Committee is the Government but it is not. 
    The real Government in this city is the law and teachers, principals, Boards of Education, Congressman’s staff and investigators have to comply with the law and that is the ultimate superior and that is why we are here. 
    We think that the processes of the law and that the protections of the Constitution and the protections of a Civil Rights Act now a 101 years old provide us with the remedy and that an injunction is possible if only the courthouse doors will open. 
    They’ve been close to us this is the last Court we can go to.

    I am sorry it is Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 which incidentally was passed about two months after a Bill creating a territorial government in the District of Columbia that is the reference to the District of Columbia versus Carter Supplemental Memorandum. 
    We adopt that position.

    Your Honor, it is water over the dam. 
    It should have never been published with their names. 
    Having been published we want an injunction that further distribution excise their names into the practical extent possible the report be recalled with the names excised. 
    That is limited injunctive relief; it is not broad and sweepy.
