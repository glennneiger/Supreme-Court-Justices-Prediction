Evco v. Jones

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We’ll hear arguments next in 71-857, Evco against Jones. 
    Mr. Schlenker you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
speaker="kendall_o_schlenker" startTime="46.693" stopTime="430.010">
    Mr. Kendall O. Schlenker 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the case of Evco v. Jones is before the Court the second time. 
    The issue is whether the gross receipts of Evco from sales of tangible personal property to customers outside the State of New Mexico where delivery is made outside the State of New Mexico are exempt from the New Mexico Emergency School Tax and the Gross Receipts Tax. 
    New Mexico of course is a State which is not a heavily industrial state and as a result perhaps of the Atomic Energy Commission and some of the other government agencies and instrumentalities, in our state there have evolved a number of businesses which deal in scientific and technological materials of which Evco is one. 
    Now, Evco designs educational programs. 
    Its customers are many government agencies for the state and federal government. 
    It does a certain contract work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and typical of the kind of work it does, which is involved in this case is the designing of instructional programs for the IBM Corporation up in Endicott, New York for its use in training people how to use its typewriters, magnetic tapes, electric typewriters, and other modern types of business equipment. 
    The products which evolved from this work, which Evco does consists of camera-ready copies of books and training manuals, film strips for instruction and audio tapes. 
    Now, this case arises under two different New Mexico statutes and for our purposes, I believe it can be considered the same. 
    The first one was the so-called Emergency School Tax Act which came about in 1939 and continued along until about 1961 when we changed the name to the New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax. 
    The practical effect of those taxes is the same and in each case an exemption was contained from the tax for sales of tangible personal property to government agencies and instrumentalities and to certain nonprofit corporations. 
    In this case, in the lower court’s opinion, typical of this were the sales to the U.S. for service into the University of Toledo and so forth. 
    Now, the first issue involved in this case initially was whether Evco was actually selling tangible personal property or whether it was in fact selling a service, which was not subject to this exemption. 
    The New Mexico Emergency School Tax contained no provision regarding interstate commerce. 
    The New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax provides an exemption in the case of sales which were an interstate commerce. 
    Notwithstanding this absence of a provision in New Mexico Emergency School Tax, I don’t believe anyone has ever contended that New Mexico -- that the presence of this provision one way or another would have any effect since, I think it’s always been fairly clear that if these sales are in interstate commerce that they would be just exempt as they are stated to be under the gross receipts tax. 
    The New Mexico Court of Appeals decided that Evco was selling tangible personal property which took care of a considerable part to this case, that relating to sales to the Government and sales to these tax-exempt institutions. 
    However, the Court of Appeals decided that notwithstanding their determination that tangible personal property was involved, these sales where delivery was made to IBM for example in New York were not exempt as being in interstate commerce. 
    We came to this Court before and petition for writ of certiorari and the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office at that time filed a brief, which -- in which it was stated that so far as a second point was concerned that the state would now agree that the sales were exempt as being in interstate commerce. 
    They expressed their dissatisfaction with the determination still about the services versus tangible personal property point. 
    This Court sent the case back in using language in the view of the attorney -- their New Mexico Attorney General’s position or concession that the case was being resubmitted for reconsideration. 
    And in effect what the New Mexico Court of Appeals said was that we have reconsidered but we don’t we change our mind on this point and we again came back with the petition this time which was granted. 
    The State raises this point about the tangible personal property versus services, but the state’s position on the second point is that if this is the sale of tangible personal property that we are correct in our position that these sales are exempt as being in interstate commerce. 
    We rely on the case of Adams Manufacturing Company versus Storen in which the sales there involved were so-called out-shipments and which this Court determined that those sales were exempt as being an interstate commerce.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    As I understand what you have told us and as I understood it in reading the briefs and understood it, that when the case was last here you and the State of New Mexico are in agreement, are you not that if the sales are on personal property the tax cannot be imposed?

    But they are saying that we have a right to tax this notwithstanding it that the petitioner should apportion the tax in this case. 
    Now, under the apportionment idea, we believe that the apportionment we are to make is between intrastate and interstate sales and we believe those are fairly clear. 
    It appears however that the New Mexico Court is concerned about apportionment of something else.

    Mr. Kendall O. Schlenker 
    Yes. 
    Yes, Your Honor and we say that the decision of the New Mexico Court of Appeal is incorrect under the authority of Adams Manufacturing Company versus Storen, and the subsequent cases that reaffirm that same position. 
    They are relying on the case of General Motors Company versus Washington as authority for their decision in the case and that case involved in-state or in-shipments to the State of Washington. 
    This Court has drawn these distinctions of three kinds as I understand it, out-shipments which cannot be taxed by the shipping state, in-shipments which can, and then the manufacturing type of manufacturing tax, which is also a constitutional tax.

    All of those cases, it is a gross receipts tax. 
    The Commissioner of Revenue under the Gross Receipt Tax Act which came in 1961 did issue a ruling of which is to the effect that our sale -- our sales would be exempt if in fact they are tangible personal property.

    On page A9, this is its first opinion. 
    He said, “The sole question is therefore whether or not the contracts constituted sales of tangible personal property within the contemplation of the statutes or were contracts for the performance of services.” 
    And so he said that’s the sole question for him to decide and then the case came up here and it was remanded. 
    And on remand on page A31, same judge for the same court says, “We failed to understand how a tax on this aspect of interstate commerce can be constitutionally fair and valid if the -- it arise out of a contract for services, but constitutionally unfair and invalid when the same instances are incidents arise out of a contract of sale. 
    In our opinion, taxable incidents are equally apparent and ascertain it involve with equal lead whether they arise out of the contract of sale or out of a contract for services. 
    So, the first time around he said that the sole question was whether they were tangible personal property or services; and the second time around he said it didn’t make any difference.

    We have the two questions squarely presented. 
    One on the tangible personal property versus service; and then the second one that was a threshold question once the determination was made. 
    And I believe that the New Mexico Court of Appeals is just saying that it does not agree with the laws established by this Court.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1054.130" stopTime="1088.094">
    Unknown Speaker 
    May I follow up on this question that you’ve been discussing. 
    Look at appendix A8 which is the first opinion on the New Mexico Court. 
    The first full paragraph starts it by saying “he taxpayer contends that these contracts constituted sales of tangible personal property” and then on the last sentence the court says, “we agree with the position of the taxpayer.”

    Unknown Speaker 
    Now, I can construe that as a finding and a holding by the New Mexico Court that it construes these sales to be of tangible personal property under your statute. 
    Now, in its second opinion, after the remand although it did say as you and Justice Stewart have pointed out that it doesn’t see any legal consequence following what would be different if it construed the sales to be of services nevertheless, it concludes by saying we reinstate and reaffirm the first opinion. 
    Now, I have construed that until this argument that that was reaffirmation of a prior holding that the sales were of tangible personal property.

    It would not be in the sense that if the Bureau of Revenue follows its existing regulation that it would just not raise it in any subsequent case. 
    It does have a ruling in effect which is in the Court’s opinion at the beginning on the bottom of A13. 
    We believe that that exactly fits our situation -- the receipts of New Mexico seller from sales of property to non-residents of New Mexico or deliveries made out of state by seller’s vehicle, U.S. mail, or common carrier are receipts from transactions in interstate commerce and such receipts may be deducted from the gross receipts of the seller. 
    That was in existence and our court expressed doubts about it. 
    They said, well, if that is a correct statement of the law, then it wasn’t in effect that the time that the taxable transactions arose here.

    Mr. John C. Cook 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case involves two issues, which were presented to the New Mexico Court of Appeals. 
    The first issue decided by the lower court was a certain instructional material, which were developed and created by petitioner and sold as camera-ready copies were as a matter of law tangible personal property. 
    Receipts from sales of this tangible personal property to the United States and the Research Foundation of the University of Toledo were decided to be exempt from the tax as it issue here.

    Unknown Speaker

    Sales of tangible personal property to governmental bodies?

    Mr. John C. Cook 
    Once they decided what was being sold was tangible personal property, yes Justice. 
    The second issue concerns sales to bars who were outside New Mexico and the delivery was outside New Mexico. 
    The subject matter of those sales was not materially different. 
    The New Mexico Court of Appeals held that the petitioner’s receipts from these sales were subject to tax. 
    These sales were clearly under the New Mexico Court of Appeals reasoning out-shipments of tangible personal property.

    Mr. John C. Cook 
    Yes, Justice.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Now, Mr. Cook how do we second guess that the Court of Appeals is to whether these were sales of tangible personal property as applied in any event? 
    Your Court of Appeal said, these were for the purposes of your statute, and that’s it? 
    That’s modern statutory construction in the sense of application that these particular materials, wasn’t it?
speaker="john_c_cook" startTime="1702.696" stopTime="1703.705">
    Mr. John C. Cook 
    Yes, Justice.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1703.705" stopTime="1709.498">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Now, how do we -- how do we then, we agree with that or have we any jurisdiction of the Supreme Court?
speaker="john_c_cook" startTime="1709.498" stopTime="1903.336">
    Mr. John C. Cook 
    Well, if I'm might expand a little on my answer. 
    The Court of Appeals stated in the first opinion that -- the regarding the issue of services versus tangibles said the adoption of the possession taken by the commissioner would result in an augment imposition of taxes such as those here involved upon agencies and institutions which the legislature intended should be exempt their file or result in a tax burden being shifted to other taxable customers of the taxpayer. 
    Neither of these results would be consistent with the legislative intent. 
    Shifting the tax burden would be inconsistent with the object of requiring a tax burden to follow with uniformity and equality upon the class of person sought to be taxed. 
    In support of the statement, the Court of Appeals cited another Court of Appeals case, New Mexico Electric Service Company versus Jones. 
    The reasoning that resulted in the statement I’ve read seems to be that if the Commissioner’s decision and order with respect to the issue of service versus tangible personal property have been affirmed by their Court of Appeals, the effect would be a denial of equal protection to taxpayers performance services for the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof. 
    The New Mexico Electric Service Company case which was cited by the Court of Appeals raised issues under both the equal protection provisions of the United States and the New Mexico constitution. 
    Respondent contends that this reasoning of the New Mexico Court of Appeals regarding a requirements of equal protection is erroneous because the imposition of the tax was on the seller and there was no showing that sellers or services to these agencies or organizations has a class that sellers ask class were treated differently for purposes of taxation. 
    If the imposition of the taxes at issue here is on receipts from the performance of services rather than receipts from the sale of tangible personal property, the respondent contends that the tax is not repugnant to the United States Constitution. 
    And that seems to be the basis for part of the New Mexico Court of Appeal’s decision with regard to that first issue. 
    There appears to respondent to be at least of security as to the precise grounds for the judgment in the New Mexico Court of Appeals on the first issue. 
    Although, we haven’t cited at this case in our briefs in view of the --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1903.336" stopTime="1942.632">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, one of the things that may be quite right, Mr. Cook would I don’t see however erroneous maybe the basis, the supporting reasoning for holding that these or that this particular taxpayer was taxed on tangibles. 
    However erroneous that basis is, how can we set aside that conclusion of the Court of Appeals? 
    Although it’s whether that -- whether the other if it is error has its roots and misapplication of the federal constitution or not as to this tax payer which --

    That’s correct Justice. 
    In the case of State of Minnesota versus National Tea Company which is not cited in the respondent’s brief that it’s a 309 U.S. 551. 
    There was obscurity in the decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota in a tax case involving the graduated gross sales tax on chain stores. 
    This obscurity arose because of discussion by the Supreme Court of Minnesota of the Equal Protection Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment and the reference and the syllabus of that case to a provision of the Minnesota Constitution which provided that taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects. 
    In Minnesota versus National Tea Company, it was contended that the United States Supreme Court should not take jurisdiction because of the rule that jurisdiction is not taken for a judgment of a state court rest on two grounds, one involving a federal question and the other not. 
    However, there was found to be obscurity as to the grounds for the decision and jurisdiction was taken. 
    The case was remanded to the state court to resolve ambiguities of the decision. 
    And the case in the course of the opinion, this Court stated this Court is frequently held that in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction it has the power not only to correct errors of law in the judgment and the review, but also to make such disposition of the case as justice requires.

    Do I understand it all is it like that happen again in the future as far as Evco is concern?
speaker="john_c_cook" startTime="2615.376" stopTime="3077.346">
    Mr. John C. Cook 
    Well, with regard to the question Justice Rehnquist asked the statutes of New Mexico have been amended. 
    Section 7216 (a) 14.12 came in after the period involving this assessment. 
    Now, that deduction provides for deduction for services performed in New Mexico when an initial use of the product of the services is outside New Mexico. 
    However, the buyer outside New Mexico is required to deliver a non-taxable transaction certificate regarding these sales. 
    So, if this matter had come up under current law and a certificate had been issued then the sale would’ve been deductible from a gross receipts tax. 
    Respondent submits that there was error of law present in the decision in New Mexico Court of Appeals on the first point. 
    That error presented to federal question on the ground that the states statute was held repugnant to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, I have been over that. 
    Even if it is decided that in New Mexico Court of Appeals did not completely decide the first issue on the grounds that the state statutes were repugnant to the Equal Protection Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of United States Constitution. 
    The decision does not present -- does present an uncertainly as was present in Minnesota versus National Tea Company. 
    Respondent submits that if ambiguity is present that ambiguity should be resolved before the interstate commerce question is considered. 
    If the first issue of the case was decided on incorrect grounds that the exemption or deduction provisions which were limited to receipts from selling tangible personal property were repugnant to the Equal Protection Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, then the issue could be resolve as a question of fact rather than a question of law. 
    There were facts which would substantially support the Commissioner of Revenue’s decision that the transactions which resulted in the tax were found the performance of services if it’s a fact question. 
    If it is decided that the first issue was decided as a matter of state law or that the issue was clearly decided on both federal grounds and state grounds then respondent agrees with petitioner as to the decision on the Court of Appeals on the second point which concerns the application of the Commerce Clause Article 1 of Section 8 of the United States Constitution. 
    The decision of this Court in Freeman versus Hewit and J.D. Adams Manufacturing Company versus Storen hold that if there is a risk of a double tax burden, the tax would be forbidden under the Commerce Clause and that this would so even if apportionment was accomplished. 
    The reason we think this is the rule is because the destination state could imposed a use or compensating tax on a full value of the Adams when they came to rest in the destination state. 
    The destination state could also impose as an alternative and oppose the gross receipts tax on the receipts from the subsequent sale of Adams if the seller had sufficient contact with destination study as was done in General Motors versus Washington. 
    Respondents emphasize that our contention is that the risk of a double tax burden is all what is required to forbid the tax on receipts from an out-shipment of tangible personal property. 
    This we think is clear from the following statement and in J.D. Adams case. 
    The statement reads the vice of the statute as applied to receipts from interstate sales is that the tax includes in its measure without apportionment receipts derived from activities in interstate commerce and that the exemption is a such a character that if lawful in may in substance be laid to the fullest extent by States in which the goods are sold as well as those in which they are manufactured. 
    Interstate commerce would thus be subjected to the risk of a double tax burden on which interstate -- interstate commerce would then be subjected to the risk of a double tax burden to which intrastate commerce is not exposed and which the Commerce Clause forbids. 
    The Adam’s case distinguishes a gross receipts tax on out-shipments from a tax on manufacturing measured by gross receipts. 
    The taxes at issue here are clearly not taxes imposed on the activity of manufacturing. 
    In this case there was no showing in the record and no argument that there was a possibility of another state taxing or attempting to tax any receipts from the activities incident to the performance of the contracts. 
    Therefore, this Court said that Evco then had failed -- the Court of Appeals said, in its burden of showing an unconstitutional tax on interstate commerce and the question on multiple taxations was not before the court. 
    Respondent points out that it would be very difficult if not almost impossible for the record to reflect the possibility of another state taxing these transactions -- the possibility of another state taxing these transactions. 
    Also with respect to this, the following statement from Freeman v. Hewit seems particularly applicable. 
    The immunities implicit in the commerce clause and the potential taxing power of a state can hardly be made to depend in the world of practical affairs on the shipping incidents of the varying tax laws of the various States at a particular moment. 
    I have no further argument.
