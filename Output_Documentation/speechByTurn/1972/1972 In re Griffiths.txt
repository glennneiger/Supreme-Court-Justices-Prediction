In re Griffiths
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="14.534">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    This morning, the number 71-1336 in matter of the application of Griffiths for admission to the Bar. 
    Mr. Broiles, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="14.534" stopTime="113.841">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Fre Le Poole Griffiths was born in the Netherlands in 1940. 
    Immigrated to this country on a temporary visa in 1965. 
    Obtained the status of a permanent resident alien after she acquired work in this country in the State of New York in 1965. 
    She continued to work in this country and was married in 1967, and moved to Washington, D.C. 
    After residing in Washington, D.C. approximately two years, she moved to New Haven, Connecticut where she was admitted to Yale Law School as a second year law student. 
    She completed her studies for an LLB degree at Yale Law School and graduated from Yale Law School in June of 1969. 
    She has the equivalent of a BA in Law from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, and LLB in Law from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and an LLB in Law from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. 
    She is concededly, in all respects, qualified for admission to the Bar examination in the State of Connecticut. 
    But for the fact that Rule 8 (1) of the Superior Court rules of the State of Connecticut requires that all applicants for admission to the Bar examination, be citizens of the United States. 
    Fre Griffiths is not a citizen of United States and did not at the time for application intend to become a citizen of the United States. 
    She was at the time of her application, a resident within the residency requirements of the State of Connecticut for admission to the Bar.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Does the record indicate that why she doesn’t want to -- why she does not intend to become citizen of the United States?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="120.274" stopTime="132.372">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    This was the fourth hearing that we’ve attended and you’re the first person to ask. 
    The record does not so indicate why she does not intend to become a citizen of the United States. 
    If you like for me to give you the reason, I would --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="132.372" stopTime="139.250">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, does the record show whether or not she intends to remain in the United States and particularly in Connecticut?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="139.250" stopTime="150.930">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    The record does not show whether she intends to remain in the United States or in the State of Connecticut. 
    She was not asked that question. 
    She in fact, does intend to reside in the United States as with her husband.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="150.930" stopTime="152.004">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Indefinitely?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="152.004" stopTime="155.574">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    Yes and she does intend to reside in the United States indefinitely.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="155.574" stopTime="157.932">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And clearly intends not to become a citizen?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="157.932" stopTime="214.727">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    She does not at this time intend to become a citizen. 
    Her feeling is that after 25 years of living in Holland that she cannot give that up at this particular time. 
    Dual citizenship is not a possibility. 
    It would be as if we immigrated to Holland, say we married a Dutch citizen and I was living in Holland and my wife was working there, and in order to practice my profession as a lawyer, I was required to give up my citizenship in the United States. 
    My failure to do that and I would not give up my citizenship in the United States to be a Dutch citizen would not be because of any lack of loyalty to Holland, where I’m resident thereof or because I intended to violate any laws of Holland or because I could not abide by the constitutional laws of Holland. 
    It will be because of the feeling that I have after having my family and resided in the United States for 25 years. 
    That sort of personal feeling is what Mrs. Griffiths has and she doesn’t feel (Voice Overlap).
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="214.727" stopTime="225.070">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just to have a personal feeling or one never knows about the future, about the relationships for example between our country and Holland, or any other nation.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="225.070" stopTime="225.516">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    No there are contingencies (Voice Overlap)
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="225.516" stopTime="236.910">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And as long as that personal feeling of loyalty exists to the nation of which you’re now a citizen, that’s I suppose what Connecticut was trying to get at, isn’t it?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="236.910" stopTime="253.670">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    I think it is not what Connecticut is trying to get at. 
    Connecticut -- people have personal feelings, for example, with regards to their citizenship in the State in the United States, by the virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, we have a dual citizenship to a State and to the United States if we are a citizens (Voice Overlap).
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="253.670" stopTime="264.129">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But in international affairs under our Constitution and all those matters, you’ll turn over to the National Government. 
    States don’t have foreign policies with other nations. 
    That’s one of the reasons our Constitution was adopted.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="264.129" stopTime="265.391">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    That’s correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="265.391" stopTime="266.829">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So that’s not (Voice Overlap).
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="266.829" stopTime="319.464">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    Well, to contingency -- if you’re asking, is there a contingency that she might go back to Holland. 
    That contingency, in fact, exists as much as the contingency that someone born in California, who is admitted to practice law in Connecticut, might go back to California, that someone who’s a citizen of the United States might choose to re-announce their United States citizenship and move to Israel. 
    That someone might die, that someone might commit a breach to the Canons of Ethics as a member of the Bar and be disqualified. 
    There are all sorts of disabling contingencies that one can have and certainly one of them would be that she can go to Holland. 
    That’s a contingency that her husband also is subject to, that anyone would be subject to in leaving United States. 
    I do not think it is what the State of Connecticut is getting at by requiring United States citizenship of all members or applicants to the Bar though.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="319.464" stopTime="334.206">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Broiles, to pursue your hypothetical, if you are moving to Holland and having a Dutch wife, as a member of the Bar of the United -- some one of the States of the United States, do you think you’d have a right to be a judge in Holland?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="334.206" stopTime="371.111">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    No, I would not have a right to be a judge in Holland though it is interesting that my client, who is not a citizen to United States, and is a citizen of Holland, would on our research, have a right to be the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. 
    Our research tells me that in Holland that is not the case. 
    I’m telling you what my client tells me about Dutch law. 
    I don’t purport to know anything about it other than that. 
    We have not found any disabling provisions for an alien to be a United States District Court Judge or to be on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="371.111" stopTime="374.316">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We’re going to the constitution (Inaudible) need to be lawyers?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="374.316" stopTime="379.202">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    There’s no requirement that a Justice on the Supreme Court be a lawyer.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="379.202" stopTime="387.473">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Broiles, following through with your hypothetical as a matter of curiosity, do you know whether you could be admitted to the Bar of Holland?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="387.473" stopTime="390.496">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    According to my client, I could not.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="390.496" stopTime="391.740">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Without being a Dutch citizen?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="391.740" stopTime="409.941">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    Without being a Dutch citizen. 
    Our research shows that there are very few countries that allow what one would call reciprocity without the requirement of citizenship. 
    One of the few being Japan, and it is apparently possible in England, but it is not possible according to her in Holland.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="409.941" stopTime="413.509">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    This is outside the record. 
    Is your client’s still a resident in Connecticut?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="413.509" stopTime="427.470">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    She is presently living in Holland and is coming back Thursday and has the intention of practicing in Connecticut if this opinion is favorable to her. 
    She went to Holland and have a child. 
    She now has, since the beginning of this lawsuit has had two children.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="427.470" stopTime="429.594">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, is the case moot?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="429.594" stopTime="443.060">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    No it is not Your Honor. 
    There is no residency requirement in the State of Connecticut. 
    Rule 8 (2) requires that you have an intention to reside in the State of Connecticut which she has. 
    At the time the case was brought up to Court, she’d been a resident of Connecticut for two years.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="443.060" stopTime="450.343">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, an intent to reside that means an intent to live in Connecticut and indefinitely.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="450.343" stopTime="461.017">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    No, it does not Your Honor. 
    It means, an intent to reside in Connecticut so long as it takes to become a member of the Bar. 
    Once one has become a member of the Bar, you need no longer to have to that intent. 
    For example --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="461.017" stopTime="464.469">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    How can you have an intent? 
    What does residency mean in Connecticut?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="464.469" stopTime="465.671">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    Residency means living there.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="465.671" stopTime="466.372">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Just being there?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="466.372" stopTime="507.691">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    Just being there. 
    I, for example, I’m a member of the Connecticut Bar, a Commissioner of the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut as I stand here right now. 
    I have not resided in the State of Connecticut for two years. 
    I have been to Connecticut only twice in those two years, both times in connection with this lawsuit. 
    I became a member of the Bar at the State of Connecticut after my graduation from a law school in the State of Connecticut. 
    No questions were asked to me and no questions are required by the rules in the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut that I intend to permanently reside in the State of Connecticut. 
    Rule 8 (2) says, “You must either reside in the State of Connecticut or intend to reside in the State of Connecticut.” 
    It does not require an intention to permanently reside in the State of Connecticut. 
    I recently --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="507.691" stopTime="510.481">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Residence doesn’t mean domicile then?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="510.481" stopTime="523.679">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    I think residence in fact does mean just that. 
    That you are at the time you make application for the admission to the Bar, have the intention to reside. 
    I take it domicile to mean actually physically be present.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="523.679" stopTime="534.254">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, also domicile involves an intent to remain there indefinitely. 
    When I stay on overnight in a hotel in New Haven, that doesn’t make me a resident --
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="534.254" stopTime="535.014">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    That would not.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="535.014" stopTime="542.858">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But if I have the intention residing in Connecticut indefinitely then I am and then domicile depends upon intent?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="542.858" stopTime="544.229">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    I think domicile intents (Voice Overlap)
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="544.229" stopTime="545.308">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Voice Overlap) intent?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="545.308" stopTime="559.073">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    Yes, I don’t think the intent can reasonably said to be indefinitely. 
    The intent must be to stay there having no particular plans to leave at this time to go some place else. 
    This is where I am now. 
    I’m not definitely living some place else.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="559.073" stopTime="563.169">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That is the -- residency doesn’t even mean that thing?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="563.169" stopTime="564.210">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No. 
    Apparently, no.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="564.210" stopTime="566.873">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    No I don’t think so. 
    I don’t think (Voice Overlap).
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="566.873" stopTime="573.576">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you could just move to Connecticut for long after you take the exam and leave?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="573.576" stopTime="576.958">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    Based on the rules of the State of Connecticut, that is quite right. 
    That’s (Voice Overlap).
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="576.958" stopTime="591.624">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So far under your submission in this case, somebody could come from Japan, or Uganda, or Nepal, and just fill out the questionnaire and take the Connecticut Bar exam.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="591.624" stopTime="592.380">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    No that’s (Voice Overlap).
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="592.380" stopTime="594.238">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That’s an absolute constitutional right to do so. 
    Is that right (Voice Overlap)?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="594.238" stopTime="602.193">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    No, that’s absolutely not the position here. 
    One has to take -- one has not only fill out the questionnaire but be interviewed by the Bar Committee.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="602.193" stopTime="604.361">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Alright, is there long enough for an interview.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="604.361" stopTime="607.571">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    And the Bar Committee is satisfied to these qualifications.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="607.571" stopTime="608.113">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Alright he is found he law school in (Inaudible)
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="608.113" stopTime="613.551">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    As to his residency in the State of Connecticut then it seems clear under the rule of the State of Connecticut that he’s admissible.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="613.551" stopTime="614.898">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, except if (Voice Overlap)
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="614.898" stopTime="616.085">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    If so required --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="616.085" stopTime="618.385">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Constitutionally requires, it’s what you’re saying.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="618.385" stopTime="620.724">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    I’m saying that that’s what the rule of the State of Connecticut requires.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="620.724" stopTime="655.679">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No. 
    No, you’re saying what the (Voice Overlap) Constitution requires is that Connecticut must, if a person is otherwise qualified, must let him take the Bar exam whether or not he’s a citizen. 
    So as I say, you could from India or Ceylon, or Nepal, or Uganda, or Tanzania, and be there long enough for an examination and to show you’ve gone to law school and that Connecticut as constitutionally required, let him take the bar exam and if you passes it, do admit him to the bar of Connecticut, then he can leave the next night and never come back.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="655.679" stopTime="686.918">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    That is not my position. 
    The Constitution does not require that. 
    The original question asked by you was with regard there was not the purpose to make sure that there was a residency, if the people were residents of the State in which they were lawyers. 
    In fact, the State of Connecticut does not require more than what you have described. 
    If the State of Connecticut were to just require a six-month residency requirement that may work well withstand the test of constitutionality. 
    The New Mexico case which you recently denied cert on --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="686.918" stopTime="692.334">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The issue in this case is whether or Connecticut can constitutionally require that a person be a citizen.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="692.334" stopTime="693.371">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    That’s correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="693.371" stopTime="704.870">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And you’ve told this that it doesn’t require that he be domicile in Connecticut. 
    Therefore it since it doesn’t, then your constitutional claim does come down and does it not to what I suggested in my questions?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="704.870" stopTime="705.535">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    It does not.

    Why not?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="705.907" stopTime="708.146">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    Connecticut could require constitutionally.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="708.146" stopTime="710.547">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Alright, it could but it hasn’t you told us.
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="710.547" stopTime="737.419">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    It has not. 
    If this case, does come down to my client on the Connecticut rule qualify because she wasn’t back in the Connecticut in the opinion of the Board of Bar Examiners, a resident under that rule. 
    That has been so found and it is not disputed. 
    That Connecticut has no further requirements other than domicile or intention to be a resident. 
    In this case is, yes. 
    Someone could come to Connecticut and stay there, and if the board was satisfied with that (Voice Overlap).

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He comes from Timbuktu so long as he was there long enough for an interview, and filled out question 8 (2) that he was a resident in Connecticut and intended to stay there then Connecticut couldn’t require that he’d be a citizen?

    Mr. R. David Broiles

    No, that is not the issue.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="766.290" stopTime="775.553">

    The issue in your case, is whether or not the Constitution compels Connecticut to allow somebody to take its Bar exam even though that person is not a citizen.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Broiles, basically what you’re saying is that if this sort of fugacious presence is acceptable to the Connecticut Bar examiners on the part to someone coming from Alaska as Mr. Justice Marshall posits, it is a constitutional matter must be acceptable in the same circumstances except that the person comes from Canada or Japan?
speaker="r_david_broiles" startTime="846.467" stopTime="871.860">
    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    I’m not sure I understand it. 
    If you’re saying that he comes from Virginia for example to Connecticut and establishes residency under the minimum requirements the State of Connecticut presently has, and he should be able to do that with a resident alien status from Canada. 
    Yes, I am saying that because that’s the Connecticut rule, but I’m not saying that this is a constitutional requirement. 
    It is not.

    My client, as a resident alien, a permanent resident alien may reside in the United States indefinitely. 
    She is subject to the laws of that right on conditions that do not apply to citizens. 
    If she is guilty of conduct that is prescribed by the Federal statute, you know, habitual drunkenness, they are spelled out in immigration naturalization, she could still be subject to deportation. 
    They are certainly less stringent rules than one would expect of a bar association, so that were she guilty of those same acts and misconduct, she should certainly be disbarred before she is deported. 
    But she is permanently has a right to be here under the present statutory scheme.

    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    No, Your Honor. 
    She in fact got that status before she married a United States citizen. 
    The -- by virtue or the fact of marrying a United States citizen, she achieves one thing that she did not have earlier and that is that she could become a United States citizen in three years rather than five years. 
    But she got her permanent resident status prior to marrying a United States citizen. 
    I’d like to address myself to one inquiry raised by the brief of the State of Connecticut and that is that Graham versus Richardson does not apply in this case with regard to the standard. 
    That the classification based on alienage is subject to strict judicial scrutiny and that the State of Connecticut must show a compelling interest that this classification is necessary to me. 
    This is stated on page 5 of the brief of the State of Connecticut where it is held that no inquiry beyond reasonableness is really needed. 
    The reason that an alienage classification does receive special scrutiny, namely the alien’s non participation in Government fails here because the non participation is a purpose served by the classification. 
    As I understand that statement, the State of Connecticut is saying that Graham does not apply because of the fact that the very exclusion of aliens from the process of Government is the purpose of the rule. 
    I would take it that what they mean is that if aliens have the right to vote, there would be no holding by this Court but under the Fourteenth Amendment, all such classifications are subject to strict judicial scrutiny. 
    I would point out two examples where this is not the case. 
    That is that the franchise or the right to vote is not the purpose for the strict judicial scrutiny rule. 
    Children cannot vote and to my knowledge, this Court has not said, that by virtue thereof all classifications with regard to children are subject to the standard in Graham, a strict judicial scrutiny of a necessary and compelling interest. 
    Secondly, convicted felons cannot vote and I would be surprised if this Court would seriously entertain an attack on the 1968 Crime Control Gun Provisions, that govern felons’ possessions of registered and unregistered firearms on the grounds that they cannot vote. 
    The reason that classifications based on alienage are subject to the strict judicial scrutiny is because of their analogous characteristic to racial classifications and classifications based on sex. 
    The State of Connecticut has to show a compelling interest that’s furthered by this classification and that the means are necessary to further this classification.

    It’s a little strange to be saying that a classification that is made in the Constitution itself in many different provisions of the Constitution itself, i.e. between citizens and other persons who are not citizens within the United States, that classification is constitutionally suspect. 
    The Fourteenth Amendment itself makes that, makes those classifications. 
    The Fifteen Amendment is the right of to franchise to citizens, not to persons. 
    The Fourteenth Amendment gives some protections to citizens that it doesn’t give to persons. 
    It gives some to all persons and there are other places all through the Constitution where you find that distinction.

    Mr. R. David Broiles 
    No, I think so, both. 
    Whether yes and no by some examples Your Honor. 
    I think there is a difference under -- even if the Court went as far as Mr. Justice White as said that these rules might compel it there is still a difference between an alien and a citizen. 
    The Fourteenth Amendment talks about the privileges and immunities of citizenship. 
    A citizen by the virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment has the privilege permanently to reside in the State as a citizen of that State, no matter what his conduct maybe, and is immune from the laws of citizenship, or from deportation from the United States, no matter what his conduct maybe or what we may think of him. 
    That is not the case. 
    That is not a privilege or immunity of an alien.

    What the record shows in this case, with regard to attorneys is quite different. 
    This case is one step removed from the decision you must make in the case that was argued yesterday, Sugarman. 
    We do not concede that our client has the status of a governmental official. 
    She is not asking to be a member in the Government. 
    She is asking to be an attorney in the State of Connecticut. 
    The State seeks to analogize her to a governmental official. 
    They seek to analogize her by a virtue of the position that she would hold as an attorney in Connecticut, as a Commissioner of the Superior Court. 
    The State argues this on what they call a self-evident proposition that after all, the Government of the State of Connecticut has a right to limit its positions to citizens thereof. 
    In fact, the State of Connecticut does not limit positions for attorneys or commissioners of Superior Courts to citizens of the State of Connecticut. 
    I am both an attorney in the State of Connecticut, I am a commissioner of the Superior Court, I cannot vote in the State of Connecticut, I am not a resident of the State of Connecticut, and yet I have all of these positions that they seek to deny my client on the grounds that she is not a citizen.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1892.547" stopTime="1894.717">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would you raise a little bit Mr. Tiernan?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="1894.717" stopTime="2002.351">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Yes. 
    That she’s seeking admission to the Bar of the State of Connecticut on her own terms to some degree at least. 
    When she was examined before the committee, one of the committees which of course acts as an agency for the judicial department of the State, the Court to the State in the procedure for bar admission which of course appears in the appendix, she was inquired of as to her residence and so forth beginning at page 30. 
    This is the transcript of the hearing before the committee on recommendations. 
    Now, when the question arrived as to her citizenship, she unequivocally stated that she was not and that she had no plans of becoming one. 
    The inquiry and the interrogations stopped at that point by the committee. 
    The first question posed here by the bench satisfies me that that is a natural inquiry and to my view, the first inquiry. 
    Why didn’t someone ask why? 
    Now, of course, the first and basic requirement of the Connecticut rules, which has been an effect for about a century, is first, that he is a citizen of the United States. 
    Just prior to that, there is a statement to entitle an applicant to admission to the Bar except in Section 12. 
    One might very well say, well what’s that exception is about. 
    The exception 12 merely refers to the admission on motion from other States by attorneys in the State of this country.

    What do you mean by that?

    Mr. George Tiernan 
    No, the citizen of the United States, of course, in order to become a citizen, when you become a citizen in the United States of course, you become a citizen of a State that you are presently where you are. 
    There is no specific answer. 
    Every citizen of the United States is also a citizen of the State in all to allegiance to both, United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S 377. 
    The case decided here in 1922.

    No.

speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="2049.663" stopTime="2055.288">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    The only requirement is that he is a citizen of the United States and then the second question which was --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Has to do with residence that is not before us here?

    That is right (Voice Overlap) 
    Mr. Justice Stewart that is correct. 
    That he is a resident of this State, or intends to become such resident.

    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Well of course the rule doesn’t limit it just to -- it says there, were entitled and that applicant to the admission to the Bar and of course only one of the steps is the citizenship. 
    Now, the question of whether a person says I filed a declaration.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2107.060" stopTime="2116.850">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    No, my question is, he says, “I intend” the language of the rules is “I intend to become a citizen,” could he be admitted?

    Mr. George Tiernan

speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="2184.373" stopTime="2196.859">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Thank you very much. 
    The one thing occurs to me is the fact of this Court does not have any machinery for admission to the Bar. 
    Presumably, that through the history of this Court is because they --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2196.859" stopTime="2201.764">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Tiernan, you must stay near the microphone if you want to be on the record.
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="2201.764" stopTime="2205.107">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    I have been accustomed to being heard on the past.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2205.107" stopTime="2206.819">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, we record these, as you see.
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="2206.819" stopTime="2293.740">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Oh, I beg your pardon. 
    This Court derives its qualifications to right degree of practicing before this Court by State’s attendance presumably because they believe through the past that they are proficient enough to be accepted. 
    And of course the federal system has no separate or distinct machinery for admitting people to practice before us. 
    Now, one of the basic rules of admission in this Court is that the applicant for a practice before this Court as today must represent that they practiced in a State of this country for a period of three years. 
    It would be difficult to understand how a person could make a solid showing for a permission to practice here on that requirement. 
    Because of course, up until this year, there was no single State that unequivocally by decision decided or found that citizenship was not required for admission to the Bar. 
    Now, in reference to Graham --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2293.740" stopTime="2299.823">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    In that connection, Mr. Tiernan, you have admission by a motion in Connecticut as I understood from your prior remark?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="2299.823" stopTime="2301.609">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    That is correct.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2301.609" stopTime="2308.005">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And suppose, well there are States today which permit a person to be admitted to the bar without proof of citizenship.
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="2308.005" stopTime="2310.631">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Yes. 
    Yes, there are couple.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And if someone presented himself to the Connecticut bar authorities with proof of admission in one of those States, would Connecticut admit him by motion?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="2321.479" stopTime="2340.514">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    No because under the Section 13 at the rules, subparagraph 3, one of the kinds in addition to his practice in the other State is that he is a citizen of the United States. 
    That is common to both non-resident Bar, those applying to motion and those applying directly.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2340.514" stopTime="2344.737">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun

    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Three years?

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Three years of practice.(Voice Overlap)
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="2351.570" stopTime="2591.651">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Of course, I take it that this issue is not similar to the issues raise or the factual situation raised in Graham and Dunn versus Blumstein voting rights. 
    Social benefits in Graham -- because of course in those cases, we have a situation where with reference to Graham which advanced that compelling interest, State interest test to be applied in alienage classifications. 
    Right there, it seems to me that that case distinguished in the situation there because of course the financial integrity of a State was involved just as in Shapiro, nothing about anything else. 
    That was a case where they were trying to deprive the people of visiting the State of welfare benefits undergrounds of no durational residence for citizenship. 
    And they said that the State had to show a compelling State interest. 
    That is hardly to be I think compared with admission to the Bar because of course the reference that was made to the brief concerning the special judicial scrutiny required. 
    As a matter of fact, the mere situation in Graham and the voting case in Graham and Shapiro, the right to travel which although doesn’t appear specifically in the Constitution has been inserted therein by judicial decision, and the fundamental right of travel of people in this country was restricted, says this Court in those cases. 
    But in the Graham case, there was a discussion concerning one of the tests used in our history of special interest and in that very case, Graham on page 374, 403, this Court stated that although the special interest test was rejected, so far as the social benefits were concerned, social benefit cases which of course Graham represented, this Court specifically said, whatever maybe the contemporary vitality of the special public interest doctrine and other context at the Takahashi, we conclude so forth. 
    In other words, they left open, this very Court left open even the application of a special interest test. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Marshall, you referred to the -- talked about Truax which of course is the case that obviously when this country grants entrance and vote to an alien, obviously, one follows the other. 
    The early efforts of course, when this question was raised from -- in this country from a country that once had many aliens, when we’re in the formative stages, when that question was raised here in the -- as in to the Truax case, the Court said it was limited to the right of an alien to indulge in the common occupations of men or sometimes it was a common I believe industrial occupations. 
    That has always been interpreted even by writers, scholarly writers, law writers, that that did not include professions. 
    Now, incidentally in this connection, efforts have been made to add.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2591.651" stopTime="2594.923">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Could you give me that scholarly writer?

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It was a scholarly student’s comment. 
    But what could point to me in Truax, that says as limited that in any fashion at all and I think you’ll agree that Chief Justice Hughes didn’t use broad language that they can manage. 
    He said it was a denial of equal protection for a State to draw the line between alien and the citizen in the matter of employment and right to make a living.
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="2681.016" stopTime="2725.376">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Yes. 
    But of course, how can this be considered as all inclusive and have any meaning to the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    How can this be considered as being all inclusive for all forms of occupational activity including the professions when it's indicated classifications are permissible that must be justified. 
    After all even Bar admission rules must be within the framework of the Constitution, but how can we ever permit any classifications as such so far as employment is concerned, if that is so? 
    Now, --

    Mr. George Tiernan

    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Because in the State of Connecticut, the Court has established by this Court, presented, I should say, by its decision that because of the status and the position of the lawyer in the State, there are other conditions or qualifications that are required, citizenship, residency, educational requirements, they say, this Court stated that in order to have a system toward the administration of justice and in the public interest in Connecticut, a lawyer who is called with the right to command actions by authority of the State of Connecticut, in connection with his affairs both private, both public, and his reference to individuals as a counselor.

    Mr. George Tiernan

    In Connecticut, the Court stated that because of the position that member of the Bar holds that citizenship is a requirement, that there is nothing irrational above the State asking for that in accordance with the precepts set down by the decisions of this Court. 
    And in the first place, as one said in -- just examine the duties of a lawyer, his relationship both to the individual, the public, his connection with the Court, his involvement of the rules, his involvement of the procedure, and the changing procedure and changing rules, all of this is connected with the Government.

    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Well, of course, as long as he retains -- as long as he retains his position in Connecticut.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3053.469" stopTime="3054.375">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Alright.
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3054.375" stopTime="3063.321">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Whether they are known by the authorities or not and in whatever connection, he is of course clothed with the rights of the office that he has.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3063.321" stopTime="3068.361">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Would he lose that if you took out double citizenship?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3068.361" stopTime="3071.151">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Well, of course that would be obviously a question --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3071.151" stopTime="3072.933">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Would he, under those rules?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3072.933" stopTime="3078.952">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Well there’s no rule here that says that if you can be a citizen of two countries and still be a lawyer and of course --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3078.952" stopTime="3087.508">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, is there anything? 
    Well if a person gives up his citizenship, does he resign from Bar automatically?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3087.508" stopTime="3090.393">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    If he gives up his citizenship?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3090.393" stopTime="3099.812">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    If he gives his citizenship, his United States citizenship five years from now, does he lose his Bar membership in Connecticut?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3099.812" stopTime="3101.577">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Oh! 
    No there’s no such provision.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3101.577" stopTime="3119.382">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So, that this man can -- who is sitting in there --Mr. Broiles, could go to Netherlands, live in the Netherlands, take out the Netherlands citizenship and he’ll still be able to practice law in Connecticut. 
    Am I right or wrong?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3119.382" stopTime="3123.716">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Well, by what test or standard do you mean?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3123.716" stopTime="3126.762">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Under the -- under the law in Connecticut right now?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3126.762" stopTime="3130.764">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Well, there is no a specific provision that covers any particular case, Your Honor.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3130.764" stopTime="3138.451">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, there’s nothing in the law that says once he loses his citizenship, he loses his right to practice law?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3138.451" stopTime="3208.182">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Well, I assume that that could be considered without any specific reference thereto. 
    Just the -- then you get into the international question or the federal question of citizen -- may I just call attention to this Court, to the fact that in this particular case, there was question raised at the committee hearings as to whether or not there was any treaty existing between the Netherlands and the United States. 
    And the applicant said that there was no treaty concerning reciprocal rights of either national to practice in the state or country of the other. 
    But actually at that very time, there was a treaty between – and is a treaty between the Netherlands and the United States which in declaring the national treatment of the nationals of either country, specifically excluded by by the protocol of that treaty, the professions.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3208.182" stopTime="3209.714">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    In those treaties?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3209.714" stopTime="3214.311">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    It was after 1956.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3214.311" stopTime="3221.437">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    While I have interrupted you Mr. Tiernan, let me ask you one other question which really isn’t here on case but it still bothers me?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3221.437" stopTime="3222.163">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Yes.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3222.163" stopTime="3238.462">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Am I correct in my understanding that Connecticut in addition to requiring citizenship for attorneys and physicians also requires it for funeral directors, and embalmers, and hairdressers, and barbers, and sanitarian?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3238.462" stopTime="3248.694">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Yes, that’s what’s listed in the original Court decision of the Supreme Court as a reference of the appendix.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3248.694" stopTime="3251.333">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Is it a fact that this State does this?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3251.333" stopTime="3255.487">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    There is to the statute so -- still there. 
    Did you include barber sir?
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3255.487" stopTime="3257.715">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I did.
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3257.715" stopTime="3263.387">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    That is becoming moot in Connecticut, but that is a fact that those statutes are still there.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3263.387" stopTime="3267.042">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because there are no barbers?[Laughter]
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3267.042" stopTime="3320.397">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    You see I come from New Haven, Justice White and the demand is, bless me.[Laughter] 
    The -- now, with reference to the (Inaudible) the question of dual citizenship of course raises a problem. 
    This has been reiterated in the Courts of this -- in this Court -- in the decisions of this Court and it’s impossible in the case of lawyers to imagine that a person with dual nationality, dual citizenship, dual allegiance, would be able to fulfill the task that that person has in reference to the practice of law.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3320.397" stopTime="3324.560">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    How is dual citizenship involved here?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3324.560" stopTime="3332.432">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Well, it isn’t because of course this applicant wants it this way, being a citizen of the Netherlands --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3332.432" stopTime="3335.596">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But I don’t -- she doesn’t claim dual citizenship in any?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3335.596" stopTime="3336.242">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    No.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3336.242" stopTime="3338.294">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, how is it in this case?
speaker="george_tiernan" startTime="3338.294" stopTime="3400.230">
    Mr. George Tiernan 
    Well, she’s getting around that. 
    She’s going to have both options. 
    She’s going to be a citizen of the Netherlands, a country of origin and the right to practice law in Connecticut and if that’s isn't having it both ways, I can imagine what is. 
    The fact is that also referred to here in this situation is the case of Schware, the case to which -- it’s about the only case that set down to test of what is necessary for the admission standards reasonableness was required and its felt that here that the rule in Connecticut is reasonable and rational with reference to the admission of any candidate for the Bar of Connecticut.
