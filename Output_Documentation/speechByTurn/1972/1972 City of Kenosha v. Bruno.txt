City of Kenosha v. Bruno
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="9.226">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Dalton you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="9.226" stopTime="235.080">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from the three-judge District Court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. 
    This case involves the liquor licenses of three bars in the City of Racine and six bars in the City of Kenosha. 
    Kenosha is a city of about 70,000 or more on the border of Wisconsin and Illinois, just north of Chicago. 
    Racine is the city of about 90,000 to 95,000 just a few miles north of Kenosha. 
    This appeal is from a judgment holding that Wisconsin’s statutes which permit legislative hearings in liquor license renewals and original granting are in violation of a due process clause. 
    The Court said that insofar as those statutes permit the denial of the renewal of licenses, granting of licenses without a judicial type hearing, the statutes violate the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The judgment is so broad against these two cities that when the licensing year which is approaching arrives, these cities are enjoined from denying any renewals. 
    A motion is pending before the three-judge Court to modify that, but is un-acted upon. 
    I would like to take the Court back through our liquor licensing regulations in Wisconsin. 
    We have what may be compared to the old town meeting type of legislation. 
    Since the Twenty-first Amendment, we permit what we call local option. 
    That means that each of the over 7,000 local municipalities in Wisconsin have the authority to grant or not to grant licenses for the sale of beer or intoxicating liquor or both. 
    This is a legislative grant to these municipalities and at the present time about a 150 municipalities do not permit the total package. 
    There are some that permit beer, of course, the majority permit beer and liquor but there are some that permit neither. 
    Now, these cities, towns and villages are the ultimate authority in our state to determine whether or not beer and intoxicating liquor would be served within their borders.

    The option is exercised by the voters?

    Either the voters or the governing body.

    It can be revoked, but then there has to be what amounts to an adjudicatory-type hearing. 
    There is a special statute applying to revocation of the license or suspending of it during the period of its life.

    Is there a judicial review?

    There is by certiorari.

    On a revocation.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="348.710" stopTime="373.883">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Yes. 
    We just went through one of those in the town of Madison, what surrounds the city of Madison where we had another nude bar and before they could get away, by going to the State Court for certiorari, they went into the Federal Court, and the Federal Court enjoined the town from revoking.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="373.883" stopTime="375.749">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Got to the revocation?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="375.749" stopTime="376.897">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="376.897" stopTime="378.722">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the Federal Court enjoined it?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="378.722" stopTime="474.572">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    These annual licenses must be applied for by April 15 each year. 
    The statute sets out a procedure that each of the municipalities must follow as to time. 
    They must begin to act on the licenses, May 15 and they must make final determinations by June 15. 
    This gives a leeway of at least two weeks between the time of the final determination by the municipality, and the succeeding licensing year. 
    During this period of time, the aggrieved parties of course, can avail themselves of one of two court proceedings in the state. 
    Now, no liquor license can be issued in Wisconsin unless the applicant has first obtained a beer license. 
    The beer license if it is denied, if the application is denied, can be reviewed by a procedure in any Court of record in the county. 
    This is an original action brought by the applicant to test the revocation or denial of a license in the county court or circuit court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="474.572" stopTime="478.647">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that under review de novo or a trial de novo?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="478.647" stopTime="479.393">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Trail de novo.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="479.393" stopTime="480.825">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Not to just review on any records?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="480.825" stopTime="512.061">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    No it's a trial de novo and there are limits set by the Wisconsin's statute as to when the Court must act so that any aggrieved parties can have a prompt determination of the issues. 
    The other type of Court review is by certiorari and I think the court has without any question set out the procedures that are to be followed in that type of proceedings.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="512.061" stopTime="516.852">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That is discretionary with the writ or is that --

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    The writ of certiorari is discretionary.

    And in what court does that goes?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="523.246" stopTime="536.208">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    That's in the Circuit Court, that is the Court of general jurisdiction within the state.

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    That's a review including all constitutional questions.

    There is no record, isn't it?

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Yes, there are the notes that are made in court in review.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But there is no transcript?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="554.729" stopTime="586.712">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    There is no transcript of testimony, no verbatim transcript, but if there is a denial, of course, the statute requires a statement of the reasons for denial be made in the record and all of the notes of the licensing body in the case of the City Council that are subsequently printed and they are part of the record in this case would go to the Circuit Court for review.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="586.712" stopTime="593.008">

    Does there has to be some reason for (Inaudible) renew a license?

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    The reasons should be stated according to our statute whenever renewal is refused, renewal.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's on renewal.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="602.781" stopTime="604.929">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    But not for original application.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="604.929" stopTime="613.185">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    For original application, they just deny it, but on renewal there has to be a determination of some kind -- some kind of conduct?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="613.185" stopTime="627.120">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Yes and our Supreme Court has indicated that, that is to facilitate the certiorari so that the Court can determine whether or not any action taken was arbitrary or capricious.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="627.120" stopTime="629.814">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, it is different than an original application.

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton

    But that is after the hearing?

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    That's after the City Council has acted.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="679.383" stopTime="685.239">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, what does the applicant have before the City Council acts?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="685.239" stopTime="710.470">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    He files an application each year. 
    He files an application with the City Council and by our law he must pay for having that printed in the local paper. 
    The burden is always on the applicant to carry forward his request to the governing body to license him for a one-year period. 
    On renewal it's the same as the original but --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="710.470" stopTime="714.993">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Maybe I am using the word hearing wrong, but does he get a hearing?

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Well, this is a difficult term. 
    Hearing is I think it depends on what situation you are in. 
    Now, we have run up repeatedly in the Federal Court system where --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="727.925" stopTime="729.849">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But do you know what notice means?

    Yes.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="730.442" stopTime="733.018">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Does he get a notice?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="733.018" stopTime="735.026">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    A notice of what, Your Honor?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="735.026" stopTime="741.393">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Of why there is a possibility that it will not be renewed?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="741.393" stopTime="773.000">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    He understands, each year when he applies that there will be hearings on all licenses that have been filed, that the applications have been filed for on 15th of April. 
    He knows, he should know that each one of these Boards and Committees will have to act upon these licenses between May 15 and June 15. 
    The notice, I think what you are talking about is when the licensing body is going to hear these requests for license.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="773.000" stopTime="774.718">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    His request.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="774.718" stopTime="797.424">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Well, all of them. 
    They usually set license matters for hearing on a certain date and there are requirements that -- within the city law that they hold license hearings on specific dates and that notice is posted on the City Council bulletin board and it is printed in the newspaper.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="797.424" stopTime="801.279">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And does he know whether or not there is going to be opposition?

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Not necessarily.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="803.219" stopTime="806.607">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You mean a law.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="806.607" stopTime="807.770">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    It is very possible.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="807.770" stopTime="812.761">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And the people testify against him?

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Well, they testify, yes if they want to.

    Under oath.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="816.272" stopTime="876.392">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    No, unless he asks and makes a motion. 
    The City Council is an administrative body. 
    It acts in a legislative capacity. It acts on quasi-judicial capacity. 
    Sometimes it acts in administrative capacity. 
    It has the power to do many things, but the liquor licensing function is not what we consider to be a contested matter. 
    The man comes in and applies and he has the burden of convincing the licensing body that he should have a license for the succeeding year. 
    Now, he has the burden from the beginning of convincing that legislative body and I want to emphasize that at that point, the City Council is not sitting as a quasi-judicial body. 
    It's sitting as a legislative body. 
    It has been delegated the authority by the state legislative body, the state legislature.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="876.392" stopTime="883.014">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    The only one practice, Your Honor is the hearing that's granted is legislative type hearing.

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    If he asks for it, but I am not ruling out that if he asks for a fact-finding hearing before the Board that he wouldn't be entitled to it.

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    He can convince the Court that he should continue during the litigation, the Court could, the same as the lower did here, grant a temporary restraining order.

    There are nine of these and Your Honor, I must say that I understand that three of them are on a business but they have been protected by the Federal Court for almost two-and-a-half years by different orders allowing them to continue nude dancing and the selling of alcohol.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="993.840" stopTime="1037.387">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But anyway if he went through judicial review there would have to be some finding of some kind of conduct dis-entitling him to renewal in order to sustain the refusal. 
    As I understood a while ago that on renewal as distinguished from original applications that there must be some finding of some conduct dis-entitling him to renewal by a Court in order to sustain the --

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Alright.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="1049.243" stopTime="1057.250">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Right.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="1059.489" stopTime="1063.925">

    By the Court.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="1064.495" stopTime="1071.866">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But now the district, in order to affirm the refusal to renew the Court is going asked to define or is going to have to agree with the City Council with respect to this alleged conduct?

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    If you are talking about the 66.054, our Supreme Court has not yet interpreted the breadth of that provision. 
    Apparently, no one has ever really carried a case under that statute all the way through. 
    They usually use the certiorari provision and there our Supreme Court has said that they are limited to a review of arbitrary, capricious action.

    Well now, that connection Mr. Dalton and I am looking at the record here page 44, I do not know which of the cases I see three of them and there appears there a report of the Committee on Licensing &amp; Welfare with the recitation in five paragraphs of the reasons why the license was not renewed, and then that was followed by a later report which speaks of the alleged of violence and threats of violence and feuding between the management of the Pussycat and the whatever the other one is. 
    Now, this goes up on certiorari to your circuit court. 
    Now, is the review on -- is that the record which is reviewed that we're looking that these two --

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    That was the report of this Committee. 
    The Committee reports to the Council and then the Council acts based upon --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    How does the applicant seeking a renewal get any fact determination? 
    I thought you suggested to Mr. Justice White that if his allegations set up a fact issue he can get a fact determination in certiorari in the Circuit Court, can he?

    Section 66.054 applies to the beer license. 
    You can't have a liquor license unless you first have a beer license. 
    Now, this statute which has not been really interpreted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court as to its breadth says that if the Council revokes or does not grant a license for good cause then a regular Court proceeding may be held to determine whether or not there was good cause.

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    That's the applicants choice as to whether he wants to move by this route or by a certiorari.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1280.302" stopTime="1281.004">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Can he move this way --

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    If he has factual, excuse me, if he has factual issues which he wishes to be determined, let's take for instance in this case. 
    Let's say that an applicant said, well, you told me that I was permitting nude dancing and you wouldn't renew my license because of that and I wasn't permitting nude dancing and he wants a factual determination of that. 
    Now I suggest that he can either ask the council and this basically is not required under the statute, nor Supreme Court said it was necessary, but I am saying that he could ask the council for a hearing on that point and could ask to bring in his own Court reporters and to have testimony taken. 
    The council is perfectly capable under rules of Administrative law of setting its all --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1331.964" stopTime="1336.570">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now he doesn't have to do that and so he doesn't do it then what may he do.

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Either way in which he gets a fact-finding as I understand it, is that if he follows the de novo route.

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    There is one exception, the certiorari court could weigh evidence and determine whether or not there is substantial evidence.

    I see, a when it comes up renew he is turned down, the council alleging that he has done and finding if he has done A and B.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, under the law the committee itself could have acted with out reference to the council as I read in the statute and that's what the complaint of your brothers on the other side, they did not even know which body was going to act, whether it was going to be the committee or the council as a whole.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="1614.405" stopTime="1617.760">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Well, the council as a whole made the final determination.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1617.760" stopTime="1633.827">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that's not what the law seems to say. 
    It says, all town and the village boards and county councils or the duly authorized Committees of such councils and so on a point made in the --
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="1633.827" stopTime="1636.066">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    But these cases they were all referred to the city council.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1636.066" stopTime="1637.124">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They were in fact in these cases to find out.
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="1637.124" stopTime="1791.503">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    They were in fact referred to city council and they adapted the reports of the Committee. 
    Now, the Committee reports are in fact the basis for the legislative action. 
    The reasons why the legislative body decided that they would resolve not to have nude dancing within their municipality. 
    Now, it's true that this record is not specifically set out that resolution. 
    And I think that, that is a not a federal constitutional question. 
    That's a question of state law as to whether or not the city council in these cases actually followed the state law when they adapted the resolution that they would not license nude bars within their communities. 
    Now, to give you a little more background on what happened, the two cities when faced during the 1970 license year with nude dancing in several bars and after receiving over two thousand petitions in the city of Kenosha and upward of 25,000 in the city of Racine, the councils in both cities passed ordinances which regulated costumes in cabarets. 
    This required the dancers to cover the sexual organs. 
    Both cities were enjoined by the Federal District Court in December of 1970. 
    From that point until the next licensing year in 1971, the city which -- both these cities were faced with a dilemma of how to control nude dancing in the bars in those cities. 
    The test of obscenity was difficult. 
    The county prosecutor --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1791.503" stopTime="1798.202">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have to spend much time on that view with the holding in the rule, isn't this basically a procedural problem now?
speaker="leroy_l_dalton" startTime="1798.202" stopTime="1862.184">
    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Yes, the rule we think solves that and I want to point out that after the rule, the District Court released the injunctions that had permitted the nude dancing to take place in these two cities, but while this injunction was in effect, the city decided that they would not re-license these bars and they sat as a legislative body in doing this. 
    They did not sit and adjudicate each one of these cases. 
    They decided that they would not permit nude dancing in their cities and each one of these bars in each city, the bars were treated as a group and they made a policy statement and I agree that the Committee report here probably does not satisfy the Wisconsin statute in regard to the reasons why the denials were made, but that is not a Federal constitutional question.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1862.184" stopTime="1895.714">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I submit to you that at the bottom of your page 32 that you referred to us, paragraph number 26, and on the opposite page, at the bottom page 33, paragraph 32 both ascribe that direct and indirectly as reasons for not finding the renewal in the Committee reports and if the Committee reports were adapted by the legislative body that would be quite adequate statement of reasons to satisfy me as to why they had failed to renew.

    The legislative resolution is why these licenses were denied. 
    They all were featuring nude dancing. 
    Both these communities that decided that they would not permit nude dancing anymore and the reasons why they would not permit nude dancing were the item set out in the Committee report.

    Mr. Leroy L. Dalton 
    Our Supreme Court has so held.

   Argument of James A. Walrath

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    May it please the Court. 
    I would like to begin by responding to some of the points that have risen during the course of Mr. Dalton’s argument. 
    First of all, the argument is made that these two municipalities have been enjoined under all circumstances from denying when a -- license renewals that they have been foreclosed from in any way taking these licenses away from the individual appellees in this case. 
    I would submit that that is not a correct statement of the situation and I would refer the Court specifically to page 55 of the Appendix which contains a statement of the summary judgment order of the District Court which indicates that the municipalities are free to act on the applications at such time that their actions are commensurate with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    So, the municipalities are not foreclosed from considering these applications or denying them, should they follow the procedures which were outlined by the three-judge Court below.

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Our position is, Your Honor, that they could not and that was the next point I want to raise.

    First of all, Your Honor, as far as the liquor licenses are concerned, when a liquor license application is not renewed, the remedy, exclusive remedy, as I understand it under Wisconsin law is by certiorari and --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2128.401" stopTime="2133.913">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In which event, no evidentiary hearing, all on records, reasons and notes?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2133.913" stopTime="2152.395">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Yes, all on handwritten notes or typed notes by city clerks, whatever is there. 
    In the present situation there was very little of any sort of record as far as what statements were made at the hearings.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2152.395" stopTime="2156.567">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That isn't our question here, whether it was arbitrary?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2156.567" stopTime="2160.663">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    But there definitely is no entitlement to a trial de novo, excuse me. 
    I am sorry.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2160.663" stopTime="2164.679">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    On certiorari, the judge could not give a hearing?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2164.679" stopTime="2184.905">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    That is correct. 
    On certiorari, the only thing that the reviewing Court can do is look at the return which is filed with it by the municipality. 
    That return would, in most instances, merely contain the notes from the clerk of the municipality which would state under, as required by state statute, the reasons why --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2184.905" stopTime="2186.530">

    It would, it contain statement of reasons, yes.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    This is in the Federal Court. 
    Is this what a return would like?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2206.468" stopTime="2211.121">

    And --

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    If this document was in fact adapted by the City Council as its reason for denying the license.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2216.813" stopTime="2220.422">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And in addition then there would be what, notes you said?

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Possible notes, if they had been taken.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2222.607" stopTime="2233.322">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if the City Council gives no reason at all, is it automatically arbitrary to deny renewal?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2233.322" stopTime="2235.879">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    I would submit yes under State law, if there is a reason.

    There must be a reason for denying renewal?

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Yes, by state statute.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2240.595" stopTime="2249.177">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And so the arbitrariness of denying renewal simply turns on whether it states a reason or not?

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Well, our claim here, Your Honor, is not all -- is more than that. 
    We are claiming that the procedures were arbitrary because prior to the council’s taking the action that they did, they did not grant each of the appellees a hearing.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2264.672" stopTime="2266.329">
    Justice Byron R. White

    I understand --

    Mr. James A. Walrath

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2269.641" stopTime="2284.286">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But I would suppose that there would be a different case if you had a right to a complete de novo hearing on review of the renewal where you could call witnesses and statement had to call it?

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You would have gone to State Court and let me understand this clearly now.

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    In each instance, I do not believe there is an indication in the record as to whether in each instance, their beer license is worth denial. 
    I would have to rely on the representations of state in that regard that they were.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2338.511" stopTime="2349.775">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Well, that is the argument on the state, Your Honor, but I would submit that that does not comport with a reading of the state statute which provides for renewal of or which provides for procedures on beer licenses, Section 66054 sub 14 --

    Page 4 of the brief of the appellants. 
    That provision starting at the very bottom of page 4 mentions that the action of any City Council in granting or the revocation of any license or the failure of said City Council to revoke any license for good cause may be reviewed by any court of record.

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Well, our point, Your Honor, is that there is no express declaration in this statute to cover the situation where renewal is denied. 
    We are not in a revocation situation. 
    We are in a denial of renewal situation which is not covered by the stature.

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Not in the way that we have just gone through it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2555.174" stopTime="2591.664">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Walrath, I appreciate you hardly a chance to get the first sentence out of here, the arguments you intended to make. 
    So I apologize for interrupting you again but I have a basic question here which is this, the Due Process Clause of course, covers deprivations of life, liberty or property and those alone, I wondered and obviously license isn't involved here and I wonder now how you define what, if any, liberty and/or property is involved.
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2591.664" stopTime="2622.450">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Your Honor, if I may, the situation is this that the -- first of all, we submit that both liberty and property interests under the definition or the analysis provided in Board of Regents versus Roth, both concepts of liberty and property were involved in this situation. 
    Both the liberty of these tavern keepers and the property of this tavern keepers was impaired by the decisions not to renew their liquor licenses.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2622.450" stopTime="2628.419">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, these are a one-year licenses by their terms and under state law that's what they were and that is all they could be?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2628.419" stopTime="2629.593">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2629.593" stopTime="2632.291">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that is right, so that's very much like a --
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2632.291" stopTime="2633.573">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    It is similar to Roth.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2633.573" stopTime="2636.399">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And like Mr. Roth, a teaching contract.
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2636.399" stopTime="2640.049">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    But there are some very significant differences from the Roth situations.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2640.049" stopTime="2640.922">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2640.922" stopTime="2695.627">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Now, the first significant difference is that in Roth, the action taken with regard to Roth was not -- the reasons for not renewing Roth’s teaching contract were never stated, were not required to be stated, were never made public. 
    In other words, Roth was not one of the significant factors in the Roth case, I would submit is that Roth was never faced with a situation where the reasons for his non renewing his contract or communicated to anyone and if those reasons had been one reasons which alleged dishonesty on his part or immorality in his affairs and they had been communicated to public, this Court said that his case quite clearly would have been a different way. 
    And I would submit, Your Honor, that the situation is very analogous in our own case in that, by statute --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2695.627" stopTime="2701.239">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The Court indicated he would then have been given an opportunity to clear his name if the charges were false?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2701.239" stopTime="2701.589">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    That is correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2701.589" stopTime="2707.948">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I didn't understand there was any claim here that this kind of dancing did not warrant in these bars?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2707.948" stopTime="2820.071">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    No, but that is not the central point. 
    The municipalities did not say that they were denying the renewal of these licenses because of nude dancing. 
    They said and I want to be very specific first of all, and refer it to the appropriate parts of the record, first of all, the municipality of Racine, you will know it on pages 35 and 36 of the Appendix, there are the reasons which the municipality of Racine or at least the License Committee gave for recommending that the license is not to be renewed. 
    Now that -- those statements make no reference whatsoever to nude dancing. 
    They do attribute to the tavern keepers' conduct or operations which foster an increase in prostitution and venereal disease. 
    They also attribute as reason F, they attribute instances of serving minors on the premises. 
    They attribute matters of fights or altercations and violence on their premises. 
    None of these reasons are directly related or in any way stated by the municipalities to involve nude dancing. 
    As far as the municipality of Kenosha is concerned, the statement of reasons in that situation with regard to the six Kenosha tavern keepers may be found on page 7 of our red covered brief. 
    And again, there is -- nowhere in this record is there simply an assertion by these municipalities that they are not renewing these licenses merely because they do not like nude dancing. 
    What they did --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2820.071" stopTime="2828.862">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I am perplexed about this criminal complaint on page 69 as they give on the record.

    Both of these complaints I would stress relate to matters which occurred long after or after any of these license renewal denials occurred. 
    In other words, the facts that are stated in those complaints are not -- and the filing of those complaints are not relevant to the reasons.

    They are irrelevant on the question of nude dancing?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="2931.442" stopTime="2999.305">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    No, they were irrelevant on the question of what was before the Licensing Committee and the City Council at the time it reached this decision. 
    The one other point that came up on direct argument is the statement of reasons why the Kenosha municipality, why it denied the liquor licenses, those reasons that you find on page 7 of our brief were adapted at a City Council meeting word per word. 
    In other words, the License Committee entered these findings and then made these findings a recommendation to the City Council. 
    The City Council adapted them, word for word, with regard to each of the six applicants. 
    In other words, word for word, there were no variations in finding of facts. 
    The same activities were ascribed to each of the applicants in a rather indiscriminate broad fashion. 
    Now to the question --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2999.305" stopTime="3012.691">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you think that is a nature of the legislative licensing process sometimes. 
    You take a category of people and they say they are not going to be in or they will be in?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="3012.691" stopTime="3052.743">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Yes Your Honor, I would submit that in a legislative type situation where you are as in LaRue instance where you are dealing with legislative findings in enacting a resolution or an ordinance or state statute, these kinds of statements are appropriate, but here we were dealing with a definite adjudicatory situation where the City Council or the Licensing Committee itself was passing on -- as required by the statute, was passing on the question of whether these individuals were proper individuals to have their licenses renewed. 
    So, I think we are in an adjudicatory situation which requires more specific findings of fact.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3052.743" stopTime="3068.449">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is it you argument -- did you contend that in any way there was a common law kind of a property right or expectancy to a renewal each year?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="3068.449" stopTime="3138.997">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Yes Your Honor and that's an argument that we did not make sufficiently I would submit in our brief. 
    That is the Perry versus Sindermann rationale that -- I would submit there was -- there is clear evidence that there is an implied property interest in -- or claim to having your liquor license renewed from year-to-year. 
    First of all, I think it is implied by the very fact that the state statutes require that licenses can only be renewed, if reasons are -- are not renewed, excuse me, can only be denied if there are reasons given by the municipality. 
    Secondly, the record also indicates that there were some 154 to 159, I believe, applications to renew licenses before the municipality and in only six situations, the six appellees in this case, were those applications denied. 
    So, there is more or less I would submit a common law situation or an implied situation that licenses will be renewed unless the cause is shown by the municipality.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3138.997" stopTime="3141.857">

    No, it did not.

    So, the District Court rather relied on the Court of Appeals' opinion in the Roth case which was subsequently reversed here, correct?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="3150.781" stopTime="3156.395">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Yes, the three-judge court below did not have the benefit of Perry versus Sindermann or Roth with Board of Regents versus Roth.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You have the then benefit of -- you had the then benefit of a case that was subsequently reversed. 
    They are all (Inaudible) in Court of Appeals?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="3165.176" stopTime="3298.950">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    Yes, but we think quite clearly even in light of Roth which does restrict concepts or at least define concepts of liberty and property more carefully that quite clearly, these individuals, their liberty and property interests were affected. 
    Going back to the definition of liberty under the Roth decision, I would submit that it should also be borne in mind that because these individuals and the accusations against them consisted of allegations of criminal tight conduct, immoral influence on minors and juveniles in the community, quite clearly this brings this case within the language of Roth that these are the types of allegations which affect a person’s liberty. 
    And more importantly, these are the types of allegations which attribute bad moral character to the license holders and by state statute once again, a critical eligibility factor for getting a license is that you must be a person of good moral character. 
    I would submit that the allegations therefore, are in effect, makes these license holders ineligible for renewal or ineligible to hold a license anywhere else in the state of Wisconsin because they have been branded as persons of bad moral character. 
    So, that's the other aspect of liberty which we would submit has been affected. 
    Just because these tavern keepers who run legitimate businesses as tavern keepers choose to have burlesque type entertainment or topless or nude dancing on their premises does not necessarily imply that they, in any way, have permitted a prostitution on their premises or that they have permitted minors on their premises and have imposed immoral influences on juveniles. 
    And these were the allegations that were labeled against them and these are the allegations which, under Roth, they should have a right to answer and counter. 
    Now I hope the record is sufficiently clear under what --

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    The former and not the latter. 
    They are entitled to a hearing to dispute or challenge these allegations. 
    If the allegations of prostitution or immoral influence on youths had been established at the hearing, then I think quite clearly it's within under state statute, it's within the power of the municipalities to deny their applications.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    When you responded previously to the question I put to you, I am not sure which case you were referring to, but turning to paragraph number 26 on page 32 of the Appendix, in the stipulation of facts, they have stipulated a fact, parties have stipulated a fact which under the LaRue would mean non-renewal of the license. 
    Now, do you--?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="3464.491" stopTime="3474.769">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    I don't dispute that except for the fact that the municipalities in this case didn't say that they were denying the applications because of that fact in paragraph 26.

    The statement at paragraph 32 was something that happened in Federal Court and it is a statement that was not made at the time that the licenses were renewed or denied, excuse me, that the renewal applications were denied.

    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    I think the purpose of paragraph 26 was merely to get an agreed stipulation of facts that in fact we do not dispute the fact that nude dancing occurred on these premises. 
    That is not a disputed fact. 
    What is disputed is whether there was prostitution on the premises.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In your view of the due process question, if the case went back to the state, went back to the District Court, would the stipulation paragraph 26 be sufficient if they put that and only that in evidence of the reason for non-renewal? 
    Because the City Council, they have noticed, went through all its processes and then put the stipulation in evidence, would the paragraph 26 be sufficient then in your view for the denial of the renewal?
speaker="james_a_walrath" startTime="3805.798" stopTime="3849.091">
    Mr. James A. Walrath 
    If that is the only allegation that the city raises, I think that would be an adequate basis for non-renewal. 
    Under LaRue, the city admittedly does have an ordinance on the books which defines what type of dress is required on tavern premises. 
    I should add, however, that the city ordinance is not identical to LaRue statute and in fact, it is our position that the city ordinance is even broader and more restrictive than LaRue statute so that, that would be an additional issue that might be raised at a hearing before the City Council.
