    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1428, Hensley against the Municipal Court. 
    Mr. Bass, you may proceed.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="33.498" stopTime="160.341">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which affirmed the dismissal of a petition for writ of habeas corpus. 
    The District Court in dismissing the petition did not reach any substantive issues but denied the petition on the sole ground that the petitioner being enlarged on his own recognizance by the state trial Judge pending the outcome the federal habeas proceeding was not “in custody” for purposes of the federal habeas statute. 
    The issue presented is whether or not a federal habeas Judge is without power to entertain a petition for the writ until the state criminal defendant who is sentenced to imprisonment surrenders into jail. 
    Whether the defendant has exhausted his available state court remedies and has been permitted by the very judge who imposed the sentence to remain at large, pending the outcome of the federal habeas proceeding. 
    The background facts will be briefly as follows. 
    The petitioner Hensley is a chief presiding officer of the Universal Life Church which has awarded honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees. 
    He was charged of violating a California misdemeanor provision which prohibited the awarding of degrees which signify academic accomplishment without meeting accreditation requirements. 
    The trial was held on May 19, 1969. 
    At the close of the State’s case, the defendant moved to dismiss. 
    The court held that it lacks jurisdiction in the State all throughout the proceedings. 
    Subsequently, the State moved to reopen the case. 
    Mr. Bienvenu, the defendant’s counsel at that time declined to appear at the reopening. 
    He advised the prosecutor that neither he nor Hensley would appear. 
    However, the traverse in this case states that Hensley was never advised by Mr. Bienvenu that he had to appear or that his failure to appear would result in conviction. 
    On the contrary, he says, he was advised that the trial was dismissed and that he did not appear further.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that still relevant to us?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="163.147" stopTime="261.474">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    That may be relevant in so far as we deal with his status on release on recognizance or whether or not there’s been a deliberate bypass. 
    I think it may not be relevant, however, it’s offered in case questions do arise with respect to that but the Court held in defendant’s absence that the Court had jurisdiction and it found the defendant guilty in absentia. 
    And on July 1, 1969, one year imprisonment was imposed plus a $625 fine and costs. 
    And at that time, the state trial judge granted a stay and allowed the defendant to remain on his own recognizance of pending appeal. 
    Subsequently, the conviction was affirmed and state trial judge permitted Hensley to remain on O.R. pending the exhaustion of state post conviction remedies which were habeas corpus in the District Court of Appeal and in the California Supreme Court. 
    Then on June 16, 1970, Hensley filed his federal habeas. 
    On the same day, the State trial judge granted a stay, an additional stay. 
    Permitting him to remain at large, pending the determination of the federal habeas corpus application. 
    Federal habeas corpus judge found that or ruled that Hensley was not in custody because he was on recognizance and he denied the petition. 
    However, he granted a certificate of probable cause and the Court of Appeals affirmed, rehearing was denied. 
    A timely petition for cert. was filed and this Court granted cert.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Bass, as the practical matter, is this about the only factual situation in which this -- in which the federal habeas petitioner will have exhausted state remedies and still be free on his own recognizance? 
    I would think during the course of his appeal on state courts, for example, he can’t get federal habeas because he hasn’t exhausted his state remedies and that it might be a fairly limited situation in which this type of thing would occur?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="291.899" stopTime="343.039">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, we don’t get into the question as to whether or not the state remedies are so ineffective as to check the rights of the petitioner that we have a question under 2254. 
    Here, since Hensley was permitted to remain at large by the state trial judge, he exhausted all of his state remedies without the problem of his having to surrender and his sentence running and the question of possibly becoming moot. 
    Here, the issue was preserved because at all times, he was permitted to remain on his recognizance by the state trial judge. 
    The important factor to note is that the state trial judge who permitted Hensley to remain on his recognizance may well have felt that Hensley’s failure to appear in trial was not intentional and would have a bearing at such time as the Federal Court reaches the question of deliberate bypass. 
    But it would appear that by releasing --

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    The opinion of the state court is not in the record. 
    The point here is that the record needs to be developed before the judge can make a finding that there’s been an intentional relinquishment of federal constitutional right. 
    One cannot conclude there’s a bypass on this record.

    Fourteenth Amendment due process and that he was sentenced, that he was convicted in absentia. 
    And he’s also arguing that he was engaged in constitutionally protected activity.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    That was due to a combination of factors. 
    Part of which was the alleged inadvertence or incompetence of counsel in not telling Hensley that he had to appear, otherwise, he would lose his opportunity to make defense.

    That was denied. 
    He then filed habeas in the District Court of Appeal in California and that was denied. 
    He then filed an original habeas in the California Supreme Court and that was denied.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    The first issue, I would think that the federal habeas judge would entertain is the question of deliberate bypass as to whether or not the petitioner Hensley intentionally relinquished his opportunity to appear and to raise any defense and Fourteenth Amendment due process. 
    It would appear that the First Amendment issue might not be reached until the Fourteenth Amendment question as to whether or not Hensley deliberately absented himself from the state trial court would be resolved.

    Why wasn’t he incarcerated when his appeal was affirmed?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="656.970" stopTime="665.147">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Because the state trial judge continually granted stays, keeping Mr. Hensley on recognizance [Voice Overlap].

    Unknown Speaker 
    While the habeas petitions were pending on state and federal?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="667.964" stopTime="693.589">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    The state trial judge granted a state pending appeal. 
    He granted another state pending -- state habeas applications. 
    He granted another stay pending, a federal habeas corpus. 
    And after the federal habeas was denied, he granted a stay for about two weeks at which one Mr. Justice Black granted an eight-day stay. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas granted a two-week stay and then a stay pending an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was granted.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="693.589" stopTime="696.712">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And he’s been very generously treated, hasn’t he?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="696.712" stopTime="849.460">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Except for the fact that he’s going to serve one year in jail if he does not get federal habeas corpus relief. 
    The basis of our argument is that term in custody used by Congress relates to the class of cases not the timing as to when the petition must be filed. 
    The state’s argument here is not based upon any legitimate needs of federal judicial administration. 
    It’s not based upon any law enforcement needs but is based strictly upon an outmoded conceptual definition. 
    In this case, if the habeas petition is not permitted to be filed while he’s on recognizance, he will file it when he’s in custody, there’ll be the same number of federal habeas petitions. 
    There will not be an increase in the federal case law. 
    Secondly, if he is not committed to file the habeas while he is on recognizance and must go into jail, there would be more pressure on the District Court to move more quickly, to hear the case. 
    Whereas if he’s on recognizance granted by the state trial judge, the Federal Court can hear the thing in a more leisurely fashioned. 
    As this Court pointed out in Peyton versus Rowe, it’s in everyone’s interest to hear the habeas corpus application. 
    It’s in the state’s interest. 
    It’s in the petitioner’s interest. 
    It’s in the Court’s interest. 
    In fact, it will cost the state money to incarcerate this person unnecessarily, perhaps. 
    If it turns out that the federal rights are involved, there will be irretrievably loss. 
    There’s absolutely no reason to commend the result urged by the state in this case. 
    In Peyton versus Rowe, this Court allowed the use of anticipatory attack upon a future sentence. 
    In Jones versus Cunningham, it was unnecessary to wait until parole was revoked before Jones could bring the habeas. 
    In Strait versus Laird, it was unnecessary to wait until the servicemen were reactivated before he could bring his conscientious objector application. 
    In this case, we deal not with the question of a District Court’s discretion but simply with the question of power. 
    There is no need here, for example, for the Federal Court to determine if bail should be granted because the state trial judge has already granted the stay while he exhausts the federal habeas. 
    This is the reverse situation of the case in the California Supreme Court called In re Smiley. 
    There, a Federal Court granted on recognizance release and the California Supreme Court said that they had jurisdiction to grant habeas relief. 
    They said, if they have the authority to release the person, there was no reason why it would be unreasonable for them to say they lack authority merely because someone else has done it for them.

    I’m not dealing with the situation of a person who’s already served the sentence and who just complains about the civil disabilities that come from conviction because this situation evolves the most graphic type of deprivation namely imprisonment. 
    And the Court need not reached the other question particularly the question raised in the United States ex rel.

    The Seventh Circuit said he was not in sufficient custody. 
    The problem was he had posted 10% under the Illinois statute which could have been set off against the fine, so he never would’ve done any time in jail. 
    There’s no anticipatory incarceration possible. 
    Whereas in this case, of course, that one year is staring him in the face, and if he doesn’t get relief from the federal habeas court, he will be in jail. 
    And of course, if he is in jail, everyday that he suffers in jail that may turn out to be unconstitutionally imposed. 
    That would be irretrievable. 
    He will never be able to get anything out of that.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that’s the faith of almost all habeas petitioners, isn’t it? 
    It’s almost fortuitous that the state court here happened to grant bail because ordinarily, a federal habeas court won’t grant bail pending its own decision as to whether the state conviction is valid.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, I don’t have that probability as this Court in Shuttlesworth did state that the Federal Court have a power to do that. 
    It is true that the in this case, the state court must have thought enough about the issues and perhaps Hensley’s non-dangerousness to allow him to remain on a recognizance for such a long period of time. 
    And whether he’s being considered a charitable or just what is legally necessary, the fact of the matter is that he has not been recalled. 
    He could be.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Yes, but the situation we deal with here is where a state judge has granted the stay. 
    Under such circumstances, we find that it would be no reason why the federal judge should deny or asked you power to hear when the very reason for the state court allowing the man to stay is so the federal judge can hear the petition without being presented with stay applications or other types of emergency request for immediate relief.

    Well, I don’t think Mr. Chief Justice that a state court is required under any consideration of supremacy or federalism to grant such a stay. 
    That would seem to be entirely a matter of discretion and if he decides not to grant the stay, then the petitioner would have to ask the District Court for that stay.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    No, Mr. Justice Powell, the order granted by the state court is a one-page order that simply says it’s order that the sentence given to the petitioners identified is hereby stayed pending determination of the petitioner’s writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California. 
    We would submit that in view of the fact that the state is asking Mr. Hensley to go through a meaningless ritual that Congress could not have intended in view of the fact that it serves no legitimate purpose. 
    It does not serve judicial administration. 
    It does not serve the state’s interest and it certainly doesn’t serve the petitioner’s interest to be incarcerated under such circumstances before he can file where in fact, we have imprisonment, a sentence of imprisonment involved here, under such circumstances, it is clear that the federal habeas court did have authority and that Mr. Hensley was in sufficient custody to be able to invoke the writ.

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The Court in its questions I think is struck upon the sole issue in this case as to whether or not an individual, who for whatever reason is not yet in custody, is a prisoner, can petition a Federal Court for habeas corpus. 
    The sections that are cited in my brief are very clear. 
    The preamble says that a prisoner may petition for habeas corpus when he is in custody and the Federal Constitution that goes on to set forth the other areas.

    Until such time as the execution of the sentence begins.

    But until such time --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1649.588" stopTime="1654.348">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall

speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="1675.223" stopTime="1678.815">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Well, at the request of the defendant, he could.

    He could?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="1679.263" stopTime="1693.701">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    I believe he could. 
    If the defendant requests that the court refrain from imposing sentence or for having that sentence executed, at the defendant’s request, the defendant had suffered no prejudice by the system but rather with his own --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1693.701" stopTime="1696.348">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I think it’s what you stated awhile ago?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="1696.348" stopTime="1772.105">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    No. 
    But here, we have a situation where the defendant was sentenced and the judge in the trial court granted a stay to permit the defendant the opportunity to refrain from going into custody until such time as his appeals have been terminated. 
    Mr. Stromer, the counsel who is representing the defendant at the time the federal habeas corpus petitions first filed, notified Judge Nelson the fact that he was in fact filing a petition with the Federal District Court in San Jose with Judge Peckham and Judge Nelson as a result of the request made by Mr. Stromer, delayed and stayed temporarily the execution of the sentence thereby continuing Mr. Hensley and his own recognizance. 
    Thereafter, the judges of this Court and the Ninth Circuit continued to stay the proceedings. 
    We are now almost at the fourth anniversary of the time the alleged offense took place. 
    Counsel in his statement indicates that the state has no legitimate interest whether or not the defendant goes into custody at this time or some future time. 
    And I would respectfully defer with that. 
    The state has a very substantial interest. 
    As any defendant has a right to a speedy trial, so to as the state have a right to a prompt an expeditious execution of sentence. 
    Otherwise, that the purpose of sentence doesn’t do anything.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1772.105" stopTime="1779.359">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But Mr. Lempert, the state could have vindicated that right here, couldn’t it through its own Municipal Court judges’ refusal to grant the stay?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="1779.359" stopTime="1825.222">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Only up till 1970, thereafter, it was the Federal Courts and the Justices of this Court and other courts of the Ninth Circuit that prevented the Municipal Court from acting. 
    And at this point in time, the defendant has been out of custody following in the imposition of sentence some three-and-a-half years. 
    It just does not seem appropriate. 
    The fact that the petitioned for writ habeas corpus initially was devised as a system, as a means to have a prompt in expeditious examination of a detention by a defendant, generally, before trial has been expanded by the legislature, by Congress to permit a means while after conviction when an individual is in custody, is a prisoner to have the courts examine that detention.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1825.222" stopTime="1845.211">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But Mr. Lempert, if Judge Nelson hadn’t granted this stay, is it fair to suggest that nonetheless before determination on the merits of the federal habeas petition either the District Court or a judge of the Ninth Circuit or a Justice of this Court would’ve enlarge the petitioner?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="1845.211" stopTime="2016.947">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Well, the -- that could’ve been done if the Federal Courts had wanted to do that, that is if the defendant had gone into custody, there is machinery whereby when a petitioner files a habeas corpus in Federal Court, he can be released by the Federal Courts. 
    But here, because of the -- Judge Nelson wanting to do the defendant a favor if you will, and Mr. Stromer continued temporarily or stayed temporarily until such time as there was a consideration of the habeas petition by the Federal District Court. 
    Thereafter, the matter was taken out of Judge Nelson’s hands by the subsequent stays that were issued by the Ninth Circuit and by this Court. 
    And it reverts back to the question as to whether or not this Court or the Federal Courts can exceed the authority that is granted to it by the legislature, by the statute authorizing the issuance of habeas corpus. 
    The statute is clear. 
    It relates to a prisoner and it relates to someone in custody. 
    Now, the Court has regularly defined or expanded on what is custody, what status someone has to be in, in order to be in custody. 
    In Jones, it indicated that a parolee is in custody because he can’t drive a car, he can’t work without the permission of the parole officer, he can’t go places or do things. 
    He is in custody. 
    Not necessarily with bars around him but nonetheless, restricted. 
    This defendant in this case, his whereabouts are totally unknown, at least as far as the people are concerned. 
    He can be sitting in this courtroom. 
    He can be out of the country. 
    He is operating his business and there is no restriction on any of his activities whatsoever, except one that with the lawful order of Court, he shall surrender back to the Court. 
    And that I don’t feel is the type of custody, the type of restraint, the type of interference that is such a magnitude that requires the invocation of the habeas corpus. 
    It doesn’t qualify for that custody that is required by federal habeas corpus. 
    One of the questions that was asked is under whose control is the defendant presently? 
    And that I think, similarly procedurally presents a very interesting question. 
    Counsel responded he is under the control of the Municipal Court. 
    The Municipal Court has no power over the defendant at this time. 
    It cannot lawfully order anything respecting the defendant because the Court is precluded from that by a stay granted within the federal system. 
    And the sheriff is under no -- has no control over the defendant. 
    He cannot volitionally go out and seize the defendant or arrest the defendant or do anything with respect to him. 
    The petition for habeas corpus is addressed to the sentencing Municipal Court. 
    And it is not properly any person or any entity that has the control over the defendant. 
    And I would submit that --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2016.947" stopTime="2026.152">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Suppose that you -- but the moment, within one minute theoretically, at least after this person out of penitentiary he could bring the same habeas corpus?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2026.152" stopTime="2035.939">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    That’s correct. 
    Once he goes into custody and once he is in custody, then the right accrues to file the petition for writ of habeas corpus.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2035.939" stopTime="2038.001">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And then could the District Court release him at that time?

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    If the District Court at that time wanted to exercise its discretion, yes it could. 
    But that presents the question that maybe a more desirable system, it may well be that it might, the system should have a procedure whereby someone who is in imminent danger of going into custody can have access to federal habeas corpus and if the Congress so desires, then they want to pass legislation which would permit that. 
    But under the present status of the law, the Congress has not gone so far and they still require in the legislation that the person be in custody.

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    I would think if the Court at this time, if the Municipal Court were to issue an order requiring the defendant to appear tomorrow, at its Court and the defendant chose not to appear that that would violate no law, that the defendant could not be prosecuted for that because the Court has no jurisdiction to issue such an order.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The federal -- if there was a federal jurisdiction, it was destroyed by the issuance of a stay by a federal judge?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2195.517" stopTime="2231.990">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    No. 
    I don’t think that necessarily follows. 
    There was no federal jurisdiction, I believe because the defendant was not in custody. 
    Notwithstanding that fact, the fact that the Federal Courts have stayed, the execution of sentence I don’t think affects one way or the other defendant’s custodial status. 
    I believe you indicated that if the defendant were ordered to appear and did not, would he then not be in custody? 
    Clearly not. 
    He would be somewhere, somewhere other than where he was supposed to be but not in anyone’s custody. He could not be restrained unless he was found and placed in custody.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2231.990" stopTime="2278.996">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But I believe that the Court has held that the parolee released from physical custody but under certain restraints is in custody for the purposes of the federal. 
    One of those typical restraints is a territorial jurisdiction. 
    Don’t leave the state or don’t leave the county or something like that. 
    Now, but the only sanction for that is you’ll be jumping bail if you -- or you’ll be violating your parole if you leave the county. 
    You might be committing a crime where your parole might be revoked. 
    If you’re under an obligation to show up at a certain time and you don’t show up, you certainly have some obligation that other people of the community don’t have.

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Yes.

speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2282.727" stopTime="2310.766">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Correct but that is not, I feel, the type of custody that requires the invocation of habeas corpus. 
    A parolee is an individual who is not only suffering from a single requirement or a single restriction on his daily existence. 
    As this Court has pointed out in Jones, suffering from a whole range of prohibitions with respect to job, family, his domicile, who he can associate with, where he can go and where he can’t go.

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Under counsel’s argument, I think it would be because if any individual is subjected to an order of Court, the violation for which would result in the possible incarceration of a person which if an individual willfully violates a proper subpoena or summon served upon him could be subjected to writ, a body attachment and be incarcerated. 
    And on the counsel’s argument, yes, that person would spontaneously get the right to file a petition for habeas corpus.

    For --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In that stage, wouldn’t we have been citing to all of these and he said, “No, wait a minute. 
    Before I give you the stay, let me push him in.”
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2398.342" stopTime="2401.290">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    That’s correct. 
    Had that occurred -- had Judge Nelson at that time --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2401.290" stopTime="2403.197">

    That’s correct. 
    Had there been a remittitur from the Supreme Court of the State of California, re-conferring jurisdiction on the Municipal Court and if at that time Judge Nelson had declined to grant the stay of execution of the sentence, the defendant would have been at that time been taken into custody and thereafter would have been eligible to file its petition for federal habeas corpus and his request for release.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Then doesn’t this get very circular or am I confused? 
    In other words, if we should affirm the Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit in this case, as you’re asking us to do then no judge in the future will ever issue a stay because he’ll say, “I have no habeas corpus jurisdiction until or unless you’re incarcerated,” isn’t that right? 
    So, this case would never arise again.
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2467.661" stopTime="2471.706">

    Within the state.

speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2500.543" stopTime="2515.322">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Well, procedurally no because there is an automatic stay with the filing of the petition with the District Court of Appeal. 
    The stay that was granted by Judge Nelson was a stay up until the time that the appellant division of the Superior Court either affirmed or denied the case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2515.322" stopTime="2518.873">

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2542.334" stopTime="2542.927">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2542.927" stopTime="2552.124">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    There was a request for certification to the District Court of Appeal which was denied. 
    A petition for habeas corpus was filed in the state and the District Court of Appeal denied.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2552.124" stopTime="2554.310">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And the whole time, this man was out on his recognizance.
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2554.310" stopTime="2555.034">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    That’s correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2555.034" stopTime="2557.905">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Because of the original Municipal Court Order, plus the operation of the California law [Voice Overlap].
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2557.905" stopTime="2572.355">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    And by the operation of the law. 
    That’s correct. 
    And it was a petition filed in the Supreme Court of the State of California again for habeas corpus which was similarly denied. 
    That time, there would have been a remittitur 30 some more days following the determination by the California Supreme Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2572.355" stopTime="2573.787">
    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    And automatically, the man would’ve gone to jail. 
    The day that that would’ve occurred, Mr. Stromer went to Judge Nelson and indicated to him that he was in the process --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2582.445" stopTime="2583.859">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And who’s Judge Nelson?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2583.859" stopTime="2585.336">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    He was the trial judge in the Municipal Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2585.336" stopTime="2587.130">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And he is still back at the State Municipal Court?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2587.130" stopTime="2604.756">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    That’s correct. 
    Mr. Stromer, the defendant’s counsel of that time, went to Judge Nelson and said, “We are filing now a petition for writ of habeas corpus before the Federal Court. 
    Please, can we keep Mr. Hensley out until such time as the Federal Court’s got the case?” 
    And Judge Nelson being a magnanimous individual, agreed to do that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2604.756" stopTime="2607.015">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that he’s also unaware of the Ninth Circuit rule?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2607.015" stopTime="2665.567">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Unaware of the Ninth Circuit rule, it was never even brought up whether or not there was jurisdiction in the Federal Court to hear the case. 
    The impression at that time was at the Ninth Circuit rather that the Federal District Court Judge Peckham would consider the petition and would be dispositive of the case. 
    At the time for the return for the order to show cause why the petition should not be granted. 
    I brought up that question at the court, did not have the jurisdiction to hear the case. 
    At that time, the Federal Courts then by granting stays continued the defendant on his own recognizance. 
    Had the Federal Courts not at that time at the Ninth Circuit or Justices of this Court, interfered at that time, the defendant similarly would have gone in custody and that time, would’ve been eligible for federal habeas corpus. 
    It may be as secured as root and maybe that regardless of the verdict of this Court, in this case, the matter is going to go back to Judge Peckham even the defendant will be in custody when that happens or he’ll be out of custody. 
    But whether or not --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2665.567" stopTime="2679.660">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And in the absence, I guess really what it boils down to that. 
    However, this case is decided in the absence of a stay order by a federal judge. 
    The person is going to be in prison, isn’t he?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2679.660" stopTime="2680.912">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert

    That’s correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2684.909" stopTime="2686.903">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It takes a stay order of a federal judge --

    To keep him out.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And the ordinary operation of state law, this question isn’t going to arise because he’ll begin serving a sentence.

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    All the appeal rights of the defendant have ruled the state court and collateral rights.

    Judge Peckham did not issue the stay order.

    I believe it was Justice Black.

    The defendant would have been incarcerated.

speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2747.795" stopTime="2762.612">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Because the habeas corpus was determined by Judge Peckham when he dismissed the petition for one of jurisdiction. 
    And at that time, a petition was filed with Justice Black to continue the defendant on his own recognizance pending a filing in the Ninth Circuit. 
    And thereafter, Mr. Justice --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2762.612" stopTime="2767.764">

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    The stay in term -- the terms of the stay were conditioned upon the determination of the case by the District Court in San Jose, yes.

speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2788.786" stopTime="2796.450">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    I don’t think so because I don’t think a state court or a judge of a state court can confer jurisdiction upon the Federal Court.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2796.450" stopTime="2803.021">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I didn’t -- but what if the state judge, do it though. 
    He wouldn’t do it for that purpose but --
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2803.021" stopTime="2804.857">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Well, he might do it out of ignorance.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2804.857" stopTime="2806.774">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It might depend on how this case today is decided.
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2806.774" stopTime="2808.910">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Depending of course on how this case is decided.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2808.910" stopTime="2810.970">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Otherwise, there would be no point in doing it.
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2810.970" stopTime="2811.518">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    That’s correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2811.518" stopTime="2814.051">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If he would hold that this Federal Court wouldn’t entertain it.
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2814.051" stopTime="2858.621">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    That’s correct. 
    The law would be clear at that time because this Court had not addressed itself to that question. 
    It is considered what certain circumstances are custody and what are not. 
    But it hasn’t said that an individual on bail or an individual released on his own recognizance whether that person is or is not deemed to be in custody. 
    The California Courts recognized the doctrine of constructive custody. 
    That is a person out on bail on his own recognizance is deemed to be in custody. 
    But I analogize that to somebody being a little bit pregnant. 
    You’re not. 
    Either you are or you’re not and I think that the federal law requires that the person is in jail. 
    Now, it may be an antiquated doctrine, it may not be. 
    I feel, that’s what the Congress has intended and if they intended something different, they all would set something different.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, you don’t mean a different federal statute in light of what we held in Jones. 
    It means in every case, you have to be in jail before --
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2865.603" stopTime="2868.228">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    I think Jones went so far --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now, but perhaps [Voice Overlap] was not in jail.
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2870.669" stopTime="2884.207">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    I appreciate that but jail can mean different things. 
    A parolee and as the Court has pointed out other types of people, although may be not behind bars are still in custody because their lives are not their own.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2884.207" stopTime="2888.081">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, the question is whether one on his own recognizance is in custody in the same way?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2888.081" stopTime="2889.526">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Yes. 
    Absolutely.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2889.526" stopTime="2906.032">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If he surrendered to the state now, voluntarily, to begin his sentence within 30 minutes or even three minutes thereafter, a federal district judge could let him out again pending determination, could he not?

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Yes.

    And you wouldn’t question that the Federal Court had jurisdiction --
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2909.557" stopTime="2910.084">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Would not.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2910.084" stopTime="2910.656">

    -- then?

    Absolutely.

    Why not?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2911.887" stopTime="2927.863">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Because the statute said so. 
    2241 then confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court. 
    Now, this Court obviously has the power to say an individual who released on his own recognizance is in custody but I don’t think that that would be a reasonable interpretation of 2241.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2927.863" stopTime="2938.342">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if a fellow is in custody, he files his habeas corpus petition and the district judge before maybe the petitioner’s filed then enlarges it on his own recognizance.
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2938.342" stopTime="2945.960">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    The critical time is at the time of the filing of the petition. 
    If he is in at that time, the courts have jurisdiction. 
    If he is out at that time, the Court is no or at least the Federal Court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2945.960" stopTime="2950.902">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Even if he’s just sitting in the anteroom of the State Judge Nelson’s office?

    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Waiting to go in. 
    That would be my view. 
    Again, it may be a very narrow construction of the law of the rule.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2957.026" stopTime="2989.607">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But suppose that Judge Peckham might have said to himself, “Well, I don’t have jurisdiction of this petitioner’s petition for habeas corpus since he’s not in custody but I’ll take this petition as a 1983 application, alleging deprivation of constitutional rights and I will now, treating it that way incident to a 1983 petition, I’ll continue on his own recognizance.” 
    Could he have done that?
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="2989.607" stopTime="3003.169">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    Possibly. 
    I don’t know. 
    But the petition in this case was filed under 2241 at a habeas corpus under (c) (3).
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3003.169" stopTime="3006.414">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, of course, not uncommon, isn’t it? 
    [Voice Overlap] mystery things.
speaker="dennis_alan_lempert" startTime="3006.414" stopTime="3033.841">
    Mr. Dennis Alan Lempert 
    I appreciate that but I think what the defendant is doing in this case is it’s intending to have the Federal Courts act as a super appellate review by way of written on nature of coram nobis to get the matter heard as an appeal rather than a habeas corpus. 
    Was that as various, in my view very precise meanings and very précised requirements? 
    Which requirements have not been met by this defendant in this case? 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Stanley A. Bass
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3033.841" stopTime="3035.221">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have anything further?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3035.221" stopTime="3065.753">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Yes, Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    For the record, after the federal habeas was denied, the state trial judge then granted another stay of about 12 days and that was the stay that kept him out until Mr. Justice Black acted on August the 12th. 
    The habeas petition was denied on July 31, so that the -- there was dovetailing throughout of stay orders that were granted by the state trial judge before the federal judge did know.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3065.753" stopTime="3087.410">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did I get the impression that you thought that you said before that going in, in this process of surrendering himself to custody of the state and then immediately filing on a petition for habeas corpus in the Federal Court and asking, was this a meaningless ritual, is that?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3087.410" stopTime="3147.820">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    I thought it was a meaningless ritual for the petitioner to have to go through. 
    I also have mentioned in the brief that I thought that it would be an extremely inadequate remedy to suggest that all he has to do is surrender either into the anteroom or to the institution of confinement and then he could probably be bailed by a federal judge. 
    The two circuits, the Fifth and the Eighth Circuit that decided the issue the other way, contrary to the Ninth Circuit, both involved civil rights cases coming out of itself. 
    And it was no accident that in those cases it was extremely important that the person who is still out on some sort of former release be allowed to seek vindication in the federal courts in a timely fashion. 
    And we submit that there really is no reason other than just a definitional one which is outmoded, and we think has been superseded by Strait versus Laird and all of the pervious cases that this person can be considered in custody for the purposes of 2241 (c) (3). 
    Thank you.
