    Mr. Billups, you may continue.

    Mr. Richard A. Billups, Jr. 
    Thank you sir and Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The last question being discussed with one of supersedeas when the time run out and not continuing to believe with the point but on the other hand in the three-judge tribunal or three-judge trial court under said paragraph 2 and 3, it states supersedeases within the power of the court without statutory authority therefore and appeal from a judgment where -- when no statute requires supersedeas bond to affect a suspension. 
    It ordinarily suspends the judgment without such a bond. 
    In addition it will be doubly sure because it was prior to that time of that decision, the board adopted regulation number one in which they said that no action would be taken pending an appeal. 
    Now, I was trying to show an answer to the question of harassment that the six years between the time these charges and suits where filed resulted from no action on the part of the board. 
    But it involved one case that went to the Supreme Court on the question of the sustaining of the motion to abate by lower court in the injunction case against Lee. 
    And the Supreme Court held that -- and overruled the lower courts in their holding on the motion to abate and directed the court to proceed, and it did proceed and proceed to trial with a judgment and an injunction granted against Lee Optical from which they appeal in the House of $8.50 case, a companion case and that it involve the same questions. 
    However in that case, the optometrist remained in the case along with the House of $8.50 Eyeglasses when in the Lee case, a motion to abate on their part of the optometrist was sustained by the court without assigning reasons therefore and the case proceeded to trial on the case against Lee. 
    Then after these two -- and in the House of $8.50, an injunction was granted against both the House of $8.50 Eyeglasses and their employed optometrist from enjoining them from the unlawful practice of optometry. 
    Following that, then, these charges which had been voluntarily held in abeyance by the court, this covered appeared of almost six years, and with the counsel for the Board stating to counsel for the defendants that they had no desire of whatsoever to run the optometrist involve out of Alabama that they where badly needed in Alabama. 
    So badly is the shortage of optometrist in Alabama that Alabama has now established a school of optometry and Legislature made it the part of the medical complex at Birmingham, and 73, they will graduate their first class of optometrist. 
    So, that then brings us up to the injunction suit filed in federal court which was filed between the time of the decisions, favorable decisions in the lower court granting injunctions which were appealed by Lee and House of $8.50. 
    But following those favorable decisions, then these charges where set for hearing before the Board with due notice. 
    At one prior time, they where agreed -- continued by agreement as shown by an exhibit in the record because of the possibility that by participating in the trial by the State Board it might cause them to become disqualified to hear the charges as a State Board, and it was agreed by counsel and reduced to writing and is in the record that that would not be true. 
    However, no one -- no member of the State Board did participate in the charges, except Dr. Koch who is at that time President and soon went off of the Board after that and would not have been a member of the Board to hear these charges when this injunction suit was filed in federal court. 
    Now, we have the Geiger case from Georgia which is almost an identical case to the case we have here, involving charges filed against a physician before the Board, alleging misconduct on his part. 
    And in that case, an injunction suit was filed just as in this in the case and was heard. 
    It was held in that case that the charges where penal in nature and the anti-injunction statute would apply and the case was dismissed. 
    It came up to this Court and on March 29, 1971, the action was affirmed by this Court. 
    Now, the -- in McCrory v. Wood in Mississippi, it has been held that these Sections of this Optometry Law involved here are constitutional, even though held unconstitutional by the trial court in the federal injunction suit. 
    Now also in Alabama in the case of State v. Keel, it has been held that such charges pending before a State Board are penal in nature and by virtue of being penal in nature, then would be subject to the anti-injunction statute. 
    Now, then that brings us up into the case of Mitchum from Florida which did not involve a professional case, but involved a bookstore and an injunction was filed and in that case, the -- charges were filed in state court against the bookstore under the obscenity law before they were tried, before they were heard, then an injunction suit was filed in federal court as in this case. 
    Then upon a hearing, the three-judge trial court held that since this was a penal case pending a state court that the anti-injunction suit Section 2283 would apply and the case was dismissed. 
    Then upon appeal here, this Honorable Court held that the exception under 1983 or that there was an exception to with 1983 to such a penal case as that. 
    And based on that, this Honorable Court held that that exception applied to the case pending in Florida, and reversed the lower court and its ruling that had dismissed saying that the anti-injunction suit was absolute in its application. 
    This Honorable Court reversed but at the same time in a concurrence, it was suggested that perhaps the lower court should give consideration to what could be accomplished in the state court, in the disposition of this matter.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And this case, this case that you are now arguing here was decided by the District Court before the Mitchum case was decided by this Court, wasn’t it?

    Mr. Richard A. Billups, Jr. 
    Right, right, right. 
    Now, I would like in closing to say that in the case of McCrory v. Wood in Mississippi, as well as in some other states, sections for the Optometry Law such as 192 and 206 that are involved here are constitutional, and for what that might be worth and the consideration given this case by this Honorable Court that that is the situation. 
    We sincerely trust that this Honorable Court will take cognizance of the extreme importance on all licensing boards of the decision rendered in this case because throughout the country, practically all licensing boards in the professional healthcare field have similar provisions as to appointment of members of the board and similar provisions as to membership in the association, and in general appeals from charges that are heard before the Board. 
    So, I thank you and I appreciate the attention of the Court.

    Thank you Mr. Billups. 
    Mr. Cole?

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The position of the appellees in this case is and I think that possibly to focus upon the issues which duly present here. 
    I might make this statement at outset, and that is that in our view in the study of the District Court’s opinion, the three-judge District Court held nothing unconstitutional. 
    No statute was held unconstitutional. 
    The only effect of the courts decision and opinion being to enjoin the enforcement of the statute holding that it was unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff appellees in this case.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1067.413" stopTime="1070.159">

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    The point of my saying is, Your Honor, that I think we are going to get back to a regular 1983 case and the only question before this Court is whether or not the Federal District Court should have exercise equity jurisdiction to enjoin?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1082.755" stopTime="1089.418">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And the anti-injunction statute just wouldn’t apply under Mitchum, I suppose?

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    Right, sir.

    Unknown Speaker

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    Yes, sir, inadequate as we contended in the court below.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1121.527" stopTime="1124.474">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Do you know whether that review would be in de novo or on the record?
speaker="harry_f_cole" startTime="1124.474" stopTime="1126.223">
    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    De novo.

speaker="harry_f_cole" startTime="1136.472" stopTime="1154.361">
    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    No, sir. 
    In our opinion the judgment, there was no absolute right supersedeas. 
    Alabama case hold that supersedeas is not a matter of right and unless granted by statute must be directed to one of the circuit judges and if the circuit judge has authority to issue a writ of supersedeas at law --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1154.361" stopTime="1159.770">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, had the Alabama courts categorize this standard proceeding as a penal proceeding?
speaker="harry_f_cole" startTime="1159.770" stopTime="1178.895">
    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    No, sir. 
    The case was State v. Keel cited by the appellant involved the fact situation where the Department of Conservation had issued some regulation prohibiting trotline fishing in the river in Alabama. 
    And the defendant was arrested for trotline fishing and they held that they could issue a warrant on this.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1178.895" stopTime="1188.531">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So the question here is whether or not the federal court should withhold an injunction where there is pending a state -- that administrative proceeding subjected to these review.

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    Yes, sir, but the facts here additionally, we contend and we thank the record as replete with examples of vast prejudice and disqualification on the part of the tribunal who where -- who what, which was to try these defendants, and that’s the basis we ask for the injunction in the first place.

    In this case, we allege that they could not get Due Process in the first instance, and that we have been subjected to harassment.

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    Well, if the state courts where in Dombrowski versus Pfister. 
    Yes, sir. 
    I mean, that is where we were. 
    We were in the same position. 
    We think as the defendants were in Dombrowski versus Pfister. 
    Whether or not we could have defended this in the single action, of course, we think it is a question for the Court. 
    If I may review the history and what the record was shown, the record is voluminous in its appeal with that. 
    The appendix has some 400 or 500 pages of testimony in here from the state board members, that position were taken from each of them. 
    The history of this litigation goes back to old 1956, the first that the two Alabama state statutes giving the board the authority to regulate the practice of optometry are Sections 206 and then addition there, some other section. 
    One of the Sections says that nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to deny the right of a department store or some other business to operate in optometrical department. 
    Assuming that it’s under the control of a licensed optometrist and that his name appears in any advertisement, there have been prosecution of several or one or two at least optometrist, under this Act holding that there where guilty of unprofessional conduct because their name had appeared in advertising. 
    The Board prosecuted these people because they said that they violated the Code of Ethics of the Alabama Optometric Association. 
    The Alabama Optometric Association has given the authority by the Legislature to admit members to practice and govern the practice of the profession within Alabama in code -- state code. 
    The Alabama Optometric Association also nominates the members of the Alabama State Board and board members must come from the association. 
    Also, in the record or in the rules of the Alabama Optometric Association is a provision which says that any optometrist who is employed by anybody other than a licensed optometrist cannot join the association. 
    So that optometrist who are employed by corporations or optical dispensaries are excluded from membership and the organization govern the practice of their profession. 
    Now, the association and the state board had admittedly these stipulated Mr. Billups stated in his statement had been engaged for many years and had been interested in eliminating what they refer to as corporate practice of optometry in the State of Alabama and other states. 
    That is that the practice by which an optometrist maybe employed by an optical dispensary. 
    In Alabama, I think the record shows that there are a hundred members of the Alabama State Board of Optometry. 
    There are 92 members of these non-corporation employed optometrist or non-members of the state board. 
    There has been litigation --

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    The litigation first begun in 1956 in the case of Alabama State Board v. Bush Jewelry, they attempted to entertain some license revocation action with optometrist because he had violated the Association’s Code of Ethics. 
    The Alabama Supreme Court says you can’t take his license away from that because you can’t impose your Association’s Code of Ethics on a non-member of the association when he is actually pursuing the right given to him by statute. 
    Later, the next case of the Alabama State Board v. Dr. McCrory who is one of the plaintiff appellees in this case was begun in 1961. 
    They started the license revocation proceeding against McCrory alleging that he was guilty of unprofessional conduct because he has allowed his license to be used and had advertise the practice of his profession.

    They referred to themselves as doctor, yes.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1699.137" stopTime="1705.915">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is that just a euphemism, colloquialism or are they allowed to do so by statute?
speaker="harry_f_cole" startTime="1705.915" stopTime="1979.879">
    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    There is nothing in the statute to allow them to do it. 
    There is just a -- in fact the Alabama Supreme Court -- the last case, the Lee case, the deciding point of whether or not it was a learned profession and the court said that it was not. 
    That it was a limited statutory profession. 
    But in any rate, McCrory who was one of the plaintiff appellees in this case was there was an attempt to prosecution. 
    The Alabama Supreme Court said that the state board did not have the authority to prosecute him or to revoke his license. 
    That occurred in 1965. The basis of that holding was a provision of the Alabama Code which guaranteed him the right to advertise and also said that the department store could have an optometrical department. 
    At that point, the advice of this Board, the present member of this board begins to become more evident. 
    We think that their depositions and their testimony showed it very clearly. 
    This state board Dr. Thomas S. Gibson who was Chairman of the Alabama State Board of Optometry was also Legislative Chairman of the Alabama State Optometric Association. 
    Members of the Association were asked to contribute or assess, we do not know. 
    Although, some Dr. Gibson himself contributed $500.00 and so did other members of the state board to what they referred to as a legislative fund to secure the repeal of Section 210 of the Optometry Act. 
    This was a Section which gave corporations a specific right to employ optometrists. 
    This Section was appealed in August, I believe, of 1965. 
    Then in October of 1965, Dr. Thomas S. Gibson filed a sworn complaint in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County in behalf of the State Board of Optometry, all of the members of the state board where part as to this complaint. 
    They alleged that all of these plaintiff appellees in this case were guilty of improper and unethical practice, and that they where employed by corporation contrary to the provisions of the law and ask that the court enjoin these optometrists from working for the corporation and the corporation from employing them. 
    Later, as Mr. Billups said that the court let the individual optometrist out of the case on technicality. 
    At the same time, the civil proceeding was filed. 
    The Alabama State Optometric Association initiated charge before the state board. 
    So at this point, you have a state board maintaining a civil action, claiming that these people are guilty of something, and at the same time, they are fixing the trial to revoke their license in a proceeding both by their apparent organization and Alabama State Board of Optometry. 
    Their license revocation charges were held at advance over a period of six or seven years. 
    During this time, the state court enjoined Lee from employing optometrist held that is was a learned profession and all sorts of thing. 
    The Alabama Supreme Court reversed and summarily and rendered the case and that was the end of that. 
    It said that there was nothing wrong with them employed optometrist. 
    While this was pending in just a few weeks before the Alabama Supreme Court rendered its opinion, these appellees were again notified that license revocation charges where going to be brought and that they were going to be prosecuted for practicing optometry illegally because they were working for a corporation -- corporate practice. 
    At this point, we had asked the Board to recuse itself, it had refused and we filed this action invoke in the provisions of 1983 to protect Fourteenth Amendment rights. 
    Their allegations were in the evident showed that there had been between the State Board of Optometry and this Alabama Optometric Association are common defense fund whereby they have shared legal expense for the prosecution of these people. 
    They had conferred at links between themselves as to the cause of the litigation action be handled and how corporate practice should be eliminated. 
    There had been as I said contribution to legislative fund by members of the civil suit. 
    The Board Chairman himself testified in his deposition that the State Board of Optometry felt compelled follow the mandates and dictates of the Alabama Optometric Society and determining what to do and how to handle these things. 
    We feel that basically, the case presents a perfect illustration of vast prejudice and disqualification upon the trial of fact who are ultimately to sit in judgment upon these optometrists as to whether they should be able to practice their profession. 
    As to the rights of supersedeas and irreparable injury, we think that it goes without saying the quote from what -- one of the district judges said in source of Florida case, I forgot what is -- had absolutely nothing to lose, except their livelihood and the right to practice that --

    It took us two years to get that. 
    So, I mean there --

    You started in 1956?

    Mr. Harry F. Cole 
    No, we did not start. 
    Now, that was another prosecution back in 1956. 
    I cited those cases to just show the evidence of harassment that has -- that we alleged in our brief. 
    And I might mention one other thing. 
    I think that the trial court found evidence of pecuniary interest in the same by board members. 
    The evidence that came out in the hearing was that there was some said the 5,000 pairs of eyeglasses sold by the employer of the appellees alone in the State for Alabama in one year, besides from the price differential chart between the two parties. 
    I mean that the employers of these people at one time examined eyes free and sold glasses for $20.00 a pair. 
    The members of the state association and the board members at the same time were charging $20.00 to examine eyes and sold all of the glasses. 
    So, if you take it right down to the dollar marks in the thing, you have a proposition where you get $30,000.00 per year per man as far as the sale of eyeglasses and this is what the whole thing is about. 
    It’s a competitive proposition that had been for 20 years.
