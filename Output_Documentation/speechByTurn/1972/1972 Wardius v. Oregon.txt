Wardius v. Oregon

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We’ll hear arguments next in 71-6042, Wardius against Oregon. 
    Mr. Kuhn, you may proceed.
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="33.632" stopTime="140.159">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Petitioner in the instant case was convicted for the sale of Narcotics and sentence to 18 months imprisonment. 
    During the trial of his case, he was not permitted to present alibi testimony through an alibi witness and his own testimony because he felt comply with requirements of ORS 135.875 Oregon’s notice of alibi statute. 
    Pursuant to the requirements of this statute, the defendant not less than five days prior to trial must file a written intent of notice to rely on alibi evidence. 
    The notice must include within it the place or places the accused claim to have been at the time the crime was alleged to have been committed plus the names and addresses of the witnesses he intends to call. 
    The sanctions levied upon a defendant for failure to comply that the witness or witnesses are not allowed to testify as to an alibi defense and under the construction of the Oregon Court of Appeals, the defendant himself is not permitted to take the stand and give testimony as to his whereabouts at the time the crime was alleged to have been committed. 
    In the instant case both the defendants’ prospective witnesses’ testimony and its own were stricken. 
    Now, petitioners believes that this Oregon statute and as construed by the Oregon Court of Appeals is unconstitutional and that it denies him due process of law because it fails one to provide any reciprocity on a part of the State and that it gives no discovery rights to the defendant.

    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    I believe that what would be left in this particular case, Your Honor, is the fact that the Oregon statute applies to the defendant’s testimony and that the requirements that he file a written notice as to his whereabouts prior to trial as a condition of his taking the stand would get us here.

    You’re speaking of the record.

    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    From the record there was no request.
speaker="juctice_rehnquist" startTime="195.407" stopTime="207.429">
    Mr. Juctice Rehnquist 
    Didn’t your Oregon Court of Appeals say that they just had no occasion that passed on the extent to which reciprocity would be required since the record didn’t raise the issue? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of J. Marvin Kuhn
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="207.429" stopTime="348.053">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    Yes, Your Honor, the Court of Appeals held that they would not reach this issue because the State did not offer any rebuttal evidence. 
    However, the petition does appeal like that is valid in this case because the State was not required to offer any rebuttal evidence because the defendant’s alibi testimony was stricken from the record. 
    So there would be no reason for the State to offer rebuttal evidence. 
    That was the reason given by the Oregon Court. 
    Now, petitioner also believes that the statute denies due process and that it prevents the defendant from testifying in his own behalf if he fails to give notice as required by the Oregon statute. 
    Also that denies him his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself because of the written notice required as the condition precedent to his taking the stand and giving alibi testimony. 
    And that it denies him his right to the Sixth Amendment to rights of compulsory process. 
    Now, this Court in Williams versus Florida did uphold the alibi statute from the State of Florida. 
    However, one of the main bases as petitioner reach the case once that Florida did provide for a liberal reciprocity in their statute that the Oregon statute does not. 
    Under the terms of the Florida statute, both the defendant and the State are required to submit the names of their proposed alibi witnesses. 
    The defendant for his alibi, the State for any prospective rebuttal witnesses they may wish to call. 
    If either party under the Florida statute failed to give the required notice, that party including the State would not be allowed to call their alibi witnesses. 
    The Florida statute was therefore equal in placing the duty, responsibility as well as the sanction equally among the parties for failure to comply with it. 
    The Oregon statute places the entire obligation on the part of the defendant that requires nothing on the part of the State. 
    The State has no duty to disclose any rebuttal witnesses nor as there any sanction applied against the State for failure to do so. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Juctice Rehnquist
speaker="juctice_rehnquist" startTime="348.053" stopTime="371.474">
    Mr. Juctice Rehnquist 
    Can you be sure of that just from a reading of this one section of the Oregon statute? 
    Isn’t it possible to read the Oregon Court of Appeals’ opinion here is saying that had a request been made to apply the same rule to the State that very likely as a matter of its interpretive authority it might have applied that rule to the State? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of J. Marvin Kuhn
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="371.474" stopTime="444.987">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    It may have Your Honor. 
    However I could not answer that. 
    However, a recent case passed them down. 
    The statute has been further interpreted. 
    It is cited in the State’s supplemental brief State versus Kelsaw. 
    In that case, the Oregon Court of Appeals has recently held that a defendant does not have to require with the Oregon alibi statute now, unless and until the State supply him with the specific time and place that the crime was alleged to have been committed. 
    If the State fails to do this either by way of indictment or information relayed to the defendant’s attorney by the District Attorney. 
    The defendant does not have to comply with the statute. 
    However, I believe all of that may alleviate the problems someone in Oregon. 
    I don’t believe it’s going to solve it because once the State has given this information to the defendant. 
    The defendant then is in the same boat that the petitioner here is and that he must then comply with the statute. 
    If he does not comply with it, he is not permitted to testify nor any of his witness permitted to testify.

    Yes, Your Honor, on the reciprocity issue. 
    Now, petitioner also feels that under the terms of this Oregon specific statute and as interpreted by the Oregon Court of Appeals that he has been denied due process and that he has not been allowed to take the stand and testify in his own behalf because he has failed to give the State the required notice specifically saying that where he was at the time the crime was alleged to have been committed. 
    This is made a condition precedent as to taking the stand and giving alibi testimony.

    [Voice Overlap] by statute?
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="954.149" stopTime="1132.496">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    The defendant in Florida is exempt specifically under the terms of the Florida statute and that the failure to file notice under Florida Statute does not affect his right to take the stand and give testimony. 
    In Oregon does not have that provision and I believe that of this Court in Specht versus Patterson has indicated that the defendant in a criminal case has a right to be heard, has a right to be confronted with the witnesses against him the right cross-examine and the right to offer evidence of his own. 
    The petitioner believes that the right to be heard and to offer evidence of his own must necessarily include the right of the defendant himself to take the stand so that he make deal his side of the story. 
    I think that anytime a person is charged with the crime he should have this right. 
    And that the Oregon statute unconstitutionally abridges his right because it requires the defendant prior to trial to tell the State what his trial testimony is going to be as a condition precedent of his getting up on the stand and testifying. 
    I believe that this is an unconstitutional abridgement of his right to testify. 
    Both the New York and Iowa have held that the notice of alibi statute in those states do not apply to the defendant testimony on -- of his, unlike Oregon. 
    The petitioner feels that the sanction under the Oregon alibi statute is simply not justifying because the defendant is denied the right to testify on material issue that goes to the very heart of this case and as in the determination as to whether or not he is going to be deprive of his liberty. 
    Finally, not finally, I believe that the defendant’s right against self-incrimination is violated by the statute for precisely the same grounds again in that since the statute does apply to a defendant’s testimony and not just witness’ testimony he must tell the State prior to trial what his alibi testimony is going to be as a condition precedent to his taking stand and giving that testimony. 
    And if it applied only to the witnesses perhaps there would be no denial of right against self-incrimination as this Court held in Williams versus Florida. 
    However, I do believe that this is a distinguishing feature of the Oregon statute and this case vis-à-vis the Williams decision and that the defendant in Williams were specifically excluded from the terms of that statute here he is not. 
    And he must reveal his testimony prior to the time of trial where as the police would have no right to that testimony under decision of this Court unless the defendant voluntarily wished to waive his right against silence.

    There is no law. 
    The issue has never risen to my knowledge in Oregon. 
    And we just do not believe that the legislature should force should be able to force the defendant to reveal his testimony, alibi testimony prior to trial when the police would have no right to that testimony themselves unless the defendant voluntarily wish the waive his Fifth Amendment rights. 
    Finally, petition believes that he was denied his right to compulsory process in this case under the terms of this Court’s decision in Washington versus Texas where the Court held that the right to compulsory process was complaint terms the right to present a defense and it was a fundamental element of a due process of law. 
    Petitioner believes that here because his witness was in Court, was physically able to testify had knowledge of a material fact that for the Court to strike her testimony was a denial on his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process.

   Argument of W. Michael Gillette
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1288.996" stopTime="1290.339">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Gillette.
speaker="w_michael_gillette" startTime="1290.339" stopTime="1376.597">
    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Questions have arisen this morning with respect to Oregon procedure and I should like for a moment if I may to attempt to clarify little further for Justice Brennan, the present status of Oregon law with respect to discovery. 
    First of all, there is no general discovery statute in Oregon with respect to the right to criminal defendant. 
    And included in that, there is no right to a bill of particulars as the law now stands. 
    I believe that after the legislatures concluded its work at the present time there will be one but there is not at the moment. 
    The Kelsaw case represents really the first major step by any Oregon Court of Appeals whether the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals to establish any right of discovery on the part of the criminal defendants. 
    In that case only goes as far as it does I believe because that’s all it was called to do in that particular case. 
    Now, it establishes the right of a defendant to refuse to comply with the alibi statute unless that the defendant is in possession at the time the compliance is called for. 
    It is in the possession of information supplied by the state which tells him the time, the date in which the crime was alleged to have occurred and a place where it is alleged to have occurred. 
    And this ruling is made on the basis of a theory of fundamental fairness to the effect that the defendant cannot be held responsible for disclosing that he was at place “X” until he knows that he’s charged of having been at place “Y.” 
    Now, the Court of Appeals went no further because there was no need in the Kelsaw case.

    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    No sir, there was not. 
    But I would submit to the Court that in an appropriate case where the defendant applied at the time he gave the notice applied for in order from the Court requiring the State to disclose to the defendant the names of any witnesses it propose to call and rebuttal to his alibi testimony their names and addresses and so on that he would be granted that. 
    And I think that would be called for on a basis of this Court’s decision in Williams versus Florida. 
    The point is the Oregon courts have not yet had a chance to deal with this question and when they are given the chance to deal with this question, I believe they’ll deal with it in the same way they dealt with the Kelsaw problem. 
    They’ll analyze it, they’ll take this Court’s decision in Williams and they’ll apply it. 
    And one of the points that I want to urge upon the Court this morning is that state courts in general and the Oregon courts in particular are capable of taking constitutional decisions of this Court and applying to them to their own statute and --

speaker="w_michael_gillette" startTime="1472.301" stopTime="1490.089">
    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    Well, the rational of alibi statute, as I understand them and as I believe they are explained in the Williams case, is that the alibi defense is a peculiar kind of defense it offers opportunities for surprise that the general defense does not. 
    And the State has a special interest in avoiding the kind of surprise that an alibi defense represents.

    Mr. W. Michael Gillette

    Call witnesses to show that either the defendant was somewhere else or call witnesses who were at this place where the defendant claims to have been to show that he wasn’t there.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It’s almost unbelievable. 
    I can understand why you want to examine the other witnesses. 
    But the defendant himself, I thought, had a right to do one of three things not testify, testify, and to take any position he wants to take at that moment which could be directly contrary to the position he wanted to take before the trial. 
    Am I right or wrong?

    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    I don’t think it interferes with his right to testify if during the time limit provided by the statute prior to trial he was aware on it, informed his counsel of the fact that he had alibi testimony to offer. 
    If he kept that information to himself and did not tell his counsel until the case it actually proceeded and he finally -- and this happens. 
    I am told by colleagues who are in the defense business. 
    If he finally after the trial has proceeded, first turned to his counsel and says, “look, I will now tell you what I was doing, I was with a girlfriend somewhere and I didn’t want to bring her name up but the case is going badly and I have obviously got to.” 
    If that occurred, I think that would constitute good cause for the waiver of the alibi notice.

    A question arose from one of the Justices I believe it was Mr. Justice Rehnquist with respect to rebuttal testimony. 
    I -- perhaps I have already finished that statement but I -- the question of whether or not the defendant is entitled to that information. 
    Information which the Georgia statute or the Florida statute, pardon me, called for with respect to the names, addresses, nature of the testimony from the rebuttal witnesses. 
    The question of whether the defendant is entitled that’s not settled but it seems to me that the conclusion of the Oregon courts would have to reach this, pretty well dictated by the language of Williams. 
    And I would have thought that at the very least it would be the value for the Oregon courts to be given an opportunity to settle that question on their own based upon an appropriate motion by the defense.

    Could you just tell me what the State’s interest is in having this alibi statute?
speaker="w_michael_gillette" startTime="1808.248" stopTime="1841.561">
    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    Yes, it is the same interest that’s referred to in the Williams case. 
    The alibi defense is one which involves -- usually involves surprise to the State because it develops the testimony in an entirely new line. 
    The testimony for the prosecution goes whether the defendant was in certain place where they perform certain acts. 
    The alibi testimony gives a right turn to the entire proceedings. 
    It is surprising by definition. 
    And the interest as referred to in Williams is the interest of full and fair disclosure of all the issues which go to the guilt or innocence of the accused.

    And what interest of Florida is lost if at the time an alibi witness is offered that hasn’t been previously been disclosed, that the trial is adjourned until -- so that the state may accomplish its aims of investigation and avoidance of surprise then of fraud and perjury?
speaker="w_michael_gillette" startTime="1865.554" stopTime="1948.920">
    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    I think the concern their shifts. 
    The concern then becomes concluding the business of that particular trial particularly in jury section with crowded dockets without being faced with an arbitrary really is surprising delay due to the fact the defendant did not make a disclosure at a time when he was aware they could have made it. 
    Let me put this way, let’s supposed that the matter is being tried for at jury. 
    Now, this case was not but I think it’s fair to say that whatever the Court decides that they will apply to both trials to juries and trials to the Court. 
    If the case is being tried to a jury and the jury spent about two weeks hearing testimony in a relatively complicated criminal matter and the defense for the first time at the end of those weeks discloses that they intend to offer evidence of alibi and they make available, let’s say the names of four or five witnesses and the State has then granted a continuance. 
    You’re asking a jury which could be used under other circumstance to hear other cases in the panel of a (Inaudible) frequently is limited in jurisdictions such as the one I came from in Portland. 
    You are asking that jury to sit on its hands until the State has concluded its investigation. 
    They can’t be assigned in any other case because they may not be available to reconvene the trial. 
    You are asking that the judge be made available. 
    You are asking that those things occur, those delays occur which could have been avoided by supplying information ahead of time. 
    You are asking that the judicial system, the system were trying to take care of crowded dockets be interrupted by that period of time. 
    Now, it’s easier with the judge and with the jury. 
    It’s much more complicated with the jury because they ought to be [Voice Overlap].

speaker="w_michael_gillette" startTime="2138.620" stopTime="2229.815">
    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    The matter in which this whole question came up is set out at length in the appendix and I think it’s of some significance. 
    What occurred was -- this trial happen about two or three months after this Court’s decision Williams versus Florida. 
    And it’s -- I think it’s evident from the transcript if you examine it in the appendix that the Trial Court was aware neither of the alibi statute nor this Court’s decision in Williams so that both of those things came as a surprise to the trial Court. 
    On the other hand, the defendant was aware both of them because as the transcript shows the defense counsel gave a copy of the Williams decision to the prosecutor during the noon recess. 
    And he came in the afternoon and put on the proceeded put on his alibi testimony which was well the only testimony offered by the defense. 
    And the first time, the Court was aware that there was an alibi statute or there was a problem with an alibi statute was when the prosecution entered in objection. 
    So, what occurred after that is not particularly clear the defendant was given an opportunity to make it showing of good cause where the requirements of statute should not be waive -- should be waive? 
    And his offering was to the effect that first he thought that the date on the indictment was wrong and he was prepared after alibi witnesses on a different date. 
    But of course he had notice those either. 
    And then secondly, he also said that he was not aware the name of his alibi witness and again the transcript shows that even if he was not aware that his defendant was he dated the girlfriend of that year. 
    So, neither of those showings was --

    He simply offered the Court the decision it said, here is the statute you can only beside the other and that is the end of it and I supposed in that sense you could say that the issue of the constitutionally of the state [Voice Overlap] raise was more properly raise before the trial court than on an appeal.

    What would you suppose the interest of the defendant would be in not notifying of an alibi if he was reasonably confident that -- if he didn’t notify and still -- and nevertheless offered alibi witnesses during the trial, the trial would be adjourned? 
    He anticipated in the adjournment if he offered unannounced witnesses, what would be as interest in not notifying before trial?

    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    Well, I think the adjournment procedure makes available to the defendant that is a close to the states case a period of time in which he can figure out what to do. 
    If he’s serious of notice of alibi by which he is not back, he simply gets himself a five-day recess or whatever the period time is and which he can sit down perhaps even get full transcript of all the testimony and go over all the testimony and plan what it is he is going to do.

    And when he offers them then the state would ask for an adjournment.

    And do you think that would be precluded by Oregon law or by some provision of the Federal Constitution?
speaker="w_michael_gillette" startTime="2552.744" stopTime="2565.975">
    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    Well, I think it would be precluded by Oregon law. 
    The courts of -- Oregon courts have been rather severe about that promise of the jury on anything that is not directly in evidence and that would constitute testifying as to matters not an evidence. 
    I think that Oregon [Voice Overlap].
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2565.975" stopTime="2584.071">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Oh! 
    But it’s something that jury -- they do see the alibi witness ultimately and your point is that it would be a testimonial to develop the fact that, that was a late tactic.
speaker="w_michael_gillette" startTime="2584.071" stopTime="2588.006">
    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    Yes, I think so.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2588.006" stopTime="2598.123">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would -- then I take it too that if the prosecutor got up and objected on the grounds that it was a belated tender, he’d be in the same trouble?
speaker="w_michael_gillette" startTime="2598.123" stopTime="2675.814">
    Mr. W. Michael Gillette 
    He’d be riding the same difficulty I think it might well service grounds for mistrial at that point if he did it in the presence of the jury. 
    Now, if I may Your Honor, I’d like to finally refer to the question of compulsory process which counsels referred to when he specifically say that the Washington versus Texas case and I would submit that the difference between this case and the difference between the problem pose by this case and the line of cases represented by Washington versus Texas, Pointer versus Texas, Ferguson versus Georgia and the like is that in those case witnesses were incompetent period. 
    The statute made the man available to the defendant no matter what he did. 
    He simply could not qualify them as witnesses. 
    Washington, you may recall, involved a situation where the defendant could not call on accomplice to testify a co-principal to testify at all. 
    He was deemed incompetent by Texas statute. 
    Now, in this case the only step that the defendant needs to take to make the witness confident is to serve the notice. 
    The power to make the witness confident lies within his own hands and I would submit that makes the statute as applied. 
    Significantly, different in the entire line of cases represented by Washington versus Texas. 
    Unless the Court has further questions, that concludes my remarks. 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of J. Marvin Kuhn

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you, Mr. Gillette. 
    Do you have anything further Mr. Kuhn?
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2685.867" stopTime="2686.179">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    No, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2686.179" stopTime="2687.906">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Could I ask you Mr. Kuhn?
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2687.906" stopTime="2690.960">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2690.960" stopTime="2692.691">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You are representing a defendant.
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2692.691" stopTime="2693.209">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2693.209" stopTime="2704.386">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You know ahead of trial that if you offer surprise alibi witness, he is going to be on adjournment. 
    States are going to have an opportunity to investigate your witnesses?
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2704.386" stopTime="2706.104">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    Yes, that’s correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2706.104" stopTime="2722.910">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And you know that that’s going to happen if you do not comply with the statute and rather than comply for the witness unannounced. 
    You know that this is going to be an adjournment and what be your choice to comply with the statute or to waive?
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2722.910" stopTime="2730.000">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    I think that I would probably tell the district attorney that I was going to have an alibi.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2730.000" stopTime="2738.030">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And why would you do that? 
    You do not see any particular advantage in waiting then if you are going to have to be subject to an adjournment anyway.
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2738.030" stopTime="2743.295">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    No, Your Honor. 
    However, whether there would be an adjournment or not, well that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2743.295" stopTime="2746.164">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know but assume there would be, assume there would be, assume that the Court --
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2746.164" stopTime="2758.265">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    If there would be, although I would probably offer no more then the fact that there would be an alibi defense and not complying with the remaining terms of the statute assuming we had a statute.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2758.265" stopTime="2759.947">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or you wouldn’t give the names of the witness?
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2759.947" stopTime="2761.800">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    No, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2761.800" stopTime="2766.373">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you would have to name them -- you have to call them sooner or later to their call.
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2766.373" stopTime="2767.245">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2767.245" stopTime="2772.444">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And as soon as you called them, the State would ask for them and would get an adjournment?
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2772.444" stopTime="2780.191">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    Yes, in that case I would see no reason not to give the names and addresses of the witnesses.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2780.191" stopTime="2781.144">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Ahead of time.
speaker="j_marvin_kuhn" startTime="2781.144" stopTime="2792.244">
    Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn 
    If I could obtain an agreement to get them back. 
    However, I would not submit the defendant’s testimony as to where he was at the time.

    Thank you gentlemen.
