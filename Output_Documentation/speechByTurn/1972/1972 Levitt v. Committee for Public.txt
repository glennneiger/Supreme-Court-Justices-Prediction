    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The statute at issue on this appeal, Chapter 138 of the New York Laws of 1970, provides for the payment by the State to non-public schools within the State, specific sums of money as partial reimbursement of the expenses of record-keeping, testing, and reporting incurred by the non-public schools in complying with requirements of state law and regulation. 
    The laws and regulations referred to have been enacted for the purposes of the examination and inspection of the non-public schools by the State. 
    The examination of this statute to determine its validity, must we feel be made in the perspective of the total historical educational picture in the State of New York. 
    From the creation of the University of the State of New York in 1787, the regents of that University and subsequently the Commissioner of Education as its administrative arm had a general supervision over all educational institutions in the State of New York, both public and private. 
    All private educational institutions from elementary grades through colleges receive their charges from the Board of Regents. 
    The state education law gives the Commissioner of Education the power to examine and inspect private as well as public institutions of learning, to determine whether or not they comply with the compulsory attendance and instructional requirements of the state law. 
    The state education law not only requires children to regularly attend some school, either public or private, but sets minimum standards of education including course content which must be met by the schools which these children attend, in order that their attendance does comply with the compulsory attendance laws. 
    The importance of this supervisory function to the States concerned, relative to its children's education was recognized by the framers of the state constitution in 1894 when in adding a provision prohibiting aid to sectarian schools, they specifically accepted expenditures of money for the purposes of examination and inspection, in the carrying out of this function of examination and inspection and general supervision over the education provided by non-public schools in the State. 
    The State requires the schools to perform certain testing, record-keeping, and reporting services to the State. 
    Among these are the administration of tests, including Regents' examinations which are statewide tests of specific subject matter achievement, Pupil Evaluation Program Tests in grade six and nine, and other general statewide evaluation tests also used in public schools. 
    And in addition, the regulations of the Commissioner of Education require the non-public schools to conduct a continuing program of individual pupil testing in all grades to provide an adequate basis for evaluating pupil achievement. 
    In addition to the testing program, the non-public schools are required to maintain health records, records of marks, attendance records, provide information under the basic educational data system, which includes statistical information as to students, teachers, curricula offered, physical plans and so forth, and of secondary schools, additional data on a more detailed basis than in the basic educational data system. 
    These requirements imposed upon non-public schools by law or regulations involve considerable addition expense to the schools for which, immediately prior to the enactment of Chapter I38, the schools were not compensated. 
    While immediately prior to the enactment of the statute, the schools were not compensated, the State has had a long history of providing some compensation to some non-public schools in recognition of the cost burden imposed by the State in assuring that the requirements of the compulsory attendance laws are being met. 
    Beginning in 1892, appropriations remain annually to so called academies for services in connection with the compulsory attendance laws. 
    Those academies included sectarian and non-sectarian, secondary non-public schools. 
    The provision for such compensation was retained in the state's education law until 1930, but even after repeal in that year, appropriations continued to be made and in the State's local assistance appropriation bills, in connection with the attendance requirements of academic pupils. 
    Only in the years between 1968 and the enactment of the legislation at issue here for no payments made to any non-public schools for these purposes. 
    The legislation adopted in 1970 therefore, merely reinstated a past practice of compensating non-public schools for record-keeping and examination services required by the state updated the amount paid to reflect current economic conditions and made the base of payment more equitable by including all non-public schools at all-state imposed examination and recordkeeping requirements. 
    The cost analysis studies made for the State Education Department, in which there are exhibits in this case, exhibits D and G in a separate folder of exhibits submitted to the Court, and which were made by three individuals acting independently of each other, demonstrate that the payments made to the non-public schools are justified in amount, and are still substantially less for the actual cost of performance of the services. 
    Appellees do not dispute these conclusions, except by alleging that the administration of test is a part of the teaching function of the non-public schools and then consequently New York is paying the schools for the cost of education. 
    This is a matter of perspective. 
    From the State's point of view, we are not paying the schools to administer tests as part of the educational program of the schools, but rather as a method of evaluating the achievement of the schools in meeting minimum standards of education. 
    This assumes that the teaching function per se has been completed prior to the administration of a test as a measuring device, and we submit that is the more reasonable viewpoint on the aspect of the State's payment -- in this -- this regard. 
    The past decisions of this Court have not prohibited all payments or benefits to non-public schools. 
    Justice, they have not permitted all payments or benefits. 
    In Everson, the activities which were described as prohibited were those directed to the aid of religion as such. 
    In McGowan this Court observed that the establishment cost does not ban state or federal regulations of conduct whose effect merely happens to coincide with the tenets of some religions. 
    Again in Everson, the Court expressed the concept of neutrality, stating that the Constitution does not require the State to be the adversary of religion. 
    In both (Inaudible) and McGowan, this Court discussed the intent and effect test by which a statute is measured as to whether it has a secular legislative intent and a primary effect which neither aids nor inhibits religion. 
    In Walz the test by which legislations were being measured was expanded to include an evaluation as to where the statute of issue created an excessive entanglement between church and state. 
    In discussing whether or not the New York statute here at issue meets objections under each of these tests, we must bear in mind the observation of this Court's opinion in Lemon that the line between permissible and impermissible legislation is not a wall but rather a blurred, indistinct and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship.

    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    Yes, Your Honor, because the -- the state Commissioner's regulations require the non-public schools to have a continual – in-school program of testing of pupils to measure educational achievement and that the testing involved here includes not only the general test imposed by the State which are statewide in application but also the state's examination of the test administered in the schools to determine whether or not the pupils in all grades are meeting levels of educational achievement.

    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    It would be possible to so construe it and that might raise a question as to the relationship of the amount paid. 
    There was a -- there was a cost analysis study which is Exhibit G which referred only to the statewide tests and comes less than the amount paid to the schools. 
    However, that it should also be noted that that particular cost analysis study, while it related only to statewide tests, do not include the other record-keeping functions such as health records and attendance records and so forth which were included in the other studies which included the teacher testing.

    From your response to the one of the other, earlier questions, it would seem to me at least, that New York State is unique in not having any standards, computations for the teachers. 
    Some of the States, at least, have the same requirements applied to private and parochial church schools as for public schools and are -- are you sure that New York doesn't require those same standards for the teachers in a -- in a church school? 
    That as a college degree, if a college degree is required to teach eighth grade or junior high school in public schools, are you telling us that that is not required?

    I don't think the record does to take my own understanding is that. 
    It doesn't have, at least, in the elementary school level. 
    It may have it on secondary school, or it doesn't have. 
    The position of the appellees in this case is that this Act, Chapter 138 is not what it purports be. 
    But whether it is considered what it really is or whether it's considered what it purports to be, is equally unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause. 
    The Act purports to be a law of to compensate private schools for certain service which are mandated by law and regulation. 
    But aside from a sort of talismanic reference to it, perhaps to satisfy the purpose effect requirement which had been expressed before this law was enacted. 
    The declaratory, the (Inaudible), it's declaration of purpose refers to these mandated services of testing and record-keeping. 
    And that is the last there is in the law. 
    The rest, the operational act, part of the Act has no reference to it. 
    Each school gets a specific amount per child, $28 for each pupil in grades one to six, $45 in each -- for each pupil, grades six through 12. 
    It matters not whether the -- this is the way that the -- the law is interpreted and applied by the State. 
    It matters not that the actual cost of these mandated services in a particular year is $1 or $5 or $10. 
    The school gets $28 per student or $45 per student without regard to what is expected. 
    The school is not required to account for the money. 
    It gets the money per student and does with it what it wills.

    -- of the main brief?
speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="1629.579" stopTime="1848.265">
    Mr. Leo Pfeffer 
    -- of main brief, (Inaudible) brief of the State of New York. 
    So, under the bottom of the page, the overwhelming the majority of tests given on public and non-public schools alike are formulated, administered, and created by teachers. 
    These are the tests which take care of two-thirds of the whole cost. 
    Eliminate that and you have an amount which is considered to be substantially less than the amount which is given per student. 
    But even that is not relevant because the State takes a position that is irrelevant how much money is spent for these mandated services. 
    The amount is given per pupil and not on the basis of what the cost is. 
    These cost analysis were not applied by law. 
    They were made in litem for the purpose of preparing for this -- for this case after we brought the suit. 
    And that -- and the -- the stake -- states in this interrogatory, it was a part of interrogatory. 
    It does not ask what the money is for. 
    It doesn't require any reporting. 
    And it takes a position that the amount is fixed by law and this is the amount which is unchangeable whether the costs go up or go down. 
    Now, there's another point which I'd like to call the Court's attention. 
    I think Ms. Coon is not correct in stating that this money is used to reimburse for expenditures already made. 
    The law was passed in 1970 to take effect the following year. 
    And during each year, the school gets per pupil according to the amount of students in that -- during that current year. 
    The first year, the school is allowed to choose, the months of September, October, November, which month it will take to measure the number of students to test. 
    And for that year, that is a number taken for $28 or $45. 
    Thereafter, the year before the current year is used as a base year. 
    But the payment is not made for the base year. 
    The -- they've already been paid for the base year. 
    The payment is made for the current year and that's a fact. 
    That in the event that there is a difference between the student enrollment during the current year, or the base year, an adjustment is made accordingly. 
    Moreover, the Act provides that the payment is to be made in two portions.One is payable January 15th and the other is paid April 15th for the current year. 
    Now April 15th is two-and-a-half months before the end of the school year. 
    There is nothing in the Act or in its administration which prevents a school teacher or school principal, or superintendent of the school of the religious schools saying to the teachers, “We're short of money for our religious teaching. 
    We're short of money for our religious worship. 
    We've got to carve out in-class tests.” 
    No more class testing. 
    Use all that money for the two-and-a-half months. 
    We're getting it now. 
    Use all that money to pay for catechism, to pay for religious worship. 
    According to the State of New York, that is perfectly permissible. 
    There are no strings attached to this money, no reporting, no auditing, only the -- only auditing required is to establish how many students there are during the year.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Of course if New York set up a system with strings attached in auditing, then you'd be here saying there was too much entanglement, wouldn't you?

    Mr. Leo Pfeffer 
    Your Honor is entirely correct.

    Mr. Leo Pfeffer 
    That's exactly what the point is. 
    This is what the Court said in Lemon. 
    It's in the inside of the dilemma. 
    Either you give money which can be used for religious purposes which the Court has said is unconstitutional, in which case you have the (Inaudible) of financing religious instruction, or you audit and you supervise as they try to do in Lemon which is this (Inaudible) of entanglement. 
    The answer is of course that the law is unconstitutional, but that's not unusual. 
    That's what the Court said in Lemon against Kurtzman. 
    That's what Court said in Tilton against Richardson. 
    In Tilton against Richardson, the Court report said, an unrestricted grant of money, which is partly used to build a building, which after 20 years may be used to hold religious classes, that's unconstitutional. 
    You cannot have a “no strings attached” grant of money to a religious school.

    Mr. Leo Pfeffer 
    Honors please, the complaint in this action, challenges the law, add on its face and as construed and applied. 
    I've devoted myself up till now, to the law as applied. 
    And I've have pointed out that the law as applied does not require the schools to in anyway account for the money received. 
    This is substantiated and it is established by the interrogatories was submitted to the state and their response to it on the appendix pages 87A and 88A in which the State says the qualifying schools are not required to submit the reports and copy for the moneys received and how they are expended. 
    Also, that means, it's a free -- they have a freehand on it, no strings attached. 
    Also, I want to call to the Court's attention to the fact that as applied and this is -- comes from the second of the in litem cost analysis made by the State after the suit was started, that in two typical schools which they selected, the Catholic Central High School and the North Shore Hebrew Academy and I point this out, I get these references on page one in my brief. 
    The schools -- the first school received $77,878 under the law. 
    Taking in account everything other than teachers' examinations, that means this region's examination of pupil evaluation tests, record-keeping, health-keeping, everything conceivable under the Act which is mandated, which is not mandated and this includes indirect costs and so-called kind and benefit cost which these teachers give as in -- in kind taking them all. 
    According to the State's own cost analysis, the sum total of all these, the most liberally interpreted mandated service is $24,674 which is less than one-third of the amount received under the statute. 
    The only way you can justify this statute is the other two-thirds of it, is if teachers examination, the kind of examination which a teacher give in every school, oral or written, daily quizzes, weekly quizzes are included. 
    You get two-thirds of sum total is set. 
    The same is true with the second, also in page 20. 
    The second typical school, the North Shore Hebrew Academy, they receive for $5,400

    Mr. Leo Pfeffer 
    Page 20 -- It's on Exhibit D and Exhibit G, $5400 as North Shore Academy received under the statute. 
    Its total cost for other than in-school teachers' testing, is $1776 again less than one-third. 
    So that the answer to the question which was just to Justice Blackmun. 
    If this statute were interpreted narrowly to limit it only to these, to exclude teacher's test and quizzes. 
    The guts of the statute will be out. 
    Two-thirds of the amount would be destroyed. 
    Now there's no question that's not worth an answer. 
    Now, but assume – assume the statute is what is says to this. 
    I will now, at this point, accept the statute at face value and accept that teachers' examinations is a kind of teaching, a kind of examinations which are done every day on schools take up two-thirds of the time. 
    That that is what is properly within the statute. 
    It's our opinion that this statute is unconstitutional on its face for a variety of reasons. 
    It's indistinguishable from Lemon against Kurtzman. 
    Ms. Coon has responded to a question put by one member of the Court as to whether teaching itself is not mandated, which was involved in Lemon against Kurtzman, teaching, teaching of the secular subjects. 
    Her actual -- I was unable to quite understand. 
    She said it's not mandated because the school voluntarily establishes itself to teach. 
    If it didn't voluntarily establish itself to teach, it wouldn't be required to teach. 
    But that's equally true about these reporting. 
    If a school, the private school did not voluntarily undertake to teach, they wouldn't to have to or submit reports of any kind. 
    It's their -- the statute in New York as in Pennsylvania, hasn't ruled that. 
    It requires a number of things. 
    It requires that you teach certain nine or eight or nine basic courses which was involved in Lemon against Kurtzman and DiCenso against Robinson. 
    It also requires that you'll keep records and you report them. 
    I can see no distinction between them. 
    If one is unconstitutional, I can't see how the other is -- is constitutional. 
    Moreover, keeping records, and testing is not the only thing required of these schools by law. 
    They're required to be safe, they're required to be sanitary, they're required to be well lit, they're required be in every way respected – acceptable. 
    Otherwise, they're violating the law. 
    As Ms. Coon suggests, that because the State requires that schools be safe and sanitary and lit and heated, that the State can constitutionally, on the statute of clause pay for the fuel bills, pay for the lighting bills, repair the buildings, the church buildings --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me clear that step further Mr. Pfeffer. 
    Suppose the State required an annual or semi-annual examination, X-rays, or chest X-rays and annual inoculations for polio. 
    It gave private schools the choice of either having the state supply the service, a mobile medical unit or to let the private schools engage the services themselves with their own physicians and pay them $5 a head or $10 a head. 
    What would you say about that?
speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="2486.090" stopTime="2500.574">
    Mr. Leo Pfeffer 
    I would say that's constitutional provided, Mr. Chief Justice, provided the schools were account -- were required to account that they did that particular thing. 
    That they used the money for that purpose, for the inoculations, but this not required here.

    That would be entanglement, wouldn't it?
speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="2501.584" stopTime="2586.608">
    Mr. Leo Pfeffer 
    No. 
    That would not be entanglement. 
    This is what, the difference between this case and Everson -- and -- and how, there is no religious aspect to an inoculation. 
    You -- that inoculation doesn't but as the Court pointed out in Lemon against Kurtzman, there was only a world of a difference in teaching. 
    A teacher can't if this is from the Lemon, a teacher can and while he may not, some may, some may not, may use the teaching for the purpose of inducting any religion. 
    And this is exactly equally respected testing. 
    If you include in-class testing, and I have put forth in my brief examples of testing in respect to the most valued three subjects of Mathematics. 
    I've given examples of actually types of (Inaudible) used and proposed in which you're fully impregnated with religious values. 
    Now, I don't say that the school -- any of the schools in New York use those tests. 
    I don't know whether they do it or they don't but that's not important. 
    The point that -- the Court pointed out in Lemon, that the point is that only to make sure as a must in order to avoid financing religion to make sure that it doesn't do it, this State has an obligation to maintain a continuing surveillance.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2586.608" stopTime="2600.799">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well that would be true in the inoculation case because the school might take the money and use it for religious teaching, (Voice Overlap) and -- and therefore the State would to be assured that the school had not done that and that would entangle the State with the school, would it not?

    Mr. Leo Pfeffer 
    The -- the entanglement would be limited to -- not to examining what's taught, to limit it just to a doctor's certificate. 
    Yes, we inoculate 50 students here and we have to pay for $250. 
    There are no entanglements there. 
    That's not entanglement.

    Oh, we'll say it's -- or is the Christian Science school accepted it and use for -- for inoculations? 
    Oh that will be all right. 
    That will be all right. 
    I think so. 
    Now, the point is, I think it is completely unrealistic. 
    I think it's just as a fantasy world to seek to the divorce testing, day by day testing, examinations written on a front page. 
    From the days of Plato, those testings have been the basic way of teaching, the major way of teaching religion as a catechism. 
    That's traditionally, what is a catechism? 
    It's a form of teaching by testing. 
    The teacher asks questions, the student answers. 
    If a student answers correctly he's learning his lesson. 
    If he's somehow stucky, he studies some more. 
    Every student knows that in order to pass his course, he has to pass examinations. 
    How do you pass examinations? 
    You give the teacher what the teacher wants, how? 
    Now, you take the two schools here, the Catholic Academy and the north -- the Hebrew Academy and the Catholic School. 
    I am certain, that a student in a Catholic Central High School would not answer a question on history on the Reformation the way the same question would be answered by a student in Lutheran High School. 
    Or take a question on the origins of Christianity. 
    I am sure that a student in the North Shore Hebrew Academy would not, if he wants to pass the course, answer that question the same way that a student in the Catholic Central School will do. 
    Teaching is two ways. 
    One way, and the least effective way, is for this teacher to stand in front and lecture and lecture. 
    And then send the students home. 
    A most effective way is for the teacher to get it from the students. 
    That's way it's done. 
    And the State says, it applies to everyday teaching, written, and art.

    I don't know --

    That -- that still gives us some -- it has entanglement and gives us some aid to church-operated institution does it not?
speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="2847.904" stopTime="3045.609">
    Mr. Leo Pfeffer 
    Well the -- the -- my answer to that would be, that the ROTC is generally as far as I know up until now, is at college level, and in Tilton versus Richardson, this Court held that there are more liberal rules with respect to -- at the college level than expect the elementary and high school level. 
    So that, I don't think it would necessarily be the same answer. 
    I would have reservations on the elementary and secondary sides and level. 
    It would certainly have reservations on it. 
    Now, in Lemon, this Court said that, in Lemon and DiCenso that the State of Rhode Island and the State of Pennsylvania were obligated under the Constitution, as well as in the statute to see to it that the money given to the teachers was used only for secular teaching. 
    That it couldn't have given the money and say, use it for secular teaching but make no examination, no verification whether it's been used as a purpose. 
    And then the courts went and said, well that very verification -- you see, the answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's questions, that very auditing -- that very surveillance, that very required constitutionally and statutory requirement, assurance that it is not used for sectarian instruction, or religious worship, that involve, that surveillance which from Walz through Lemon, the Court said is forbidden by the Establishment Clause. 
    Yes, it is true that -- that if -- if there were no audits here as there isn't, we call any stuff constitutional because it is financing, subsidizing religious education and if there is some audits if there is surveillance and there is policing, we say it's unconstitutional because it involves entanglement. 
    But that's not our dilemma. 
    That's a dilemma of the Establishment Clause. 
    That's a dilemma of a history of over a 150, 175 years where State after State, court after court, constitution after constitution said you cannot do what you're trying to do here. 
    You cannot take tax-raised funds and use it to pay part of the upgraded course whether it's required by law or not required law of church schools. 
    This is what it's all about is what the Establishment Clause says and this what the Court said in Yoder. 
    That long before there was a public school system, there were the a religion clauses and that's the policies, the constitutional interests which were set forth in the religion clause, as to date, our educational system -- our educational system had to shape itself to the establishment in the Free Exercise Clause, not the establishment of Free Exercise Clause to shape themselves and fashion themselves to the educational interest. 
    This is what this case is about. 
    This -- this case says, the court below says, you cannot take an import element of the budget of a church school in order for you to operate. 
    You cannot take it off the voluntary contribution of those who adhere to and make an -- an obligation of every taxpayer. 
    That's a violation of what, the Establishment Clause of a Constitution. 
    Your Honors, thank you very much.

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    I believe in one or two of them, courses in religion are required. 
    A -- a challenge of worship is not the -- the answers to our interrogatories. 
    Spell that out -- they -- they spell that out, I think. 
    We are here in this that this statute has been enacted. 
    A unique statute in reliance on the language of this Court in the Allen case, if -- this Court there said, if the State must satisfy its interest in secular education through the instrument of private schools, it has a proper interest in the manner in which those schools perform their secular education function. 
    That is what we say this Act was designed to do. 
    It's already been brought out, but it should be emphasized again that public and private schools in the State of New York are part of one system, and subject to one set of control. 
    They've been under the university in the State of New York since 1784. 
    They've been required to be compulsory examined, tested, and inspected since I think 1852. 
    Take the case of a child who goes to a Catholic high school. 
    He has to take courses prescribed by the Regents, the State of New York, his attendance records are kept. 
    He takes examinations, and when he takes them, the same of so-called, Regents' examinations, they're the same examinations that are taught, that are given down the street in George Washington High School and if he passes them, he gets a diploma. 
    And who does he get the diploma from? 
    He gets the same diploma as his friend down the street. 
    He gets the diploma signed, not by the bishop, not by the pastor, but by the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York. 
    The degree of control is illustrated by one regulation which is, that if a school, public or private wants to give a course where there is not, an already an approved syllabus, permission from the State of Education Department must be had before that course is to be taught. 
    Mr. Pfeffer's arguments and his bookkeeping depend on one fundamental fallacy. 
    He overlooks the fact that this is a reimbursement statute. 
    This talk about, the money goes out, they can use it for whatever they like, overlooks the fact that chronologically, what has happened is this. 
    The school sends in a form asking a large number of questions and testing whole, do you comply with this and this section of the law? 
    What courses do you give in fire protection? 
    What courses do you give and so on and so on. 
    Before you're eligible to -- you have to fill that out in order to get the money. 
    And they say that you'll have to certify that you have conducted the testing requirements that you have had to attend -- kept attendance requirements and done all the other things required for the mandated services. 
    The school will have done all that out of its own pocket. 
    It will be out that much money. 
    And then later on, it gets a reimbursement. 
    Now, that reimbursement --

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    No, it is not.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3364.270" stopTime="3366.827">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So how can it be reimbursement?
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="3366.827" stopTime="3374.363">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    Well, it's -- it's a partial reimbursement because it's less than the cost that the school undertook.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3374.363" stopTime="3376.686">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Could -- could it be a contribution?
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="3376.686" stopTime="3578.401">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    A contribution toward that but the point that I make is, the school, whatever it is, the school is -- out of the money it has performed the services. 
    It gets back a partial, not larger, a partial reimbursement. 
    That partial reimbursement of course becomes its own money. 
    Let me go back to an analogy. 
    What about this parent in the Everson bus case? 
    He paid out of his own pockets for a bus fair. 
    He later got it back. 
    Was that money segregated or tainted or marked by sectarian influence? 
    No, he got it back, he could use it to put into play. 
    He could use it to go to the races. 
    It was a reimbursement for a legitimate expense. 
    So, with all respect, I say that this talk about audits is completely beside the point. 
    The point is that the school is required to perform a large number, an appalling number of administrative services for the State. 
    I want to cite an illustration. 
    I just happened to notice that the records of attendance and other basic data in connection with these -- these applications are required by the State to be maintained, opened to inspection of the schools' files for at least 50 years. 
    Did the parent in the textbook case who was relieved of the cost of buying textbooks? 
    Did he get sectarian -- was it sectarian money? 
    Was it sectarian reimbursement? 
    No, the point I'm making is, that if this is a reimbursement, where funds are already expended, it's completely immaterial where the money goes. 
    The partial reimbursement was deliberately fixed by law in the judgment of the legislature which should be conclusive. 
    And it was fixed in such a way that there would be no overage. 
    The cost studies made after the suit was brought, all bear that out. 
    Let me give you just one little illustration from one of the exhibits. 
    In mode two, they studied how much it costs the schools to perform the mandated services. 
    They took a public high school and a Catholic high school and a public elementary school and a Catholic elementary school. 
    They applied the same bookkeeping tests to both of them to see how much it costs. 
    Holy Trinity High School in Hicksville for doing the State's bookkeeping for it, cost that school $232.90 per pupil, and they got back $45. 
    Hicksville High School at the same time, same town, it cost them $361.72, one-third more. 
    Corpus Christi Elementary School and Mineola Catholic, it cost them $77.56 to do the state's work for it. 
    They got back $27. 
    Willis Avenue Elementary Public School across the street, cost them $474.12 to do the same services. 
    And so, as to all the other --

    Well -- I -- I -- apparently because the Catholic schools are -- pinch their pennies a bit tighter while the Mineola High School --

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    For Mineola High School may have -- I believe that was a new school with not too large an enrollment that may have come to more. 
    That -- but let me take others from the same study, Holy Family Elementary in Hicksville cost them $86, got back $27. 
    The Dutch Lane Elementary School, it cost them $198, still much larger, but not quite as large as the -- as the Mineola figure. 
    So, it simply shows that there is no padding and no excess and that applying the same bookkeeping methods fairly to both public and private schools shows or demonstrates the fact that there can be no overage and no excess. 
    As a matter of fact, all three Judges in the trial court agreed that there was no excess. 
    Judge Palmieri pointed it out very forcefully in his dissent. 
    The other judges said that if you take out of account teacher exams, then there's very -- the -- the cost or -- then the reimbursement might, in some instances, exceed the cost. 
    But the point is we maintain that the teacher exam should not be taken out. 
    They're in the statute, they are specifically provided for in a regulation which my opponent has not even cited in his brief. 
    I see my time is running very short and I will close, Your Honor, with one further thought. 
    We've heard something about dilemmas today. 
    Consider this dilemma. 
    The State has a right to have parochial schools perform effectively. 
    It has a right to have testing and examination done, not for the purpose of educating them, but for the purpose of seeing how well they are being educated. 
    If it costs -- it admittedly costs schools a lot of money to do it. 
    If relief of this sort is not allowed, another alternative, if it once comes up, may I just finish my sentence. 
    A core of state inspectors, if it's all wrong to reimburse a school for doing this kind of work, it's obviously all right to send the core of inspectors in every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to keep attendance records, to give examinations, prior to the teacher from the room for the moment and give an examination and do all the bookkeeping work. 
    That would require quite a few more people in Albany and would, I think, result in entanglement of a source of -- of a sort that has hardly been conceived.
