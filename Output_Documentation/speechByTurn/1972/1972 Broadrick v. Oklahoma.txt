Broadrick v. Oklahoma

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in 71-1639, Broadrick against Oklahoma. 
    Mr. Buckingham, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="50.623" stopTime="210.434">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This case is on appeal from a three-judge Federal Court decision, denying appellants' civil class action for injunctive relief to enjoin the deprivation of the civil rights of the appellants and all classified employees in the State of Oklahoma. 
    The appellees with State Personnel Board, initiated proceedings against the appellants seeking to dismiss said appellants from employment by the State Corporation Commission for alleged political activities under Title 74 going to statute -- Section 818. 
    This action by the State Personnel Board precipitated the filing of the suit in Federal Court. 
    The questions presented on this appeal maybe briefly stated as follows. 
    May a state by statute proscribe in broad and general terms First Amendment rights of state employees and two, may a state constitutionally classify the employees of some, but not all of the state agencies and broadly prohibit the employees of those agencies from enjoying First Amendment rights while permitting the unclassified employees of the state, all other public employees and the citizenry at large to freely enjoy the same. 
    Now we urge to this honorable Court, that such proscriptions by a state statute are wanting in constitutional acceptability are of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. 
    If the political activities prohibition provisions of the Hatch Act in the previous case are found to be subject to successful challenges as being vague and overbroad, a fortiori the political activities prohibition provision of the Oklahoma Merit Act should be determined as constitutionally warranted. 
    If however, the political activities prohibition provisions of the Hatch Act are found to be constitutionally sound, it does not necessarily follow that the political activities or proscriptions of the Oklahoma Merit Act are constitutionally well found as said proscriptions are inherently distinguishable from the pertinent portions of Federal Hatch Act.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Which would you regard as the more lenient to the two acts?

    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    I would suggest the Hatch Act is more lenient.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Let me ask you another question while I have you interrupted is the reverse. 
    When this action was begun, were there not state disciplinary proceedings pending?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="228.463" stopTime="230.925">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    There were, sir.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="230.925" stopTime="234.923">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Could one man say that the Federal Court should have abstained?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="234.923" stopTime="278.494">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    No, sir. 
    We feel in this particular instance because facially the statutes involved which predicated the action against the state employees are both so vague and broad as to permit the Federal Courts under 1983, because the civil rights in question involved to rules specifically on that statute. 
    Abstention to make all additional employees who may have conducted, the State Personnel Board feel should warrant some kind of action, prosecutory action under these two Sections we feel it is untenable when you read the two statutes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="278.494" stopTime="289.908">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but then Younger against Harris involved a claim of over facial, over-breadth too, didn't it? 
    Isn't really the only distinction between that and this and that this is civil and that was criminal?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="289.908" stopTime="321.810">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    No, sir. 
    We feel in our particular case, in this particular statute, as you know in the Hatch Act and further acts, there are some proscribed permitted activities, political activities perhaps non partisan activities. 
    The Oklahoma statute does not describe any permitted political activities of any kind other than a private expression and the right to vote with the use of such terms as --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="321.810" stopTime="327.931">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You may not take but the disciplinary proceedings that were pending, whether they are administrative proceedings?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="327.931" stopTime="345.581">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    No, sir. 
    They are administrative proceedings insofar as the determination under the Oklahoma Merit Act, that if the charges are valid then they will be discharged from their jobs. 
    In addition, under the particular act, if they are discharged, criminal actions in the nature of misdemeanor can also be brought against them.

speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="350.793" stopTime="361.331">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    The proceedings that were pending were an action by the State Personnel Board and in effect have the Corporation Commission show cause why these employees and these employees should not be dismissed from their jobs.

    Sir, we have had two decisions involving Oklahoma Merit Act and these simply were questions raised as of the validity of Merit Act and essentially whether or not they could delegate certain rule making functions to the State Personnel Board.

    And over-breadth, both sir.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I read your questions presented both in the jurisdictional statement and in your brief, and I do not find any mention of the word vagueness anywhere. 
    Your opposition argues it and I wondered whether you had conceded that the statute was not vague?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="529.296" stopTime="623.898">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    No, sir, we have not, Your Honor. 
    I thought, that I had used the phrase vagueness and over-breadth, and I specifically direct your attention to, if I may and I think would the Court, if I can read these two short provisions that are involved, the sections that we are actually complained of I think and I can point out the problem. 
    Some unnumbered Paragraph six states, “no employee in the classified service and no member of the Personnel Board shall directly or indirectly solicit, receive or in any manner the concerned and soliciting or receiving any assessment, subscription or contribution for any political organization, candidacy or other political purpose and no state officer or state employee in an unclassified service shall solicit or receive any such assessment, subscription or contribution from an employee in the classified service.” 
    Next, unnumbered Paragraph seven, “no employee in a classified service shall be a member of any national state or local committee of a political party or an officer or member of a committee of a partisan political club or a candidate for nomination or election to any paid public office or shall take part in the management or affairs of any political party or in any political campaign except to exercise his right as a citizen, privately to express his opinion and cast his vote.” 
    I respectfully suggest sir, that you could not hardly get more vague than the use of a phrase “The affairs of a political party.”
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="623.898" stopTime="633.340">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    That maybe, but I agree with your questions presented, and I find nothing like that in your brief?

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Which of your questions presented perhaps can we can get at more specifically?

speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="644.637" stopTime="671.298">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Well, I can very honestly state to the Court. 
    I think that the Court is probably correct that insofar as the not in any word in the brief, in here the brief that I filed or the jurisdictional statement, utilized and specifically pointed out that word of the statute. 
    I have used generalities in terms of referring to the statutes being over-broad and vague. 
    The vagueness, I humbly submit to you that by virtue --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="671.298" stopTime="679.479">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    But, the third question on page 5 on the jurisdictional statement says, “take part of the management and affairs by the political party.”

    Mr. John C. Buckingham

    We feel that it is patently obvious that the political activity proscriptions of the Oklahoma Merit Act impair First Amendment rights of Oklahoma state employees in a classified service.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Your number three is almost precisely the language of the Hatch Act, is it not or at least its thrust is precisely the same, management or affairs?

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="752.176" stopTime="767.198">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Did the three-judge District Court before whom your case went in Oklahoma have to construe the statute in order to reach the determination that it did? It is hard to tell from their opinion I think?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="767.198" stopTime="890.389">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Yes, sir. 
    Insofar as the construction is concerned, the jurisdictional statement has attached the opinion of the three-judge Federal Court and I cannot go beyond what they state there as to what they did as far as construing it. 
    Additionally, it is obvious that the political activity's proscription of the Oklahoma Merit Act affecting only those state employees who are in the classified services repugnant to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. 
    In this regard, we would like to request respectfully that the Court direct its attention to page 29 of the answer brief, of the Attorney General, which seems to suggest that the difference between classified and unclassified employees coincides with the classification of ministerial and policy forming officers. 
    In other words, it seems to indicate the Attorney General feels that the policy forming officers are generally unclassified. 
    Then, if you go to the Merit Act involved which sets forth the unclassified employees, I respectfully submit that these are some of the unclassified employees. 
    Sub-section eight, patient and inmate health in the state charitable, penal, mental, and correctional institutions. 
    Sub paragraph 13, temporary seasonal foreign labors or other foreign help engaged in single phrase of agriculture production or harvesting, not to exceed 120 calendar days in any year. 
    Sub 15; labor, semi-skilled and skilled craftsman, temporarily engaged for purposes of building, renovation or remodeling and paid on an hourly or piece work basis provided the request is made by the appointing authority and is approved by the State Personnel Board.

    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Well, under the act, there are certain designated agencies which are designated as classified, certain employees are classified, then the governor may select certain classified employees. 
    But, I think as we note in the jurisdictional statement and seeing the section on unclassified employees, there are some 22 different, various exemptions under the statute for unclassified employees. 
    Now it's hard for us to conceive how a secretary working at the Corporation Commission as a typist wearing a political button, endorsing a candidate, how this is relevant to some governmental purpose where she should be deprived the Bill of Rights to wear this button, as opposed to a secretary in the Attorney General’s office.

    Does the term classified in your statute connote job tenure of some sort?

    Mr. John C. Buckingham

    The Hatch Act does recognize certain political activity which they recognize that employees could engage in. 
    In other words, there isn't affirmative provisions in the Hatch Act if it is non-partisan political activities. 
    There is no such language in the Oklahoma statute. 
    There is no recognition of any kind of activity, political activity that you can engage in other than if you would consider the right to vote, and to privately hold an opinion, as being a political activity that you engage in. 
    In this respect, we're saying that the Oklahoma is more restrictive.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    (Inaudible) Judge of court in paragraph nine, conclusions of law, there is an interpretation of your act to the effect that it does not restrict public and private expressions on public affairs and personalities, so long as employee does not channel his activity to a party's success. 
    Assuming for the moment that it could not have authority to interpret Oklahoma law, would you accept that final interpretation?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="1209.079" stopTime="1330.682">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    No sir. 
    I think recently the Attorney General who is in this case actually referring not for its party success, there was a candidate involved in the city election, which was non-partisan, where an activity was taken part as I understand by a Corporation Commission employee and charges were filed, being violative of the political prohibition section of the Oklahoma Merit Act. 
    That seems to negate that determination in the Federal Court's finding number nine. 
    At least, the State Personnel Board did not feel that, that would be a prohibition against them bringing charges against an employee perhaps indicated a preference for a candidate that was running for a city office, not on a partisan political basis. 
    The Attorney General throughout his brief and first that the object and/or aim of the Oklahoma Merit Act were directed at the evils of partisan politics, equating part and partisan politics with evil. 
    Now, the appellants in this case strongly dissent to that type of a conclusion. 
    The evils the act were directed against were the coercion, intimidation and misuse of authority which might exploit the employees by governmental superiors. 
    We respectfully suggest the act was not directed against the voluntary participation and partisan political activity by a classified state employee. 
    In this regard, we point out that the purposed clause of the Merit Act simply sets forth what you would expect a purpose clause to provide all citizens a fair and equal opportunity for public service, to establish conditions and service which will attract officers and employees of character and ability.

    Will isn't that other factors a legislature takes into account that is that they do not want to put a premium on having a man enlarge his staff for any particular departments in order to have that many more people to work on political activities?

    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Yes, sir. 
    I have to agree with you, yes sir. 
    That will certainly and undoubtedly has been in mind of many legislators insofar as enacting provisions. 
    But, what we are saying in this case very simply is that there is a suggestion for what can you do to striking this particular provision, political prohibition provisions. 
    That is a rather drastic step. 
    Isn't there an easier way? 
    Wouldn't it be difficult to drop the statute? 
    I suggest to you that it would be difficult to draft the statute but you could have drafted a statute where you positively set forth what particular political activities could be enjoyed by all employees as opposed to proscribing in “Blanket prohibitions” those acts which they cannot do. 
    This seems as a possibility as an answer. 
    I suggest that it appears to me with the vast number of state employees that we have throughout both in Oklahoma and throughout the country. 
    That they ought to be given the opportunity to voluntarily exercise political expression. 
    I think, this is without a doubt a foundation of our system of government.

    I think the putting on a button is an expression of political opinion. 
    I would say that, that's more closely connote a private expression of political opinion as opposed to being an act that should be curtailed. The State Personnel Board has enacted a particular provision interpreting the political prohibition section of the Oklahoma Merit Act, where they say that is partisan political activity. 
    Bumper stickers are also political activities.

   Argument of Mike D. Martin
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1682.120" stopTime="1686.031">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Martin?
speaker="mike_d_martin" startTime="1686.031" stopTime="1846.869">
    Mr. Mike D. Martin 
    Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In 1947, this Court upheld in Mitchell case and a companion case, Oklahoma versus Civil Service Commission, you have applied the Federal Hatch Act prohibitions to state employees that are federally funded. 
    The Oklahoma legislature 1959 in enacting the Oklahoma Merit System Act, the Personnel Administration, Incorporated in that act, political activity prohibitions against classified employees of the Merit System. 
    This Act is modeled after the Federal Hatch Act. 
    In fact, the Act provides in one of the sections that the State Personnel Board is required and directed to alter any rules or regulations it has, the conflict with standards or conditions of Federal grants recognizing that the federally funded employees that work for the state are subject to the prohibitions of the Federal Hatch Act. 
    There are some differences between the Federal Hatch Act, and our state political activity prohibitions. 
    Basically, it's a matter of degree. 
    I believe that the state took the prophylactic approach that was upheld in Mitchell as a method for proscribing political activity on behalf of state employees. 
    In doing so, they did not incorporate by reference any case decisions, as there were none in Oklahoma. 
    They did, however, provide that the Personnel Board could by rule enact rules and regulations to carry out the effect and purposes of the Act. 
    The State Personnel Board has done so, and they continue to enact rules and regulations regarding not only the entire Merit System, but the political activity prohibitions. 
    In addition, the language, the facial language of Section 818 has some differences which are not contained in the current Federal Hatch Act. 
    There are references to privately expressing his opinion and casting his vote which I believe has been raised by my brother counselor. 
    We would urge that --

    The prophylactic approach of Mitchell is the current approach that the state has used and has currently adopted.

    Mr. Mike D. Martin 
    Yes, he could have asked for an opinion. 
    I believe that the vagueness test we have cited out in Grayned versus City of Rockford is controlling in our case, we notice that the state employees have in regard to the prohibitions is given not only by the facial language of the statute itself, but also from rules and regulations set forth by the Personnel Board, circulars that are issued by the Personnel Board to each employee prescribing and setting forth what activities he can be involved in, and what activities he cannot be involved in. 
    In addition, there are Attorney General’s opinions which as I indicated earlier have force and effect of law and which employees and agencies are required to follow. 
    These opinions have alternatively down through the years, interpreted the prohibitions to be prohibitions against partisan activity. 
    The standards which the Personnel Board has to enforce this political activity prohibition is sufficient to meet the test and grant it. 
    They themselves has set forth rules, and they also guide themselves by the Federal Hatch Act prohibitions through the Oklahoma versus Civil Service Commission case and a provision in the statute itself which requires them to alter the rules and regulations which conflict with those standards that apply to Federal grants. 
    So they themselves adhere to standards which they set themselves and which are set through the Federal Hatch Act. 
    The employees themselves have access to advisory opinions from the Personnel Board which is indicated to them in a circular that is distributed. 
    They have access to the rules and regulations of the Board which further define the prohibition set out in the statute, and under certain conditions they can ask for Attorney General’s opinion if they get someone to ask who has authority to. 
    The broadness test, over-breadth test that supplied to this case particular in relation to the language of the statute itself. 
    Appellants contend that it prohibits constitutionally protected speech as well as non-protected. 
    The three-judge panel correctly held that the prohibitions were against partisan political activity, and were not over-broad while the specific language itself does not with perhaps as certainly as appellants would like, connote that it is only partisan political activity that is prohibited the particular wording of the statute gives that connotation. 
    In addition, the Attorney General earlier in 1968, in an Attorney General’s opinion that those prohibitions were against partisan political activity only. 
    The enforcement of those provisions by the Personnel Board and the circulars that they issue to state employees also specify that they are partisan political activity prohibitions.

    Mr. Mike D. Martin 
    Yes, I would think so, and I would think that the definition of party politics is broadly that which is aimed at instigating a state government a particular belief or espousing a particular platform, which currently has a two-party system but there are independents, and other parties, actually American party which -- are parties because they espouse a particular belief or attempt to set forth particular policies in state government which are unique onto themselves. 
    So I think in that regard, it would be a prohibition against someone working for an independent candidate via such an organization.

speaker="mike_d_martin" startTime="2829.677" stopTime="3022.383">
    Mr. Mike D. Martin 
    Yes, there are three that are in the record but they are not inclusive of all that were issued. 
    There are a number of more that were issued. 
    Now, I will make available as part of the record those opinions. 
    Of the states, 22,000 employees, approximately 20,000 are under the Merit system as classified employees. 
    The prohibition specifically apply only to classified employees. 
    They do apply to unclassified employees to the extent that unclassified employees cannot attempt to solicit funds from classified employees, nor get them involved in partisan politics. 
    The distinction for the prohibitions are related to the enactment of the Merit system of Personnel administration. 
    When the Personnel act was put into effect in 1959, these prohibitions were placed in there and applied only to classified employees. 
    The rationale of the Merit System is to allow the employee to progress in his work free from outside influence including politics. 
    The decision to exempt certain agencies and employees from the classified system was based primarily on the decision that the populace needs some state individuals to express their will. 
    In addition, the unclassified employees are not protected by the Merit System are subject to the whims and caprices of their employees so to speak. 
    They have no recourse in event that they are terminated as to the classified employees. 
    Not only are specific individuals exempted from the Merit System classification, but agencies as a whole are also exempted. 
    While the decision of the legislature to allow the populace to express their will to certain individuals was expressed in the act. 
    They also felt that it was necessary for entire agencies because of the nature of their work to also be exempted, and in this regard, the application of the prohibitions is limitedly applied to them. 
    We think that this is a valid distinction that under the prophylactic approach of Mitchell, the decision to include some state employees under the prohibitions and exclude others is a judgment that has to be weighed by the state and has experienced over the years of the political activity that they are attempting to prohibit. 
    The governor in the state of Oklahoma can by executive order place new agencies under the Merit System or existing agencies that are not under the Merit System. 
    So there is a flexibility as time goes by for the state to continue to combat the evils of partisan politics by placing those unclassified employees and agencies under the prohibitions.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3022.383" stopTime="3031.461">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Does the governor has unrestrictive power at anytime to place any or all categories of state employees under the system?
speaker="mike_d_martin" startTime="3031.461" stopTime="3054.914">
    Mr. Mike D. Martin 
    He has given authority by the Personnel Act to place agencies under the Merit System, and that authority does not exceed the exemptions that are already placed in the statute itself. 
    There are certain statutory exemptions, but as far as newly created agencies, he has the authority to place them under the Merit System by executive order.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3054.914" stopTime="3056.296">

    To do so or not to do so.

    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3059.740" stopTime="3072.734">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you say that the reason for banning political activities by the classified employees is to insulate the employee from political pressure. 
    Is that the aim of it or --?
speaker="mike_d_martin" startTime="3072.734" stopTime="3085.159">
    Mr. Mike D. Martin 
    I think that is one of the reasons. 
    The obvious reason for the enactment of the Merit System is to insulate him from outside influence including politics. 
    I think, the prohibitions apply only to classified employees.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3085.159" stopTime="3092.070">
    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="mike_d_martin" startTime="3092.070" stopTime="3118.306">
    Mr. Mike D. Martin 
    Well, the state unlike the Federal government did not till 1959 make prohibitions against political activity, and during this long period of years since 1907 since we have become a state, it has been apparent to the legislature that the political activity control of state employees was something which was not good for the state.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3118.306" stopTime="3121.901">
    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="mike_d_martin" startTime="3121.901" stopTime="3135.967">
    Mr. Mike D. Martin 
    It was to insulate the employees and to prohibit a party from controlling the state and making its desires and wishes of the state instead of having a neutral state government which was not controlled by a party.

    They had access to the one that was in the record, but they did not have access to all of them since the plaintiffs, appellants here particularly noted that they were not contesting those rules or regulations, just the statute. 
    The conclusion I would like to point out to the Court that Oklahoma has taken the prophylactic approach of Mitchell and we feel that this is the only classical way of combating the evil that is sought to be prohibited. 
    An inclusive approach of setting out all the conduct that has to be prohibited by the statute is impossible, a narrowing construction of the statute would not have the effect of combating the evils that are sought to be prohibited. 
    Now, the prophylactic approach of Mitchell is valid whether it is based upon the rational test, basis test, or the compelling governmental interest test with the least alternative restrictive test, and we feel that the Court should sustain the over court's holding that set prohibitions are constitutional. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of John C. Buckingham
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3409.637" stopTime="3437.003">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Buckingham, I have a question or two if you have the moment on. 
    I suppose it can be assumed or at least let us assume it anyway, that although there were some employees who assisted this Commissioner under whose general jurisdiction they were, there were these people who helped him get reelected, there may have been others who did not help him get reelected. 
    That is a reasonable assumption, is not it?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="3437.003" stopTime="3439.241">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Yes sir, it is.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3439.241" stopTime="3453.422">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is it reasonable assumption for the legislature to think that they want to protect employees from being urged by the Commissioner to engage in political activity?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="3453.422" stopTime="3456.982">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Very reasonable, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3456.982" stopTime="3474.900">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Perhaps those who are requested and declined might not be so favorite if the Commissioner got reelected? 
    That is a possibility. 
    I am not suggesting it is a fact, it is merely a possibility that the legislature might have taken into account. 
    Is that right?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="3474.900" stopTime="3477.883">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Yes sir. 
    I will agree with you again.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3477.883" stopTime="3491.678">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So that would tend to sustain the Attorney General’s view that the purposes were prophylactic or to take Mr. Justice White’s term to insulate them from this kind of an influence.
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="3491.678" stopTime="3504.922">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    We do not contest the purpose and the aim and the object. 
    What we are saying is how was it accomplished, what we are saying in the particular statutes that are involved, they are too broad --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3504.922" stopTime="3513.191">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, are you challenging as applied here, the people who solicited money, received campaign contributions, and transported campaign materials?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="3513.191" stopTime="3526.365">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    What I am saying sir with regard to the statute that is involved is that the jurisdiction of the Court was aimed that the statute itself and so far as it is over-breadth and vague where these are concerned.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3526.365" stopTime="3537.170">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Should anybody who is able to read had any doubt that this statute prohibited the kind of activity involved in this particular case?
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="3537.170" stopTime="3546.559">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Well, if we are to assume that we are talking about subscriptions and receipt of money there, I would say that you have to agree.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3546.559" stopTime="3548.564">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That is what is involved in this case.
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="3548.564" stopTime="3569.244">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Yes, and so far as the charges if the court please now, these are charges where we are a long way or insofar as having action on those charges, these are the allegations that they made against the employees. 
    I do not want the court to feel by virtue as argument in the case that we have not admitted at all that there --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3569.244" stopTime="3583.605">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    No, no we are merely talking about allegation, but you concede that these are proper grounds for a state to establish prohibitions, and that if they were found guilty of them, they could properly be disciplined.
speaker="john_c_buckingham" startTime="3583.605" stopTime="3620.346">
    Mr. John C. Buckingham 
    Yes sir. 
    Most certainly, we think that, that type of conduct is what was obviously aimed at and what we are trying to do with insofar as any kind of proscription of these rights. 
    But what we are saying is, let us not take all the rights that they have a way with regard to political expression. 
    A statute could be enacted and could be drafted, we will say from the positive point of view, permitting them to engage in certain partisan political activity on a voluntary basis which would give them an exercise of those rights guaranteed to them under the First Amendment, we are saying. 
    Under our statute, they have not granted these rights.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3620.346" stopTime="3622.987">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
