    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may please the Court. 
    This case involves two regulations of the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control which provide that a California state on sale alcoholic beverage license may not be held on premises for the sale and consumption of alcohol where certain sexually oriented acts, conducts or visual displays are employed on the premises. 
    The regulations were enacted after legislative hearings before the California department of Alcoholic beverage Control. 
    Now it was developed that these hearings, first that alcoholic access would be present upon the control centers of the brain which normally inhibit the so-called base behaviors and that persons consuming alcohol may and do engage in acts and conduct which they would not engage in, if not drinking. 
    Secondly, it was developed that persons under the influence of alcohol are more likely to be sexually stimulated by viewing sexual material, sexual conduct and acts and that they are more likely to engage in sexual activity or conduct on premises which afford or offer such sexually oriented entertainment.

    The regulations become effective in number of days after their promulgation and enactment and placement in the California in the administrative code. 
    Before their effective date, these actions were brought, both in the State Courts and in the Federal District Court. 
    The Federal District Court in Los Angeles withheld the action pending action by the state courts. 
    The California State courts refused to hear the cases, refused to enjoin the regulation.

    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Yes, the action for declaratory relief and injunction was brought in the State courts.

    These were on petitions. 
    Regulations and/or decisions of the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control are reviewable either by petitions for writ to review in the California Appellate Courts or under a type of hybrid writ of mandate proceeding, which would be similar to declaratory relief to check the validity of the regulations, but it is discretionary with the California Appellate Courts whether or not they entertain.

    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Only one perhaps in all honesty. 
    Just prior to these regulations being enacted, there was a case in the California Courts, Boreta Enterprises versus the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, case decide by the California Supreme Court. 
    That case which came up before these regulations, involved the employment topless waitresses in a San Fransisco Bar.

    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    That is correct, they were disturbed according to their decision by the fact that there was no evidence, there were no regulations, just a sterile stipulation that topless waitresses were employed.

    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    That perhaps they just had a case where there was no evidence in the record, no regulations involved and they did not want to take on a subsequent case in the absence of what they might thought was an absence of the evidentiary record.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="389.342" stopTime="395.635">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Porter, do you regard this case as essentially a licensing case or an obscenity case per se?
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="395.635" stopTime="660.070">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Licensing. 
    As indicated, the hearing, the legislative hearing before the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control developed the effective alcohol upon persons imbibing in it and also developed through the testimony of various Law enforcement officials in California through department of investigators that the sex -- this type of sexually oriented entertainment is provided on premises where alcoholic beverages were sold and consumed on the premises, that the resultant problems on such premises, including overt sexual act between the employees and the entertainers and the customers, B girl activity, as indicated by officials from San Francisco Police Department, where in 1964 they had almost come to nil on B Girl activity, the introduction of the sexually oriented entertainment in On Sale bars in San Francisco and college B Girl activity to reach almost epidemic proportions. 
    Prostitution increased around such premises where you have this mixture, the prostitutes congregating where you have this sexually oriented entertainment, sexually stimulating entertainment plus the customers imbibing in alcoholic beverages. 
    Narcotic and drug problems increased at or near such premises, violent crimes, exploitation of customers, overt sex crimes, (Inaudible) and temperance, serious and extensive law enforcement problems, we have set out in the briefs. 
    Accordingly the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control adopted these regulations in order to try and prevent these serious problems and offenses that were occurring on the licensed alcoholic beverage premises in California. 
    As indicated, the regulations were tacked by various licensees in Los Angeles and Southern California area, both in State and Federal Courts, and when the State Courts refused to entertain these cases the three-judge Federal District Court in Los Angeles heard the case. 
    On a two to one decision, the lower Court held, relying on Roth and other obscenity cases, decisions by this Court. 
    The Lower Court held that the sexual acts and conducts and this visual displays that were prescribed by the department regulations were protected expression under the First Amendment and that the State could regulate them only on the grounds of obscenity. 
    That in is much as the department regulations did not deal with obscenity, they did not require standards of proof as to obscenity, the regulation must fall. 
    In addition, we would note that its clear, if one reads a lower court's decision, that they took the position that regardless of the alleged purpose of the department in enacting regulations that they assumed and determined that the department's motive was to circumvent the obscenity laws and not to try and prevent the problems which the legislative record had shown. 
    The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control argument is three-fold. 
    First that the sexual activities and sexual conduct regulated by these regulations are not and do not constitute symbolic speech. 
    They are not and do not constitute expression and are not within the protection of the First Amendment. 
    Secondly that even if this Court should determine that they are within the First Amendment, that a state may regulate the First Amendment activity on grounds or interest other than obscenity; that obscenity is not the sole touchstone the state is required to use in attempts to regulate First Amendment activity.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="660.070" stopTime="670.582">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Porter, does your argument here, does it based it all on the Twenty-first Amendment, dealing with the state authority over regulation of alcoholic beverages?
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="670.582" stopTime="716.835">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Based to the extent that if we are in our First Amendment area, then as far as balancing the state’s interest, we submit that both the traditional power that a state has had over the conditions surrounding the sale of alcoholic beverages and the power given to the states under the Twenty-first Amendment must be considered in balancing the state interest that these are substantial and important state interests, where we are talking about the condition surrounding the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
    We have never argued, nor would we ever argue that the Twenty-first Amendment would automatically override the First Amendment or any other part of the Constitution. 
    We only urge that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="716.835" stopTime="724.774">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it has been held at the Twenty-first Amendment -- has overrode a great deal of the Commerce Clause. 
    Isn't it?
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="724.774" stopTime="726.828">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="726.828" stopTime="731.731">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And it does by its terms?
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="731.731" stopTime="733.430">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    That's correct, but I --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="733.430" stopTime="746.159">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And it has been held that the Twenty-first Amendment overrode a good deal of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, isn’t it, as was in the Young's case?
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="746.159" stopTime="797.106">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Yes, but I would submit that I would myself attempt to temper that somewhat to the extent. 
    I think it shows an overriding state interest in weighing between the Commerce Clause and the Twenty-first Amendment where you get up an equal protection, you get up and so the First Amendment or some so called alleged preferred clauses or amendments of the Constitution; as I say, we do not argue that it overrides the First Amendment, but if we are dealing in a First Amendment area that a great weight should be given to state’s interest and power under the Twenty-first Amendment in balancing and weighing whether the state interests outweigh the interest to be protected under the First Amendment.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="797.106" stopTime="804.842">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I gather Mr. Porter, that one your part at least, there is alternative argument, isn't it? 
    Your basic argument is that there is no First Amendment right involved here at all?
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="804.842" stopTime="920.840">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    That's correct. 
    And thirdly, we argue that a Federal Court may not enjoin or invalidate otherwise valid regulations on the grounds that it believes a bad motive influenced the regulations. 
    Now, first of all is to, this not being First Amendment activities, we submit that public and commercial acts such as masturbation or copulation, sodomy, exposure of the genitals do not constitute symbolic speech or expression and that such acts and conduct do not contain a recognizable significant speech element entitling them to First Amendment protection. 
    And assuming that dancing is protected by the First Amendment, which is the main argument of the licensees in this case, we submit that the licensees may not make sexual acts and conduct and visual displays dancing by merely calling it dancing or the fact that such acts or conducts that are engaged in with music being played or that they may do some dance steps up to the act or dance away from the act does not make these acts, the sexual acts, sexual conduct, dancing. 
    Sexual conduct and acts are sexual conducts and acts. 
    Furthermore, we would submit that if the live sexual acts or conduct or displays are not speech, it does not seem rationale to us to say that by merely putting such acts or even conduct on film that they are transformed into speech, the minute they are put on the film and visually displayed by film rather than live.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="920.840" stopTime="934.167">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, a murder might not be a speech I suppose we could agree that it isn't and yet the depiction of a murder in a movie or a play, simulated, certainly is protected by the First Amendment, isn't it?
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="934.167" stopTime="962.594">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Yes, but here we are dealing with regulations that do not want the sexually oriented entertainment, whether it'd be on film or whether it'd be live and we're not looking at -- to the context. 
    I suppose a -- if one just showed a murder and nothing more --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="962.594" stopTime="975.771">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now I will take off fellow or take accomplished works, dramas through the ages, those are certainly protected by the First Amendment, aren't they?
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="975.771" stopTime="1018.252">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Alright and as to that, we'd say that, if it is within the First Amendment, that the state here could show a proper more significant interest to more out weighing interest in preventing the display of such films on premises where alcoholic beverages are being consumed, conceding that it would be First Amendment film, protected by the First Amendment. 
    We believe the state can properly restrict such films from premises where alcoholic beverages are being sold and consumed.

    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Well it would have encroach in the sense that and that is the interest of the state involved here over the control of conditions surrounding the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
    So the 21st would be in the state's traditional power, absent Twenty-first over the conditions surrounding the sale --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It seems to me Mr. Porter that and I have this feeling reading through the briefs that this case turns around -- the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control has not prohibited these things going on in the state of California or anywhere. 
    It simply prohibited the sell of liquor by the drink and that's its function, that's its jurisdiction, and I should think that you could validly argue whether you could make the argument, that under the very broad autonomous police power given to the states under Twenty-first Amendment and historically that California could prohibit selling liquor by the drink in bookstore if it wanted to or within a 100 feet of a church if it wanted to, without violating either freedom of free press or freedom of religion. 
    You are dealing with liquor by the drink, you are not prohibiting these things from going on, you are prohibiting liquor from being sold, isn't that true?
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="1223.726" stopTime="1225.221">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Oh, I would endorse it.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I thought that was the purport of my question to you whether this is a licensing cases or an obscenity case. 
    It's a licensing case relating to the sale of liquor as Justice Stewart emphasizes and what else is -- what other businesses transacted in conjunction with that is the matter for the state police power of California at least, so I would understand the state's position.
speaker="l_stephen_porter" startTime="1258.623" stopTime="1375.949">
    Mr. L. Stephen Porter 
    Yes. 
    Well aside from that position that the state is merely licensing liquor by the drink and just saying where it maybe sold, I would like to point out that nonetheless assuming that it should be found that the conduct, the acts, the displays that are prohibited by this regulations from being a performed or being offered on on-sale alcoholic beverage premises are within the First Amendment. 
    And there is a question as to the state that the state is actually trying to regulate First Amendment activity and not trying to do something in furtherance of alcoholic beverage control. 
    We submit that a state may regulate on grounds other than obscenity that the decisions relied on by the lower court, Roth and the obscenity cases, and relied on by the licenses, deal solely where a state is proceeding against acts or conduct on the basis that they are obscene and as we have indicated that is not the state's interest here. 
    This court set down the criteria in United States versus O'Brien. 
    We've indicated in our briefs, how we feel that has been made by the state's regulations.

    Mr. Harrison W. Hertzberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    These rules set for grounds for disciplinary proceedings against a alcoholic beverage control licensee. 
    These rules say in effect that if you permit entertainment, which entertainment has these acts, specific acts, that's grounds to discipline you suspend or revoke you liquor license. 
    It's our contention that as a condition of the exercise of that license, you cannot deprive an individual be she or he a dancer as there are plaintiffs in this case or a licensee before going to their First Amendment rights.

    Mr. Justice Stewart, if you limit, you prescribe that liquor cannot be sold in a bookstore you are discriminating against those people who want to read books and exercise their First Amendment rights while drinking, those who do not. 
    When you have a monopoly state and don't permit liquor to be sold anywhere in that state you are treating all people alike, you may have very serious Fourteenth Amendment problem with the type regulation which you specify.

    If you can show State of California has scientific evidence in some kind of a legislative hearing that would constitutionally permit them to find that there were some logical and reasonable correlation between the sale of gasoline where liquor sold then I would say, yes. 
    But more so in a First Amendment right situation and that's we have here. 
    Going back to the legislative hearings in this case, I contend, and we contend that the State of California must show some logical and reasonable correlation between the drinking of liquor while watching a nude girl dance or a movie or even a television which some of the shows on television today would be prohibited by these rules and a kind that occurs outside the premises and I say that for this reason Mr. Chief Justice, that each and every act complained of in pray to horribles listed in the brief of appellant herein is either prescribed by California Statute today, none of plaintiffs might and that I represent, there is over 20 of them here, obviously during this kind of conduct, were judged by, they are judged by the normal rules of obscenity and that's all we ask this Court to do is to judge it no differently then they would judge any other First Amendment right.

    Over any other place, isn't that true?
speaker="harrison_w_hertzberg" startTime="1902.813" stopTime="2072.503">
    Mr. Harrison W. Hertzberg 
    I couldn't stand here and deny it Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    I don't think that the power is that strong and in this instance here, after three days of hearings, the record will reveal that since this entertainment commenced in Los Angeles, the entire State of California, they established outside of the premises, that they were four indecent exposures, one attempted rape, one actual rape by alleged patrons and two general statements that crime was on the increase and that's after three days of testimony, inviting every law enforcement officer of the state to testify. 
    Each and every one of the pray to horribles here is grounds for disciplining a license of the licensee. 
    There is no need as these rules in this case before this Court at this time to take away the First Amendment rights which we feel would be taken away as a condition of the exertion of a privilege because here we're not talking about the type of conduct as the appellant alleges occurred in O'Brien, this is directly communicated activity. 
    I don't stand here and ask this Court to think or believe that every bar in the city of California carries out the type of activity which the appellant picked out and chose to put in his brief in this case. 
    These are by far the exception. 
    If in California, or any state I would believe, any activity occurs of this nature, any contact between a patron and a entertainer, it would be prescribed in addition thereto if it's the liquor, if the liquor is the added element in this case, which appellant seeks to use to invade the constitutional right then why not remove the liquor if we can to the best extent in the from bloodstream of the patron and we do that in California by saying, we have cited Section 647 (f), that you are not permitted to remain on the premises if you are under the influence or if you are not the influence you are no different than anybody else. 
    So you should not be there in the first place and if they are going to be inside the bar to police it to determine whether there has been any violation of your -- of the alleged rules they might as will just take the people that are under the influence and get them out of the bar.

    Obscenity really has nothing to do with selling liquor in the lobby of the theater.

    If the Court please, historically -- well, what we have to argue at this time, the regulations as they come before this Court. 
    Briefly in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart’s initial Younger versus Harris argument, we filed this action originally on behalf of plaintiffs in the Superior Court of the county of Los Angeles for declaratory relief and requested an injunction in Superior Court which is the trial court and we were denied hearing. 
    We petitioned the District Court of Appeals for writ of mandate and we were denied hearing.

speaker="harrison_w_hertzberg" startTime="2386.953" stopTime="2447.040">
    Mr. Harrison W. Hertzberg 
    Well, I very honestly state Mr. Justice Blackmun, I know one thing that the California Supreme Court like this Court doesn’t like to give advisory opinions and whether that was their theory or not would really be conjuncture on my part. 
    However, in California, you can only contest a disciplinary proceeding on a liquor license by going through certain administrative procedures. 
    We filed a complaint in this case prior to the effective date of the rules to enjoin, I believe it may have been concurrently therewith to enjoin their enforced on the theory that it would be irreparable damage of which the appellant agreed, they were going to enforce them and that the loss of these licenses would be irreparable. 
    We did not wait until the licenses were revoked or until disciplinary proceedings had been instituted.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2447.040" stopTime="2461.859">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Does California have a procedure whereby one can get a judicial review of administrative rule making which I take it was what you sought here rather than an administrative adjudication?
speaker="harrison_w_hertzberg" startTime="2461.859" stopTime="2745.290">
    Mr. Harrison W. Hertzberg 
    I would have answered that question in this regard, I will defer the answer to Mr. Scholtz. 
    I believe a declaratory relief probably could. 
    We would submit further that the way rules are drafted, they are overbreadth the Smith versus California problem which Mr. Scholtz will take up with the Court, are such that or in a manner that they do deny the licensees herein the proper exercise, the licensees and the dancer plaintiffs, the proper exercise of their First Amendment rights as a condition to the owning of a liquor license, no different than NAACP versus Button and those line of cases requiring the foregoing of an old etcetera to maintain the license. 
    That's the basis of our argument herein. 
    The District Court below said that if it is not obscene then something is wrong with it and they can't take your license away because obscenity has been the standard since 1957, decided by this Court in Roth, but to accept these rules taking things out of context and merely saying if an act simulates, an act that simulates, whatever that may be, that's grounds for disciplinary proceeding even if it is in a picture on the wall because it involves movies, still pictures and entertainment of any kind of nature whatsoever. 
    The injunction granted in the Federal District Court in this case, specifically accepted any contact between any entertainer and any patron, person in the bar which are 90% of the pray to horribles listed in the briefs, in the briefs of the appellant herein. 
    We submit that from time immemorial, dancing, entertainment of that kind as this Court said in Stanley versus Georgia the line is too illusive to draw between conveying ideas and entertainment that whether it is vulgar, whether it is refined, whether it is ugly or whether it is elegant receive the same protection and that test the obscenity test as has been laid down so strong and hard. 
    To sustain the rules in this case would take us back to Hicklin, prior to Roth. 
    The activity, dancing is direct communication. 
    This is not as I previously said an O'Brien case. 
    In O'Brien, this Court held that when speech and non-speech elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently governmental interest in regulating the non-speech element can just defy incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms. 
    But, the Court further went on in O'Brien and stated, referring to Stromberg versus California, the red flag waving case, since the statue there, in San Bernardino, California was aimed at suppressing communication. 
    It could not be sustained as a regulation of non-communicative conduct, citing Brandenburg versus Ohio which came later, Brandenburg versus Ohio which required the incitement to action. 
    We submit that the conduct here, or the content of the conduct here cannot be changed from speech to symbolic speech or non-speech merely by changing the name.

   Argument of Kenneth Scholtz
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2765.766" stopTime="2769.688">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Hertzberg. 
    Mr. Scholtz.
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="2769.688" stopTime="2930.947">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may please the Court. 
    I think that it is clear this case involves a conflict between the state's police power to control alcohol and the First Amendment. 
    I think it is clear that these rules would be over-broad, over-broad and vague under the First Amendment, if there were no question of alcohol involved and that they prohibit -- well I could list, I can tick off a list of movies that couldn't be shown in a bar under these rules. 
    The Catch 22, Summer of 42, I could tick off a list of master works of arts including probably half of the output of Picasso that couldn't be shown. 
    So, let me ask a rhetorical question. 
    Could a state require bars to be racially segregated, after holding hearing wherein police officers testify that fights between persons of opposites races are more likely to occur when they are drinking, and therefore, the state says that bars are required to be racially segregated. 
    I say it could not do so. 
    That would an impermissible conflict between the Fourteenth Amendment and the state's police power over alcohol. 
    Similarly, I think in this case the state cannot make an unconstitutional discrimination against exercise of First Amendment rights simply because alcohol is involved. 
    To respond to Mr. Justice Burger's question at the beginning, let me distinguish this between a rule that says a bar cannot be located say within 600 feet of a Church as California does. California says, you cannot put a bar within 600 feet of a Church. 
    The California does not say and I submit it, it could not say that you cannot put a Church within 600 feet of a bar and California does not say if you have a bar in a place and a Church comes in within 600 feet that the bar has to go. 
    Because I would also say this that the rule respecting for example, distance to Churches is intended to protect the persons who go to the Churches. 
    These rules are intended and expressly intended to control what the people do inside the bar without regard to where it is located without regard to what effect it may have on anyone else outside the bar. 
    So, there is a clear distinction here between this type of a rule which directly applies to the conduct inside of a bar which directly restricts what can go on inside a bar.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2930.947" stopTime="2953.094">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Again, perhaps according to how you put it, but I thought this had to do with places where liquor could be sold, not to what conduct goes on inside of a building, but whether or not a liquor could be sold. 
    In other words it is similar to a state saying no liquor shall be sold while they drink in a Church.

    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    No I don't think so. 
    I think this rule purports to regulate the content of the --

    The places where liquor can be sold?

    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    What this rule says and I think this is important, I don't think its just a case of how you put it. 
    This rules discriminates between types of entertainment. 
    It says, entertainment can take place inside of bar except that the entertainment can't have this and it can't have that and can't have something else. 
    I think this is an unconstitutional discrimination between types of entertainment and that I think the Constitution would require that type of a discrimination to be made on the basis of obscenity.

    First.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3033.935" stopTime="3039.579">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it has to be the Fourteenth (Inaudible) in the State of California?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3039.579" stopTime="3044.952">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    First and Fourteenth, it's not a direct application to the First through the Fourteenth.

    You reject the position of the State that this is a licensing case rather than First Amendment case?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3051.529" stopTime="3078.813">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    Well, it's obviously both. 
    It is both a licensing case and the First Amendment case. 
    It involves as I said originally, the conflict between the First Amendment and the licensing power and I don't think that, as I have said, I don't think this is a mere question of terminology and how you put it.

    Do they have a rule about lighting in bars out in California?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3083.859" stopTime="3094.768">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    I think there is just a general rule that says that the bars have to be -- have sufficient light for investigators to see what's going on when they walk in.

    Is there any interference with his First Amendment right?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3099.172" stopTime="3109.429">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    That would be different because that is not, that would be an example of an incidental restriction on a First Amendment right of the type, the O'Brien type.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Isn't entertainment incidental?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3111.720" stopTime="3116.397">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    No, I don't think entertainment is incidental. 
    I think is entertainment is a direct First Amendment activity.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3116.397" stopTime="3120.297">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well isn't it incidental to the selling of Whiskey?

    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    Not necessarily, in many of these places that may be.

    Do you of anybody who goes to bar that hasn't entertainment and doesn't buy a drink and if you find him to bought the -- is going to put him out?

    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    I would agree with that Justice Marshall.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Right, am I correct?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3135.580" stopTime="3136.423">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    That is correct Justice Marshall.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3136.423" stopTime="3139.387">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So its incidental to the selling of Whiskey?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3139.387" stopTime="3140.987">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    Well I would say this they are incidental --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3140.987" stopTime="3149.066">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And it is incidental to the selling of Whiskey, its a part of the business of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3149.066" stopTime="3200.745">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    I would agree with that I don't agree with that, I don't disagree with that proposition, but I do disagree with the proposition that the Department of Alcohol and Beverage Control can do whatever it pleases without regard to the First Amendment Rights of the participants. 
    I don't think that the Department of Alcohol and Beverage Control could condition the issuance of the license upon the applicant taking the oath that this Court held was unconstitutional in Speiser versus Randall. 
    I don't think the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control could condition the issuance of a license upon the licensee filling out the questionnaire that this Court held unconstitutional, I am forgetting the name of case, the Arkansas case. 
    I don't think the Arkansas school teacher case, I don't think that --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Sheton against Tucker.
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3201.692" stopTime="3240.845">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    Right, Sheton against Tucker. 
    I don't think there is any question that the state couldn't do that and I don't think the state can condition the issuance of a license upon the refusal of the licensee to exercise his First Amendment rights in a manner which discriminates the way this rule discriminates, the way rule discriminates between types of entertainment. 
    I don't think a State can say, you can show Bambi but you can't show Summer of 42 inside the bar, that's what I think is the unlawful discrimination.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr Schultz early in the argument of your brother on the other side I asked about Younger problem. 
    I am interested now in another preliminary question of this case, I have read Judge Ferguson's opinion when I got here and I just glanced it over again. 
    Now I have a hard time in finding in his opinion any conclusion that the remedy at law was inadequate or that there was a irreparable harm of course would be satisfactory conditions to the issuance of this injunction?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3275.467" stopTime="3288.072">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    The joint pre trial statement, I think contained those elements that there was a reparable harm and there would be reparable harm in the enforcement of these rules and that the remedy at law was inadequate.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3288.072" stopTime="3303.429">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There is no finding however unless you can find it in this discussion of Blount against Rizzi and Freedman against Maryland I suppose the application -- or otherwise this was impermissible, wasn't it, an injunction?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3303.429" stopTime="3305.001">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    No I don't think it was impermissible.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3305.001" stopTime="3307.264">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Why?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3307.264" stopTime="3360.571">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    If the Court refers to the record there was a direct pretrial statement filed joined in by all parties and the court in which the statements that there was irremediable harm here and that this would exist if there was no injunction. 
    Now if Judge Ferguson neglected to put that in his opinion I don't think that removes jurisdiction, that is in the record. 
    It's also the case of the State Courts as we have said did refuse to take the case. 
    In answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question earlier there is a type of declaratory relief remedy available and that is what was done in this case because the State Of California in a Liquor case requires you to go to the Appellate courts rather than the trial courts level and the Appellate courts apparently have the discretion to refuse to take the case which is --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3360.571" stopTime="3365.263">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So it's a discretionary denial of a relief that is -- can't be available under California law?
speaker="kenneth_scholtz" startTime="3365.263" stopTime="3376.025">
    Mr. Kenneth Scholtz 
    That's right. 
    That's a discretionary denial of a relief it can't be available and there was no place left to go. 
    So that the attempts to exhaust, take the State remedy had been exhausted. 
    Thank you.
