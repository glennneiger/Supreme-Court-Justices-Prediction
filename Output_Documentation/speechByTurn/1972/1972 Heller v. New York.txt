Heller v. New York

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We’ll hear arguments next in 71-1043, Heller against New York. 
    Mr. Anolik, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is somewhat similar to the prior case. 
    However, there are marked differences. 
    In this case, Your Honors, just to orient the Court briefly, on July 29, 1969, Inspector Smyth went to the Gerak Theater in Greenwich Village and saw a movie, which is the subject of the litigation before this Court, Blue Moon and apparently felt that it was obscene. 
    He then communicated with the Prosecutor’s Office and on July 31, 1969, together with Just-- the Judge Arthur Goldberg, no relation to any judge in this Court, he returned to the theater and Judge Goldberg and Inspector Smyth saw the film again. 
    At that point, after the film was completed at July 31, Judge Goldberg forthwith signed a search and seizure order without a hearing of any sort whatsoever and also issued warrants for the arrests of Mr. Heller, the petitioner here, and two other employees of the theater. 
    As it turned out, of course, two of the three arrests should never have occurred because, before the beginning of trial my concession with the District Attorney, those two arrests were-- those two individuals were dismissed in the case because they should never have been arrested. 
    The issue as to whether or not they should’ve been an adversary hearing is preserved in this record. 
    It is the position of the petitioner that in a First Amendment situation that we have here, the general rule appertaining to search and seizures cannot be followed, that an adversary hearing is essential to protect vital First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. 
    We have the seizure of a film.

    I see. 
    You mean, an adversary hearing to determine obscenity del not.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That’s right.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Not just probable cause.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="153.870" stopTime="227.971">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    No, to determine obscenity del not. 
    That’s correct because, first of all, we do not have a clear and pleasant danger here as we might if a person possessed munitions or narcotics or something of that sort. 
    Indeed, we know from various cases and even from the history of this case before the New York Courts that there was sharp disagreement as to whether this film was even obscene and we do not, unlike our prior-- unlike the prior case, we do not for a moment concede that this was obscene. 
    In fact, we don’t think it was and, indeed, in the intermediate Appellate Court, the Appellate term of the Supreme Court. 
    The decision was two-to-one with Justice Markowitz dissenting and, in the New York Court of Appeals, the Chief Judge and another judge dissented and held that-- or said that the film was not obscene. 
    So, we have a real sharp issue as to obscenity, but I want to pass what I consider to be an even more paramount issue. 
    The problem that we face here is that once this film was seized and the printed--

    Well, because of the fact that movies can be shown to a large audience. 
    In other words, it is the size of the audience that must be the criterion and not the item. 
    The District Attorney, indeed, in his brief says, on page 35, that this Court should consider the seizure of a film and equate it to a seizure of one book, and we do not subscribe to that and, indeed, the United--

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Unfortunately, that was never actually developed in the record. 
    I have not tried the case. 
    It was not actually developed in the record, Justice Brennan. 
    But, to say that another print of the film is available, I think, actually begs the issue here because it is the adversary proceeding that we are addressing ourselves to at this time, and we think that is a very important issue and we are leading aside to the time being whether or not it’s even obscene.

    As far as I know, it was shown in only one theater in New York. 
    This was not syndicated through a number of theaters. 
    It was only at the Gerak Theater that this was being shown. 
    Apparently, it was a low-budget picture. 
    The quality of the film is not even good.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    There probably would not be, but let us--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="488.296" stopTime="489.151">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    There had to be.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="489.151" stopTime="757.839">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    There may have been copies in the west coast. 
    That’s a possibility but, nonetheless, the seizure here amounted to what we consider to be a violation of the First Amendment. 
    Now, the problem that arises, of course, is that the film itself is seized and it’s true that the District Attorney argues that, well, a motion to suppress can be promptly made. 
    But, he casts the burden upon the defendant to make such a motion and says that were the burden otherwise, in other words, if an adversary hearing had to be held before you could seize a film, then a defendant could delay such an adversary hearing and delay justice, but you can turn that right around. 
    The District Attorney asks this Court to assume that the District Attorney or other prosecutor would never delay such a proceeding. 
    That is not at all evident. 
    We’re not dealing with New York County alone. 
    We’re dealing with an overwriting consideration here. 
    There could be delay on the part of a prosecutor but, more important than that, when we deal with a First Amendment situation such as this where we have a theater with 299 seats, and this incidentally is a closed theater. 
    This is not a theater such as in a Rave or in the Roaden case where maybe you can see something from the road. 
    Mr. Heller who testified, who happens to be an attorney incidentally, testified that the-- there was a sign in the lobby of the theater that the film was marked X, that no one under 17 would be admitted and, indeed, he said they, including him, enforced a rule that no one apparently under 18 was admitted. 
    There was no complaint received by any member of the public. 
    This was a situation where the police, apparently protecting some unknown and anonymous person, were arrogating to themselves the right of censorship over films, decided to look at the films and “well, we’re going to seize this film.” 
    That’s about the size of it, and we maintain that the problem of not holding the adversary hearing, in essence, means that the prosecutor can arrogate to himself the right to seize the film and to put the theater out of business because most theaters book films, let’s say, for three, four days a week or so. 
    It’s not that easy once the film is seized suddenly, as was-- as happened here, to suddenly get another replacement film. 
    It’s quite difficult in fact. 
    The arrest of the personnel is quite a traumatic effect, as indeed two of the three arrests here should not even have occurred. 
    And, the net result is that not only do you have an economic loss to the owner of the film, but you have a tremendous economic loss to the movie house, the exhibit. 
    Now, let us consider the situation where a prosecutor, perhaps not as liberal as some, decides that a particular movie is offensive. 
    That prosecutor, if he follows the procedure here, can handpick a judge and, incidentally, there’s no-- nothing in the record here one way or the other as to how Judge Goldberg was chosen to come down to Court. 
    So, we could-- we have a right at least to speculate that maybe this judge was handpicked, brought down, and he issues this forthwith warrant. 
    Now, if Judge Markowitz, for example, who dissented in the Appellant term, had been used as the magistrate, there would not have been a seizure, there would not have been an arrest and, indeed, this case may not-- might not have even been up here. 
    So, w have that dangerous situation in a First Amendment case whereby the District Attorney can decide, perhaps subject to a certain ethics of course, and we don’t maintain that all prosecutors necessarily have the ethics of the New York County District Attorney’s Office, but the fact remains that the magistrate came down there and forthwith issued this search and seizure order and arrest order.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="757.839" stopTime="761.115">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Do you know whether that’s a standard procedure?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="761.115" stopTime="829.165">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Now, I understand that since this situation has occurred and in view of Death View Amusement Park, in the Second Circuit-- an astro film is in the Second Circuit and, indeed, decisions in Sixth Circuit Courts of Appeal-- I believe the procedure in New York County is that they do give out that sort of hearings now. 
    Apparently, it recognizes the serious question as to whether they should or should not. 
    This is the case which apparently will crystallize whether or not they should continue doing it, but I’m sure Mr. Friedman will be able to speak more authority as what the actual procedure is. 
    But, be that as it may, in the brief of the District Attorney, he says that Judge Goldberg and Inspector Smyth did not see or do not recall seeing signs that this was restricted to people over 17 years of age and that the film was marked X. 
    Mr. Heller testified under oath that that was in fact the case, and there’s nothing to contradict that in the record. 
    Merely, the fact they didn’t recall seeing it certainly is not contradiction. 
    The--

    Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Judge Goldberg testified and so did Inspector Smyth testify. 
    As a matter of fact, Justice Rehnquist, there was an attempt to cross-examine Judge Goldberg as to what criteria he used to determine what-- why this was obscene and, indeed, perhaps to determine if he was even familiar with the standards laid down by this Court in Roth and in other cases because I don’t think we have a right to assume that lower Court judges necessarily are always conversant with the standards laid down by this Court. 
    In an adversary hearing, at least these matters could be called to the attention of these jurors to determine “are you, in fact, judging this seizure by the standards set down by the Supreme Court of the United States or is it some visceral reaction that you are motivated by?”

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    No. 
    I would say that if the party at least who was in the role of the complainant. 
    The problem with this case, Justice Rehnquist, is that Judge Goldberg became a prosecution witness, so to speak, in this case saying that he determined that the film was obscene and, to that extent, having become a witness at the trial, counsel at least tried to determine what standards he had applied and they did not permit cross-examination as to that question.

    I am saying that at least the complainant, in this case, Inspector Smyth. 
    At least to that extent, cross-examination should be permitted and an opportunity to call to the attention of the magistrate the precedence and the holdings of this Court and, perhaps, the Courts of New York as to what the definition of community standards are, what the definition of obscenity is under the Roth testing of the test.

    Yes, but the point is, in the one case, you’re judging the film itself.

    It’s a little bit different standard there because it’s Section 235, the obscenity Section 235.05 that we have promoting obscenity.

    The difference being that, in the one case--

    I mean practical business.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="1450.507" stopTime="1484.511">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    The practical is that, in the one case, we’re testing out whether or not the film itself should’ve been seized, whether or not it’s in fact obscene. 
    Let us assume the Court then decides that contrary to the position of the defendant, that they hold that the film was obscene. 
    The issue then is did he promote-- if he pleads not guilty, now, it may be that he was found in the projection room. 
    It may be that he was found taking money, but that would not automatically presume him guilty. 
    Having plead not guilty, he’d be entitled to a trial as to his own--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1484.511" stopTime="1494.359">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, what we’re worried about, isn’t this just like some narcotics cases when you, as defense counsel, you lose the motion to suppress, you lose your case?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="1494.359" stopTime="1515.919">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    No, I wouldn’t think so, because in narcotics cases there, again, has to be some element of criminal intent and knowledge because, frequently, a person who’s found in possession of heroin and there’s a chemical analysis. 
    There’s absolutely no doubt that the matter is heroin and that he was found with it and was sold to an agent. 
    That does not mean he’s not entitled to a trial in the merits.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    As a practical effect, I’ll say this. 
    That I have seen cases, Justice Marshall, where there had been disagreements or acquittals of defendants notwithstanding the fact that, on a motion to suppress, they lost the case they were called.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1531.690" stopTime="1534.018">

    I wouldn’t push you a number.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    No, there aren’t too many of those. 
    I’d have to agree. 
    There aren’t too many of those because you are taking the narcotics here, but why don’t we take some other situation where we’re not dealing with anything as dramatic as narcotics, where we’re dealing with something, perhaps the possession of an unloaded gun or the possession, for example, of the material--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1554.401" stopTime="1571.059">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    All of those that I-- I limited mine to that because I don’t think the others apply.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well, Your Honor, as I said, I-- if you noted, I was willing to backtrack a little bit on that aspect. 
    I would say that I perhaps should adopt the standard of a fair preponderance for that purpose, and insist upon beyond reasonable doubt for the purpose of trial. 
    As I say, upon analysis, Justice Marshall, and if you would give me an opportunity perhaps to amend my rather adamant position previously, that perhaps upon reflection a preponderance test should be used in the initial hearing and reasonable doubt in the trial proper. 
    That would be perhaps a more reasonable situation. 
    What-- an adversary hearing, however, of some sort must, of necessity, be held, we maintain, to protect a First Amendment right.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    The movie would have to be there, but the point is this. 
    It should not be in-- with the possession of the District Attorney because assuming-- let’s say that we won the suppression hearing. 
    They said it should not have been seized. 
    Under New York law, the District Attorney could appeal that and retains possession of the property until it goes through the Appellate process. 
    He is not required to return that film because that’s true in all search and seizure cases. 
    The District Attorney can appeal forthwith if he says he cannot proceed with the case and, therefore, he retains possession of that until it goes through the full Appellate process. 
    We do not have a concomitant right of appeal if the suppression is not granted because we would have to either, plead guilty and then appeal, or else we have to go through a full trial and then appeal for the judgment of conviction before we could appeal that question.

    And then, let’s assume that the magistrate, after the adversary hearing, finds that this probably is or that the prosecution has sustained its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that this is obscene, and then what happens? 
    Does he--

    What the counsel had in mind.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="1900.281" stopTime="1902.445">

    Alright and--there’s a finding that by a fair preponderance of the evidence the film is obscene, then you say the constitution then requires the film to be returned to the theater?

    That’s correct.

    Again, through subpoena, it is displayed to the Court, and until there’s a finding of guilty, it should not be seized.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1924.491" stopTime="1930.826">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it’s subpoenaed and then displayed to the finder of the fact, the jury or the trial judge.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well, eventually, if it’s deemed to be obscene after a trial on the merits beyond a reasonable doubt, then I presume they could seize it because it would technically be contraband at that point.

    Suppose it were feasible for a copy of the film to be reproduced promptly, say, by an independent lab. Under circumstances, it would assure that there was no tampering with the film and that your client, therefore, could have the original back in 24 hours.

   Argument of Lewis R. Friedman
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1994.365" stopTime="1998.545">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Friedman.
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="1998.545" stopTime="2200.129">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The state has, as this Court has held many times, a valid important interest in the prosecution of obscenity and the enforcement of the obscenity laws and that is a state interest which may be vindicated in any number of ways. 
    The state has a number of alternatives opened to it, and the Court has also held that if there is an important governmental interest which might incidentally limit protected speech that the Court must weigh the interest of the state on one hand and the procedures used so that the incidental effects can be minimized and that it is this tight of balance that must be decided in any given situation. 
    And, what have we here? 
    We have here a situation where the state has chosen to use its penal statutes, its penal provisions which impose a penalty for the prior showing of the film. 
    That is, they do not aim at the future showing but only at the showing that occurred at some point in the past at some act the defendant has already performed and, in the course of enforcing this valid state interest of imposing a penalty for the past showing, the state of necessity must have evidence. 
    And, in order to obtain evidence, there are two choices at this stage. 
    The state, in a case of a film, must have testi-- can have testimony of someone who has seen the film that testifies to its contents, or can have the film. 
    Now, if a person who has seen the film tries to testify, the problems of proof are, in many cases, overwhelming. 
    And I believe, as the summary of evidence which we have given in our brief indicates, any testimony concerning Blue Movie would have been very hard to discern by the tryer of fact. 
    It is a type of movie which can be seen in its entirety, as it-- sorry, which must be seen in its entirety as the only way to ascertain what this movie is. 
    The description is very difficult to do and, I say, even counsel, with great deal of leisure, have had difficulty attempting to summarize it in any useful form. 
    Now, given this problem, why should the state be relegated to less than the best available probative evidence of a crime? 
    Why must the state rely on secondary evidence which is really, in a case of this sort, worthless? 
    Because, in this case, I would submit that a finder of fact would have had almost impossible task in figuring out what Blue Movie is about. 
    Now, they say the state has chosen the penal sanction, and I mention that because that distinguishes, in large part, many of the prior cases in this Court where states have tried a civil injunctive remedy. 
    That is where the state has attempted to prevent future showing. 
    What we are doing here is enforcing a right against past showings. 
    Now, it is true--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2200.129" stopTime="2202.813">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why do you need to take the film out of circulation?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2202.813" stopTime="2207.146">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Your Honor, we-- the film didn’t have to be withdrawn from circulation in order to prosecute it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2207.146" stopTime="2208.174">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You seized it, didn’t you?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2208.174" stopTime="2222.603">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    We did seize the film and, in partial answer of a question Mr. Justice Marshall had asked before, the film was currently in this Court’s custody actually. 
    It was delivered to the Court by the District Attorney. 
    We still have the film, but--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2222.603" stopTime="2227.128">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Was-- Wouldn’t it have been enough for your purposes to subpoena it for the trial?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2227.128" stopTime="2250.970">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Well, Your Honor, the subpoena route is not as simple, I submit, as has been suggested by my adversary. 
    The subpoena route has raised many serious Fifth Amendment problems where the perspective defendant is subpoenaed to produce a document in his possession which is incriminating. 
    And, as a practical matter, we have been subjected to collateral proceedings every time we ever tried the subpoena route.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2250.970" stopTime="2256.192">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    At the time of the trial, the film would finish its showing and they’d be out of jurisdiction anyways.
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2256.192" stopTime="2270.984">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    That’s correct, and I think the contemptor’s power is not a very effective one for this reason. As has been mentioned several times here, the films are on a schedule of circulation and if the current distributor--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2270.984" stopTime="2271.213">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if there were--
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2271.213" stopTime="2279.170">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Has a contract right which limits his right to possession to a very limited period of time, he may well have a defense to any contempt proceeding.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2279.170" stopTime="2281.901">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Ordinarily, does he get more than one print?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2281.901" stopTime="2286.068">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    The individual distributer, generally, would have one print, although--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2286.068" stopTime="2290.876">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is that the sort of distribution method this film was subject to?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2290.876" stopTime="2301.850">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Well, Your Honor, I presume that each person who had this film had one print in his possession. 
    The record doesn’t tell us, but that more than one print exists, I think, is just facing the facts of--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2301.850" stopTime="2302.287">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I know, but that--
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2302.287" stopTime="2303.152">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Commercial distribution.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2303.152" stopTime="2307.610">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That doesn’t mean much if there’s not a second print available to this exhibitor, does it?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2307.610" stopTime="2317.985">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    We don’t know whether there’s a second print available to this exhibitor. 
    We don’t know what the terms of his distribution agreement were. 
    He never put any of this in the record, Your Honor. 
    If the-- if he was going to lie on that claim, then the record is--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2317.985" stopTime="2330.109">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let’s assume that there were two copies readily available to him and you could have one of them but he could go on showing the other. 
    If all you want is evidence, just having one copy but letting the other one show would satisfy your need, wouldn’t it?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2330.109" stopTime="2354.836">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Yes, it certainly would, Your Honor. 
    There are a number of situations where films have shown in several theaters even within the city and we have seized one print for evidence, but the problem is this, and it’s a very practical problem. 
    The seizure of that first print will effectively tell any defendant who is represented by competent counsel that perhaps he ought not to show the film in the future.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2354.836" stopTime="2355.021">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that--
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2355.021" stopTime="2367.629">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    But not because we are preventing it, but because practicality of law enforcement is that the penal sanction, having been invoked as to one showing, the man runs a risk of subsequent prosecution.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2367.629" stopTime="2367.957">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, isn’t that--
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2367.957" stopTime="2369.957">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Where they’re not subsequent seizure.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2369.957" stopTime="2371.389">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What’s the significance of that?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2371.389" stopTime="2384.291">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Well, the point is, Your Honor, that the mere fact that the film is not shown again even if he had a second print available would not necessarily be because the state would seize it, but because the man might be well-advised not to show it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2384.291" stopTime="2390.616">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but that’s a little different situation than when you effectively preclude him from showing the film.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2390.616" stopTime="2392.498">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Each exhibition is a new crime, is it not?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2392.498" stopTime="2455.102">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That’s correct, Your Honor. 
    I do not recall, offhand, the situation where we have actually prosecuted multiple counts for every repeated showing, but I can bring to this Court’s attention a case which is currently pending in the Courts of New York County in which we have started a prosecution and this prosecution was started by the same route as was used here, the issuance of a search warrant on August 17, 1972. 
    On August 18, the judge who awarded the seizure directed the film to be returned to the distributor. 
    That film was at the hand of the distributor. 
    It has never been produced in Court to this date. 
    It was on the calendar for yesterday. 
    It was not produced yesterday. 
    The distributor is showing it. 
    Since the time of the seizure, I believe published reports have shown that about $400,000 in gross has been taken-in in this picture. 
    It’s a film showing in several theaters in New York. 
    The prospect of the defendant being charged with multiple counts has maybe not dissuaded him, although the statute of limitations has not yet run in that case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2455.102" stopTime="2467.635">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why did they tell you that until you decide obscenity, you’re not supposed to take steps to preclude circulation of it?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2467.635" stopTime="2490.132">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    But, Your Honor, the problem is this, and that’s why I refer to this case involving a film called Deep Throat which, I believe, is referred to in one of the briefs for amicus curiae in this matter, a motion in brief which has not yet been accepted by the Court. 
    In that case, the defendant has no incentive in conducting a hearing. 
    There is no interest on this defendant’s part.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2490.132" stopTime="2490.320">

    They have this case come to a hearing.

    Isn’t there a solution to go to trial?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2494.011" stopTime="2532.012">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Our-- we have made every effort, Your Honor. 
    This matter has been on the calendar on six occasions by my count and, yet, we cannot force the case to a hearing, but why? Because the exhibitor who is commercially exploiting the film will not, in any way, cooperate with prosecution, and I think that some of the suggestions made by my adversary are perhaps suggestions of fantasy because there is not cooperation. 
    There is a reported case in the official reports which we cite in our brief in which an adversary hearing was attempted in New York County. 
    That was our last attempt.

speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2853.225" stopTime="2858.772">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    The first answer, Your Honor, is that the statute-- the amendment, I believe, became effective in August of 1972.

    Secondly, it’s a-- I have been told that the effectiveness of the Kingsley Books statute is somewhat limited because it’s a-- in a book situation.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2869.501" stopTime="2870.835">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It’s an injunction proceeding.
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2870.835" stopTime="2874.472">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    It had been a very cumbersome procedure to serve and hold in advance.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2874.472" stopTime="2876.356">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It’s an injunction procedure, isn’t it?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="2876.356" stopTime="2939.354">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    It’s a purely civil injunction procedure which is now contained in the Civil Practice Act. 
    It’s not in civil practice law of the rules. 
    It’s no longer part of the criminal procedure statutes in New York, but in a situation here, we are only asking of a seizure for a limited period, a very limited period, until it can be a hearing. 
    We want a speedy hearing because there is no reason for these cases to remain in the Court structure at all if the def-- if the film is seized inadvertently, and really that’s what we’re talking about. 
    We’re really just talking about the possible effect on the First Amendment if a film is improperly seized in the first instance. 
    Those films should be returned to circulation forthwith, but if a film is properly seized, after hearing, a state may hold it. 
    I mean, even under a Quantity of Books after a full adversary hearing or, say in case of this sort, after a trial, the state may validly maintain custody of the film. 
    Indeed, an injunction could issue after the trial.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2939.354" stopTime="2944.778">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I take it on the ground that if there’s a determination of obscenity that takes it outside the First Amendment.

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman

    Is there anything that prevents you from going down at the District Attorney from going from judge to judge, through about 30 judges until he finds one that agrees with him?

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Your Honor, there is nothing to stop, but there is nothing to stop it in any search warrant case. 
    In any case in which a Court has multiple judges who have concurrent jurisdiction, there is nothing to prevent judge-shopping for the purposes of trial. 
    Somehow or rather, a judge must be selected. 
    Now, as a practical matter, the only thing I understand New York law would require is that if there were multiple applications for a search warrant, you must indicate to the magistrate you apply to the history of the prior applications. 
    It is-- the magistrate must know that you’ve gone to someone before.

    But you--

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Allegedly, Your Honor, but what we have in this case, and I think you’ve realistically thrown all of these cases, we have had a search and seizure where a magistrate has seen the evidence and has found eh film to be obscene. 
    Now, there’s some question as to what you found and I just would quote from the judge who issued the warrant, and this appears in the record. 
    “I had seen the film and it was and is my opinion that that film is obscene and was obscene as I saw it then under the definition of obscene, Section 235.00, the Penal law.” 
    Now, the judge--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3118.600" stopTime="3120.739">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That’s obscene under the state law of New York.

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Under the state law of New York, Your Honor, and I think as we set forth the state statute at the outset of our brief, I think the Court will see that that is as close a paraphrase as the legislative draftsman was capable of doing of the three-fold test this Court has announced in its five decisions on obscenity. 
    If the state statute is--

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    No, Your Honor, I think that that question is one which can be seen from the statute itself, that the state has codified the sound in this question--

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Why can’t we have this hearing, other than the fact that it takes time?

    Yes, other than the fact that it takes time.

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    After a magistrate has seen the film, we run a substantial risk, and has been mentioned several times today, of alteration of a film, we run the risk of film disappearing because of will, and these are not imaginary. 
    I think there is some concrete examples referred to in our brief where it has occurred, and the remedies of contempt are not practical. 
    If the film itself is gone and the original version is not available for comparison, the hearing process itself will have to be held sooner or later. 
    The state--

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, why go through any hearing?

    We might suggest that the magistrate must have, as close to firsthand, knowledge of the material to be seized as is possible in order for him, in his judicial role, to make that decision.

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    That’s why we’re here, Your Honor. 
    That is-- the problem is that the Court has held that the First Amendment does not protect obscenity and, at some stage, a decision must be made in one form or another whether a matter is obscene or isn’t. 
    And, in this situation, we have a finding beyond a reasonable doubt by, in this case, a non-jury trial, three-judge trial, and that is a final judicial determination of the obscenity of this film. 
    Now, of course, it’s subject to review on appeal and were the film, returned or destroyed, as a practical matter, the Court would be unable to review it. 
    And, it is for that reason the film is, as I say, in the custody of the Court Clerk’s Office at the current time, but once that determination is made--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3354.854" stopTime="3364.281">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    We wouldn’t have that problem in the case we had earlier because somebody destroyed it.

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    If it’s the same film, Your Honor, and I believe the Attorney General from Kentucky indicated he hadn’t seen it to see if it is the same film. 
    And, I would submit that if the Court choose to see Blue Movie-- you’d see that it’d be very difficult to ascertain if this was the same film.

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Not-- the statutes are vague, at best, as to the right to retain or destroy evidence at the expiration of a case. 
    As a general matter, heroin is fungible and not necessarily valuable after a case is disposed of.

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    I presume there is a statute regulating the police property clerk which governs that but, as a practical matter, I think the Court’s aware there’s a substantial problem in obscenity cases of the Bar or anyone else knowing precisely what the item that has been adjudicated is, and that the objects are usually retained for as long as it is possible to keep them in some form of intact state or another so as to provide that insight for further study, so that in most cases and certainly in most obscenity cases the material that’s been seized has been held for years and years.

    I think you need to use the word “library.”[Laughter]
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="3512.335" stopTime="3577.081">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Well, I think that’s the way it’s been popularly described, Your Honor. 
    But, the point we face here is that the state’s effort that New York has adopted of acquiring the magistrate to actually see the material is one which walks, we think, a fair middle ground between the seizure by an untrained officer who sees a film and then seizes it and a procedure where perhaps, if the state is lucky, a hearing can be held prior to the time the film is removed from the jurisdiction. 
    And, the adversary hearing approach in the limited cases in which we have tried it has been very unsuccessful, and I don’t blame the judges of New York for this purpose. 
    It is, in fact, the nature of the obscenity business which puts the incentive of delay and obstruction on the defendant.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3577.081" stopTime="3579.457">

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Your Honor, it is the judges, but the defendant’s Fifth-- Sixth Amendment right to counsel is generally what has been interjected and, I think, not unjustifiably where counsel needs time to prepare. 
    It certainly needs time to prepare. 
    He has to see the film.H 
    e has to come get experts. 
    Experts have to be contacted. 
    They have to see the film. 
    A lengthy period of time is required. 
    We cannot have-- if a full-pledged hearing, as Mr. Anolik suggested, be held, if that is what an adversary hearing is and, Mr. Justice Stewart, I don’t think anyone is really to find what it is because the Court is just simply saying either one is needed or isn’t and leave it to the states to work out what they will.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3619.331" stopTime="3619.597">

    So, you--
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="3619.597" stopTime="3633.076">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    But if a hearing is required, then the problem of delay is forced into the hearing process by the Sixth Amendment, if nothing else. 
    It’s not even bad faith. 
    It may even be good faith, but there must be delay.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3633.076" stopTime="3643.874">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But you-- if it were the other way, then the state concedes and holds pending what you say is necessarily a period of time for preparation?
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="3643.874" stopTime="3663.376">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    If the def-- if the person who had custody of the film requires a time for preparation, then the state-- if he wants the time, then should that state return it to him during that period. 
    I mean, that’s the practical effect of the question because we are ready for a hearing once the film has been seized as before the Court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3663.376" stopTime="3675.612">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I suppose you might say too that, although frequently defense counsel in criminal cases will want delay in the actual trial of the action, they may not insist on delay of-- for preliminary hearing.
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="3675.612" stopTime="3742.004">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    No, they may or they may not, depending on how it suits the strategy of a particular defense, but the question is whether the state must be put in a position where delay is a matter of right, and I think that the Sixth Amendment would make it a matter of right. 
    So that, it is particularly appropriate in this instance where, in a movie case, the state’s only proof is the film. 
    More than the film would not be required and submitted, and that can be held at the movie theater when the man is arraigned promptly, we have Courts operating from 9 in the morning until midnight every day. 
    Hearings can be held, but who should have the burden of initiating it after a judge has seen the film and has made a determination? 
    Because, we submit, that it is the judicial presence and not the adversary’s presence which is the crux of what this Court has tried to say in Marcus and A Quantity of Books. 
    That is, there must be a magistrate who’s made a specific determination on a specific film and how as to whether he must hear argument or not, we can’t tell.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3742.004" stopTime="3745.216">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Yes, sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3745.694" stopTime="3749.708">

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, I know.
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="3751.902" stopTime="3757.568">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    The New York Court of Appeals, in this case, in its opinion seem to treat it as being a question of argument as oppose to a question of proof.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3757.568" stopTime="3765.160">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But what you’re doing now with the magistrate going to the theater, that-- there’s no-- nothing in the way of a contest.

    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="3788.588" stopTime="3818.164">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    Well, Your Honor, the sug-- the reading the New York Courts have taken I think is a reasonable one and that is that the constitution in the seizure of possibly protected material requires more than an officer’s statement as to probable cause, and if a magistrate, bringing the judicial mind to the question of obscenity, has made a determination which, for all intense and purposes, must be a prima facie determination, not one of probably cause.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3818.164" stopTime="3820.199">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And an ex parte one.
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="3820.199" stopTime="3821.515">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    It may be ex parte in that--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3821.515" stopTime="3822.463">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, that’s what it is.
speaker="lewis_r_friedman" startTime="3822.463" stopTime="3885.706">
    Mr. Lewis R. Friedman 
    It may be ex parte, but that doesn’t necessarily make it deficient because in a judge-- in deciding the questions of obscenity, there are no questions of fact in the sense of an informant type of search warrant case. 
    It’s not a factual determination. 
    It’s an inference determination, an inference from basically a conceded fact, that is, the film is conceded to be here. 
    From that film, what inference could be drawn? 
    And, to require the defendant’s presence with counsel and, conceivably, experts and we really don’t know what else, at this stage, would really be an unreasonable burden of a valid state interest, a valid state interest which this Court has upheld in saying that the prosecution of obscenity laws may be continued. 
    So that, we submit that the New York practice under which a magistrate seize a film prior to the issuance of a warrant of allegedly obscene material is constitutionally sufficient.
