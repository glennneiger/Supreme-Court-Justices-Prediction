Tacon v. Arizona

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Arguments next in number 71-6060, Tacon against Arizona. 
    Mr. Hirsh, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="44.327" stopTime="112.689">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    If I could give the Court a brief presentation of the facts in this particular matter, Mr. Tacon was a soldier down at Fort Huachuca in 1969 and in February of that year he was arrested for unlawful sale of marihuana, he was claimed to have transferred a little of an ounce of marihuana to an undercover agent and as the result of that arrest was a charge in the Cochise County Superior Court in South Eastern Arizona. 
    Mr. Tacon was given appointed counsel, he was released from his own recognizance, released back to his company commander and in the summer of the that year, he’d spent time consulting with his court-appointed attorney and if there was a continuance granted at the court-appointed attorney’s request. 
    There was no time set after the motion for continuance was made, the trial judge didn’t set a time certain and in December of 1969, Mr. Tacon was discharged from the service. 
    He called his court-appointed attorney said, “Mr. Whitney, I’ve got to go back to New York, I’m discharged from the service.” 
    Mr. Whitney thereupon told Tacon, “That’s fine, give me your address back there and I’ll notify you when the trial comes up.” 
    In March the 3rd --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="112.689" stopTime="117.354">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Was his release conditioned in any way on remaining within the jurisdiction of the court?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="117.354" stopTime="185.085">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    No sir, it wasn’t. 
    That was one of the issues that was raised in Cochise County at a hearing and the only restriction that Tacon had on was that his orders had been plugged and Tacon testified at that hearing that he didn’t know the meaning of that and all he understood was that he was to remain at Fort Huachuca as long as he was in the Army but he didn’t understand or have anyone tell him that he couldn’t go back to New York. 
    The trial judge had a different belief as to that and the trial judge in fact had claimed that Tacon had violated his trust and violated the bail arrangement by leaving the state although, I think the record shows that Tacon did act on good faith when he went back to New York. 
    He called the court-appointed attorney in Cochise County and also he had a federal charge that at that time was against him and he called the -- then the U.S. Commissioner in (Inaudible) and the bail restrictions and the federal charge did specify that he was not allowed to leave the State of Arizona without prior permission. 
    Tacon called the U.S. Commissioner and got specific express permission to leave the State and then went to New York. 
    So the state of the record indicates that at least he didn’t have any good faith plea for cause to believe that he was not allowed to leave the State of Arizona.

    Tell me again –-
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="185.480" stopTime="189.904">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Did it show how he got back to New York in his own funds?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="189.904" stopTime="196.749">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    No, it does not show that. 
    I assume that he had some severance pay from the service, for the service provided wanting to get back to New York.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="196.749" stopTime="205.987">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Was he a New Yorker when he entered the Army? 
    Unless he’s changed, [Voice Overlap] came in he’s planning to go back to New York at the taxpayers expense?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="205.987" stopTime="217.588">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    I’m almost certain that he was a New York resident. 
    I just –- I don’t have a specific recollection of it. 
    I know his family during the time he was in the service moved to Florida and that his mother was a Florida resident at the time this particular case came up for trial.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="217.588" stopTime="223.162">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But did he consult his -- does the record show whether he consulted with his lawyer before he left Arizona?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="223.162" stopTime="286.281">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Yes, it does. 
    The appendix shows that in fact, our hearing after the trial indicates that and the attorney verifies this that Tacon called the attorney on the phone and advised him that he is now being discharged from the service. 
    He told him he was going to New York and the attorney said, “Fine, you just give me your address in New York in order to enable me to locate you when the case is called for trial.” 
    So I think it’s clear from the record that Tacon did act in good faith when he went back to New York and fairly welcome as he didn’t violate the law based on my interpretation of the facts. 
    In any event, Tacon returns to New York and on March the 3rd, the trial judge by minute entry advised his counsel that the trial date is to be March 31, 1970. 
    The attorney, the court-appointed attorney after receiving notice of the trial date then writes a letter to Tacon and in this letter he merely states your trial is now set for March 31st, I want you to be out in Bisbee at least one week prior to the time set for trial. 
    That was it, there was nothing about trial absentia if he wasn’t present, there is no more said.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="286.281" stopTime="293.398">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Is there any explanation for the long delay between the alleged commission of the offense and the trial?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="293.398" stopTime="314.459">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Court procedures in Arizona sometimes we have long delays in Arizona and I should say, I shouldn’t make admissions like that but there’s no apparent explanation. 
    It is common at least in my county to have delays of a year or year and a half depending on the court calendar. 
    It’s not common in federal court. 
    It is common in state court. 
    They’re trying to resolve it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="314.459" stopTime="315.799">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It was only within a year or more than a year, wouldn’t it?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="315.799" stopTime="430.067">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Yes sir, that matter is through -- attempting to resolve these problems right now and speed up the trial process. 
    In any event, Tacon and I might add that the Arizona Supreme Court opinion is in error and the Attorney General is in error when they say that Tacon by that letter of March 3rd was advised that he would be tried in absentia, this is the only notice that Tacon received from his court-appointed lawyer that is the letter of March the 3rd. 
    Tacon receives as he testifies around the 8th or 9th of March and he now has -- finds himself with a short time to get up to Arizona and he has no funds, at least this is what he testifies to. On the 28th it is of March, he attempts to call the court-appointed attorney. 
    This is on a Saturday and he calls the attorney in Wilcox, Arizona in his home and he is unable to reach him. 
    He again calls on Monday, that’s the first business day after the weekend and tells him, “I simply don’t have the funds to get to Arizona. 
    I don’t know what to do.” 
    And the court-appointed attorney, and I might add on the 24th the county-attorney of Cochise County gets wind off the fact that Tacon might not be available on Arizona for trial and the State is bringing a witness from El Reno, Oklahoma to testify and the county is anticipating spending some $1,000 in order to see this witness get to Cochise county. 
    The county attorney then advised of the Judge that there’s some question about Tacon appearing at trial and the judge says, well-- we submitted an entry on this part of the appendix in this case, the judge says that if he’s not here, we’re going to try him on absentia, there is minute entry to that effect. 
    The court-appointed attorney is advised with this and in the telephone conversation that occurs on March 30th. 
    He tells Tacon, this is the first time Tacon is advised that if he is not present in Arizona, the very next day that he will tried on absentia, and --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="430.067" stopTime="434.175">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you suggest that he must be affirmatively advised to that effect?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="434.175" stopTime="568.088">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Well, this goes to the issue of waiver and I think it’s the States position that there was an a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to be present then the waiver is fortified by the claim that Tacon was specifically advised that he would be tried for absentia if he didn’t appear. 
    It simply isn’t the case at all and the fact of the matter is that he did -- was advised of the trial date by the letter of March the 3rd but that was the only notice he received and enough time to get to Arizona in order to be present for trial. 
    In any event, the trial starts March 31st, the court-appointed lawyer appears before the Court and advises the court that there was a telephone conversation with the Tacon but Tacon didn’t have the funds to be present. 
    The judge who had apparently made up his mind from the week preview said, “You search the court area and see if this gentleman is around, and if he’s not around we’re going to try him absentia. 
    I am making a finding now pursuant to Arizona Rule of Procedure 231” that Tacon’s absence is voluntary. 
    Our rule provides that this finding is to be made at the outset of the trial and we’ll get into the distinction between Rule 43 and the Arizona Rule but in any event, the finding of voluntariness is made by the trial judge at the start of the trial prior to the commencement of trial that morning. 
    They go through the first day of trial; I might add parenthetically, there was a confession extracted from Tacon of a questionable voluntariness. 
    This isn’t in the record but they had Tacon locked up for three hours after the sale was made and that Tacon was crying and after three hours of interrogation, he finally confessed that he in fact had sold a little marihuana to the undercover agent. 
    So that was an issue of that second day of trial. 
    The first day of trial, they selected a jury and made opening statements and examined the first witness, the one from El Reno. 
    In the second day, the State had intended to present evidence of the confession for a voluntariness hearing outside the presence of the jury. 
    The court-appointed lawyer gets word after the first night of trial that Tacon’s mother now finds out that Tacon is supposed to be in Arizona and the mother is going to provide funds for Tacon to arrive in Arizona.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="568.088" stopTime="572.434">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Who did that word come from Mr. Hirsh?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="572.434" stopTime="600.508">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    The way that the information got to the mother was a result of a letter being sent to Tacon’s former mother-in-law’s residence in New York and the former mother-in-law then advised the mother -- the Tacon’s mother in Miami. 
    Tacon’s mother then called I believe Whitney, the court-appointed lawyer and thereafter hired a lawyer by the name Burt Levey in Miami to attempt to negotiate with Whitney to see that Tacon arrived in Arizona for trial.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="600.508" stopTime="610.790">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So that when Whitney came into court and make his representation the second day, he had had no direct communication from the defendant himself that he would be there.
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="610.790" stopTime="611.899">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    The only communication –-

    Is that correct?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="612.317" stopTime="624.028">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Yes, sir. 
    The only communication he had had there before was the converse -- the telephone conversation on March 30, and thereafter he didn’t hear directly from Tacon. 
    He heard from the mother and then from it the attorney in Miami.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="624.028" stopTime="628.176">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And the substance of the conversation on March 30 was that he might be there or might not?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="628.176" stopTime="643.194">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    No, the substance of the conversation was the fact that “Mr. Whitney, I want to be there. 
    I intend to be there but I simply don’t have the funds at the present time to get to Arizona and would you see if you can get me a continuance.” 
    And Whitney said, “I doubt that I’m going to be able. 
    In fact, I’m sure I can’t.”
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="643.194" stopTime="644.549">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    This is on March 30th?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="644.549" stopTime="682.844">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    This is on March 30th, yes sir. 
    This is on Monday, the first business day after the weekend. 
    The reason he gave for not calling earlier was that he doesn’t know what to do, he thought he was hopeful that he come into some money and something would happen that would enable him to have the funds to arrive in Arizona but his expectation simply didn’t materialized. 
    In any event, after the first day of trial, the judge has now advised that there are funds available for Tacon to arrive. 
    There is a motion for continuance made and the judge again made a second express finding at that time, denied the motion for continuance, made the second express finding that Tacon was voluntary absent but –-
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="682.844" stopTime="684.925">

    What was the motion specifically?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="684.925" stopTime="696.182">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    The specific motion was the motion to continue for one day in order to enable Tacon to be present at trial.

    I suppose that if the judge would give him one day, he’d give a day and a half until Tacon actually appeared, I don’t think the judge for that –-

    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, I know but the fact is –-
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="717.907" stopTime="722.876">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Yes, the continuance was for one day where the motion was made asking for one day.

    Unknown Speaker 
    The information was that he could easily be there by that time?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="726.711" stopTime="746.305">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    I expect that he have the hopes that Tacon could arrive. 
    In any event, that motion was denied, the case proceeded to trial, the jury went out and promptly found Tacon guilty. 
    Tacon arrived Friday morning, turned himself in with there is a warrant for his arrest and remained in the Cochise County Jail until he was sentenced some three or four weeks thereafter. 
    The trial judge –-

    Yes, he would have testified that that confession was involuntarily made, I believe again, I wasn’t trial counsel on the case and I know there were substantial questions as to voluntariness that was raised and the issue was resolved adversely to Tacon by the trial judge. 
    But at least there would have been some chance that that confession was excluded. 
    I might add that confession was replete with evidence of other crimes that weren’t related to this and that might claim before the Arizona Supreme Court was that confession should have not been admitted because there were irrelevant material that showed that Tacon had engaged another bad action.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    It was not made because the burden is on the, our position was the burden was on the state of Arizona to affirmatively show this man’s absence from trial was knowingly and voluntarily made and the state never presented a hearing on this particular matter and I don’t feel for the defendant to now have the burden of making a motion for a new trial and having the burden of proving that he was absence -- was violative of this constitutional right and violative of the Constitution, and in order to have waiver, I think the burden of this Court has long held the burdens on the state of Arizona or in the Government to show that waiver and show it by clear and convincing evidence.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="946.246" stopTime="951.386">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Once your motion might have been granted, instead you’re taking the burden of an appeal up here?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="951.386" stopTime="960.801">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    I doubt that in view of the trial judge’s feelings towards this man, I doubt that the trial judge would have granted any relief in this particular case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="960.801" stopTime="965.425">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Or maybe the Supreme Court would have granted relief if your analysis is correct.
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="965.425" stopTime="1017.700">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Well, the matter went up, the same issue was presented to the Arizona Supreme Court and in fact the only -- the first time that anyone claimed that there should have a motion for a new trial made was in the response by the Attorney General in this case that perhaps the defendant should have made a motion for a new trial but the same issues were presented to the trial judge, they were presented to the -- I take the back, they weren’t presented to the trial judge, they were presented to the Arizona Supreme Court and the Arizona Supreme Court didn’t mention our Rule 311 that provides promotion for a new trial. 
    The Arizona Supreme Court met the issue directly and held that the absence of Tacon was voluntary, that Rule 231 was constitutional and that that was the end of it. 
    So, I think it’s superfluous, number one to have made a motion for new trial and number two, I think that again that would be at odds with the Constitution because it replace the burden on showing waiver on the defendant, and again that’s complex with all the principles that --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1017.700" stopTime="1036.883">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So there you’re assuming that on that motion, the conventional rule of putting the burden on the move out would have applied. 
    But if had pressed that point in the trial court, how do we now know that the Court would not have adopted your version of the burden of proof?
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="1036.883" stopTime="1042.080">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Well, of course, you can’t be certain, I know this judge personally. 
    I have doubts [Voice Overlap]. 
    I understand that.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1042.080" stopTime="1046.108">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, I object to matter of [Voice Overlap] we’re concerned about.
speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="1046.108" stopTime="1191.014">
    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    I have doubts that he would have accepted that and perhaps I wish we’re missing not making a request but to say the issue as to whether or not that motion should have been made was never brought up, was never raised in the Arizona Supreme Court. 
    It’s now raised for the first time by the Attorney General here and I think if the State wanted to interpose that argument, perhaps they should have raised it for some previous time, in view the fact that the Arizona Supreme Court did resolve this matter on the issue. 
    My position in this particular matter I might add after the trial terminated, there was a contempt hearing. 
    Tacon received the sentence for five to five-and-a-half years in the Arizona State Penitentiary by this judge and short time after judgment was entered and sentence was passed, he filed a, he directed the county attorney to file an order to show cause ordering Tacon to show cause why he shouldn’t be held in contempt for failing to abide by the court’s order appearing at the time specified in the minute entry. 
    That was my fist appearance in the case and the result of that was that we had an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether or not Tacon willfully and intentionally absent himself from the jurisdiction and we didn’t get into the constitutional question although the hearing was akin to the issue that’s before the Court now. 
    The trial judge after hearing all of the evidence took the matter under advisement and it is to this day still under advisement. 
    He never did rule as to whether or not Tacon was held or should be held in contempt for his willful failure to appear. 
    He did state and I might add -- state virtuously on the record that after Tacon, at the close of the hearing, Tacon requested to make a statement to the court and at state he said, “Your Honor, I swore to you that I intended to be present at trial. 
    I never intended to absent myself and I swore to you that what I’ve told you is the truth.” 
    And the trial judge at that time said. 
    “Mr. Tacon, I can assure you that I’m not in impress one bit with your stated intention at this time” and that was the end of it. 
    We took the appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court and it was on that language that the Arizona Supreme Court said that the trial judge apparently felt that this man willfully, intentionally absent himself from the jurisdiction and did not voluntarily waived his right to be present at the trial and they used that language as to, as a claim that the trial judge made a finding.

    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Well, again, I distinguished that. 
    But the issue says -- well it wasn’t presented to the court and I think that when we’re talking about a finding --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1207.393" stopTime="1210.210">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    He heard the witness and signed when he heard all the witnesses’ reasons and excuses.

    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Yes. 
    But I think when we’re talking about an evidentiary hearing on the question of waiver, as to waiver of a constitutional right, I think there ought to be a little more specificity than a judge’s reaction to the witnesses’ testimony, and I think were talking about in fact an evidentiary hearing, that’s what this Court has always mandated, that an evidentiary hearing be made and that specific findings be determined by the court. 
    There were no specific findings and I grant the Court that perhaps you can infer what the findings might have been had they been squarely presented to the court but there were no such findings made and the issue was never squarely presented to the court and to this day, there is no issue for finding the fact or in the question of whether Anthony Tacon voluntarily appeared or voluntarily failed appearance, I’m sorry.

    With respect to this, a defendant is on bail or on personal recognizance, he goes out of the State, doesn’t violate his bail and he’s notified his trials set and he simply writes “Since I have no money to be there, until I do, I fully intend to be there and once I can never get there but I am going to, there’s just no way of my I’m getting there.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that position a normal, normally used after a person is indicted or is it a function of extradition to getting back for the purpose of indicting him and charging.

    Mr. Robert J. Hirsh 
    Well, they might give the local court more control over the defendant in the hopes that he will abide by that bail arrangement but there is nothing that can be done. 
    The question is weighing the fact of trying someone in absentia in this particular instance, the court-appointed counsel in fact in most instances, the court-appointed counsel without that individual being present to be at the trial, to make sure, to assure that there’s integrity in that trial and insure that court-appointed counsel does his job as opposed to the state’s policy of proceeding with the trial in the defendants absence and in so weighing I think it’s a matter of policy.

    We don’t have any provisions, any procedural provisions in our state procedure to suppress confessions prior to trial. 
    You can suppress unlawfully obtained evidence but as far as the voluntariness of a confession is concerned, that has to be done at trial. 
    We don’t have any specific rule unless the trial judge grants you permission to have that done prior to trouble.

    Yes, my case, I haven’t add a factor, the fact, this man was innocent might -- factually, I feel that he didn’t make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to be present because he simply didn’t have the funds to appear but if you ask me hypothetically if there is any difference as far as position, I would take there would be no difference.

    There was a recent case decided by our Supreme Court that’s, we cited State versus Davis was decided the day or two before this Court accepted cert in my petition where they had given notice to the defendant and he wasn’t seen thereafter and he was tried on absentia and no one had seen him, by some and the court-appointed lawyer and he was convicted and I don’t recall whether he sentenced.

speaker="william_p_dixon" startTime="2355.409" stopTime="2467.938">
    Mr. William P. Dixon 
    That is the rule Mr. Justice White, they had recently probably under the pressure from this Court and the federal courts, been considering the federal constitutional questions when they are raised for the first time with them but that rule is of longstanding, but unless it is presented first to the trial court to give the trial court a chance to correct its own mistake, it will not consider it on appeal. 
    As I say they’ve been ignoring that tacitly in recent decisions when it has been constitutional question that is first presented and I think rightly so because otherwise they can go to the Federal District Court on a writ of habeas and there was no question about it. 
    Alright, this case for me at least has been one that was difficult to get ahead along in the beginning and I think that was because of three particular reasons. 
    The first reason being the claim of poverty, poverty seemed to raise the constitutional question that we have run roughshod over somebody’s rights over some poor persons right. 
    I think also because of the claim that there had been no hearing on voluntariness and untimely of course when I searched the record, we found that the trial judge made no express decision after he had heard all of the testimony on his motion for contempt. 
    But really, the only issues of this case could ever present whether before this Court or before the Arizona Supreme Court would be two. 
    One is the constitutionality of Arizona’s Rule 231 and the second issue would be dependent upon the resolution of the first and that would be granted that rule as constitutional was there sufficient evidence before the court to sustain the finding if only an implied finding which it did make.

    The appellant does not argue with that proposition nor does he urge the Court to hold that Rule 231 is unconstitutional, that’s the opening paragraph of petitioners brief to the Arizona Supreme Court on the constitutional status of Arizona Rule 231.

    And that he proceeds to say there, the thrust of this brief is that the question presented here is whether or not there was in fact a waiver.
