    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This appeal by the Indiana Employment Security Division presents the issue of validity of certain practices used by the Division in determining the eligibility of claimants for unemployment compensation benefits. 
    These practices which are called for by the Indiana Law, were held by a three-judge district court not to comply with requirements of the Social Security Act.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Before you move further Mr. Diamond it would help me if you clear up the situation, the factual situation. 
    As I understand it the appeal board reversed the division officer's decision to terminate these benefits and so what is the posture of the benefits now? 
    Were they allowed, and are they being paid?
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="65.840" stopTime="71.644">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    Are you referring here Mr. Chief Justice to Mrs. Burney's case if it is a General rule? 
    I am afraid, I don't understand the question.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="71.644" stopTime="79.348">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, somewhere in this massive material, I got the impression that the division officer in this case --
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="79.348" stopTime="80.192">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    In this case --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="80.192" stopTime="93.358">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- have reversed -- had been reversed by the appeal board and that the benefits denied by the division officer were then granted.
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="93.358" stopTime="166.121">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    They had in fact been granted much earlier on the basis of the preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order issued by the district court. 
    The facts of Mrs. Burney's particular case were moot well before the district court entered its judgment. 
    In fact, it became moot at the time the referee providing the type of hearing which was required by the district court order determined that she was not eligible for benefits. 
    In this case, the first determination by the deputy was that Mrs. Burney was not eligible for benefits in that she was unduly restricting the hours in which she was available for work. 
    The referee after a full hearing upheld that determination. 
    The review board after going over the case, hearing argument determined that the restriction upon her hours of possible work was not so severe as to indicate that she was not available for work within the statutory meaning.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="166.121" stopTime="169.427">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And then what happened?
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="169.427" stopTime="235.341">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    At that time her case was completed. 
    There was no appeal to the Indiana Court of appeals on this. 
    So, Mrs. Burney's case was moot at this point in the same way that the Java case, also an unemployment compensation case, was moot well before it ever came before the courts for final decision. 
    This was a class action, although her particular claim was not designated as such. 
    The district court clearly stated that it was ruling on behalf of Mrs. Burney and of a subclass within the original case. 
    In the original case, there were actually two questions. 
    One being precisely identical to the Java issue and the other Mrs. Burney's case. 
    So the district court divided this into two subclasses while Mrs. Burney's particular case was moot at a very early stage this is a class action within the scope of the district court opinion.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that was a class action and that had to do I guess rather directly with the doctrine of the Java case and that was decided and that is not an issue before us.

    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    She was an individual intervener within the scope of her case.

    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    I cannot say definitely. 
    We thought it would be better to see if we get determination because this was fair representation and the fact that the district court order did not depend upon the facts of the individual case. 
    District court order was very general.

    Yes, Your Honor, since that time when a deputy has made a determination of ineligibility, if the claimant files a notice of appeal benefits are still paid until the referee hears it and enters a decision --

    Within the terms -- at the present time if this were vacated it would go and go back our assume to the prior practices, this would be a decision made by the division and not by our office and then the class would come back into and the injunction was no longer in effect.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="587.239" stopTime="600.578">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The fact is that there is probably no other member of this class who could now intervene in the lawsuit because you have made sure there isn't any other member of the class?
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="600.578" stopTime="607.207">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    That is true because we would like to follow District Court injunctions.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="607.207" stopTime="615.159">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If the district court Injunction were vacated, you would soon have a lot of people coming into that class?
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="615.159" stopTime="1420.657">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    I would assume so because I would assume the decision is not my to make, but as soon as Division would then go back to something like its prior practices. 
    If I may then, deal briefly with the types of determinations which are involved here. 
    In determining a claim for benefits, there are basically three determinations to be made, breaking this down into three as far as appropriate analysis, as a matter of law, there are only two. 
    The first of these is the determination of insured status. 
    This is merely whether the claimant has had enough work and has earned wage credits in a covered employment to be eligible for benefits if he meets the eligibility requirements. 
    This determination says nothing about whether the person is eligible or not eligible. 
    In fact, a person can even request this determination when he is still employed. 
    The second determination goes to eligibility and this, I have broken down into two parts. 
    The first issue, going to the reason for termination of the prior employment, that is basically whether the termination was attributable to the employer or to the employee. 
    The third issue, which is involved in this case is a continuing question of the conduct of the claimant during the period of the unemployment. 
    Each week, the claimant is required to well, continue to be unemployed, to be able to work, to be available for work, to be making an independent effort to secure work, to not have refused an offer of a suitable job or not have refused instructions by Division to apply for a job which would be suitable. 
    This determination is made each week by the Division and it is on this basis that the determination of eligibility for that week is made. 
    There is never any determination by the Division which would have any effect for any week prior -- past the time of that week. 
    This is like, in a sense, pay for looking for work and you don't get paid until after you have done the job. 
    When a person comes in each week to present his claim, he is required to establish that he has met these criteria. 
    This establishment may come about by his certification, upon the voucher form that he has met these requirements. 
    It may come by an interview or a hearing, an interview type hearing with a Claims Deputy. 
    This hearing would be basically similar to the hearing on an initial claim which was described by this Court in its opinion in the Case of California Department of Human Resources Development versus Java. 
    The party, the claimant is called in, the question which raises the doubt is discussed. 
    If there is anyone else who would have information, the Deputy finds that information and he reaches a determination of whether or not the person was eligible for that particular week. 
    That decision is as much an initial decision in that sense as is the first week. 
    The only difference being that in the normal situation, it is not necessary each week to determine the questions of why the previous employment was terminated. 
    In this case, Mrs. Burney was determined by the Division, by the Deputy not to be available for work in that she was unduly restricting the hours for which she was available for work and the other case was presenting the same issue, in the New York case of Torres, there was the plaintiff Mr. Dinger who was found by the Division not to be making an effort to secure work. 
    In the Vermont case of Wheeler versus Vermont, there was a determination there that the claimant had refused to seek work when directed by the Division. 
    In the California case, Mrs. Crow was determined to have refused an offer of suitable work. 
    When these questions arose, it was necessary to make a determination of the prior week's conduct because each of these questions is a condition precedent to eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits. 
    This is a different type of system than the welfare system, in which there is an initial determination of status such as a family has a child or children who are dependent within the definition of 42 U.S.C Section 606, that is, a needy child living with a designated relative who is deprived of the parental support of at least one parent. 
    In those cases, once a determination is made, it continues in effect and it was necessary to have a hearing because a prior determination having continuing effect is now being changed. 
    The welfare recipient has no such affirmative duties to go out and look for work, to be available for work and not to review his work. 
    So, we have a completely different situation here. 
    The welfare situation is not applicable to this case at all. 
    In looking to this Court's decision in Java last year which was held by the District Court to be dispositive of the issue, I believe that the rule of law of the Java Court actually supports the position of the Division in this case. 
    In Java, you had an initial determination by the Deputy in the California Department, as to the eligibility of a particular claimant. 
    After that determination had been made, one of the parties to that case filed a notice appeal and that notice or appeal was sufficient in itself to call for determination of benefits, even though in that case, the Division had determined that the benefits were due. 
    So, you were allowing a party to upset the decision of the impartial agency. 
    In this case, we merely have the other party seeking to overturn the decision of the impartial agency that benefits are not due, this is merely two sides of the same coin. 
    I would emphasize in this respect that the Indiana Employment Security Division is an impartial arbiter in these cases. 
    The State of Indiana and the Division have no interest in whether or not these payments are made, in the sense that the money used to pay these benefits comes from employers and not from the state treasury. 
    The administrative expenses so long as the plan is held to be in compliance with the Federal Law are paid by the Federal government. 
    The interest of the state agency is merely in having a workable system in which the authority of the impartial arbiter is upheld and the duties placed upon claimants by the Social Security Act and the State Unemployment Compensation Laws are met. 
    When Congress passed the provision to the Social Security Law dealing with the questions of Unemployment Compensation, they had before it a general outline of what Unemployment Compensation plan would be like and this included these issues. 
    The District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Code which was then passed by Congress, includes the same provisions. 
    So as a result we have the determination by the agency that a party is not eligible for benefits. 
    We have a claimant for whatever reason, in most cases probably because of a sincere questions as to the fact but as was pointed out in the Java case possibly by an arbitrary desire or merely by a desire to apply short run benefit may file a frivolous appeal. 
    There is no way to determine this until the referee decision has been made and in some cases on from there to the Review Board and from there to the Indiana Court of Appeals. 
    The issue of due process has been presented in this case. 
    I am not sure that it is this issue in this case except to in the following way. 
    The District Court did not rule on the due process issue presented under Goldberg versus Kelly. 
    It did, however, require the division to provide a prior due process hearing and did not explain what that hearing should consist of. 
    Division filed a motion for amendment of judgment to show what that hearing would consist of and the District Court refused that motion being unable or unwilling to say what a due process hearing is. 
    I believe it's clear from the law that there is no such thing as a due process hearing in the sense of a specific set of requirements. 
    Due process is a much more general phrase which would vary from period to period and from case to case. 
    What is due process in one situation would not be due process in another. 
    And what maybe a denial of due process in one situation would provide due process in another situation. 
    Therefore, it's necessary to look at this question within the realm of the unemployment compensation and not in the question of welfare even though both of these are programs under the Social Security Act and determine whether the deputy determination would be a proper determination in this case. 
    Whether the deputy determination is itself a due process hearing within the scope of the District Court order. 
    Since the District Court refused or wasn't able to clarify that order, the Division felt it was necessary to give it the strictest possible interpretation because they didn't know what might put them in contempt of Court.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What mode of hearing is in fact given?
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="1426.300" stopTime="1527.988">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    Since the injunction was presented, there is the deputy determination which is basically the same question -- the same procedure as was presented in the Java case, that is the deputy interviews the claimant, interviews other persons having information about it. 
    Now in the above both the cases for example frequently there will be no employer party because the prior employer would have no way of having knowledge as to the behavior of the claimant after this period. 
    After all of this information is presented and in most of these cases the information comes exclusively from the claimant himself, the deputy determines the facts and determines whether that brings a person within one of the limitations, whether in that situation the person is eligible. 
    However, since the District Court injunction was entered, the deputy determination did made in the same way. 
    However the deputy determination of ineligibility is not given effect if the claimant expresses a desire to appeal to a referee, but rather benefits are paid despite the fact that there has never been a determination of eligibility for that period until a referee hearing and the written formal referee opinion is handed down.

    At that time also they might suggest other ways of finding work, perhaps looking in a slightly different field, checking to see if there is some other type of skill which the employee -- which the claimant has, which would enable him to find work in a slightly different field. 
    This is not merely an attempt by the Division to do a person out of benefits. 
    It's an attempt to find out whether the person meets the criteria and try to find a way to find him a job.

    Mr. Diamond it's probably of no consequence, but a while back you said the fund came from the employer. 
    Is there no contributory aspect to this at all, nothing taken out of the employee's salary while he is working?
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="1699.200" stopTime="1709.444">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond

    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    It is not a contributory fund.

    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond

speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="1739.081" stopTime="1761.707">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    I believe it is 10 days in the normal case. 
    In certain cases where you have an interstate claimant and the like, it maybe 15 days, but ordinarily the appeal must be presented within that period of time and under Indiana law that time limit is jurisdictional for consideration by the next highest club.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1761.707" stopTime="1774.011">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well that is the time limit on the filing of the appeal. 
    What is the experience been in the terms of how promptly a hearing maybe had before the referee?
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="1774.011" stopTime="1813.140">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    This varies according to the staffing of the department and according to the case load at the time. 
    At the time that Mrs. Burney's case arose, it was a long period of time, perhaps 10-15 weeks. 
    At the present time, most -- about half of the cases or more -- are being decided by the referee within 30 days. 
    This is because primarily of an increase in the staffing and partly because this is a little bit soccer time for claims, not has been any claims are being presented.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    The question I asked was whether at the hearing before the referee what elements of due process are now provided in light of the injunction of the district court, how do they compare with what previously existed?
speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="1850.159" stopTime="1910.924">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    The injunction of the district court did not affect the referee hearing. 
    This is an administrative hearing of counsel. 
    The parties are given notice. 
    They are told that they may bring witnesses. 
    They may bring counsel or any other person to assist them in presenting their case. 
    If a party is not represented the referee is given the duty of helping them present their case of bringing out all the facts which might be relevant to it. 
    It is like a court hearing in a sense, except that the referee has greater duties to make sure that the facts are presented then would an impartial judge who merely sits back and decides what the case is like. 
    It might be like a smoke flame cordon in many areas. 
    I don't think that there is any question but that that the referee hearing would provide the due process elements under Goldberg.

speaker="darrel_k_diamond" startTime="1992.532" stopTime="2070.118">
    Mr. Darrel K. Diamond 
    I believe the information I received from their office when last talking to them was that the an affidavit in the record in the co-case in California indicated that the total cost be something like the 167 million dollars there. 
    This was in extra employer contributions and extra administrative expenses. 
    If the benefits are found to be paid erroneously and is necessary to try to bring them back by either collecting the money or not paying for future weeks' of eligibility. 
    This requires extra administrative help. 
    For example, the Indiana Polis local claims office; before the injunction had one worker spending about half of his time on recouping erroneous payments. 
    Now this one office has two employees full time on this case and this is only the one local office. 
    So there is an extra administrative load which the expense of this is probably on the United States government and not upon the state government, but it is an extra administrative expense and extra administrative burdens.

    Mr. Ivan E. Bodensteiner 
    I represent Mrs. Burney and all members of the class as defined by the lower court. 
    I think what is important here is because of the very nature of the problem we are dealing with as the court was dealing with in Goldberg, the question is when do you get a hearing. 
    After the hearing is granted, there is no permanent member, no permanent class representative. 
    The problem continues as was indicated earlier that if the order is vacated, we will probably be back in the same circumstances, since it will be necessary to re-litigate the matter. 
    So in spite of the fact that Mrs. Burney has in fact received her hearing, as in fact received her benefits, the case is though is still ripe and there is still a controversy. 
    Now this Court in addition to Java and Goldberg has ruled similarly in some of the earlier cases. 
    In Motor Coach Employees versus Missouri in 1963 involved a labor dispute and a seizure of property by the Governor of Missouri. 
    The property was released before the appeal or reached the court and this Court still ruled on the question. 
    Likewise in Carroll versus Princess Anne College where students were enjoined from rally.

    Goldberg on the constitutional issue, Your Honor, Goldberg reached the constitutional issue involved in the welfare situation.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you say the eligibility factors are the same in this kind of case as in a welfare case under Social Security?
speaker="ivan_e_bodensteiner" startTime="2725.335" stopTime="2771.654">
    Mr. Ivan E. Bodensteiner 
    There are different eligibility criteria. 
    They are both Social Security Act programs. 
    The Social Security Act welfare aspects were aimed at those pretty much unable to work, the blind, old, disabled and children. 
    In the area of Unemployment Compensation Benefits, Congress was dealing with those who were working, suddenly out of work for a short-term period and Congress was interested in taking care of their short-term need and for this reason, we feel the case is even stronger on the constitutional issue in Goldberg. 
    We're dealing with more complex factorial issues. 
    The interest of the State are much less than the interest of the State that were explored in Goldberg.

    So, one of the key factors here is that the program was designed to get these benefits to the unemployed as soon it is possible after they lose their job.

    The welfare procedure, the welfare system does not use the same procedure, in that there is not a signing.

    That is correct. 
    Now, in this case, Mrs. Burney had filed -- was employed, involuntarily lost her last employment and filed a claim for Unemployment Compensation Benefits. 
    As pointed out, she was found eligible for a period of 22 weeks. 
    She received these benefits for a period of 10 weeks. 
    At that time, she was advised by a Deputy that she was no longer eligible and the benefits would be terminated and were, in fact, terminated at that point. 
    Now Mrs. Burney's case points out the importance of a hearing in this context. 
    The termination was based on an alleged refusal to accept suitable work and an allegation that she was not making herself available for work. 
    After this was made, she requested a hearing. 
    Three months later, this hearing was held. 
    At this time, she produced evidence that she did, in fact, had grounds for refusing this job, that she was in fact available for work and that she also demonstrated that the reason she could not accept this job was because of the lack of proper transportation, the lack of babysitting, the fact that the job was in the middle of the night, the fact that she had never worked in night shift, the fact that she had no car, no public transportation, the job was too far away for her to walk to. 
    Now, when the Division was forced to prove its assertion that she had in fact refused suitable work, they were unable to do so. 
    As a result, the Review Board ultimately ruled in her favor.

    Plaintiff Torres was determined initially eligible for benefits allegedly without the employer having any notice of the application and therefore, without being involved in the critical procedure which this Court described in Java. 
    So, to that extent, it is a very unusual circumstance which we clearly don't have here. 
    Here the employer was involved in that initial determination of eligibility. 
    Now, concerning the constitutional issue. 
    In Goldberg, this Court found that welfare benefits could not be summarily terminated without affording the recipient a prior evidential hearing. 
    As pointed our earlier, this case is uniquely like Goldberg and in many respects, it is even stronger than Goldberg. 
    For example, the issues, the factual determinations to be made in unemployment compensation are more complex than those to be made in the context of welfare. 
    The interest of the State in a summary procedure are much less here than they were in Goldberg because of the recoupment provisions. 
    As pointed out, the State recoups over 70% of any wrongful payments. 
    In Goldberg, the Court recognized there was virtually no chance of recoupment.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    The Goldberg argument only becomes really a cutting if you are right in saying and in maintaining that this weekly determination is not a determination of initial eligibility?

    Mr. Ivan E. Bodensteiner 
    Yes. 
    In addition here, the determination of unemployment compensation benefits is a serious deprivation and a serious loss to the recipient as was the welfare, even though initial eligibility is not based on an individual means test. 
    Java and earlier decisions of this Court recognized that, Congress intended Unemployment Compensation to meet a short term need. 
    Just as welfare provides funds for the old, disabled, blind and children, Unemployment Compensation provides funds for unemployed workers, during their short-term unemployment. 
    Now as pointed out in the legislative history, a means test was not used because there was an explicit effort to avoid the stigma of welfare and the welfare mentality. 
    They didn't want workers to get into the -- relying on welfare and therefore, not look for jobs, but the need for a prior evidential hearing is very great here because of the complex factual issues. 
    Once a person is in this continued claim status after the initial determination of eligibility the issues that come up subsequently are usually as in Mrs. Burney's case, issues of availability and issues of refusal of work. 
    Indiana Courts have held that these questions involved questions of fact and depend on the circumstances in each case. 
    For example, is the claimant restricting the hours of work? 
    Is the claimant restricting herself to certain types of work? 
    Is the claimant looking for work? 
    Is the job suitable? 
    Was there an actual offer of a job? 
    Is the job safe? 
    Is there transportation to the job? 
    Is there babysitting? 
    What were the previous work habits? 
    Is the person physically fit to attend, to work at this job? 
    We contend that reliable answers to such questions can best be obtained at an evidential hearing. 
    I think the past experience of the division with a near 50% reversal rate indicates that there are -- in the past, there was not a reliable procedure. 
    As pointed out earlier, the interest of the State here are much less than in the welfare situation. 
    The ones -- argument advanced by the State and the brief is the need to minimize expenses. 
    Well, the State -- this is not convincing because of the recoupment procedures. 
    Indiana has been implementing this order for over a year now and there was no apparent great increase in the costs. 
    The issue, the numbers presented by the California situation, I think the decision there, the Crow decision had been in effect for over a year and I think those figures were actually rebutted by the opposition when that case came before this Court for an emergency cert. 
    The other argument advanced by the State is that this is going to create administrative chaos. 
    The experience is that it simply has not. 
    They have simply moved their referee hearing up in time and according to their own statistics is working very well. 
    So, there is absolutely no demonstration of either great costs or administrative chaos here. 
    The conclusion is as Congress recognized, we are dealing here with a program that is of critical importance to unemployed workers and our position is that only an evidential hearing prior to a termination of benefits can assure that the purposes of this program to get benefits to unemployed workers can adequately be met. 
    Thank you, Your Honors.
