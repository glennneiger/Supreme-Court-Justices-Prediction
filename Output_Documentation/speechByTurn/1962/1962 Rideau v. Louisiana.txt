    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    If on February 17, 1961, you are in the City of Lake Charles or the surrounding areas, in the late afternoon and you had your TV set on, you saw something which probably you had never seen before and probably may never see again. 
    We saw a 19-year old colored boy in the custody of the Sheriff of Calcasieu Parish confessing by sound and by this picture to the commission of three heinous crimes: murder, aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery. 
    That young colored boy is the petitioner before Your Honors. 
    The day before in Lake Charles in the late evening, a bank was robbed, three tellers kidnapped and taken out of town, shot, and one of them murdered with a knife. 
    The petitioner was picked up two or three hours later, he then thereafter made oral admissions, a written confession and the following morning, in the Sheriff's office, this boy who had up to that time had been without counsel, without friends, without anyone to lean on, was made the participant as well as the record shows without his knowledge of what was happening in this movie, at which time a sound track was made by the local and only television station in Lake Charles. 
    And that film which lasted for 20 minutes wherein this petitioner confessed to the commission of these crimes which shown on the 17th to approximately 24,000 people, was shown on February 18, the following day to approximately 53,000 people and was shown on February the 19th to approximately 29,000 people.

    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr.

    We think, if the Court please, that the result, the prejudice that resulted is the same. 
    We have no proof --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    No. 
    I realized that, but what I was wondering was, is this an instance of imaginative newspaperman doing this or is it a more sinister thing of the district attorney or the police contriving it?
speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="199.988" stopTime="214.513">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I have no proof to the matter. 
    I think it was a -- it was a very hot news item. 
    I think everybody became overexuberant perhaps about the quick capture and that sort of thing. 
    But I think that the phrases that resulted was nevertheless (Inaudible).

    The record doesn't show, if the Court please, that he voluntarily submitted to this or that he knew what was happening or that he gave them authority or okay, they're convicting him in the eyes of the public before he was even arraigned.

    Where did this television take place?
speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="278.643" stopTime="310.649">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    It was in the Sheriff's office, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    At the time, the Sheriff was shown on the film. 
    He also interviewed a state troop who apprehended this petitioner the night before. 
    It lasted for approximately 20 minutes. 
    The Sheriff would do most of the talking. 
    He'd say one out, “Wilbert, didn't you -- then you threw the knife here?” 
    And the petitioner would say, “Yes” and shake his head and he said, “Well now, you don't know why you did these crimes?” 
    And then the petitioner would say -- shake his head and say, “Yes.” 
    So --

    He participated in it.

    Participated there.
speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="333.599" stopTime="345.708">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    Now, I think in answering to Mr. Justice Harlan's question where the -- as I appreciated his question was this designed with the purpose of prejudicing this boy, I can't say that.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="345.708" stopTime="346.704">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That was the purpose.
speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="346.704" stopTime="394.802">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    But obviously the Sheriff knew about it because he must have arranged it. 
    He permitted it in his premises where no one could have gone without his permission. 
    And of course, all during this time, this boy had no counsel. 
    The record doesn't show that any time he had anyone to lean on which is another point that we have raised. 
    And again all of these, before arraignment, before indictment in fact, this took place February the 16th, to go on further, the boy was arraigned on March 1, 1961. 
    That time, not only had they had all admissions, a confession in writing, the following day the TV film, then the FBI took the confession. 
    Two weeks later, he was indicted by the grand jury and arraigned --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="394.802" stopTime="396.893">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Did he have counsel at arraignment?
speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="396.893" stopTime="415.726">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, and we specifically raised that. 
    He was arraigned on three counts and one indictment murder, aggravated kidnapping to which he plead not guilty. 
    To the third count, which was armed robbery with which was a felony murder in the context of all of these facts, he plead guilty. 
    The only thing left --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="415.726" stopTime="417.100">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is that the arraignment you mean?
speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="417.100" stopTime="426.114">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    This was at the arraignment as yet he did not have counsel. 
    Mr. Leithead and myself were not appointed until after this boy had plead guilty.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="426.114" stopTime="429.765">

speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="429.765" stopTime="432.034">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    They asked him, what we are you -- what were pleas, we were not (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    That's the practice. 
    To call the -- they accused before the boy asked him how he -- the indictment is read, how does he plead. 
    And of course, he plead not guilty to the first two and then guilty to the third. 
    Why? 
    That was permitted since what was involved was a felony murder, of course we don't know and we have raised it.

    That motion was denied and we of course reserved our -- it was argued in our court and it was one of the bases of our coming at this Court for a writ. 
    In addition to the fact, and we have also raised that this boy being allowed to plead guilty without counsel. 
    We also raised the question of these purported confessions which went into evidence. 
    Now, if the Court please, this record may not be as complete. 
    On this matter, we raised that and quite candidly it was not one of the four points raised in our application. 
    We asked the Court though to consider it under Rule 23 since we think it encompasses something properly under the -- or one of the four points that we did raise, in which the writ was granted.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Oh, I beg your pardon.
speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="569.046" stopTime="624.648">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    Now, in fairness to the state, we got us a complete record as was permitted. 
    Mr. Leithead and I without any apology were civil lawyers. 
    We don't normally practice law. 
    We were appointed by the trial court in Lake Charles to defend the petitioner. 
    So, consequently, as Your Honors know, in a civil practice, a record is being made and you rely on your record. 
    In this case, as in criminal cases in Louisiana, if you're questioning a witness on his voir dire examination and then you challenge him at the end and the judge says, “Well, I won't grant the challenge.” 
    You accept, you reserve your -- through his ruling, you reserve a bill, then everything stops. 
    And then the attorney for the accused and the district attorney attempt to reconstruct what was said. 
    So that if perhaps this record is not as complete as it should be, that is the reason and we did argue and raise that point in the lower court. 
    Now --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="624.648" stopTime="626.870">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What was -- is the record typewritten here?
speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="626.870" stopTime="703.901">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    Yes sir, Your Honor. 
    It's about 700 pages, but actually it's a lot of exhibits and pleadings and the like. 
    There's -- there is several hundred pages of testimony which was taken when we argued our motions for change of venue and a sanity hearing and the like. 
    Now, one point which I think will be raised by the State on this matter of not having counsel at the time of arraignment under our law, the judge may permit an accused to withdraw pleas for the purposes of filing motions. 
    That was done in this case, but we would say to Your Honors even though we were aware of the Hamilton case and the case that Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice read a procurement opinion in today, I think it was on Docket Number 600. 
    Nevertheless, even if we must for some reason in this case point to prejudice, we think this, the boy's plea of guilty to the armed robbery which was a series, one series of transactions, one crime was aired in the newspaper so that consequently he was at a critical time without the benefit of counsel. 
    So later when we withdrew those pleas and we said we now enter pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity such pleas became mere lawyer's pleas. 
    And --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="703.901" stopTime="709.602">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, that was substantively for what happened in the merits, namely, the admission of the plea and --
speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="709.602" stopTime="709.902">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="709.902" stopTime="711.401">

speaker="fred_h_sievert_jr" startTime="711.401" stopTime="773.540">
    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    If we must point to something, we point to that. 
    Now, if the Court please, on our change of venue when that was overruled and we went to trial, it took a number of days to select a jury. 
    This petitioner was required, if the Court please, to submit his life to a jury of 12 persons, three of whom had seen this entire TV film who have heard the defendant confess, who had seen the petitioner's face as this man confessed. 
    Now, if the Court please, if you're starting off with three people against you and I don't challenge the sincerity of those jurors who sat on the case, but we think, if the Court please, that it's not within our human understanding and everyday experience for a district judge to say to those three people, “Now, can you remove from your mind this 20-minute film that you saw this boy confessing.” 
    We don't think that that conforms with reasons, if the Court please.

    Mr. Fred H. Sievert, Jr.

    We have not been able to find any case. 
    So here, this petitioner was faced with three people who couldn't possibly wipe out of their minds his guilt before the first witness was called, without an attorney at the time of arraignment. 
    And at this time, it was critical because of the subsequent newspaper publicity and he was forced to take two other jurors who call themselves, who actually held Deputy Sheriffs Commissions although of a special nature.

    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    With reference to the question of appointment of counsel in this particular matter, I would like to direct the Court's attention to the fact that as of the time of the arraignment, prior to the appointment of able counsel, the defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the crime of murder which is the only crime for which he has been tried and convicted. 
    This crime of robbery, armed robbery which he had entered a plea of guilty to, in which plea the Court permitted to be withdrawn along with all other pleas has never been to trial Your Honor, only the charge of the murder.

speaker="frank_salter" startTime="1046.845" stopTime="1091.394">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Yes. 
    Now, on this question of appointment of counsel, as both counsel agree, the arraignment was set aside on -- as it is permitted to be done under Louisiana law. 
    And the defendant was arraigned again with the assistance of counsel. 
    We take the position that this case differs from Hamilton, David Hamilton versus Alabama. 
    And that under Alabama law, an arraignment cannot be set aside once a man has been arraigned, there are certain rights that are irretrievably lost. 
    That is not the situation under Louisiana law.

    Mr. Frank Salter 
    No sir, none whatsoever. 
    And then this particular -- that is the law of Louisiana and in this particular case, he was permitted to withdraw those pleas. 
    In other words, that arraignment was set aside as if that it never occurred. 
    Now, Your Honor, the question is on that particular point itself, are we to be permitted to correct if it is a mistake, a mistake as we did in this case at that time with reference to the arraignment and counsel are -- does the law deny us the right to correct it at the time we did and require us to go on through trial through all of the appellate procedures within our state and through the Supreme Court and then go back and correct it on that particular point. 
    They have had this defendant as able counsel.

    Mr. Frank Salter 
    With reference to their question as to the oral and written confessions, this crime was committed at approximately 7 p.m. 
    Within an hour or two, the defendant was arrested driving one of the victim's automobile down the highway with the suitcase full of the $14,091 that he'd gotten from the bank when he robbed it and kidnapped them at gunpoint and took them out and lined them up, started shooting at them. 
    The oral confession at which defense counsel alleged with certain statements made by this defendant on the ride back from highway Louisiana close to the point of capture to Lake Charles, some distance of ten miles. 
    Those oral confessions, Your Honor, the record will reflect were in the nature of spontaneous confessions. 
    They were not the result of an interrogation. 
    They were not a question and answer confession. 
    While riding back with the Sheriff and another deputy, he makes certain admissions of a spontaneous nature.

speaker="frank_salter" startTime="1236.645" stopTime="1312.878">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Sir, this was within two hours after the offense was committed. 
    Now, the television didn't take place until the next day. 
    He was captured in riding back, these oral confessions. 
    Upon the return to Lake Charles that night, he was taken into the Sheriff's office where he again and in more detail, orally confessed and that confession was reduced to writing and signed by him. 
    Now, the people present during that confession were myself, two FBI agents, the Sheriff, two or three deputies, the defendant, all in a rather large room. 
    That was a narrative type confession, Your Honor. 
    As matter of fact, the record reflects that one question was asked that defendant at the time this confession was taken. 
    He's been brought into the jail from the car after being transported in from the point of capture. 
    He sat down on a chair and he was given a cigarette and the record's going to reflect now the question that was asked, “Wilbert, do you want to tell us about it?” 
    That's the interrogation.

    Your Honor, he was not at that point advised of any right to counsel.

    His mother was sitting out in the waiting room with his brother. 
    As to whether there'd been any conversation between them, I do not know but she knew he was there.

    As I say Your Honor, this -- these two confessions, the oral on the road back from capture to the jail and the oral at the jail that resulted in being reduced to writing of a spontaneous nature in a narrative type confession not the result of interrogation. 
    And this -- this is further distinguished from the Spano case with regard to counsel in this respect. 
    In Spano versus New York, the defendant had already been indicted as the Court said the crime had already been solved. 
    The defendant had already been indicted. 
    He had been there with his lawyer and his lawyer said, “Don't talk.” 
    And then they interrogated him in shifts for eight hours. 
    In addition to that, he used a supposed friend on the Police Department lulled him into (Inaudible) Security. 
    Whereas here, there'd been no indictment, the confessions were in a nature of spontaneous narrative type confessions taken in the course of the search for the person who had committed the crime before any indictment.

    The State takes the position that this defendant could and did get a fair and impartial trial by a fair and impartial jury. 
    On the question of motion for change of venue, 29 witnesses appeared and testified.

    That's the -- oh, that's the maximum number required to obtain a jury. 
    This case is quite different from -- I believe it was Irving -- Irvin versus Dowd, the case set Your Honor well. 
    In that case, from the first place, the newspapers and other media printed the defendant's prior record. 
    Nothing like that was done here. 
    They had cartoons of electric chairs and things of that nature. 
    Editorial opinion and comment in that case whereas in the Rideau case, nothing but straight news reporting. 
    In that case, mob violence, the burning of homes, the Court having to enforce and put into effect strict rules of procedure in order to preserve the safety of the people in that community, nothing like that in this case.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Under your practice, how many peremptory challenges does each side get in a murder case?
speaker="frank_salter" startTime="2066.748" stopTime="2067.891">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    12.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2067.891" stopTime="2068.661">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Each side gets the same amount --

    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2068.935" stopTime="2069.507">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- of 12?
speaker="frank_salter" startTime="2069.507" stopTime="2073.735">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Each side gets same amount, 12 for the jury and then one for the alternative.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2073.735" stopTime="2077.628">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And each side exhausted its peremptories, did it?
speaker="frank_salter" startTime="2077.628" stopTime="2079.871">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2079.871" stopTime="2085.411">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And how many, how many causes this -- how many challenges for cause were allowed?
speaker="frank_salter" startTime="2085.411" stopTime="2099.048">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    I do not have the figure available, Your Honor, but there was something like a 120 to a 150 jurors, prospective jurors, examined on voir dire before obtaining the whole panel.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2099.048" stopTime="2102.343">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Before you got -- before you got a panel, including one alternative?

    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Yes sir, so -- say, with 30 -- well, let's I say a 150, although there had to be a good number of those who were challenged because on the basis of conscientious scruples against capital punishment --

    We don't have a --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    We don't have any record of the voir dire, do we?
speaker="frank_salter" startTime="2118.803" stopTime="2129.770">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    The only record of the voir dire is in connection with those particular challenges where the Court overruled the defendant's motion for challenge and they reserved the bill of exception.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2129.770" stopTime="2130.899">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Challenge for a cause?
speaker="frank_salter" startTime="2130.899" stopTime="2132.391">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2132.391" stopTime="2135.743">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That includes this two Deputy Sheriffs and the three people who saw the television.
speaker="frank_salter" startTime="2135.743" stopTime="2179.026">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Yes sir. 
    Your Honor, I would like to cover very quickly this two Deputy Sheriffs. 
    In many, many communities, if not all, some good citizen who want some form of identification, so maybe he'll get a little friendly treatment from the police officer driving down the highway will go into the Sheriff's office and say, “Sheriff, I'd like to have a commission. 
    And so if he is a person that the Sheriff feels is of good character and he can -- that sort of thing. 
    He will say, “Here is your commission, it's an honorary commission. 
    No pay, no duty, no nothing.” 
    Honorary.

    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Well, Your Honor, under our law anyone can carry arms --

    Concealed arms?

    Concealed?

    Yes, but can't -- can a Deputy Sheriff, Special Deputy Sheriff do that in your state?

    Well --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2224.657" stopTime="2239.254">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    He is a Deputy Sheriff because he likes to get some favors from the police. 
    Like he is speeding or something and gets a favor from them. 
    I suppose, if you testified against him, why those favors wouldn't be forthcoming, would they?
speaker="frank_salter" startTime="2239.254" stopTime="2247.328">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Well, Your Honor, I think there that we would have to assume something outside of the record and assume something very sinister outside of the record.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2247.328" stopTime="2256.783">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, maybe it's a little sinister to say he is entitled to some consideration for driving down the road against the law, might be some sinister in that too.
speaker="frank_salter" startTime="2256.783" stopTime="2281.525">
    Mr. Frank Salter 
    Well, that will be my error from straying from the facts of this case. 
    I'm sure that the record though in this case will reflect that these two men and it is on the record, were honorary deputies, no duties, no remuneration, no relationship of employer-employee and nothing whatsoever to show a prejudice on their part or part in allegation.

    I thought so.

    Mr. Frank Salter 
    In other words, I suppose if it came down to a question of an arrest, they would be placed on the position of a police officer as opposed to the citizen's arrest. 
    Yes, sir. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
