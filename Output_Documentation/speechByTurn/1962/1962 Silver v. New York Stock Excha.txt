Silver v. New York Stock Exchange
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="10.018">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- J. Silver versus New York Stock Exchange. 
    Mr. MacKinnon.
speaker="a_donald_mackinnon" startTime="10.018" stopTime="655.383">
    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court. 
    At the outset of my argument, I wish to state that the Stock Exchange does not take the position that it can act maliciously with predatory motives or in bad faith. 
    Such is not and never has been our contention. 
    We say that we must act in good faith and that we did so act and that is the standard by which we shall be judged. 
    At the outset, I would like to state what a stock exchange is, what it does, and what it is required to do. 
    The Stock Exchange is an unincorporated association in New York. 
    It has 1,375 members. 
    It is and always has been regulated by the membership, by the Stock Exchange with the enactment of the 1934 Act. 
    There was a decided strengthening of that regulation. 
    Now, the Exchange is required to police and discipline its members. 
    That duty is imposed upon it by Congress. 
    The Stock Exchange is jealous of the financial standing and repute of its members. 
    It is jealous of protecting that which it is required to protect the rep -- its take -- its reputation and standing for the protection of investors and to ensure equitable and just principles of trade which Congress has imposed upon it. 
    Now, it has a high degree of accountability and it endeavors and always has endeavored to maintain that degree of accountability. 
    Very obviously, no rules and regulations of the Exchange would be enforced or could be enforceable if 1,375 members were to go their various ways and say that they would do as they please. 
    Because of that fact, it is the Exchange that has the duty to see that its members enforce its rules and regulations. 
    And in doing so, obviously, there are restraints imposed upon the freedom of action of members. 
    Now, we furnish an auction market for 1,100 odd listings of securities. 
    When our members deal with one another as they are required to do when a member comes in and offers a security for sale and another member buys a security, they must deal with one another. 
    They must of necessity and we as an exchange must of necessity be interested in their financial responsibility and in their integrity, so that when and as our members, as they did in this particular case, have private wires, we were and has the duty of being interested in the person who had the wire connection with the member firm. 
    Now, I should like at this point to deal very briefly with the 1934 Act. 
    And in doing so, I would like to refer very briefly to a portion of Section 2, which is entitled necessity for regulation as provided in this title. 
    And to emphasize for Your Honors that what was designed was the regulation of securities transactions as commonly conducted on securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets stating that they were affected with a national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for the regulation and control of such transactions, and of practices. 
    And I underscore the words, “of practices”, and matters related thereto. 
    And further, and to impose requirements necessary to make such regulation and control reasonably, complete, and effective. 
    Now, that is what Congress said and then they provided for the registration of national securities exchanges. 
    And we are a registered national security exchange. 
    And under Section 6 of the cert -- 1934 Act, we were required by Congress to meet certain terms and conditions. 
    And to file a registration statement which provided that we would agree to comply and, and again I emphasize, to enforce so far as within its powers compliance by its members with the provisions of the 1934 Act and any amendment thereto, and any rule or regulation made or to be made thereunder. 
    We were then required to file data with respect to our organization, rules of procedure, membership, etcetera, and further, copies of our constitution, articles and incorporation, and all amendment, and of its existing bylaws or rules, or instruments corresponding thereto, whatever the name, which were collectively referred to as rules of the Exchange. 
    We also hand to agree to furnish the Commission with any amendments for changes in our rules, forthwith upon adoption. 
    Now, Section 6 (b) provides that no exchange shall be granted registration for that the registration shall remain enforced unless the rules of the Exchange include provision for the expulsion, suspension for disciplining of a member. 
    Now, obviously, no exchange could operate on the basis of one rule. 
    So the Act then provides that nothing in the title shall be construed to prevent any exchange from adopting and enforcing any rule not inconsistent with the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the applicable laws of the state in which the exchange is located. 
    Then we come to, what in my opinion, is an exceedingly important part of the Act dealing with registration and that is that it must appear because now we have the duty imposed upon the Commission. 
    It states, if it appears to the Commission that the exchange applying for registration is so organized as to be able to comply with the provisions of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of, and that the rules of the exchange are just and adequate to ensure fair dealing, and to protect investors, the Commission shall pose such exchange to be registered as a national securities exchange. 
    In other words, there is an affirmative duty cast upon the Commission to determine that the exchange is so setup, that it can enforce its rules, and that its rules are designed to protect investors.

    Outside of the fact that the National Labor Relations Board is composed of -- has official appointed by the Government. 
    What's the difference in the philosophy of what you have just read to us and the philosophy of that Act which imposes the duty to enact regulations and acts through Government agency?

    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    I -- in fact -- I don't put ourselves in the category of the Government agency. 
    I certainly say we have quasi-government duties and I would say that as far as we are concerned, I know of no other body that has the same duties of self-regulation as the exchanges.

    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    I think that we -- let's put it this way, we have a duty and that's the thing that I want to emphasize, duty. 
    And obviously, to perform that duty, we must have the power.

    Or you make a mistake?

    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    I'd say, Your Honor --

    What happens then?
speaker="a_donald_mackinnon" startTime="763.932" stopTime="812.767">
    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    I would say, Your Honor, that if we make a mistake that we have not fallen in violation of the Act as long as we have proceeded in good faith. 
    Because it is inconceivable to me that Congress would have said to the Exchange, as it has said in this Act that you are acting at your peril every time that you act, and in effect to be an insurer of your conduct. 
    I don't think that any organization could possibly undertake the responsibilities imposed upon them under those circumstances.

    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    I don't believe that a government official would be held liable at all unless he had acted with malice aforethought, and incomplete disregard of his responsibilities. 
    I don't think that he could be held liable for performing his duties as long as he performs them within the scope of his responsibilities and in good faith.

    Alright.
speaker="a_donald_mackinnon" startTime="929.651" stopTime="1039.617">
    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    -- I would like to proceed to the next point. 
    I would like to just point out to Your Honors, and I think it's exceedingly important at this point to refer to the rule under which the Exchange acted. 
    The Constitution provides that its Board of Governors must approve these words and we -- that Constitution was filed. 
    As Mr. Justice Harlan inquired yesterday the origin of these wires comes, as Mr. Justice Harlan stated, at the request of a member and after the member requested then and then only does the applicant filed his application and it is given a temporary approval pending an investigation. 
    But let me turn to the specific rules. 
    Rule 355, and I'm reading from the record and I'm only going to read briefly at page 196, “No member or member organization shall establish or maintain any wire connection, private radio, television or wireless system between his or its offices and the office of any nonmember, or permit any private radio or television system between his or its offices without prior consent of the Exchange.” 
    And 356, “The Exchange may require at any time the discontinuance of any means of communication whatsoever which has a terminus in the office a member or a member organization.” 
    Now, let me state --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1039.617" stopTime="1041.428">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What page is that last --
speaker="a_donald_mackinnon" startTime="1041.428" stopTime="1057.947">
    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    197, Your Honor, of the record. 
    Let me state that these specific rules were filed with the Exchange and these specific rules --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1057.947" stopTime="1059.234">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    With what?
speaker="a_donald_mackinnon" startTime="1059.234" stopTime="1076.599">
    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    -- with the Commission. 
    And these specific rules were approved as they were required to be approved under Section 6 (d) before we were accorded registration. 
    Further --

    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    I think it can be running but there is roughly as shown by this record, approximately 3,600 over-the-counter dealers that do not have private wires.

    That is utilized. 
    And also in that connection, Your Honor, let me state that they state that it was a very valuable asset in this case. 
    But the question of damages, despite the fact you wanted to bring it up at this time, was denied by a split court. 
    So we're only here on the question of injunctive relief. 
    Now, let's see what happened here.

speaker="a_donald_mackinnon" startTime="1576.353" stopTime="1788.293">
    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    Oh, no. 
    No, I'm not. 
    Now, I want to point out at this point, I've read to you our rule. 
    I told you that we were registered on September 28, 1934. 
    And in the annual report that was filed for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1935, the Commission stated in considering these applications, the applications for registration, the Constitution bylaws and rules and regulations of each exchange were examined and analyzed. 
    Now obviously when we state in our rules that were on file that we will have the right to approve member firm wires with nonmembers and to discontinue member firm wires with nonmembers that is a specific rule that was approved by the Commission under its responsibilities under Section 6 (d) before they registered. 
    Now, in addition to that, there is a provision that if we fail to enforce the rule, enforce the act and enforce the rules that we, under Section 19 (a) can have our registration suspended. 
    We can have it suspended for a period of 12 months or even withdrawn. 
    The law and the Bear case, Bear versus Franklin has said and it seems to me self-evident that the Exchange not only has the duty to enact rules and regulations but to enforce. 
    Now, that being the case, here, you are dealing with a rule or rules that were filed with the SEC that the SEC affirmatively found in approving registration that the rule was just and adequate to ensure fair dealing. 
    And you will recall that the Solicitor General and the same was true of the District Court petitioner, they did nothing that the Commission had scrutinized the rules with any care and that as far as these rules were concerned, it was more or less lip service. 
    But the Act, the order of approval and the annual report shows that they did in fact analy -- examine and analyze these rules as they were required to do before they accorded this registration.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1788.293" stopTime="1790.530">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Where is that at?
speaker="a_donald_mackinnon" startTime="1790.530" stopTime="2007.373">
    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    It's on page 95, a quote from it, page 95 of the record. 
    And I read the -- only a portion thereof. 
    Now, in addition to -- I have to speed here. 
    In addition to 19 (a), there is a 19 (b) provision, and the 19 (b) provision provides that the Commission can, if it is supposed to do so, tell us to change our rules. 
    And if we do not do so, that they can order a hearing and after the hearing promulgate a rule. 
    In addition thereto under Section 23 (a), the Commission can't issue rules of its own. 
    And these rules and regulations are subject to review by a person agreed under Section 25 of the Act. 
    Now, and I want to go a step further than this because it is my position that there can be no question but what anybody reading the Congressional and Senate reports that this -- the Dickinson report at the time of the organization, the SEC knows that the responsibilities were imposed upon the Exchange to enact and to enforce its rules. 
    There is no question in my mind that as far as the petitioners here are concerned, if they were disposed to do so that they could have brought immediately into the Commission and said, we are a person aggrieved, and as a person aggrieved, we tell you that we want action with respect to this rule, under which the private wire between members and ourselves were discontinued. 
    And they could do that and despite the fact that the Government, the Solicitor General failed to state so that is the position that he took in his brief at page 17 where he said, “Well, neither the Securities Exchange Act nor the Commission rules of practice, specifically authorized the filing of a complaint with the agency by a person adversely affected by a rule of an exchange, the Commission would ordinarily entertain such a complaint, if it made substantial allegations.” 
    And here, they chose another course. 
    They chose to saddle us or attempt to saddle us with a liability which would be treble to with, in this particular case, if and we are charged with the -- with the duty of enforcing a rule if we enforce them through mistake of judgment, not now saying good faith because I say, good faith is a standard that Your Honors must apply. 
    But we face, according to petitioners contention with a liability of $3 million and also potentially criminal liabilities as well. 
    I say that Congress at no time could possibly have ever conceived a remedy such as that.

    Are you saying by that, are we to imply by -- in what you've said that if there was a lack of, “good faith,” whatever that is. 
    That you could be sued for -- under the antitrust law in this case?
speaker="a_donald_mackinnon" startTime="2022.357" stopTime="2086.681">
    Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon 
    I would say definitely so, Your Honor, unless you find that we proceeded in good faith and good faith is a standard. 
    And good faith in my opinion means that we were attempting to perform the responsibilities cast upon us by statute in a fair, proper, and in my opinion, whether it'd be a mistake of judgment or not, certainly, there can be no liability but if we were motivated by malice, there could no immunity. 
    If we were motivated with a predatory objective, there could be no, no possible immunity and if we acted in bad faith. 
    But as long as we acted, misguided if it be but nevertheless acted in good faith, I say that we are entirely outside of the Sherman Act.

    It was our members who suffered the same for all practical purposes.

   Argument of David I. Shapiro
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="2947.754" stopTime="2991.294">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is really a very simple case, when unfortunately after listening to the arguments of both the Solicitor General and my opponent I think it's become very tangled indeed. 
    First of all, there are a couple of things I'd like to get straightened up right at the outset. 
    Under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, which is 15 U.S. Code Section 26, any private individual may obtain injunctive relief under the Sherman Antitrust Act. 
    That's been the law since 1914, as I understand it.

    Well --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2997.151" stopTime="2999.075">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I think you're right on that --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="2999.075" stopTime="3121.752">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    This Court so held in the Bedford-Stonecutters case and that was decided, I believe in 1926. 
    Now, the cause of action in this case is in one sense, a plain ordinary concerted refusal to deal on the part of the member firms of the New York Stock Exchange who were named as co-conspirators with the exchange in this case. 
    But it's more than that. 
    It's more than that. 
    It has also concerted action among competitors to exclude another competitor from a substantial market. 
    And we say, because this is really the reason that the Solicitor General is so concerned about in this case. 
    He's concerned because of the fact that he thinks that it may, if you apply the per se rule here, you may weaken the concept to self-regulation. 
    We don't have that problem here, let me tell you why. 
    We don't have the problem because it is just as much a violation of the Sherman Act per se for competitors to foreclose another competitor from any substantial market as it is for competitors to foreclose competition among themselves. 
    And in this case, the record is clear that the over-the-counter dealers who were the member firms of the New York Stock Exchange, with whom these petitioners have private wires, were competitors of these petitioners in the over-the-counter market in Dallas. 
    And what happened was, is that the combined action of the Exchange and its member firms in the Dallas area excluded these petitioners from the Dallas market, force them out of business.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3153.828" stopTime="3161.510">

speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="3161.510" stopTime="3315.536">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No. 
    I assert that it's a per se violation. 
    I believe that the Solicitor General does but I am sure that Mr. MacKinnon does not. 
    And he did not -- he certainly, vigorously opposed the application of the per se rule in the District Court. 
    And the District Court didn't agree with it. 
    Now, I think the real problem that's posed by this case was posed by Mr. Justice Goldberg's question to me yesterday. 
    And I'd like to deal with that if I may, because that's really not a problem. 
    It just looks like it's a problem. 
    We were talking yesterday about this fellow who was an ex-racketeer who -- the question was caught as to whether or not the Exchange had the power to order its member firms to discontinue its wires to that person. 
    Well, I think we've got to distinguish the case of the ex-racketeer from the case of the bucket shop because let's talk first about the bucket shop. 
    If we talk about the bucket shop and we have a situation in which the Exchange tells a member firm, stop dealing with the bucket shop and the member firm says, no. 
    What we're talking about at that point is member misconduct. 
    If we're talking about a situation where there are qualifications involved, the qualifications of this ex-racketeer to engage in the securities business, well he can't be qualified to engage in this business unless the Securities and Exchange Commission says that it's all right for him to engage in this business and that's gone from Section 15 of the broker-dealer registration provisions of the 1934 Act. 
    And they comment, “The criteria set forth in Section 15 are the only criteria that Congress has laid down for admission into the securities business.” 
    Now, if the Securities and Exchange Commission says, “Yes Mr. ex-racketeer, we think you have shown a sufficient rehabilitation, so that you should now engage in this business.” 
    Who is the New York Stock Exchange to say, “No, you cannot.” 
    And that is precisely the point I am making because --

    Well, there is I think a very substantial difference in this sense. 
    It is illegal under the Act to run -- it may be a violation of the Securities Exchange Act to operate a bucket shop in interstate commerce but the problem here is, is a completely different kind of situation. 
    In the one hand, you've got a problem involving the misconduct of a member. 
    And in the other, you have the Exchange superimposing upon the governmental agency charged with the responsibility in the area in the first instance. 
    Its standards of what the qualifications are for individuals to engage in this business. 
    And that does not involve member misconduct.

speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="3385.110" stopTime="3451.749">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I think not, Your Honor. 
    Because there of course, who would be predicated upon his own knowledge of the operation that he was involved in. 
    And if he was involved in that operation, certainly, we have a case of member misconduct. 
    And precisely, that's what the Solicitor General was talking about when he was talking about the SEC's power under Section 19 (a) 3 of the Act. 
    Because 19 (a) 3 is clearly a section which goes to member misconduct, the Commission may remove from an exchange any member who with knowledge of the violation affects a nonmember's transaction. 
    What are we talking about? 
    We're not talking about the regulation or the regulation of nonmembers in this sense. 
    We're talking about member misconduct. 
    As a matter of fact, the Solicitor General and I are talking about the same thing, except we're saying it differently. 
    But it's in the saying it differently that makes all the difference in this case and makes it an easy case or makes it a difficult case.

    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    -- but I say more than that. 
    I say because Congress was scrupulous in providing procedural due process for anyone who was subjected to broker-dealer registration revocation under the Act. 
    And they provided it when you are faced with the disciplinary proceeding by the NASD. 
    They provided it when you were faced with a disciplinary proceeding by the Securities and Exchange Commission, yet in this case where you have disciplinary proceedings against a nonmember on the basis of qualifications, there's no due process because the Exchange constitution and rules applies only procedural due process. 
    And I want to emphasize the word, only, only for members and absolutely none for nonmembers. 
    The Exchange made the representation at Congress.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3524.293" stopTime="3534.872">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We still have a minor question on the side to whether the Exchange does or doesn't have to have the same standards for its members in dealing with nonmembers of the NASD or the SEC.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="3534.872" stopTime="3681.769">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I appreciate that but let's take a look at the other side of the coin. 
    If the Exchange had the power that it says it has, and this Court gives it to him, it's got the power also to regulate the relations between members of the Exchange and members of other registered securities exchanges in connection with private wires relating to over-the-counter securities transactions or securities transactions on an exchange other than the New York Stock Exchange. 
    They can do that, too. 
    And I think it's quite clear that this other registered securities exchanges are in direct competition with the New York Stock Exchange. 
    And it seems to me inconceivable that Congress struck a balance here of permitting the New York Stock Exchange to regulate the conduct of its competitors. 
    And actually Congress did know such thing, because the balance that has been drawn by the Solicitor General is in our view an erroneous balance. 
    What he's talking about is a balance between protection of the investor and the rights of the individual broker-dealer. 
    That's not the balance to be drawn in this case. 
    The balance to be drawn is the rights involved in the antitrust laws competition and the rights of self-regulation of the Exchange's. 
    The Solicitor General can't draw that balance. 
    I can't draw it and this Court can't draw it. 
    Congress rule it and they drew it in Section 6 (b) of the 1934 Act, where they said and I quote, “No registration shall be granted or remain enforced unless the rules of the exchange include provision for the expulsion, suspension, or disciplining of a member for conduct or proceeding inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.” 
    Member and member misconduct is precisely the extent to which there can be any conceivable repugnancy between the Securities Exchange Act and the Sherman Antitrust Act.

    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I believe they might say that they couldn't extend wire connections to another member where that wire was used exclusively for carrying on transactions in securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange but you even have problems in that area, substantial problems. 
    Because as I understand it, you must have reason of -- the question then would turn on an AP application, whether or not there is -- anybody can enter and become a member of the New York Stock Exchange. 
    And you have a very serious Associated Press problem in that kind of context.

    Are you saying that this rule that they had didn't show on its face that they would attempt to regulate their members in that dealing with nonmembers?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="3828.966" stopTime="3842.036">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No. 
    What they would attempt to regulate their members, yes. 
    But they wouldn't apply it in such a way as to pass on the qualifications of nonmember dealings with members. 
    That I think --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3842.036" stopTime="3850.198">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But they couldn't do that without regard to how bad the man more -- as I'm assuming or that might be --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="3850.198" stopTime="3851.448">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    That's correct.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3851.448" stopTime="3865.917">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- engaged in a lawless business or a company might be dedicated to violating the law that the Exchange could not pass a regulation which barred its members from dealing with them.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="3865.917" stopTime="3925.981">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Well, I would think that that would be correct unless we had what was involved under 6 (b), member misconduct. 
    Now, for example, let me put it this way, if in fact there were relationships between an illegal operation at a member firm and the member firm was aware of it, this of course is member misconduct. 
    What the Exchange is seeking is an installation of its members but that installation is provided in the first instance under the scheme of this statute by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    Any other way, any other construction of these statutes, and it's really a very comprehensive one, would throw the complete scheme of regulation in my view, out of kilter. 
    I want to say one other thing with regard to the question of remedy. 
    I see my time is up.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3925.981" stopTime="3946.780">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Voice Overlap) to despite your statement is simple, now the first thing (Inaudible) and I presently believe, do I understand you then to say that while they can regulate their member's misconduct, they cannot bar their members from dealing with somebody else on account of -- to a nonmember on account of their misconduct?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="3946.780" stopTime="3952.330">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    That is correct as long as it doesn't involve member misconduct itself. 
    If it --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3952.330" stopTime="3958.833">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You say they can't make member misconduct define it as being dealing with nonmembers --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="3958.833" stopTime="3959.927">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Who have a bad reputation?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3959.927" stopTime="3961.895">

    If it's an act that's involved as distinguished from reputation, you've got a completely different problem.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3969.923" stopTime="3974.008">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I don't think the Commission could approve such a rule. 
    But they couldn't envision that it would have such an application.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3981.117" stopTime="4003.312">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, this is considerably broader than I understood you awhile ago. 
    Let's assume that the -- let's assume that someone -- that some former dealer had his license revoked and broker-dealer had his license revoked but he goes on dealing. 
    Now, can -- can we say then I suppose that the Exchange cannot be this cumbersome.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="4003.312" stopTime="4006.747">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, I would say that in that case the Exchange can.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4006.747" stopTime="4009.132">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because this member is supposed to know?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="4009.132" stopTime="4012.244">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, because the mem -- once the member had been put on notice --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4012.244" stopTime="4016.021">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know but you'll notice he just goes on.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="4016.021" stopTime="4040.401">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Well, if the -- I think that if the member does not know then it does not involve member misconduct. 
    But if a member does know and he continues to do so after he's been given notice, you have a question perhaps of member misconduct. 
    What I'm saying is I'm trying to restrict it to this particular kind of situation where we have a question of reputation.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4040.401" stopTime="4060.886">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So let's assume that -- you would say then that the broker-dealer who has had suspension put on him three times in a row within a year for a temporary period that even then the Stock Exchange did not keep its member from dealing with that person?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="4060.886" stopTime="4081.843">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    What it could do would -- as long it could keep -- put the member unnoticed and if that member acted in such a way as not to violate any rules of the Exchange or ethical business conduct in his relation with that nonmember, the Exchange has no power to cut off the wire in that instance.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4081.843" stopTime="4097.167">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you're then saying that the Exchange hasn't got power to order him to quit -- to cut off the wire? 
    Hasn't that the -- hasn't that the Exchange -- the Exchange hasn't got the power to waive his fellow than cease doing business with this --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="4097.167" stopTime="4100.220">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    With a nonmember who has a bad reputation. 
    That is correct.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Just call it a bad man?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="4101.858" stopTime="4107.376">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    That's right. 
    That's my position. 
    I wanted to make one more statement. 
    I realize my time is over --
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="4107.376" stopTime="4125.506">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Mr. Shapiro, suppose the Exchange has a specific rule (Inaudible)
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="4125.506" stopTime="4198.692">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    My answer would be the same because that's precisely the criteria that's covered under Section 15 of the broker-dealer registration provisions of the 1934 Act, and in such a case, it may be. 
    Let's take for example, the man was adjudged, had a conviction for a felony 20 years before. 
    The SEC's provision, the provision set forth in the statute is conviction of 10 years or less. 
    If the Stock Exchange wanted to impose a requirement of 20 years, high aid as between the conviction and the entering into the business, my answer would be precisely the same. 
    Now, the point I did want to make is this, and that's with regards to this question of remedy and I can make this very clear. 
    The SEC's general counsel in response to a question put to him by Judge Hays in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit expressly told that court that these petitioners had no remedy before the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    That's my argument.
