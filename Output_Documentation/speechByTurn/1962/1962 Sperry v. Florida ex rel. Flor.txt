    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    In this case, petitioner who is a nonlawyer has been duly authorized by the Commissioner of Patents pursuant to federal statutes and rules to advise and represent applicants before the Patent Office in the preparation and prosecution of patent applications. 
    The petitioner resides in Florida and there carries on these activities. 
    The question presented here is whether the State of Florida has the power to enjoin petitioner from these activities merely because he is not a member of the Florida Bar, and the Court has forbidden such activities, and we feel that the Court was incorrect in the following specific portions of the injunction, wherein the -- enjoined the petitioner from rendering opinions as to patentability of inventions, from holding himself out in Florida as qualified to prepare and prosecute applications for letters patents, and amendments thereto, and from actually preparing in prosecution applications -- prosecuting applications for letters patents, and amendments thereto in Florida.

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    He can theoretically call himself a patent attorney because he was admitted to practice before the Patent Office prior to 1938 at which time even though he was a nonlawyer, he was entitled to call himself a patent attorney. 
    In 1938, the rules were changed so that nonlawyers thereafter registered with the Patent Office couldn't but there is a Grandfather clause which permitted those admitted before to still continue calling the same thing.

    He can describe himself as a patent agent or as -- as a patent attorney. 
    In this case, actually he has ceased to use the name patent attorney, although under the federal rules, he is permitted to do so. 
    This perhaps might be one of the engraftments on federal rules which might be permissible so that there wouldn't be any mistake as to what capacity he's operating under.

    Well, there is an answer -- our question would have to be answered yes in the sense that the patent application as it has been held by this Court is really a contract between the inventor and the Government.

speaker="carlisle_m_moore" startTime="1050.971" stopTime="1079.150">
    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Precisely, I think that the patent agent can advise and assist inventors in the preparation and prosecution of applications before the Patent Office. 
    And this, I believe includes by necessity, the right to advise a client as to whether a patent application should be filed, that is whether it's patentable.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1079.150" stopTime="1088.341">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And you say of course, that if he can do that as an agent, he can do it in the District of Columbia or he can do it in any state.
speaker="carlisle_m_moore" startTime="1088.341" stopTime="1129.294">
    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Yes, Your Honor because 'patent attorneys' and agents reside all over the country as to inventors. 
    It's necessary for them -- for the practitioner to meet with the inventor to discuss the technical problems involved in any invention. 
    Now the Congress has, I'm sure recognized the fact that there are patent agents and practitioners all throughout the country. 
    The Patent Office, I believe, certainly realizes -- publishes a list of practitioners by state.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, most of the agents is here in Washington provide for practice and their agencies of people who are not attorneys.

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    I'm not sure I understand your question.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1146.909" stopTime="1172.402">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, there are other agencies in the City of Washington besides the Patent Office and many of them, people who are there all the time and file applications of various kinds and types. 
    Lawyers do it sometimes and other people do it sometimes. 
    Are there any regulations with reference to the other agencies that you know of in this connection besides the Patent Office?

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I'm not that familiar with the -- that branch, however, it is my understanding that the Treasury Department can qualify or register qualified attorneys and laymen to represent people before the Customs Court.

    Yes, and from the amicus brief, I understand that about a third of the Interstate Commerce Commission practitioners are not attorneys.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1224.648" stopTime="1232.212">

    How about the CPAs in the Treasury and Tax Courts?
speaker="carlisle_m_moore" startTime="1232.212" stopTime="1251.120">
    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Well there again, the Treasury before the Tax Court has provisions wherein it can set the standards of who appears before the agency and it permits attorneys are qualified nonattorneys to represent people before that agency.

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Well, yes, and actually you would have really somewhat the same problem here that that's a matter of policing of activities which are carried on by professions which sometime overstep their rights and privileges and get into the unauthorized practice of law. 
    That of course, is improper.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, it maybe that Florida has no right to do what it's done but it surely has the right to say what is the -- what is practice of law and within the meaning of the Florida statutes?

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Well, I think it might have that power but I don't think that it can then go and say that even though they consider this to be the unauthorized practice of law, I don't think that they have the right, the power to say that a person cannot do that in Florida when he has a federally right to do it.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1384.532" stopTime="1400.815">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, that's what I thought the real question in this case was whether the federal statute in effect preempts Florida's right to say that you can't do this without becoming a member of the Bar under Florida law.
speaker="carlisle_m_moore" startTime="1400.815" stopTime="1417.275">
    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Well, that is correct. 
    And the patent statutes and rules do provide that. 
    The patent statutes provide -- give the Commissioner of Patents the sole power to determine who is to be admitted to practice before the Patent Office.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1417.275" stopTime="1428.575">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    We'll put it in another way.

    Well, is that where the point (Voice Overlap) is -- that doesn't end the case as far as you're concerned obviously but that's the point of departure that we have to move on from, isn't it?
speaker="carlisle_m_moore" startTime="1444.866" stopTime="1453.628">
    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    No, I don't think that you are bound by their determination that this is the unauthorized practice of law and therefore must be stopped.

    I don't quite understand that either. 
    What I understand is, as you claim that the Federal Government with power to do so as prescribed how patent applications shall be filed carried to the Patent Office and that the appointed agents who have power to do that, do you say that Florida has come along and said that -- the doing of that thing violates Florida law and you say that it's barred by the Superior -- the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Yes. 
    That there is a case cited in the -- in the reply brief also relied upon by respondent wherein they say that the State of Florida's determination on this matter should be accepted as final and binding on this Court.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1505.963" stopTime="1516.625">

    Well, I think it's completely at odds with the federal legislation on the subject. 
    If all states were to do this and as indicated by one of these amicus briefs, their Bar Associations of about 20 different states taking the respondent's position. 
    Obviously, they are all going to -- to do the same thing if the Florida decision is upheld and the position of patent agents sanctioned by Congress would be eliminated.

    Now, there are certain facts which the petitioners did not mention of which I think are material to the case. 
    The Solicitor General states in his brief that the petitioner here had practiced in Florida for many years. 
    This is incorrect. 
    The petitioner moved to Florida in 1958. 
    And there he proceeded to rent an office on the First National Bank building of Tampa and to advertise himself on the office door as a Patent Attorney. 
    And in answer to your question, Mr. Justice Stewart, the petitioner admitted in his brief in the Supreme Court of Florida which I have here, that the term ‘patent attorney', quote, “implies that he is a member of the Florida Bar.” 
    Then he proceeded to advertise himself in August, 1960 in the classified directory of the telephone book as a patent attorney. 
    And properly thereafter, in February 1961, the Unauthorized Practice Committee of the Florida Bar got after him and sued him, sued to enjoin the unlawful practice of law by the petitioner. 
    Now here's what the petitioner did in Florida. 
    First, he rendered legal opinions as to infringement and as to patentability. 
    Secondly, he prepared patent applications. 
    Third, he prepared legal documents, specifically license agreements, and he was admitted in the court below, and I'm quoting now from page 2 of the record, that the petitioner quote, “holds himself out to the public as authorized to engage in the practice of law in the patent field.” 
    In short, this is a holding out case. 
    Now, in the decision below, as it has already been indicated, the court below held that each of the acts in question committed by the petitioner, constituted the practice of law. 
    And the Court also held that the practice of law or rather the practice of patent law was the practice of law because the petitioner argued in the court below that the practice of patent law was not the practice of law. 
    Now it has also been indicated but not quite specifically enough, the petitioner here does not contest the entire decree below. 
    He does not assert a right to continue to use the term ‘patent attorney' or to continue to hold himself out as a lawyer. 
    Now, he does not assert the right to continue to repair legal documents and notably license agreements, and he does not assert the right to otherwise engage in the practice of law, and notably trademark practice which is also covered by the record. 
    And here, we come close to the point of the case perhaps of the issue. 
    As I read his reply brief at page 2, he does not assert a right to give legal opinions as to infringement and patentability if unconnected with the preparation of patent opinions, but he does assert a right to give legal opinions as to infringement and patentability if connected with the preparation of patent opinions -- patent applications, I beg your pardon.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In short, is it correct to say that the issues now are narrowed so that all the petitioner is claiming is what the -- what the rules of the Patent Office gives him, by which do not include the right to hold yourself out as a lawyer in the general practice of law.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So now that -- it's boiled down to all -- he is claiming against infringement by Florida of the rights, you say, which the Patent Office gives him, isn't that right?

    Mr. F. Trowbridge Vom Baur 
    Yes, sir, and here we're coming so closer to the -- to the fine point of case because the petitioner contends in this Court, his brief as replete with statement to this effect that what the court below did was to enjoin him “from practice before the Patent Office”. 
    Now, I submit to this Court, that is not a fair commentary on the decision below that the court below did not enjoin the petitioner from practice before the Patent Office, and I will state my reasons why it did not. 
    In the first place, there is no language in the opinion below which is susceptible of any such interpretation. 
    Secondly, the only acts which took place, which were enjoined by the court below took place in Florida and it is noteworthy that --

    Mr. F. Trowbridge Vom Baur 
    Well, they say something about all correspondence should be carried on by mail, but the point I would like to make in answer to your question is, that the Patent Office rules which is a fairly voluminous document here provide specifically for a number of personal appearances in the Patent Office, such as interviews with examiners under Patent Rule 133, an oral hearing or oral argument before the Board of Patent Appeals.

    Well sir, I would like now if I may to return to my point that practice before the Patent Office was not enjoined by the court below. 
    It has pointed out the court below expressly disavowed any intention to interfere with the practice -- the practice before the Patent Office. 
    And fourth, in support of --

    You said when done outside the State of Florida, that's the language you've used.
speaker="f_trowbridge_vom_baur" startTime="2972.387" stopTime="3241.599">
    Mr. F. Trowbridge Vom Baur 
    Yes, sir, that is true. 
    And in the context of facts in this case, I think it is impossible to practice before the Patent Office in Florida-D.C. and I would like to give you one big reason in my opinion why. 
    Practice before the Patent Office according to the cases as I understand it means practice in the presence of the practice office, the Patent Office. 
    I have cited some five cases in my brief, pages 54 and 55, to the effect that practice before a government official or tribunal means in the presence of the particular government official or tribunal. 
    Those five cases in turn I may say, cites some other cases and they are not disputed by -- by adversary here. 
    And further, if I may proceed to the mechanics of practice before the Patent Office which I think there are some significance on this question, we find that, I submit, the practice before the Patent Office cannot begin until, number one, a proceeding is started before the Patent Office, and number two, there is an applicant there who can be represented. 
    Now, the mere preparation of a patent application does not start a proceeding in the Patent Office. 
    Secondly, if it's mailed at the Patent Office and physically received by the Patent Office, it is not automatically filed there. 
    There is a rule of the Patent Office which says, they will be carefully inspected, and if the particular application does not meet the specific requirements of the rules, the application will not be accepted, and will be sent back to the applicant. 
    And I may that if the statute of limitation runs in the meantime of course, the inventor is in trouble. 
    Now finally, there is no applicant before the Patent Office to be represented by anybody until after an application has been physically received and legally accepted and filed by the Patent Office. 
    And now I come to my first point, which is if the States have the right to control and regulate the practice of law. 
    This I think has been settled in this Court by Bradwell versus Illinois and in Theard versus United States in 354 U.S. 
    This Court stated that a states control over its judicial system was “autonomous” and the reason for this appears to be as stated in Theard versus United States that the Court's control over a lawyer's professional life derived from his relationship to the responsibilities of the Court, now I come to my second sub-point under this, which is the fact that the practice of law in a particular State involves federal subject matter in no way diminishes the power of the State to regulate it and here we come, if the Court please, to perhaps the only unauthorized practice of law case that has ever actually reach this Court and then cited by it with approval and that case is Kovrak versus Ginsburg in 358 U.S. 
    Now in that case, Kovrak was admitted to practice before this Court, the District of Columbia Courts and most significantly, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a tribunal which sets in Philadelphia. 
    Now, he was not a member of the Pennsylvania Bar, but like the petitioner here very much, he nevertheless set up an office in Philadelphia and preceded as such -- advertised himself as “attorney at law, proctor in federal taxation”. 
    And at this point, the Unauthorized Practice Committee of the Philadelphia Bar Association proceeded to sue to enjoin him from unlawfully practicing law in Pennsylvania. 
    An interestingly enough in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, Kovrak's position according to the Court's statement was and I'm quoting now, “That he has a legal right to practice law anywhere in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania with regard to any legal matter in which a federal question was involved, no matter how remote.” 
    This is on page 26 and 28 of respondent's brief. 
    And I may say this is very close to the petitioner's contention in this case, “That he has a right to practice law anywhere in Florida with regard to any legal matter in which a patent question is involved perhaps”.

    Mr. F. Trowbridge Vom Baur 
    Yes, bear in mind Mr. Justice Goldberg, that is entirely right sir, but here, this man, held -- opened an office in Philadelphia, the very place where this tribunal six in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania through which he was admitted, and he held himself out as an attorney at law, proctor in federal taxation. 
    And he contended he had a right to practice law anywhere in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania where a federal question was involved. 
    And the Court rejected his contention and said and I -- this is very significant if you will bear with me, I'd like to read it just one sentence. 
    No case has been suggested to us which holds that membership in the Bar of the United States Supreme Court entitles an attorney to practice anywhere in the United States without reference to local state requirements. 
    And that we substitute membership in the Bar of the United States Patent Office. 
    We have, I think the basic problem in this case. 
    Now in addition, in Kovrak versus Ginsburg, the Court, Supreme Court of Pennsylvania also pointed out that this did not interfere with his right to try cases in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 
    Just as the court below pointed out that the -- that the decree below does not prevent him from practicing before the Patent Office in Washington D.C. 
    And finally, with respect to this case, if I may mention, it was cited with approval by this Court in Martin versus Walton in 368 U.S. 25.

    Mr. F. Trowbridge Vom Baur 
    Not so much a part of -- the matter of housing, it's a matter of holding himself out. 
    He can house himself physically anywhere but if he holds himself out to practice law, that is bad. 
    Well, I may say in this connection, there are two leading cases, I have so little time that I'm just struggling to get this out which upheld that admission to practice before a federal administrative agency does not entitle the person involved to practice law in a particular State. 
    Now one of them is a leading case in the patent field, Chicago Bar versus Kellogg upon which the court below extensively relied. 
    And again, the petitioner in that case contended there as he does here, that his recognition before the Patent Office entitled him to practice patent law in Illinois. 
    And the Supreme Court of Illinois said, “No, you can practice before the Patent Office to beat the bond but you cannot practice patent law in Illinois.” 
    Now if I may continue, I only have four minutes left that I want to get to this matter of the construction of the statute, if the Court please, because this is rather important. 
    The petitioner is given the impression that there is some kind of federal preemption here. 
    In my opinion, this is not so. 
    The keyword in this statute is the word recognition. 
    And I submit to Your Honors that the word recognition does not deal with the subject or purport to grant anything of a nature of a federal license, rather it is a much more passive lukewarm tepid kind of word which deals only, as I read Webster's Dictionary with the subject of acceptance in the sense of being entitled to attention. 
    This is a far cry from an affirmative grant of a license or the language in the Federal Power Act for instance which specifically says that so on as the Commission has power to issue licenses for the construction of dams, etcetera. 
    Now finally and this would be the last point I was trying to get out because I do not have any more time. 
    This particular statute in dealing with the recognition, I submit, was not passed to implement Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution, rather it was merely a legislative recognition of a practice which had long existed in many of the government departments as part of their inherent power as a government department under Article 2 of the Constitution. 
    Now, the first place under that, during the Civil War and shortly thereafter, the Pension Office dealt with the subject of admission of attorneys to practice and their continued regu -- recognition under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    Then the Attorney General in 1880 ruled that the authority to disbar an attorney practicing before the Department of the Interior was an authority not given by statute but which seems to have been exercised heretofore by heads of departments in the protection of the Government. 
    That is independent of statute and that is this statute here because it is a companion statute, the two statutes which were passed at 1884, each virtually identical with this one, one dealing with Interior and one dealing with Treasury. 
    And finally, in Philips versus Ballinger, a case which is cited by approval by this Court in Goldsmith versus Board of Tax Appeals, the court there upheld the disbarment of a lawyer by the Secretary of Interior under the 1884 Act, which as I say is virtually identical with this one on the theory and I'm quoting the case now, “It is unnecessary to consider whether the 1884 Act constitutes anything more than a legislative sanction of the practice heretofore existing under another statute by a -- through all revised statute 161 nullified United States Code 22. 
    And that statute, I may say, gives the head of each department the power to promulgate rules governing the conduct of this department and this Court held in United States versus George in 228 United States that the power given by that statute was administrative only and not legislative. 
    In short, my point here is, if the Court please, that this particular statute was not passed to implement Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, but rather was a mere legislative recognition of a practice theretofore existing for many years as part of the inherent power of a government department under Article 2 of the Constitution. 
    Now there's another feature the red light hasn't flashed yet but there is another feature here which I wish to -- which is of some importance. 
    And that is to take the administrative interpretation. 
    In 1938, the rules of the Patent Office were revised so as to provide categorically, and I have this in full page type on page 56 of our brief, that the registration on the Patent Office “shall not be construed as authorizing persons not members of the Bar to practice law.” 
    And that in 1949, the rules were given -- addressed the provision and that provision was restated in a new rule to effect that registration in the Patent Office shall only entitle the persons registered to practice before the Patent Office; in short, not somewhere else. 
    Now, I have --

speaker="f_trowbridge_vom_baur" startTime="3708.863" stopTime="3880.166">
    Mr. F. Trowbridge Vom Baur 
    Yes, sir. 
    If you will look on page 56 of respondent's brief, you will see the 1938 rule which provides in categorical terms the registration before the Patent Office shall not be construed as authorizing persons not members of the Bar to practice law. 
    Now there is a separate -- an additional rule which is mentioned I think in Appendix A which has said the same thing for trademark practices. 
    Then as I've pointed out, the 1938 rules when they were given a general revision in 1949, preceded the State, I submit the same thing by providing that registration in the Patent Office shall only entitle people to practice before the Patent Office. 
    Now there's one other point I should like to try to get up before the red light flashes, and that is that the patent power is a very limited power. 
    This Court has held in Patterson versus Kentucky and two other cases that except for interference with an -- and fetters exclusive right to a patented invention, the Patent Clause and the patent statute passed by Congress are subject to the State's police power and there is at least one unauthorized practice case which is referred to at some length in Patterson versus Kentucky, one of the leading cases in this Court on federal state relations in the -- rather in the patent field where the -- where Jordan, this is Jordan versus Overseers of Dayton in our brief at pages 71 to 73 claimed that he had a federal right to administer a patented product without getting a license to practice medicine in Ohio. 
    And the Supreme Court of Ohio and also this Court said that he have to get a license to practice medicine in Ohio before he could administer the particular invention. 
    Of that, the case at least came close to interfering with an inventor's exclusive right to an invention. 
    Well, our case does not. 
    Our case bears no relationship whatever to the protection of an inventor's exclusive right to an invention. 
    Finally, this case, if the Court please, involves the future of the Bar and my last point is that a strong Bar is itself essential to the public welfare, and in this connection, I think it is effect of no small significance that one of the first acts of dictators such as Hitler, Mussolini and Castro is to decimate the Bar and with the decimation of the Bar there disappears also that leadership and public affairs, if I may say so, and the protection of the public which a strong Bar affords. 
    And with -- if the practice of law is going to be whittled away, chip by chip and turned over to laymen, lay agencies then the public will no longer have the protection which a strong Bar affords and the public will suffer.
