    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Washington reviewing a judgment which in effect denied the petitioners, Mr. Draper and Mr. Lorentzen, a right of appeal because they lack the funds to purchase a transcript at the trial of proceeding. 
    Petitioners are presently incarcerated in the penitentiary at Walla Walla, Washington under maximum sentences which totaled 40 years. 
    They are admittedly without funds. 
    The issue in this case as petitioners see it is whether consistent with equal protection of law and due process of law, the State of Washington may deny the right to appeal to indigents but not to others. 
    Whenever the trial court finds that the asserted grounds of appeal are frivolous involved in a determination of this case or the rules of the Supreme Court of Washington -- the counsel, the preceding counsel taken part of my record away here --

    Yes.
speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="111.138" stopTime="388.830">
    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    I assume there was no complicity on part of the State on what happened. 
    The general principles which apply to this case are, I think quite clear, they'd been laid down in two cases to this Court. 
    First of all, Griffin against Illinois, decided in 1956, wherein the Court said or at least the opinion of the majority of the judges -- thank you -- that destitute defendants must be afforded as adequate and appellate review as defendants who have money enough to buy transcripts. 
    And secondly, the principle laid down in a subsequent case out of the same state, State of Washington. 
    The fact that the conclusion of the trial judge that there was no reversible error cannot be a substitute for the right to full appellate review, and I emphasize that, full appellate review, available to all defendants who can afford the expense of transcript. 
    In the Eskridge case, the trial judge upon being requested by the indigent defendant who was convicted I think in that case of a murder had given life sentence in prison, the trial judge upon passing on the request of that particular defendant for free transcript ruled that there was no substantial ground for the appeal and that justice would not be promoted by granting transcript, hence, it was not granted. 
    This Court when the case finally got back up here many years later held that that determination by the trial court was not an adequate substitute for the full appellate review that a defendant with funds could obtain under the rules of the State of Washington and that in effect and I might add, now in effect. 
    Let's take a look at the facts of this particular case, involving Mr. Draper and Mr. Lorentzen as applied to the principles laid down in the Griffin case and in the Eskridge case. 
    The State of Washington still, as I mentioned gives a full right of review to those who can pay for it. 
    If you have the necessary funds to purchase a transcript, you may do so, and all that you have to do then is to have that transcript certified by the trial judge, file a brief with the Supreme Court of the State of Washington and you are given a full scale review. 
    You do not have, at any stage, to convince the trial judge of the merits of your appeal. 
    Indeed under our procedure in the State of Washington, the trial judge never gets an opportunity in the criminal case to state what he thinks of the merits of the appeal, a matter never comes before him and there's no procedure by which he can indicate his opinion to the Supreme Court. 
    Now in this particular case, the defendants having been convicted on two counts of robbery after a jury trial appeal. 
    At the trial being without funds, they've been represented by Court appointed counsel, the same Court appointed counsel represented them upon the -- their request for a free transcript in order that they might appeal. 
    Now, in considering the procedures followed in this case, the Court should have in mind the rules laid down by the State of Washington following the Eskridge case wherein the -- this Court held that the procedures previously followed by the State of Washington did not meet the constitutional test of due process. 
    Following the Eskridge case, our Court laid down rules which I have set forth in full on our brief at pages 3 and 4. 
    In order to get the facts of this particular case straight, I would like to read these rules and then refer to the record to show wherein and how they were complied with in this case. 
    The Supreme Court of Washington says that an indigent defendant desiring to appeal shall file an affidavit in which he set forth the fact of his indigency, among other things that an affidavit is in the record at pages 10 and 11.

    Would you mind indicating (Inaudible) in arguing which of these elements do you think that should mean (Inaudible)
speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="398.186" stopTime="565.122">
    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    Yes, I will do that, sir. 
    The rule next requires that the indigent seeking a free transcript shall specify and I quote the rule, these are quoted on page 3 of the petitioner's brief, “Shall specify the errors which he claims were committed.” 
    And if it is claimed that the evidence is insufficient to justify the verdict, this will specify what particularity in what respect he believes the evidence is lacking. 
    Now at the record, in the record on pages 10 and 11, the petitioners have set forth some 12 or 13 errors which they alleged were committed. 
    I won't refer to all of them, but the ones which seemed to me to be the principal ones, they alleged that evidence was admitted, that is testimony was admitted over objection improperly. 
    They alleged that exhibits were improperly admitted over objection, they alleged the trial judge with prejudice against them, and they alleged in effect that the evidence did not sustain the verdict. 
    I might say that the list of claimed errors appears to have been drawn in the penitentiary at Walla Walla. 
    I don't think a lawyer drew that list, but nevertheless, the list does cover the four points which I mentioned and some others which are slightly redundant, so that the petitioners in this case complied with the rules of the State of Washington insofar as they were able to do so, not having a transcript, well of course. 
    The rules go on to say that if the State is at the opinion that the errors alleged can properly be presented on appeal without a transcript of all the testimony, it may make a showing of what portion of the transcript will suffice, or if it believes that a narrative statement will be adequate, it shall so state and shall inform the Court that the narrative statement will be available to the indigent defendant who wants to appeal. 
    Now in this instance, the State did neither of these things, rather, as it appears on page 21 of the record, beginning actually on page 19, it recited in a lengthy affidavit filed by the Deputy Prosecutor who tried the case that the evidence was overwhelming of the guilt of these petitioners now before the Court, but he did not alleged that they could obtain an appellate review with something less than the full transcript or with a narrative statement. 
    It is simply that the prosecutor just didn't touch on it (Voice Overlap)

    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    Oh, that's correct. 
    Yes, yes. 
    That's the -- that I think is the vice of the rules. 
    The State had a few comments in its affidavit answering and resisting the request for a free transcript on the alleged grounds of appeal but those comments were very general. 
    For instance on page 21 of the record, the prosecutor swears in his affidavit in response to the argument that the trial judge was prejudiced, he says that he -- the prosecutor denies that there was any perjury committed or that the trial judge was in anywise prejudiced against any of these defendants. 
    Well, that's simply a general denial. 
    Similarly with regard to the petitioners' allegation that errors had been committed in admitting testimony and exhibits, that all the prosecutor did, as appears on page 22 of the record, was to enter a general denial to that. 
    He says, in his affidavit, that no exhibit or testimony was improperly admitted in evidence but he does not go into the particular questions that had been objected to nor the particular exhibits that had been admitted over objection. 
    And nowhere, nowhere in the record that is before this Court, or that was before the Supreme Court of Washington is there a transcript of the questions that were asked objected to and testimony that was admitted over objection similarly with regard to exist.

    That's correct. 
    He couldn't have -- he couldn't in that case have done much more. 
    On the other hand, I don't know how you would demonstrate prejudice of a trial judge without a full transcript.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="759.748" stopTime="767.549">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    In other words, do you say that the relevance is a one way to (Inaudible) the generality of the charge that a denial was (Inaudible)
speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="767.549" stopTime="968.805">
    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    That is correct. 
    The same thing would be true if the contention of the evidence failed to sustain the verdict. 
    The rules of Washington go on to say, as to what the trial court does in this proceeding where the indigent is seeking a free transcript, that the trial court in disposing of an indigent motion were statement of facts that county expense shall enter findings of fact upon the following the matters: (a) the defendants indigency where there's no issue on that and it's admitted on all sides and the Court so stated that he would have been, defendants are indigent, (b) the trial court shall enter findings of fact on which of the errors, if any are frivolous and the reasons why they are frivolous. 
    Now what did the trial court do about that? 
    On page 27 of the record we have findings at the trial court on which of the errors are frivolous. 
    And again, all that the trial court did was to enter what amounts to general denial or general statements that the allegations of error have any merit. 
    For example, with regard to the contention that evidence was improperly admitted, the trial judge says on page 27 -- or finds on page 27 of the record, near the bottom of Page F as to assignment of error number 7, the Court finds that the evidence offered by the State against these defendants -- well, that is not the -- that has to do with the sufficiency of the evidence. 
    The finding with reference to the admission of exhibits, is B on page 27 as to assignments of error, 2 and 8, relating to identification on the list of exhibits, each exhibit would properly identify at the trial the material and relevant to the issues, and that the objection of Exhibit 2, the gun identified by the accomplice Robert Jennings, as one used in the holdup as well as the objections to the remaining exhibits offered go to the weight the jury should place upon the exhibits rather than their admissibility. 
    But there's absolutely nothing in these findings of fact that advised the Supreme Court of Washington what was before the trial judge at the time he made these rulings which he says in his finding of fact were correct rulings. 
    The trial judge did not comply with that part of the rules of the State of Washington which say that he shall find what portion of the stenographic transcript shall be necessary to effectuate the indigents' appeals. 
    They simply overlooked that particular section or he construed the rules in this manner apparently that if he concluded that the trial judge concluded that the appeal had no merit then here -- it wasn't up to him to specify which part of the record would be necessary to effectuate the appeals. 
    Petitioners contend that this procedure on its face does not give an indigent defendant in the State of Washington the same full appellate review, if indeed it gives them any appellate review before the Supreme Court of Washington as compared with what a defendant who have some money to buy the record can get.

    Mr. John J. Lally 
    Mr. -- may it -- Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court. 
    In 1959, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington bearing in mind the decision of this Court in Griffin versus Illinois and in Eskridge versus the Board of Prison Terms and Paroles for the State of Washington came out with this decision which my Brother counsel has referred to, which is In Re Woods versus Rhay appearing in 54 Washington 2d, page 36. 
    And in it, our Supreme Court was trying to do two things; one is to set up a procedure for the providing of free transcripts to indigents that would comply with the standards this Court set out in the Griffin and Eskridge cases. 
    And two, to provide a means within constitutional standards that would eliminate the granting of free transcripts if the request was a frivolous one. 
    Members of the Court, I would like to just add this in reference to what counsel has stated on this formula that appears in that case. 
    The formula goes on and then states this, after the trial judge has done these indicated items that counsel mentioned, a stenographic court recorder's report of that hearing should have been made, must be made, that shall be forwarded to our Supreme Court if the indigent defendant is not satisfied because the trial court did. 
    In this particular case which --

    Now, this case and what happened in it, I think typically exemplifies how our trial courts work under this formula. 
    In this case, the indigent was not satisfied when he was turned down, his application for the free transcript of the robbery trial itself. 
    So, the rule provides that if the man is represented by counsel who was appointed, which was the situation in this case, that counsel shall be retained and continue to represent that indigent man throughout this process. 
    It provides in this case -- pardon me, what happened then in this case, the stenographic report of the hearing held before the trial judge for the free statement of facts or transcript was forwarded to our Supreme Court. 
    The affidavit and motion of the petitioners in this case where they asked for the free transcript was forwarded into our Supreme Court, a lengthy affidavit, counter affidavit, pardon me, filed by the deputy prosecuting attorney who tried this case in which appears beginning on page 19 of the record before this Court was sent to our Supreme Court. 
    And in that respect, members of the Court, there is no question raised by the petitioners to what the facts set out in the Johnson counter affidavit are true. 
    And they summarized in essence in a narrative form, all the testimony that occurred at the robbery trial.

    -- of the record before this Court. 
    In addition to that, of course, there were submitted to our Court, the briefs of counsel and the oral argument of counsel which occurred. 
    A transcription of the oral argument that heard -- that was heard before the trial judge and then further oral argument heard before our appellate court. 
    That in essence is the procedure which this formula calls for. 
    Now, as counsel pointed out, there were two items under this formula which were not followed by the trial judge. 
    And it wasn't an omission by accident but it occurred unsatisfied without accident. 
    It was the State's physician in this case that there hadn't been anything raised -- there hadn't been anything raised by the petitioners which required any kind of a transcript or statement of facts from the trial itself.

    Because if -- what happened in this case, and it shows up on -- beginning on page 77 of this trial record is the opinion of our Supreme Court that this matter it was decided by our Supreme Court under the title of State versus Law. 
    Now in that for example, here's what happened. 
    Just for illustration, I try to boil it down. 
    Under contention for illustration number six, the petitioners here alleged 13 grounds of error. 
    In actual fact, there are 12, but the 13th was the request for the free transcript. 
    On number six, for example, was this --

    Mr. John J. Lally 
    That appears, Mr. Justice Black, on page 12 of the record. 
    Number six for illustration is that the trial judge was prejudiced against the defendant throughout the entire trial. 
    Now with reference to that, in its findings of fact, the trial judge denied that, but the important fact is this and here's how our Supreme Court could answer it. 
    Even and -- though the answer would have been identically the same and had there been a full statement of fact of the robbery trial itself. 
    Our Supreme Court said this and it appears in the opinion which begins on page 77. 
    In assign -- “In assignment number six, the defendant states that the trial judge was prejudiced against them throughout the trial.”

    Mr. John J. Lally 
    The seventh assignment alleged where that the trial judge should have dismissed the case as the defendants are not guilty as charged. 
    You'll recall, may it please the Court, that in the record on page 1920 and 1921 appears the uncontradicted affidavit of Johnson, the trial deputy prosecutor who summarized all the evidence. 
    And there's no question raised that the evidence he sets out in his affidavit is not correct. 
    The trial judge then in his findings of fact, which appear on -- in the record on 24, 25, 26 and 27 found similarly the facts to be as they appeared in the uncontradicted affidavit of Johnson. 
    Our Supreme Court then, in dealing with seven, said this. 
    And it appears in the 58 Washington 2d on pages 833 and 834, “In the seventh assignment of error, the Defendant State that the judge should have dismissed the case because they are not guilty. 
    We will assume without deciding that this assignment raises the question of whether there is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction. 
    The evidence outlined above which the jury was entitled to believe was sufficient proof in support of the convictions.”

    And in its own -- in its own words, the Washington court in dealing with a contention but there was insufficient evidence certainly wasn't just making a preliminary determination as to whether there was frivolous point raised but was giving full review on the merits but without a transcript.

    Number eight was the exhibits rendered over objection that should not have been allowed to be entered and shouldn't but should not have been allowed to be entered. 
    Our Supreme Court stated on page 835 of the Volume 58, Washington 2d, in assignment of errors number eight and nine -- nine, of course, is the one the testimony with a lot of our objections and should have not been allowed. 
    In assignments of errors eight and nine, it is alleged that exhibits which should have been excluded were admitted over objection. 
    And testimony was improperly allowed in spite of objections, thereto manifestly, these allegations are too broad and indefinite to indicate what specific erroneous rulings of the Court the defendants had in mind and they have not been made more definite by the briefs before this Court.

    Yes. 
    As a matter fact, the trial judge had quite a time. 
    One of the contentions was in point number -- one of the points here was that in the trial itself, the exclusionary witness rule had been invoked. 
    And the trial judge said, as you would see in this record here, he said to the petitioner, Mr. Draper, he said, “I recall no witnesses being in this courtroom after I invoked the rule.” 
    And Mr. Draper said, “Well, there were two.” 
    And the judge said, “Well, what evidence do you have at this?” 
    Mr. Draper said, “I have witnesses.” 
    The trial judge said, “Who are the witnesses?” 
    Mr. Draper said, “I don't have to tell you and I won't tell you who my witnesses are to that fact.” 
    Now -- and that went a little farther in the conversation and the conversation went on most to the points but that was the way the trial judge -- a part of the hearing covered that as he went down each point was Mr. Draper who wanted to speak in addition to having his counsel speak.

    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    Mr. Chief Justice. 
    In my remaining five minutes, I would like to point out first that the contention that the petitioners here have somehow admitted the accuracy of the prosecutor's affidavit is not justified in the record. 
    The preceding in which that affidavit was filed was a proceeding for the purpose of determining whether the petitioners were entitled to a free transcript. 
    And the rules in Woods against Rhay, which I quoted from extensively in my opening argument, do not provide that either the applicant for a free transcript or the State shall file such an affidavit as the prosecutor filed in this case. 
    And certainly the rules do not require that the defendants seeking of free transcript file a counter affidavit and say in effect that the State's affidavit reciting the facts is incorrect. 
    There's just nothing in the rules that requires that to be done.

speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="2940.328" stopTime="2969.630">
    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    The rules are silent on that point, but the -- as a practical matter, what happened here in the evidence such as it was, was simply the recollection of the attorney who represented the defendants at the trial, the recollection of one of the defendants himself, the recollection of the deputy prosecutor who had tried the case, and the recollection of the trial judge. 
    That -- that's -- there was no evidence taken. 
    It was simply an oral argument in which each got up and in turn stated how he remembered it happened.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2969.630" stopTime="2987.492">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There was apparently a full hearing at which the trial court gave the lawyer full opportunity to say whatever he wants to say apparently, and in addition to that, gave these -- the defendants themselves since they want to do -- dispensing the services of the lawyer gave them a full opportunity --
speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="2987.492" stopTime="2987.825">
    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    One of them.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2987.825" stopTime="2990.168">

    -- to state what they want to say. 
    As far as I can see, I'm just looking through the record.
speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="2990.168" stopTime="3101.988">
    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    That's correct, but none of the -- neither of the defendants nor their counsel had the benefit of a transcript with the testimony to refresh his recollection of what these errors were. 
    Now, for instance, there was an error alleged in here that a gun had been improperly admitted which it was contended by the State it had been used in pursuant to the robbers. 
    That gun was apparently, you can find here in the record, it was found in a corridor of the same hotel in which two of the -- or one of the petitioners were staying and an argument ensued is to whether the gun had been properly identified as the gun used in these alleged robberies. 
    This record does not have before it, or does not have in it any of the foundation that was laid by the State as an identification through that gun. 
    The same thing is true of a jacket that was offered in evidence. 
    The Supreme Court of Washington just doesn't have -- didn't have before it the foundation that was laid identifying that jacket which it was alleged belong to one of the defendants and in which some money was found in the pocket, which allegedly had been stolen in the course of these robbery. 
    Now, the point that the petitioners make here is if that they had the money to buy a transcript, they would have been able to bring before the Supreme Court of Washington the whole course of events, all of the happenings at the trial and if there had been an error in the admission of this gun, if the foundation has not been properly laid, they would have had an opportunity to show that to the Supreme Court of Washington. 
    But, under the procedure here adapted, they simply did not have that opportunity.

    You have in the record I gather, don't you, that the -- there was no Court opinion in Griffin that the two -- the prevailing things, both were things to recognize, things to say that transcripts were not automatically necessary in all cases. 
    And Eskridge, it was (Inaudible) to reiterate the same thing so that in all of the cases that you were relying on here, you have the majority of the Court subscribing to those opinions all agreeing that there is no automatic rule involved that requires a furnishing of a transcript in every case. 
    And therefore, the question that is involved here surely must be whether in the circumstances of this case, something more than what was called the bystander's bill of these affidavits or something more than the state procedure was required in order to give this man a fair break on whether he should've had a hearing on this appeal, isn't that the issue?
speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="3350.445" stopTime="3368.435">
    Mr. Charles F. Luce

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3368.435" stopTime="3371.329">

    Justice John M. Harlan

speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="3382.368" stopTime="3383.223">
    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    -- to an indigent.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3383.223" stopTime="3484.416">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    -- in my Brother Black's opinion in Griffin and it's repeated in Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion, his opinion was necessary to make the Court in that case and it's repeated unless my recollection serves me in the per curiam opinion in Eskridge. 
    And it says -- Justice Black says in his opinion, “We do not hold however that Illinois must purchase a stenographer's transcript in every case where a defendant cannot buy it.” 
    Now, a so-called rich defendant or rich appellant can of course, always buy one. 
    And therefore the statement would seem to indicate, that there is a margin of difference, that a Constitution may be recognized in what a State has to do in affording a so-called indigent a fair right of appeal. 
    And the opinion goes on the Supreme Court, that is referring to the Illinois Supreme Court may find other means of affording adequate and effective appellate review to indigent individuals, individual -- indigent defendants. 
    And then it was said as an example of bystander's bill and so forth and so on. 
    So, I submit to you that the question -- unless you're arguing that it is a matter of law in every instance, in every instance an indigent in order to be put on an equal footing in constitution with a so-called rich defendant is entitled to the transcript unless you're arguing that I submit that the -- you've got to meet this case on the basis of what actually happened here under the Washington proceeding.

    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    I don't construe the Griffin case and the Eskridge case that way. 
    I think that what they were saying was this, that if an appellant who had money would not reasonably require a transcript. 
    For instance here, we're just attacking -- attacking the constitutionality of the statute under which he were convicted or for instance, if his objection to his conviction was something that happened outside the courtroom tampering with the jury or something of that nature, that he wouldn't have to, the indigent then wouldn't have to be given a full transcript because a moneyed appellant wouldn't want one either.

    Mr. Charles F. Luce 
    Well, I think that the record shows a contradiction that these people contend in their request for a free transcript that the evidence does not show they're guilty and whether they then would have had to file another affidavit and say that we don't think we're guilty for the following reasons.

    At least the rule is not clear that that's required.

    Mr. Luce, I know the Court would have me express our appreciation to you for taking this long trip and doing the work you have done to represent this indigent petitioner at the request of the Court. 
    We're always appreciative of the acts of counsel in doing that. 
    And Mr. Lally, we're appreciative of the fair and diligent manner in which you have presented your State, also those both sides must be represented in the same disparity.
