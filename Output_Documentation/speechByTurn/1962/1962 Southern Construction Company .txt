speaker="william_harbison" startTime="41.838" stopTime="462.620">
    Mr. William Harbison 
    Alright, sir and so I will take just about 10 or 12 minutes, if the Court please. 
    May it please the Court, these are -- this is a Miller Act case arising in the Middle District of Tennessee. 
    The case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    If the Court please, briefly, I can state the situation. 
    This is a procedure case involving Rule 13 (a) or one of the other rules, Rule 8 in which, we have this situation, may it please the Court, and I think there is no dispute really about the underlying facts. 
    Southern Construction Company is in the general contracting business and had two separates sets of contracts with the United States Government for the rehabilitation of barracks. 
    One set of these contracts was at Fort Benning, Georgia, the other contract a much smaller one was at Fort Campbell, Tennessee. 
    The two contracts were let separately and there was no -- nothing in common between them except it happened to be the same general contractor. 
    It happened also that the Pickard Engineering Company of Washington D.C. was the mechanical subcontractor, the successful bidder on each set of contracts, submitting a bid in Georgia and being awarded the subcontract there, another bid in Tennessee, being awarded the bid there. 
    The work on the two contracts, however, proceeded simultaneously and Pickard had one common supplier furnishing the majority of his materials being the Atlas Supply Company of Atlanta, Georgia from whom he bought most of the materials that he put into both of these two jobs. 
    Pickard left both jobs, if the Court please, before they were complete under circumstances that are not now particularly material except that he left the Fort Campbell job in December 1955, he left the Fort Benning jobs shortly after that and Southern the prime contractor completed both jobs. 
    At the time when Pickard left, if the Court please, he owed admittedly on account at Fort Campbell, Tennessee to at least of $34,520. 
    He had so certified to Southern and Atlas had also billed Southern in that amount. 
    At the time he left Fort Benning, Georgia, Atlas claimed that Southern owed it or that Pickard owed it and Southern secondarily under the Miller Act a $104,000. 
    The record in this shows that Southern never disputed the account at Fort Campbell, Tennessee, had no basis upon which they disputed. 
    But it disputed in its entirely the billing made to it because it was liable under the Miller Act by Atlas at Fort Benning, Georgia and denied any validity to that account whatever of Mr. Pickard's. 
    If the Court please, businessmen don't always act as one might wish them to act and in August 1956, Southern and Atlas met together and Southern paid Atlas a lump sum of $35,000 and accepted a complete release of it's liability to Atlas under the Miller Act on both jobs. 
    Those -- that check is in the record. 
    The money was paid. 
    There is no dispute about that. 
    The money -- the payment was not allocated by Southern at that time to either job, both of them had some -- had gone to substantial completion. 
    Mr. Pickard was shown of the record to be insolvent and Southern simply did not make an allocation at that time. 
    They just made the payment and settled a business transaction and the check is in the record. 
    Then, if the Court please, in December 1956, some months after this payment was made on August, 1956, Mr. Pickard brought a suit against Southern under the Miller Act in the Middle District of Georgia claiming that he had not been fully paid on both jobs. 
    He -- his suit clearly, a complaint is in the record, shows that he sued in that action in December 1956, on both at Fort Campbell, Tennessee job and the Fort Benning, Georgia job claiming certain amounts due to him. 
    Of course as the Court knows the time for pleading is 20 days and within the 20 days, Southern filed an answer and counterclaim setting up the defense that it had more than paid to Mr. Pickard or to his suppliers, the contract prices on both jobs and asserting a counterclaim against him on both jobs. 
    At that time, the $35,000 payment was included in this Georgia case because the Tennessee contract was also in the Georgia case at that time. 
    Now it is true that the Miller Act provides that suits shall be brought in the district where the work is done and nowhere else. 
    So some months later in April of 1957, Mr. Pickard brought a separate suit in the Middle District of Tennessee on the Fort Campbell, Tennessee contract, although that wasn't formally deleted from the pleadings in Georgia until the trial of the Georgia case, he did bring a separate suit in Tennessee in April 1957 on the Tennessee contract alone. 
    It was then, if the Court please, that Southern was faced with the problem of where this $35,000 payment made on August 1956 properly should be allocated because it was now faced with two separates suits on two separates contracts. 
    The underlying facts as I have stated to the Court were that Southern had paid $34,520 on the Tennessee contract which it did not dispute to Atlas and a token payment on the Fort Benning's contract which it had disputed in its entirety and obtained a complete release. 
    Now, Southern is a bonded contractor and obviously its position about there being a substantial dispute in the Atlas billings must have been correct because otherwise there would be no reason for Atlas to make such a settlement with Southern. 
    So Southern, if the Court please, under this undertaking claimed this $34,520 payment as a credit on the Tennessee contract which the District Court allowed over the objection however of Mr. Pickard that the $34,520 payment or $35,000 payment was a compulsory counterclaim and had to be asserted by Southern in the Georgia proceedings or not be asserted at all that -- paid it to assert it there would be res judicata. 
    The Georgia case was tried first in March of 1959 and in that trial of that case, neither side listed this $35,000 payment or any part of it as being a credit on the Georgia contract. 
    That has been found concurrently by both the District and the Court of Appeals and this is a fact, if the Court please. 
    It was not claimed by Southern in the trial of that case. 
    It was not credited by Mr. Pickard in the trial of that case as properly being allocable to that case, any part of it. 
    The Tennessee case came only for trial some months later and Southern claimed the $35,000 payment or $34,520 of it in as a credit in the Tennessee case which the District Court allowed, but which this Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that the $35,000 payment was a compulsory counterclaim under Rule 13 (a) in Georgia and could not be asserted by Southern in the Tennessee case.

    The Georgia suit was filed first and then the Tennessee suit is taken out of that and filed separately in Tennessee. 
    That that is the -- the fact situation we were faced with and we tried to plead this claimants according to the underlying facts which have been found concurrently and I think they're not in dispute, if the Court please, and we feel that the payment belonged to the Tennessee contract and not to the Georgia one.

   Argument of Edward Gallagher

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gallagher.
speaker="edward_gallagher" startTime="756.635" stopTime="855.689">
    Mr. Edward Gallagher 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The position of respondent is based or rooted in the proposition that to a large extent the substance of this counterclaim throughout of the Georgia contract. 
    It was logically related to the Georgia contract. 
    And being so logically related, it was part of the Georgia transaction or occurrence as those terms are implied in the Rule. 
    This being true, it was a compulsory counterclaim in the Georgia proceeding. 
    It was injected by the operation of the rule, it was injected into the Georgia proceeding and became part of the issues in the Georgia case. 
    Being part of the issues, it was adjudicated there and when an effort was made at a subsequent date to litigate the same claim in the later Tennessee proceeding it was res judicata. 
    Now, there's been some talk about or argument about to what extent was an attempt made to prove the claim in the Georgia case. 
    According to our interpretation of the rule, it is not important to what extent proof was submitted in support of the claim. 
    It is not important whether it was even ignored. 
    The important thing is that by the operation of the compulsory counterclaim rule the counterclaim became part of the issues in the Georgia proceeding and therefore it was adjudicated there and it was res judicata in the subsequent Tennessee case.

speaker="edward_gallagher" startTime="1093.973" stopTime="1175.609">
    Mr. Edward Gallagher 
    The reason, if Your Honor please, is this. 
    There has never been a defense to the Tennessee claim as indicated by the verdict of the jury in Tennessee which was for the plaintiff. 
    The only defense that could be created was by splitting off a piece of this Georgia counterclaim, they left most of there but they split off the item that's now before Your Honors. 
    Why, to create a defense for the Tennessee case that otherwise did not exist. 
    If it weren't for splitting off, this piece of the counterclaim from Georgia bringing it to Tennessee, the Tennessee suit was indefensible. 
    The jury held for us in Tennessee, it was only by the action of the judge in Tennessee. 
    And by reason of his legal conception of what the counterclaim rule required that the verdict of Tennessee was nullified. 
    But to answer Mr. Justice Black's question, the reason they did not want to litigate this particular item in Georgia is because they thought they could use it to better advantage in Tennessee. 
    And I may say this, if Your Honor please, that that is the very verbatim testimony of counsel for the petitioner here. 
    He testified in this case and he testified that the reason -- that the piece was split off from Georgia to be used in Tennessee is because he as a lawyer thought that would've -- it would be to his better advantage to use in Tennessee as a defense. 
    So that's the answer --

    Mr. Edward Gallagher 
    Yes Your Honor, that's correct, but may I just say this? 
    If you -- if the wording of the rule, the language of the rule itself is examined, it completely supports the position of the respondent here. 
    The Rule says that the pleading must state as a counterclaim, any claim which the pleader has at the time that the counterclaim asserted. 
    In other words, the Rule says that the date of decision or the date on which the application of the counterclaim rule applies is the date on which the first complaint is filed.

    Mr. Edward Gallagher 
    No, Your Honor. 
    For this reason that if the Tennessee contract had been left in the Georgia proceeding. 
    In other words, the operation of the Rule had been exhausted at the time that the suit was moved to Tennessee and at the time that the Tennessee suit came along. 
    The operation of the Rule is exhausted as of the date on which the first complaint is filed. Whatever the situation is there then, that's when it's determined. 
    In other words, if the counterclaim was in existence on the date that the Georgia complaint was filed as it was and if the counterclaim had a logical relationship to the Georgia contract which it did then the rule, then the claim was compulsory in Georgia.

    Oh, yes, sir, absolutely, yes, sir. 
    Now, let me say this about the logical relationship. 
    There was a $139,000 involved here, that was the total debt. 
    There was one supplier who supplied both the Georgia contract and the Tennessee contract. 
    The total outstanding debt was a $139,000. 
    The 104,000 of that was owed in Georgia not Tennessee, in Georgia, 34 in Tennessee so that the -- it will -- that by far the largest proportion of the debt was it -- that was settled was incurred under the Georgia contract. 
    This was natural because the contract in Georgia was $513,000. 
    The contract in Tennessee was $50,000. 
    The percentages, in other words, that were settled, this -- the percentages that were settled by this payment of this counterclaim by him of $35,000 was 75 in Georgia, 25 in Tennessee --
