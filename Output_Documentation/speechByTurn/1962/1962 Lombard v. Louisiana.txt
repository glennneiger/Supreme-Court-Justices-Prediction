    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of this Court. 
    I find Louisiana in a unique position here today because frankly we have no quarrel with the law as it presently exist at least in our opinion in this matter. 
    I think that this case of Lombard here, is one that was largely determined revolved its decision on what the facts actually are. 
    And they are so important that I would like to take a minute to go through the facts of this case.And then we can discuss the appropriate legal points. 
    Now, the facts surrounding this case was the basis of a criminal mischief charge brought against these defendants are still in Louisiana. 
    Between 10 and 11 o'clock on the morning of September the 17th 1960, two Negro men, a Negro woman and a white man took seats at a 24 stew lodge counter, reserved the white customers in McCrory's Five and Ten Cent Store or Canal Street in New Orleans. 
    Now, McCrory's is one of the national chain operates in 34 states. 
    It sells all kind of merchandize and it's open to the public and of course the statements I'm making here are born out by the record because I am following my brief. 
    The question of whether the lunch counter facilities in the various McCrory stores are segregated or integrated is left to the National Office of the McCrory stores to be determined by local tradition law and custom as interpreted by the manager of each individual store. 
    And that's in a transcript of the record at page 21. 
    Of course, as it has been point by Mr. Nelson, Louisiana has no law requiring segregation of eating facilities in its state. 
    It never has had -- neither thus the City of New Orleans nor do I know of any single municipality that has such an ordinance in the state, back there is none. 
    Now, the McCrory Store in which these defendants stay and having demonstration had separate food counters for serving food to Negro and white customers since 1938. 
    And as I said before, there is no law or ordinance requiring the segregation with these eating places and by operating separate lunch counters for whites and Negroes, McCrory was simply following a local custom as interpreted by that store manager, Mr. Barrett. 
    An employee of the lunch counter at which the defendants sat down called the restaurant manager who informed these four students both white and Negro, that he could not serve them at that counter and that he had to sell them eating materials at the rear of the store were he had a colored counter. 
    Now, when the manager received no answer at all from these individuals, this is the restaurant manager, he turned off the lights. 
    He removed the unoccupied stools -- stools and he closed the lunch counter. 
    A sign reading? 
    This counter is closed was pointed out to the students but they remained silent. 
    The restaurant manager then called the store manager and the police. 
    Now, the police -- it's significant, the police were never present in anytime. 
    The manger, Mr. Barrett, came behind the counter and he talked to the individuals and he asked them to leave. 
    Police still was not in -- were not in the establishment. 
    But they neither answered in nor did they move the concen -- continued to sit down. 
    When the police arrived, the store manager advised the students in the presence of the police and prior to talking to the police that the counter which they were seated was close and he asked them to leave the store, nothing happened.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I didn't quite get it. 
    Did I miss -- how did the police -- were they called under this?
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="275.449" stopTime="302.981">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Yes. 
    The restaurant manager notified the store manager and then called the police. 
    Up to that time the police were not involved in this factual situation at all. 
    And when the police arrived, the store manager talked to the four individuals and he told them that the counter which they were seating was closed and he asked them to leave the store. 
    Now, as I said nothing happened. 
    Thereupon --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="302.981" stopTime="304.866">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, was that done in the presence of the police?
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="304.866" stopTime="337.650">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Yes. 
    And the manager told these individuals that he ordered them out of store and he asked the police to take them out of the store because it was his custom not to serve them. 
    His custom as interpreted by him. 
    It was his custom not to serve them at that particular counter. 
    Then the police officers told them, ?The manager wants you out. 
    You are violating Louisiana law.? 
    And that's of course is in the record. 
    And the --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="337.650" stopTime="341.356">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He didn't identify what law they were violating, did he?
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="341.356" stopTime="368.999">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    No, he just said you're violating the State law and he asked them to leave. 
    He asked, Which one was the leader? 
    And the white student and said, I am the leader. 
    And that's the only word that was ever spoken by these four people. 
    He identified himself as the leader. 
    And he said that they had come there for a particular purpose. 
    And that their mission was to be served and that if they were not served, they were willing to be arrested. 
    So the Major, I forget his name right now, the police --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="368.999" stopTime="375.460">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, what law were they violating if any right at that moment? 
    By saying they wanted to be served.
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="375.460" stopTime="403.493">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    They were violating the criminal mischief statute of the State of Louisiana which read as follows. 
    And this is the basis of the charge against them, Taking temporary possession of any part or parts of a place of business, or remaining in place of business, after the person in charge of such business or portion of such business has ordered to such person to leave the premises after he resist from the temporary possession of any part of parts of such business. 
    In other words --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="403.493" stopTime="411.600">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So while -- while this is what you referred or called a criminal mischief statute that part of it at least is very similar to the trespass statute that we have in the previous cases, is that right?
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="411.600" stopTime="575.855">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Well, you might say that but it -- it was a statute that was passed by the 1960 session of the legislator, and was designed to protect the rights of the private individual on his property from the invasion by anyone regardless of race, creed, or color. 
    Now, counsel -- and I might go into this right now. 
    Counsel has attempted to tell you that there was a great segregation program passed by the State of Louisiana of that session of the legislature. 
    Well, it may be that there were a lot of laws passed that was subsequently declared unconstitutional in litigation in the eastern district and subsequently in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    But these particular statutes, these particular criminal statutes were passed as the result of District Attorney's conferences and I might tell the Court that as Attorney General, I've already made conferences for the District Attorneys in my state which is required to some states. 
    And we meet every year in February of the year and we discuss the decisions of this Court as they affect our laws. 
    We discuss the decisions of our Supreme Court as they affect our criminal statutes. 
    And we are always amending our criminal code to provide the situations that were never covered by law of the Court. 
    So there is no significance to be attached in such a fact like that. 
    In fact, as the result of the working with the Louisiana Law Institute, our Court of Criminal And Civil Procedures was completely overhauled at the same session of the legislature. 
    So I don't think anyone can say that that was the result in trying to maintain the policy of segregation in my states. 
    Some of the laws that we amended we act quite a bit of litigation involving our registrars and voters. 
    We woke up to find out that no one could ever provide the material for the registrar of voters because until recent years, the office was relatively unimportant. 
    And it passed the law at that session making the Attorney General the attorney for the registrar of voters just giving me a little more work to do. 
    But I recite that to you because there's nothing in any of these statutes that we passed which would Your Honor upon recommendations of the District Attorneys and this act was drawn in my office. 
    So I don't know why it was put in there. 
    We never have a statute before because we never have had situations that existed like this before. 
    We never had the statute on our books that could punish someone for coming in and taking possession of their property, much like that someone would walk into your home and say, I'm in your home. 
    And you could say, Well I don't want you in my home, get out. 
    And we never had a statute to cover. 
    Certainly, you would have the right to invite him out and if he refuse to go out you would certainly have the right to call the police because he has no right to be in your home, no federal right, no other vested right. 
    And that's why we pass this particular statute.

    What did the statute accomplish if this already embraced the general trespass statute?

    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, our general trespass statute, as I recall, relates mostly to farming and includes the lands.

    No, but they are the same approximately.

    They have provided for a fine or I believe one year in jail up to a thousand dollars after discretion of the Court or depending upon the facts of the case.

    Well, it was -- no they had never had held but it was always the contention of the District Attorneys and others that the general trespass statute would not apply to a situation where individuals came in to a place of business such as happened here and took possession of it because the general trespass statute did not cover such a situation. 
    And that's why we pass this statute; we wanted to spell it out.

    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    I'd be very glad to discuss that. 
    Now, you must bear in mind, that these sit-in demonstrations occurred just about the time we were having sit-in demonstrations all over the south. 
    And feelings were rising high. 
    We had a sit-in demonstration at Woolworths which caused the Superintendent of Police to issue that particular statement, but that was on a Friday. 
    On the next Saturday, we had a picketing fiasco at another store in the French Quarter in New Orleans. 
    It turned out not to be in a peaceful picketing at all and in fact, the police were not there of course, they're too being called. 
    And the picket were running the pedestrians over the street and making them run out into the narrow streets of the French Quarter. 
    And there was a tremendous excitement prevailing that could have blown-up in any minute and we could have had race riots. 
    That was when after that particular cause and incidentally those individuals have been charged with obstructing a public passage way and making pedestrians get off. 
    And that case was tried and they were convicted in the lower court is now in the Supreme Court of Louisiana. 
    And I imagine we'll be having it up here sooner or later.

    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    So then -- so then Mayor Morrison issued his statement. 
    Now, I can read those statements very carefully. 
    I've read them again this morning When Mayor Morrison refers to so-called peaceful picketing, what he meant was something that was attempting to be conducted under the guise of law which could possibly obstruct the peace and harmony of the community. 
    And that's why those statements were issued. 
    They were issued purely as the ministerial function of the Mayor and his chief law enforcement officer. 
    It is significant to note that the Mayor at no time said he was sending police to these department stores. 
    At no time did he say that he was going to take the law into his own hands. 
    And reading these, you can only come to the conclusion that here was the Mayor of a great city, a great mayor, a distinguished mayor, who was doing his job, under the Constitution of his state and the Constitution of the United States to maintain peace and order. 
    Now, Mr. Justices let me ask you this and this is one of the dilemmas that Louisiana face -- faces. 
    When we in cases of this kind call upon our police, which we've certainly got a right to do after an occurrence has happened such as this. 
    If we fail to maintain the peace and tranquility of our community by the use of our own police which is paid to do that. 
    If we fail to do that, we are castigated before the eyes of the nation and the press. 
    The first thing, you know, we've gotten marshals and in some cases troops. 
    Then if we don't take care of our people, if we don't use our police to maintain law and order in a community, we come before this great tribunal claiming that their rights have been violated as the result of certain sections of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. 
    Now, what are we going to do? 
    The only thing that we can do is exactly what's transpired in this case. 
    I say to this Court that Mayor Morrison is a man of moderation and so is Chief Giarrusso. 
    He'd been an outstanding mayor and he acted without discrimination whatsoever in this case. 
    He had just run for governor in that law the Negro votes. 
    Certainly, he wasn't going to turn around and repudiate him and furthermore I say to this Court that the President of the United States would have never appointed Mayor Morrison as the ambassador to organization of American States if he had it in anyway discriminated against anybody in the City of New Orleans. 
    So I attach no significance whatsoever. 
    It certainly not a part of the race just type of this case. 
    It was not a directive to any storeowner that they get to together. 
    It was not a directive to a storeowner to call the police, nothing was mentioned about that.

    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Mr. Justice, my answer to that is that it wouldn't have made any difference if they have got together and discuss it because it doesn't constitute state action.

    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Mr. Justice Goldberg, I say this. 
    That if the -- oh yes, I've been reading here of that, that there are definitely. 
    I also say this, that if the manager and it got together with all the managers and it's decided that they were going to segregate their colors and that -- then he comes around to change his mind, and called the police and someone sued him rather as a result of his breaking the agreement. 
    That that could of course be state action, likewise, if you had decided that, say he was a great advocate of civil rights and in his own mind his interpretation of what the custom was that he had decided, he was going to serve everybody indiscriminately. 
    And that group of each citizen called the police and one of them had the police arrest him, do you understand? 
    Then that would be state action, but that is not what happened here. 
    What happened here is that you had a bunch of people who moved in deliberately with design sat down and said, I want service. 
    The manager says, I'm not going to serve you. 
    The police had never been called. 
    The police had never been contacted. 
    The police gave him ample opportunity to leave and reluctantly arrested them after they had been in that count of some 20 and 25 minutes. 
    So as -- as I -- yes, Your Honor?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Excuse me -- Mr. Nelson wanted to conduct his cross-examination and direct it to this language of the Mayor in his public statement. 
    I have today directed the Superintendent of police that no additional sit-in demonstrations or so-called peaceful picketing outside retail stores by sit-in demonstrators or their sympathizers will be permitted. 
    And then jumping over to the end of it, It is my determination that the community interest, the public safety, and the economic welfare of this city require that such demonstrations seized and that henceforth, they be prohibited by the police department. 
    Now, would you discuss whether that represents state action in as much as the Mayor is the -- is the chief officer of the city and the Superintendent is his -- is appointee and subordinate to him.

speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="1470.874" stopTime="1492.382">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    But I come back to this. 
    He did not call the Mayor on the trial of this case and asked him a single thing about that. 
    These sit-ins happened after the statement of the Mayor. 
    So apparently it had no effect. 
    He never discussed with Mr. Barrett during the trial of this case whether Barrett ever new about the existence of those particular statements and I don't think --

    -- could he?
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="1494.570" stopTime="1541.591">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    I don't think that -- I don't think that that constitutes state action, because I think that all that the Mayor was trying to do was to maintain peace and order. 
    And it is a fact that these sit-ins occurred and Mr. Nelson said very quietly without any passion whatsoever. 
    And of course, the State police was not there to stop them as the result of this statement by the Mayor. 
    The statement by the Mayor to me is whether as the Chief of Police is strictly one of maintaining peaceful situations in the City of New Orleans. 
    He noted in his statement that he didn't say anything about peaceful picketing, he's talked about so-called peaceful picketing.

    Well, what's the anwer?
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="1943.239" stopTime="2026.770">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Could you just bear with me just for a second. 
    Here it is on page 146 of Supreme Court's opinion. 
    The defendants sought to introduce evidence to establish that the action of the manager of McCrory's was provoked or encouraged by the State. 
    And that they would have this Court hold at this action of McCrory's was not of its own voluntary action, it was influenced by the officers of the State. 
    The conclusion contented for as incompatible with the facts rather the testimony supports a finding as a manager of McCrory's had for the past several years for few service to Negroes, that the policy the store was established by him that he'd setout the policy he founded consistently. 
    That Negroes had habitually been granted access to one counter and within the store and it deliberately provoked mischief and disturbance such as the one he complained of here had not previously occurred. 
    In the -- passed to other Negroes could have mistaken to take sits encountered question and they were told to move and cooperate, and recognize the request of McCrory's employees and had said that the counter set side from him. 
    Even under the provisions of requested statute, it is apparent that the prosecution is dependent from will of the proprietor. 
    For all that after he is automatically intrudes to relinquish possession of his place of business that a violation of the statute occurs. 
    The State therefore without the exercise of propriety would define no basis under the statute to prosecute and then it goes on --

speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="2035.338" stopTime="2062.864">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Mr. Justice White, I will agree that we are probably weak on that particular point. 
    But it will just so be it as far as we're concerned if this Court says that it should have been allowed and the Court is not going to do by except of his mandate. 
    But we don't feel that their rights were violated in this respect at this particular trial because of the provisions of Louisiana law. 
    And the Court went into that quite thoroughly and I'll just have to stand on the decision of my Supreme Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2062.864" stopTime="2078.572">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    General, you said that a few moments ago that the Mayor was speaking only of unlawful demonstrations. 
    So, would you show me in his statement please where he says he's only referring to it.
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="2078.572" stopTime="2195.335">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    No, he doesn't come right out and say that. 
    But certainly I don't think anyone would understand that he was trying to say that he was referring to anything but violations of the law. 
    In other words, I'm being extended about this as I possibly can. 
    And I'm looking at -- I'm considering what -- what occurred, these three demonstrations and why the Mayor did this and I've never talk to him about it. 
    I've never discussed it with him. 
    And I suppose that we can draw that anyone can draw his own inferences from his statement. 
    But I repeat that I think that his statement was one purely of a ministerial nature in which he was trying to maintain the peace of the community. 
    Because he went ahead and quoted in his statement, Mr. Chief Justice, Act 17 of the 1960 legislature by disturbing the peace. 
    He quoted another provisions of Act 70. 
    He quoted 80 which was obstructing public passages and the restraining of traffic. 
    And looking at it from the overall picture, I don't think -- I think he was directing his statement to the entire population of New Orleans and not to one specific group to restrain themselves and to act in a lawful manner. 
    Now, that's what I get from it and apparently that's what the Court got from it and I repeat that Mayor Morrison is certainly a man of moderation. 
    He's very liberal with his thoughts and I don't think that he ever had in mind the utilization of the police force that he's an officer or anybody to take anyone's rights away. 
    And I repeat that certainly these sit-ins occurred some four or five days after his particular statements so it must have been a situation whereby these individuals wanted to provoke some action where they could come under the cover in the cloak of the Fourteenth Amendment and have their prosecutions voided.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    He wasn't speaking to general public when he said this: I have carefully reviewed the reports of these two initial demonstrations by a small group of misguided white and Negro students, or former students. 
    It is my considered opinion that regardless of the avowed purpose or intent of the participants, the effect of such demonstrations is not in the public interest of this community.

    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2254.654" stopTime="2259.719">

    -- just one more question. 
    And he is insisting in the statement that that be adhered to?
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="2259.719" stopTime="2328.123">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    Oh yes. 
    Absolutely, because he -- as he says, it's not in the public interest and he does not want any unlawful acts to occur. 
    That's what I draw upon. 
    We were talking about inns and in that connection let me go into this. 
    We were talking about the inns and hotels and you've talked to the other states about that. 
    We have no such statute in that respect. 
    But, talking about the policy of the State, just recently a motel was opened up in Baton Rouge, it's called the International Motel. 
    And they've got signs all up and down the highway. 
    You know what they got on the bottom of those signs in big -- owned and operated by and for colored people only. 
    We've got the Lincoln Hotel in Baton Rouge the same way. 
    We've got hotels in New Orleans the same way. 
    We've got tourist courts in Lafayette. 
    We've got tourist courts in Lake Charles and Shreveport. 
    And it's publicly, they said, This is for colored only?. 
    Now, who made them do that? 
    Strictly, the policy of State that's all. 
    Negroes are doing it just as much as white people, are we to be condemned if they do that, can you say that a policy is state action under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?

    The civil rights cases hold otherwise and I agree with the gentlemen up here from Baltimore, wherever he was from, yesterday when he said that to reverse these convictions, you have overrule civil rights cases. 
    And I said quite frankly, I agree with you as to what the law is now I believe to overrule this if you approach it from the facts of the law that you have to overrule the Civil Rights Acts which of course will give us by decision of this Court, if you do that in National Civil Rights Policy.

    Let me tell you another little incident now, Mr. Justice. 
    Let me tell you no one -- well I'm not trying to be fastidious with the Courts I -- I --

    I have a Negro in Louisiana charged back with rape.

    Yes.

    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    And he claims that his constitutional rights have been violated because Negroes have been systematically included in the jury pounds and he wants to be -- he wants to be tried by an all white jury. 
    Now, he had one for the books. 
    So I'm only bringing that out to tell you what the policy of my state is what the custom has meant. 
    And it hasn't been enforced by white people. 
    It always been enforce by Negro thought as well. 
    We've got a little community down at Houma, Louisiana which is sort of an Indian tribe. 
    A mixture of French and Negro and they've got their own school, they want their own school, they tell the School Board they want nobody else in there, they don't want white people. 
    They don't want colored people. 
    They don't want others. 
    They want their school. 
    Those are things that are just innate. 
    Those are the things that are positive and there's no law that requires them. 
    They just do that. 
    They segregate and state onto themselves. 
    Yes, gentlemen this is a serious question. 
    I realize that all of these cases are ticklish because they involve prejudices and we've got prejudices all over the United States not only in the State of Louisiana. 
    In fact, I'd we've got more throughout the United States and we have in our State. 
    We don't -- we don't try to hurt anybody. 
    I don't issue opinions in my office. 
    This opinion is for black and this opinion is for white. 
    I don't have segregated signs in my office. 
    I receive all the races in my office Mexican, red, green and all, the Irish.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    (Inaudible) of what has happened, then what the Mayor was saying in his statement was, that it was not conducive to the best interest of the city to have these segregated eating places in New Orleans. 
    And therefore, he was instructing the Police Department to prohibit any effort to desegregate restaurants, isn't that what he was saying in effect?
speaker="jack_p_f_gremillion" startTime="2542.412" stopTime="2607.897">
    Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion 
    No, I don't think so, Your Honor, because he did say that he knew of no integrated eating places as well as the chief. 
    But I come back to the fact when you read his statement in view of what had occurred, what was in the papers about the sit-ins in the rest of the cities and about the two that it already happened in New Orleans. 
    That he was a appealing to the prior, to the intellect, and to the peace loving people of the City of New Orleans. 
    And that that's all that he was trying to do. 
    And now the reason I say that is because if he had met otherwise, he had the power to take police in station him McCrory's, in Captain (Inaudible), in Woolworths, in Kress, and all of those stores, but he did not do that. 
    He allowed those people to conduct their business as they wish and as they saw fit. 
    And that is further proven by the facts that this is in the Government's brief and Mr. Nelson admitted it yesterday. 
    That these storeowners have gotten together and decided they were going to open the lunch counters to everybody which was done just recently.

    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    May it please the Court. 
    I was on Mayor Morrison's staff for four years as an Assistant District Attorney fully aware of the problems involved in Mayor Morrison's administration. 
    I might not point out to Court that the reason why they have a sign on Negro motels by colored only is because of a state statute that segregates inns, hotels, and places where people go in. 
    The Attorney General must have forgotten above that statute or overlooked it.

    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    No sir, they do not. 
    Another thing, please gentlemen, if you send this case back, give us some directives, some limitations within which we can try this case. 
    To try cases like this in Louisiana courts today from a defendant attorney standpoint is a trying ordeal. 
    Particularly when you get the Attorney General of the State that makes statements above race rights due to picketing and maybe that's what Mayor Morrison was referring to, you know what the picketing consisted of? 
    One picket walking on a sidewalk behind Woolworths on Ardebil Street was arrested. 
    This is the man that represents him. 
    This case is now depending before the Louisiana Supreme Court. 
    This is the case that the Attorney General said it was about to cause race riots and massive picketing, and people picketing push -- pickets pushing people off the sidewalks in the French Quarter, one picket. 
    Now, there is a -- there is a great deal of play in Louisiana in politics. 
    The statement is when you run for political office, you play in South Louisiana and you pray in North Louisiana. 
    Now, this same thing is being done here. 
    We say one thing in New Orleans and thing here. 
    And the thing is, is that we are trying to somehow to get into the main stream of a legal life that's going on in United States in Terrebonne Parish the unions. 
    Do you think they want to segregate themselves? 
    This is about -- a case is just about the store, it's five Indians. 
    You know, they force an Indian to go to an Indian school. 
    They can't go to Negro school or white schools in Terrebonne Parish. 
    This is not an Indian reservation. 
    You know they can't go in high school in Terrebonne Parish. 
    They've got a two room grammar school there. 
    And when they want to go to high school they have to tree hours to another parish. 
    Do think they want this as the Attorney General would have you believe? 
    Members of this Court, basically, this is not a question to eat a hotdog with a white man. 
    This is a protest and dissent in an effort to change attitudes to try to develop that consciousness of a community to choose justice and equal treatment. 
    Basically that's what this is.

    If you find such a statute, will you make a memorandum of it with the Court please.

    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    I will. 
    If might -- or to New Orleans City ordinance he says, -- but any event I will correct that. 
    If I might just sum up in a hurry, as I see to this Court the job, the issue here there are three: Number one, the determination of state action in these cases, number two the question of defining the limits within the which a protest might be made in a store which is open to the general public and in defining those limits, you also set a limitation on the power of the State to prevent that particular right being exercised, and the third is brought by Justice Douglas, the question of whether there is state involvement per se in the operation of a store such as McCrory's or Kress or Woolworths. 
    Now, in so forth --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3437.277" stopTime="3440.321">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How could you distinguish between McCrory and Woolworths?

    No sir, they are not.

    Whether that's corner store where the man lives in it or didn't live in it?
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3447.663" stopTime="3449.260">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I know but you would -- if it would apply to McCrory's and the other, it would have to apply for the smaller ones, wouldn't it?
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3455.728" stopTime="3458.421">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    It would apply to any store open to the public.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3458.421" stopTime="3459.027">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's right.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3459.027" stopTime="3495.748">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    Now, I do not say we don't have to cons -- we do not have to concern ourselves with the question of whether the Metropolitan Club or the Boston Club in the City of New Orleans because you have an element of privacy there. 
    You have an element of privacy that you don't -- you do not have in McCrory's or Woolworths, or Kress. 
    And that element may make a tremendous step and so here we concern ourselves with a piece of property that's open to the entire public. 
    That's the -- that's a public store affair that men have given up their rights to any type of privacy in it. 
    I -- so the question is on that issue --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3495.748" stopTime="3498.976">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    A retail house there is not being a home?
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3498.976" stopTime="3543.268">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    No sir. 
    So on -- on that issue, the question that we're looking for that -- if this Court -- if this case is sent back specifically looking for guidance is whether or not these kids who have protested on this open property or exercising a First Amendment right, and whether that right will be preferred to the corresponding property right of racial discrimination that a man may have, which would of course then be exercised by prosecution and subsequent sentence. 
    I say if we start with Marsh and which was no state action a privately owned town in Marsh. 
    And as I appreciate the case --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3543.268" stopTime="3552.352">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Marsh, as I recall it, didn't say that a state couldn't have laws that are against trespass, they have to warn you of leaving the property after notice.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3552.352" stopTime="3602.588">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    No sir. 
    But the way I read the Marsh with the privately owned town of Marsh but no state involvement. 
    This was the day -- this was set up as a characterization of a particular piece of property so as to define the limits of legal rights being exercised on it, apply that to McCrory's. 
    And then we come up to date on the Shelley versus Kraemer. 
    And I submit that on the basis of these two cases, as far as I appreciate the jurisprudence, we can come to an answer -- we can come to the -- to the legal conclusion that the preferred right of these kids to demonstrate in a manner in which they did, and the circumstances which were -- within which the act took place and the environment that covered the whole thing that to be accused of trespassing was a depri -- was a violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights.

    Do you have to go that far in this case?

    I understand. 
    I understand that fully. 
    But the issue, basic issue, when you get to bottom of some of these cases here whether an owner of a store can do this and whether because he has a right to do it, the State can call its officials to help enforce his legal rights.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3659.638" stopTime="3663.437">

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, are you -- are you saying that the Federal Constitution without any legislation to back it, bars a merchant from following that course, that is, as I understand it, it's ultimately the basic issue that would sometimes have to be reach in some of these cases, maybe not indeed?
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3783.813" stopTime="3813.692">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    Not indeed, sir. 
    And insofar as the -- as to whether the Constitution would prohibit a manager from actually serving the costumer I would approach it on this that I believe that the Constitution would prohibit a Negro from protesting at that very counter if it's open to the public, that he'd not be serve. 
    And that for that protest I don't think he should be -- the Constitution keep him out of jail.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3813.692" stopTime="3827.710">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The question behind that would still be whether he can go into a mercantile establishment against the will of the owner or stay there against the will of the owner in order to make his speech of protest. 
    Are you saying he could?
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3827.710" stopTime="3838.106">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    Absolutely, under circumstances of which these demonstrations took place I say this was free speech and they were invited in and they can do it. 
    I respectfully submit that they can.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3838.106" stopTime="3860.626">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I understand with reference to your argument, that you are in fact saying that no matter what how you answered the question of whether or not a storeowner has the right to discuss it -- that it's unquestionably clear that the State has no right to chose them for it, and that in this case, the State chose them for it.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3860.626" stopTime="3861.496">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3861.496" stopTime="3863.573">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That is one of your -- one branch of your argument.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3863.573" stopTime="3864.333">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3864.333" stopTime="3869.146">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if you're correct on that whether these other questions are in the case.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3869.146" stopTime="3869.796">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    That's correct, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3869.796" stopTime="3870.552">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is that true?
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3870.552" stopTime="3871.596">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    That's true.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3871.596" stopTime="3896.253">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And it's only if you answer that question in a certain way that you must reach the other branch of your argument you'd stated today in which I didn't understand you stated yesterday, that a store is such an establishment. 
    That it may not discriminate because a store per se is a state action for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3896.253" stopTime="3921.176">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    But with the requesting of court possibility that this case may be sent back for a new trial. 
    And I would respectfully request that that'd be done, that these questions in this case of these issues be defined so that we'll have some guidance to prevent the reappearing in 1964.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3921.176" stopTime="3932.950">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you if we sent back under Louisiana law whether it would now be moot since all of the stores are permitting them to come in?
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3932.950" stopTime="3934.108">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    I don't think that we --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3934.108" stopTime="3934.119">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But I --
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3934.119" stopTime="3948.750">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    -- I don't think the governor would dismiss these cases. 
    The environment is not -- that I don't know. 
    I -- I'm sure it would be moot, be a question of whether the District Attorney would want it just arbitrarily nolle prosequi the cases.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3948.750" stopTime="3952.480">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But if they're -- would be moot then, they're moot now.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3952.480" stopTime="3957.313">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    Well I don't -- there is -- there is a jail sentence facing these kids --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3957.313" stopTime="3966.331">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, there still would be but how would it change if these cases were sent back how in terms of mootness would the situation had been changed?
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3966.331" stopTime="3967.753">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    Well, if they know mootness insofar is concerned.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3967.753" stopTime="3973.019">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Voice Overlap) I mean that somebody has to take some actions before the State would do that?
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="3973.019" stopTime="3973.928">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    That's correct, sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3973.928" stopTime="4010.231">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But if there had been a statute in that state which forbad this to be done, and the State had changed it, many states hold under those circumstances the pending actions obeyed cannot presume the same thing would be through of the judgment. 
    Although not a statute, it's a common law it -- it's a custom. 
    The law has been forbidden and that law changes, their custom changes, the practice of the State changes, the State could well hope if it wanted to and it might that all actions pending on it had obeyed it, but that was the question.

    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    Your Honor, of course they -- Louisiana and I respectfully submit it would not because it depends -- would not, because the pendency of absolved.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4017.412" stopTime="4023.531">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    If we affirm this judgment. 
    We have to do it on the basis on the assumption that this person goes to jail.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="4023.531" stopTime="4025.372">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    You would. 
    There's no question --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4025.372" stopTime="4032.426">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Perhaps the governor would be soft-hearted in pardoning for something. 
    We couldn't make that assumption.
speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="4032.426" stopTime="4043.092">
    Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr. 
    No sir. 
    Because of the fact there's -- the pendency of so many cases in Alexandria, in Shreveport and in other areas in Louisiana where this is still a vital issue. 
    Thank you.
