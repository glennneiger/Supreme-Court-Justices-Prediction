Lane v. Brown

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- Ward Lane, Warden, petitioner, versus George Robert Brown. 
    Mr. Levy, you may continue your argument.
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="9.476" stopTime="71.789">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    At the Court's recess yesterday, we had proceeded with the respondent's argument to the point of examining the Law of Indiana as expressed in the McCrary case. 
    And to resume that argument, I would like first simply to say that from the McCrary case, it is clearly established that the presence of a transcript is necessary to an appeal in the Supreme Court of Indiana and by transcript, we mean, the full blown transcript in its formal aspect. 
    It is also established in the Law of Indiana by the McCrary case that an indigent convicted prisoner goes to the Public Defender, and if the Public Defender refuses to accept his case, refuses to represent him, that prisoner is unable to obtain a transcript.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The scope of this rule is limited to an appeal from denial of a coram nobis remedy, is it not?

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    To the extent that it is expressed in the McCrary case, yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And how about the statute?
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="82.357" stopTime="91.584">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    This -- the statute refers to belated appeals and apparently could be broaden to include the direct appeal as well.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="91.584" stopTime="93.410">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But it’s a post conviction and --

    This is a post conviction --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="94.041" stopTime="97.674">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's limited to a post conviction, an appeal from the denial of a post conviction remedy.
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="97.674" stopTime="98.938">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="98.938" stopTime="100.312">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    May I ask you this while --
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="100.312" stopTime="100.647">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="100.647" stopTime="114.667">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- I've interrupted you. 
    Is there an absolute right to counsel in the trial court in a post conviction remedy? 
    In this case, the Public Defender did represent the petitioner in the trial court, in a coram nobis hearing. 
    Was that an absolute right under Indiana law?
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="114.667" stopTime="254.459">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    I would say that it is an absolute right taking the older cases. 
    I do not believe the question has been raised in recent years at least. 
    Now, from the McCrary case, it may also be gathered that there is some form of review. 
    It was used in the McCrary case and then after the Brown case was repeated in -- with slight changes in the Willoughby case. 
    But it seems to us unnecessary to examine into that review at the present time unless the Court desires to hear upon it because it was not available to Brown and he, by admission of the State, had exhausted all state remedies available to him prior to the time that the Willoughby case was decided. 
    Now when we turn to Brown's own case, we have a slightly different treatment both by this Court and by the court below. 
    When Brown first sought a writ of habeas corpus, it was denied him on the ground that he had failed to exhaust the state remedies. 
    Then, Brown proceeded through the various steps that McCrary proceeded through, and finally came before this Court with a petition for writ of certiorari upon the denial by the Supreme Court of Indiana of a writ of mandate to the Lake Criminal Court to provide him counsel and a transcript and permit him to appeal from the denied petition for writ of error coram nobis. 
    In this Court, instead of setting aside the dismissal of his action and remanding as had been done in the McCrary case, the Court denied certiorari without prejudice to Brown's right to bring habeas corpus in the appropriate Federal District Court. 
    Now Brown did go into the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Indiana --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="254.459" stopTime="262.595">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Do you take the denial of the petition for certiorari without prejudice to mean as distinguished from a mere denial of certiorari?
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="262.595" stopTime="368.672">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    It seems to me that one of the great problems involved in this case is, as has been discussed in some of the preceding cases, the question of federalism and the abrasive, corrosive relationship with respect to the States. 
    The procedures, as I will attempt to show in my understanding of the Brown case, follow precisely the recommendations of the conference of Chief Justices with respect to such matters in the use of federal habeas corpus. 
    So that when Brown's case was in the Federal District Court of the Northern District of Indiana, the question arose as to whether or not his constitutional rights have been denied. 
    We -- I think he filed on July 19th, 1961. 
    We were assigned to represent him on July 20th, 1961 and in the interval between the 20th and the 26th, when the order of the District Court was entered, two hearings were held, one, the original hearing and then at the request of the State of Indiana, another hearing. 
    Now the Federal District Judge, having heard the case, wrote an opinion which is a part of the transcript, finding that Brown had been denied his constitutional rights. 
    And the Federal District Judge, following the recommendations and rules of this Court, as established in an earlier Indiana case by chance, granted the State of Indiana time in which to correct the defect with respect to the constitutional rights of George Robert Brown.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="368.672" stopTime="371.723">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You're talking about Irvin against Dowd?
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="371.723" stopTime="437.612">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    No, Your Honor, it was Cook against Dowd, another similar case in which this Court -- Cook's papers were destroyed each time that he prepared them and they were never sent up to the Court. 
    And when the Court decided that his rights have been taken away from him, this Court directed the Federal District Court from the Northern District of Indiana, South Bend Division, another judge city, to give the State of Indiana some time in which to permit him to have his appeal rather than to release him at once, so that the Federal District Court below in the Brown case followed very meticulously this rule, granted 90 days to the State of Indiana to attempt to correct this constitutional defect, the deprivation of the constitutional rights of George Robert Brown. 
    I must also call the Court's attention that in the order, the court below indicated that additional time would be granted if desired by the State of Indiana. 
    Thus --

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    No, sir. 
    No, I am trying to indicate that in every respect of the -- in the case of George Robert Brown, all that it can possibly be done with respect to the relationship of this Court and the state judiciaries -- the state judiciary of Indiana has been done.

    Mr. Nathan Levy

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    No, Your Honor, we did not. 
    As a matter of fact, to be fully frank, we felt at the time that we were assigned and having examined what record we could that the -- that the denial of what we argued then was equal protection of the law whether it is equal protection or due process is a different question, was so startling an error and so complete the deprivation of the rights of this man as measured by the Griffin case and the ones following that there was little need to go into any other of the questions raised.

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Well, it is our feeling that this constitutional right follows him both in the trial stage and the direct appeal and in any post convictional appeal.

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Mr. Justice White, we -- we thought of arguing the question of lack of counsel and in our brief in the Court of Appeals, we mentioned the point, but we did not argue it in our oral argument there. 
    The problem of arguing counsel in our case is extremely peculiar. 
    What good would counsel do him without the transcript? 
    The transcript is the key to the appeal.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="735.979" stopTime="742.573">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, there's a -- in the previous argument, you noticed that if you have a lawyer, it would be a substitute for a transcript.

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Not in Indiana, not in the face of the -- of the clear cut statement of rule in the McCrary as repeated in Willoughby. 
    There is -- we actually felt that we should argue the question of counsel particularly when this case was set on the calendar following the other three.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="761.254" stopTime="775.221">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if there was only -- if there was only a federal ground alleged in the petition, you really would have no particular exception of this whole procedure, would you, because you could go right on the federal habeas after the trial?

    Mr. Nathan Levy

    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's right, but isn't -- isn't that the end of it then? 
    Doesn't the State admit then that state remedies are exhausted and you could go right into federal habeas?

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    [Inaudible] that the State said in its letter to your client, the Public Defender said that he'd taken the matter up with the Attorney General and the Attorney General will concede that you've exhausted your state remedies.

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    That is correct, but nevertheless in each of the instances, the convicted criminal appearing pro se went through the effort in the trial court which denied the petition for writ of error coram nobis to get counsel and transcript upon the -- upon refusal attempted by writ of mandate in the Supreme Court to get counsel and transcript by mandate to that court. 
    I do not believe that those can be classified as State remedies available.

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Well, I can -- I will address myself to that right now because this is the situation as we have it. 
    We have sort of three categories of people. 
    We have non-indigents who can afford their transcripts. 
    We have indigents who receive the assistance of the Public Defender which means representation and transcript. 
    And then we have the category into which George Robert Brown falls, an indigent convicted prisoner whom the Public Defender refuses to represent and who therefore cannot have his transcript, and therefore cannot have any kind of review.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1324.392" stopTime="1385.865">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, Mr. Levy, assume this case, assume that as here, there was a trial and a conviction with the defendant represented by a lawyer and there was an appeal with the appellant represented by a lawyer and the conviction was affirmed. 
    The petition for certiorari to this Court had been denied and then a coram nobis procedure was initiated in which the identical ground, the identical grounds were asserted as had been asserted originally on the appeal and this was made clear. 
    Now do you think that the State of Indiana is constitutionally required to furnish at its expense a process of another appeal on the identical grounds under which had already been decided? 
    In other words, I'm just testing as to whether or not there might not be some relevance as to what was alleged in this coram nobis.
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="1385.865" stopTime="1420.942">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Your Honor, it makes the test the most difficult single kind of case. 
    May I respond to that by saying this? 
    Indiana tests this kind of a problem with respect to the non-indigent prisoner by having his transcript go into the Supreme Court and having the Supreme Court of Indiana say, “You are simply re-alleging the very same things that we have examined before and there's nothing new in it,” we deny this appeal. 
    Now the --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1420.942" stopTime="1432.820">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So this means that a rich man who wants to do it has a constitutional right to pour his money down a sewer, but the question is whether an indigent has the right to compel the State to pour its money down a sewer?
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="1432.820" stopTime="1516.471">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    The indigent certainly has no right to compel the State to pour its money down the sewer, but the State, as a matter of equal protection of the laws or due process which are -- however you wish to think about it that the cases say equal protection of the law, certainly does not have the right to say, and this is in response to your question, sir, and the question of Mr. Justice Goldberg as well. 
    Here is a lawyer available to you, our indigent friend, who's called the Public Defender, you go to him. 
    The Public Defender sees this man, listens to his tale, examines what he can of the record and of his own notes in this instance of what occurred in the Court and says to him, “There is no merit in your case.” 
    Now the State of Indiana has sent the prisoner to the Public Defender as lawyer and then by interpretation and rule of law, the man who has visited the Public Defender as lawyer suddenly finds out this was the judge, this was the man who decided this case. 
    He went to him for assistance as a lawyer and that man, by the interpretation of the laws of Indiana, is given the power, the equivalent power of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1516.471" stopTime="1553.518">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Suppose that Indiana in a case (Inaudible) in forma pauperis appeal have said -- had established a Commission of the Board of three judges or quasi judges and then provided that any indigent who wanted to appeal should submit his points to this Board and its determination was to be final as to whether he had a frivolous or non-frivolous appeal and the determination of the Board was un-reviewable, would that be unconstitutional?
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="1553.518" stopTime="1560.157">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, I -- I can only speculate in this way. 
    To me, it would seem to be unconstitutional.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1560.157" stopTime="1574.466">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What you're arguing in effect is that an indigent as a matter of right, in all circumstances he's got a right to get a record, get a transcript to find out whether he's got any asset -- to any legitimate points of appeal.
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="1574.466" stopTime="1626.953">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    In -- earlier, in one of the cases that you Your Honor asked, a similar question. 
    Under the peculiar situation in Indiana, he has an absolute right to get a transcript because that's jurisdictional to anything that he gets. 
    I do not believe that the language of Griffin or the succeeding cases which say that a State is free to workout other methods is meaningless language. 
    The State of Indiana maybe able to workout other methods so that instead of the formal document called a complete transcript, what Your Honor referred to as a bystander's transcript, something of that kind could be used, but where the State itself says, “You must either have this document or we have no jurisdiction,” how else can the indigent react? 
    How else can the Constitution protect the indigent? 
    There must be --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1626.953" stopTime="1633.543">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    All the State has said you have that at public expense if you showed you've got a non-frivolous appeal?
speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="1633.543" stopTime="1717.290">
    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Well, you -- the State has established a Public Defender and this, I think is an answer now to questions asked by a number of the members of the Court, has established a Public Defender. 
    He is a lawyer. 
    He acts as lawyer to the indigent. 
    With respect to the questions of lack of merit in the appeal of a non -- of an indigent person, his judgment is accepted as infallible. 
    That ends the rights of the non-indigent -- of the indigent person in Indiana. 
    Well, this is quite of a responsibility for a lawyer. 
    This is outside the province of a lawyer and there can be differences of opinion among lawyers. 
    As Mr. Justice Stewart indicated in an earlier case, the non-indigent might try a thousand different ways until he found one who believed he had a point by which he could appeal. 
    Now, let us look at the Public Defender the other way. 
    The Public Defender in none -- in cases in which he finds a lack of merit has the final word, but when he thinks there is merit, the State of Indiana itself does not give him the final word. 
    When he finds there is merit, he becomes just another lawyer like the rest of us who provides the transcript and takes that question up to the Supreme Court of Indiana.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Now what you're arguing in effect is, if I'm wrong I wish you'd tell me, that in a case where the State conditions a right of appeal upon a furnishing of a transcript to the record, an indigent in all circumstances is entitled to get a copy of the record.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What you are saying now is as I understand it, that they have turned over the responsibility to determine whether a man has points that are not frivolous to a Public Defender, not the Supreme Court and that the people who are able to go to the Supreme Court and get their records don't have to depend on the final decision of the Public Defender but can go to the Supreme Court itself.

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Now, I would like to indicate just one more thing. 
    The defect in the State of Indiana, the crux of the problem is this transcript. 
    We wanted to argue the counsel question. 
    I would hate to have to be without counsel on appeal in Indiana, as with all of the -- all of the words that the Court has heard concerning counsel at the trial level and believing them all, and coming from the State which branches attorneys at the trial level, if I were accused of crime and were not a lawyer but could remember what I'd known as being a lawyer and had to choose in Indiana between having counsel at the trial or counsel for an appeal, I would choose to have counsel on the appeal.

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Well, that is correct but the odds it seems to me that chances are greater in Indiana, that you would need the assistance of the attorney on -- at the appeal level than you would at the trial level. 
    And in this case, we have a Writ Department at the prison that turns out these papers and if you examine the transcript, you have seen some of the work that they do, but there are policies in some prisons that do not permit this. 
    There are prisons where the prisoners have a higher degree of illiteracy, less sophistication and if this kind of a situation can exist in the State of Indiana, the -- the equivalent in other states is at least as great and possibly worst.

    We are concerned about that and I am sure, as has been indicated in arguments on the other cases, with the improper withholding of constitutional rights and in the doing of that, improperly depriving a person of life and liberty. 
    He has -- he has been a resident of death row for a long time. 
    And in every respect, the right of the State, the opportunity for the State to give him this full review has been protected and held out and offered.

    Mr. Nathan Levy 
    Well, the -- the State of Indiana -- let me start out by saying -- by quoting Lord Seldon's general approach to the problem. 
    Lord Seldon said, “With the writ of habeas corpus, we deliberately take a social risk that there will be a few extra slashed throats”, and he used those words. 
    This is not a proceeding to measure the worth of George Robert Brown. 
    This is a proceeding to measure the worth of a constitutional protection. 
    The State of Indiana has held him in prison after having had full opportunity to offer him what the justices now indicate, and once again would be indicated to Indiana. 
    And one of the reasons that I started to describe the procedure with respect to the George Robert Brown case so carefully was that we -- that the federal courts in this instance have the final responsibility with respect to the constitutional question under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And the federal courts in this instance have followed out every possible suggestion with respect to the maintenance of good relations with the state judicial system. 
    The Court followed the recommendations of the conference of Chief Justices. 
    The lower court did precisely what is now suggested shall be done. 
    Now if the constitutional right has a real value despite the danger to the -- to individuals in our society, how long they may had -- be withheld.

    And the McCrary case says that in just so many words, that transcript is jurisdictional.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would just like to respond shortly to a few of the questions that arose during the argument of respondent's counsel. 
    First of all, an answer to a question from Mr. Justice Stewart, I think in fairness, we should state that it is not an absolute right in Indiana to be provided counsel at a coram nobis proceeding. 
    As a matter of policy, the Public Defender does represent the prisoners in the capital case always, but they must --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2927.614" stopTime="2928.481">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Did so in this case?
speaker="william_ruckelshaus" startTime="2928.481" stopTime="2931.556">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    -- and he did so in this case, but they must ask him if they want his --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2931.556" stopTime="2931.945">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I see.
speaker="william_ruckelshaus" startTime="2931.945" stopTime="2935.394">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    -- representation and often he does not represent.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2935.394" stopTime="2990.784">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    In that connection, on page 21 of your brief, you cite the McCrary case, the Willoughby case, and the -- and this case on the petition for a mandate. 
    The (Inaudible) -- to review the decision of the Public Defender not to proceed and you cite those cases from the point that the decision of the Public Defender not to proceed, or in other words, his decision at the appeal would be -- present frivolous matter is reviewable. 
    And my question is, reading those three decisions indicates that technically your statement is correct but actually the Supreme Court of Indiana affords its own relief, does it?

    -- grant a review.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3016.193" stopTime="3029.032">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    -- those opinions, the opinions read as if the discretion of the Public Defender is non-reviewable actually, I mean they entertain the petition; they write an opinion and say petition denied.
speaker="william_ruckelshaus" startTime="3029.032" stopTime="3122.487">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    As I understand these decisions, there has never been a question except implicitly in saying that they should be provided with other counsel. 
    There has never been stated in the petition that the Public Defender did abuse its discretion or there was a dereliction of his duty. 
    What the position of the Supreme Court of Indiana would be if there were such an allegation made, I can't say. 
    In answer to Mr. Justice White's question as to whether the same grounds that have been raised in the coram nobis petition could be raised in the habeas corpus petition. 
    I would state that the record on page 13 shows, in his petition for habeas corpus, just what was alleged in the coram nobis proceeding. 
    It said that that were later or thereafter on May 10th, 1965 in the Lake Criminal Court have verified petition for writ of error coram nobis wherein he presented the questions noted as one and two, that's in paragraph F on page 13, and one are -- And two in the Court's order is cited on page 12 on the record, show that he was -- well, what he alleged was that he had inadequate representation by counsel and that the confession was coerced. 
    Now both of those are federal grounds which he could raise in the habeas corpus petition. 
    That same argument was made by the State of Iowa in Smith against Bennett and this Court dismissed this argument by saying --

speaker="william_ruckelshaus" startTime="3317.918" stopTime="3348.458">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    That's precisely our position, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    That is an answer to your question why they didn't' consider this. 
    We requested Judge Grant and the court below to consider these questions so that we would have the whole thing and his position, as I understood it, was that you don't reach these questions because as a matter of fact, Indiana under the Equal Protection Clause must give this man an appeal from his denial of writ of error coram nobis and therefore Indiana hasn't exhausted its state remedy, and that you don't reach these other grounds.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3348.458" stopTime="3352.971">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I take it whether there has been exhaustion as a federal question (Inaudible).
speaker="william_ruckelshaus" startTime="3352.971" stopTime="3360.365">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    This was his determination that it had -- just in --

speaker="william_ruckelshaus" startTime="3377.058" stopTime="3473.146">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, this could not be determined on appeal without transcript, that's correct because it's a question of the sufficiency of the evidence and obviously, they would need a transcript. 
    However, I would submit that in the very nature of these coram nobis proceeding, it's not such a difficult thing as it is in a regular criminal conviction for an attorney to say there's no merit on appeal. 
    The burden of proof is on the petitioner, in this case Brown. 
    The hearing has had before a judge. 
    There were actually few points brought up in this particular proceeding and it's in the very nature of these proceedings they're using are brought on one or two points and that it's not impossible for an attorney to look at the question and say, “Well, it's just a question of fact and there's no chance for us to overturn it and therefore I won't appeal it.” 
    Just to make once again, it's clear as I can the position of the State in this proceeding. 
    Our position is that the Public Defender's office as it presently functions in Indiana, does not operate to deny an indigent due process of law or equal protection of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We went into the discussion yesterday of the show-cause order just to buttress the idea that the screening process that has been set up by Indiana does not make this denial of his transcript fall within the proscription of the Equal Protection or the Due Process Clause.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But do you think your case would be stronger or weaker, have any effect on it at all if the statute had provided that the Court should make its own investigation to determine whether there was the ground for frivolous and the action has been taken under that rather than leaving that power to the Public Defender?
speaker="william_ruckelshaus" startTime="3500.013" stopTime="3530.494">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Your Honor, under the decisions of this Court, certainly in copies that would probably be more amenable to this Court, but I would submit that the process of Indiana has devised in these post conviction writs is a -- as reasonable a process and provides as adequate a substitute for appeal as would the Supreme Court of Indiana reviewing these petitions themselves or reviewing the request of the indigents to appeal themselves.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would you think that your situation in the statute would be any different if the statute has provided that in all cases there is an appeal whether by person who's able to buy transcripts or not, the Public Defender could pass on the -- whether the grounds were frivolous, and let him dispose of it rather the Supreme Court?

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    This would be the position of the courts below, Mr. Justice Black, but it seems to me that if you are saying the State has a rational policy against frivolous appeals taken at the State's expense that this would only apply to screening those appeals taken from indigents because those are the ones that are taken at State's expense and not the screening of appeals for non-indigents.
