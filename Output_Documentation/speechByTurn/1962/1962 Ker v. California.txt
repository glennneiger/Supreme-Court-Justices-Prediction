    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court and Counsel. 
    This case is on certiorari to the District Court of Appeal for California. 
    The petitioners were convicted of possession of narcotics. 
    The issue before this Court is whether the entry into the petitioners' apartment, their home, and the subsequent seizure of the narcotics, the evidence upon which they were convicted, over their objection constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of their constitutional rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.

    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    There is a question of the initial arrest. 
    There's a conflict in the inferences to be drawn from the evidence on that point, most certainly. 
    I think it's obvious from the record that the purpose of the entry of the police officers into the petitioner's home was for the purpose of searching the home in an attempt to find the narcotics they were looking for. 
    The respondents have raised --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="robert_w_stanley" startTime="104.344" stopTime="385.045">
    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    That's correct. 
    At the time that the case was tried -- the reason this question arises, at the time the case was tried, I don't think there was any question about the fact that the theory of the prosecution was at the entry into the petitioners' home was for the purpose of searching. 
    Nothing, unfortunately, was asked of the police offers directly what their motive is and what their purpose was of going into the home, but the only logical inference that could -- inferences that can be drawn from their conduct is that they went into the home for the purpose of searching. 
    And, we do have the benefit of the questions of the prosecutor at the time of the trial. 
    For example, the question that was asked of the arresting officer was, “Tell us in sequence and detail what happened after you entered the home?” 
    He said that they've got the key to the door from the manager of the apartment. 
    This took 15 to 20 minutes because the manager apparently was concerned and wanted to call his lawyer. 
    They told the manager that they were going into the apartment because they thought that there was some narcotics in the apartment and they wanted the key so that they wouldn't have to break the door down. 
    Then after going into the home, after entering surreptitiously without any announcement of their arrival, the petitioner, George Ker, was sitting on the couch and he stood up. 
    Now, the first thing that they said to him I think is also indicative in sequence and detail, exactly as the thing arose, of what their intention was. 
    They displayed their identification to him and said, “We're conducting a narcotics investigation. 
    We're Sheriff's Narcotics officers and we're conducting a narcotics investigation.” 
    Well, anyone who practices criminal law in the Los Angeles County, I'm sure knows what a narcotics investigation was, and I'll get into this a little bit later because I think one of the arresting officers indicated to us by his testimony what he considered an investigation was. 
    Right at that time, the petitioner, Diane Ker, the wife, walked from the kitchen and he had displayed his identification to her and said the same thing. 
    Then, he walked over to the kitchen. 
    Now, we don't know how far he walked. 
    We do know from his testimony -- from the officer's testimony that it was a large living room. 
    He walked over to the kitchen and, standing in the doorway, he was able to observe a bricklike brown package sitting on some small scales. 
    Observing this, he called both of the petitioners into the kitchen together with the other arresting officer, and -- who had come into the apartment at the same time, and he questioned them about it and he asked him if it was theirs. 
    He asked him first what it was and they answered they didn't know, then he said, “Well, it appears to me to be marijuana. 
    Is it yours?” 
    There was no answer from either one of the petitioners. 
    Now, the question that was next asked of him at one point -- this testimony incidentally was gone over several times because of the procedure under a section of the California Code that allows this question to be raised out of the presence of the jury. 
    The question was asked at one time, “And what did you then do?” 
    And the answer was, “I then placed the defendants under arrest for suspicion of violation of the State Narcotics Act.” 
    At another place, the question was asked, “In seeing that marijuana, did you place them under arrest?” 
    And the answer was, “Yes.” 
    A subsequent search was then conducted of other parts of the home and other marijuana was found.The next day, the officers -- one of the officers went to a car which was owned by one of the petitioners and made a search of that and found some additional marijuana.

    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    There's no evidence that they did. 
    The testimony was that the brick package of marijuana had a small rip in it and the inference, apparently, is that the officer was able to see the green leafy substance because he said that it -- he identified it as green leafy substance and he said that he'd seen it before and it appeared to be marijuana. 
    Where he was at the time that he did this, we don't know, at least we don't know from the record.

speaker="robert_w_stanley" startTime="438.506" stopTime="495.586">
    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    The information was for possession of marijuana. 
    I think that these facts, together with what happened immediately preceding the arrest and also what happened the day before, indicate that the purpose of going into the apartment was to conduct a narcotics investigation. 
    They didn't know that there was any narcotics in there and they didn't have a reasonable suspicion sufficient, I believe, for obtaining a search warrant to search the home on the grounds that there -- that narcotics would be found within the home. 
    In fact, one of the officers stated that they had no direct information that the apartment contained any narcotics. 
    What did happen, however --

    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    It's my position, Mr. Justice White, that our case would not be essentially different. 
    I feel that under the decisions of this Court and based upon reason that despite the fact that officers have probable cause to search a dwelling, that there should still be the necessity obtaining -- of obtaining a search warrant in the absence of some dire necessity.

speaker="robert_w_stanley" startTime="565.370" stopTime="695.811">
    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    That's correct. 
    Thats correct. 
    Our case is that the purpose of the entry into this apartment was an entry for the purpose of searching, although the officers phrased it in terms of conducting a narcotic investigation. 
    They let us know what an investigation meant. 
    In fact, on page 111 of the record, there's this language. 
    Did you tell Diane Ker, “Now, look at this”, while you were uncovering something or, “I want you to watch this?” 
    Answer: “I made the statements to both defendants throughout the investigation.” 
    Question: “What did you tell them?” 
    “My exact words, I do not recall.” 
    “Generally, what do you say?” 
    Answer: “Watch us while we're looking at this particular spot and so forth. 
    We called their attention to it and if they don't look in our direction when we are checking an article, we reiterate the statement and do not continue the searching until they are watching what we are doing.” 
    Searching in an investigation is synonymous with police officers. 
    What other type of an investigation would they be conducting? 
    This is the most common thing that a lawyer practicing criminal law in the Los Angeles area finds. 
    Officers will come up to a person and generally a person who is a known narcotic user, who -- or who they've just seen talking to a known narcotic user and say, “We're conducting a narcotic investigation.” 
    The next step that usually happens is that they attempt to obtain the person's consent. 
    And -- well, that's not involved here because the officer at the same time walked over to the kitchen and saw the contraband. 
    It's significant in determining what the officer's state of mind was and what they intended to do when they went into the apartment. 
    Also, their language to the landlord, they didn't say, “We're going in to arrest somebody”, or “You have a man there who we suspect of having bought some marijuana, who has some marijuana.” 
    They said, “We believe that there's marijuana in the apartment and we're going in.”

    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    I don't feel that that is constitutionally the significant factor, although I think it is has evidentiary value and I think that inferences can be drawn from it. 
    Of course, at the far ends of the spectrum, we have on one case where a police officer may make an arrest two or three hours after the search and it's hardly -- that's certainly some evidence that the search was not incident to the arrest. 
    On the other hand, we may have evidence that even though the arrest and the search took place practically at the same time, that the purpose of the arrest was only a pretext for the search, or else that the real purpose, especially where a dwelling is concerned, of going into it was to search. 
    And what we're really concerned with is whether what was in the minds of the police officers at the time they went in. 
    This case is similar I think, to the case of United States versus Johnson where the officers smell some opium, what they thought was opium, burning inside of the home. 
    And when they op -- when the door was opened for them, they said, “Consider yourself under arrest. 
    We're going to search.” 
    This Court held that the real purpose of going into the apartment was to search and that the arrest was only a pretext for the search, and I think we have a similar situation in this case. 
    Now, with respect to the events that happened before the entry into the apartment, the -- this man, Murphy, apparently had been known to the officers for some time, at least to one of the officers. 
    And Officer Berman, who was one of the arresting officers, had received information over a period of time from anonymous sources or from sources that he did not disclose, claimed a privilege from disclosing them, concerning Murphy in which Ker's name had come up. 
    And the information was that Ker, the petitioner, was dealing in marijuana and he had probably got the marijuana from Murphy. 
    Another officer had made a buy from Murphy the day before the -- these events in this case took place. 
    The following day, the day that these events took place, these officers were tailing Murphy. 
    They were following him and they lost track of him, so they went up to the -- to a sparsely populated place in Los Angeles on Fairfax Avenue near Slauson and about the same place that they had been the night before. 
    They went up to the top of the hill there so that they could see for some distance in both directions and they noticed, when they went up there, the car that the petitioner was sitting in, it wasn't in the same side of the street as the -- that the officer had purchased the marijuana the night before was sitting out. 
    It was on the south side of the street. 
    They weren't particularly interested in Ker. 
    They did note, though, that he was sitting there and that there weren't any other cars with -- there were other cars, but none within 100ft, I think. 
    So, they eventually saw Murphy drive by and when he drove by, they attempted to tail him again. 
    He turned up into the oil fields where he had gone the preceding day, turned his lights off, and they lost track of him. 
    They went back and parked again and 12 minutes later, approximately, they saw him coming out from the oil fields and he parked behind the petitioner's automobile. 
    They saw him get out of the automobile and walked up to the side of Ker's car. 
    Now, there's -- of course, there's some conflict even before this Court, on that issue of how far away they were and what they were able to see. 
    They were watching through a good pair of binoculars. 
    They were probably within 500 to 1000 feet. 
    That seems to be the predominating testimony, although one officer said it was farther. 
    And, I think we can infer from the evidence that they were very interested in Murphy and in what he was going to do. 
    In the -- at the very beginning of the trial, one of the arresting officers said that it was either light or it was extremely well-lit. 
    He could see very well and, as soon as the -- they were able incidentally to identify Ker in Court from their observations at a distance, a brick of marijuana is, according to the evidence, is about the size of a brick and shape of a brick. 
    And as soon as they saw Murphy drive by, they immediately followed him. 
    They immediately pulled up and drove past, and when they drove past, they saw Mr. Ker sitting in the automobile and he was half-facing Murphy. 
    He was standing on the street talking with him. 
    And they pulled up towards Slauson, about the same distance away as they had been before, and continued to observe them all this time. 
    The period of time that elapsed during this observation was approximately two minutes. 
    Now, a question was asked a number of times, “Did you see anything passed or did you see anything in his hand?” 
    And the answer was, “No, I didn't.” 
    It's true and it was pointed out by respondent at one point. 
    The question was asked, “Could you see anything in his hand?” 
    And the answer was, “I didn't see anything in his hand.” 
    And then, after it was repeated, “Well, could you?” 
    And the answer was, “Well, I don't believe I would be able to see anything in his hand if he had it”, paraphrasing it, the question, “Why not?” 
    And the answer, “Well, because of the distance and the fact that it wasn't extremely light.” 
    The fact remains that nothing was seen to pass at that time. 
    Now, I think the subsequent conduct of the officers after that event took place can illustrate to us that the -- that they didn't believe that he had any contraband in his possession at that time or if he did have any contraband, if they thought he did, they weren't interested at that time in arresting him. 
    They had pull past where the -- where Mr. Murphy was talking with Ker and parked in a parking lot about the same distance away. 
    This was towards Slauson. 
    Now, as soon as the conversation ended, they appeared to be talking, the two of them. 
    Ker drove away. 
    He drove towards Slauson. 
    He went right past where the officers were, and their testimony was that they followed him. 
    There was nothing said that they were pursuing him or attempting to catch him and in fact, they followed him quite a distance. 
    He turned left on Slauson and went all the way down to La Brea which is a considerable distance. 
    He turned left on La Brea and after going approximately a block, he made a U-turn and came back on La Brea. 
    They said that they lost him at that time. 
    Now, I'm sure that if these officers were interested at that time in arresting this man, that was their purpose, it would've been an easy matter to arrest him. 
    He drove right past them. 
    In fact, the officer -- one of the officers states in another context what he meant by “following.” 
    The night before, they were following Murphy and they lost him because he had made a turn also. 
    So, the question was asked, “Well, were you pursuing him?” 
    And he said, “No, we were following him”, to that effect, for the purpose of tailing him. 
    And, I'm sure that that's what they were doing with Ker also. 
    Now, these officers, at that time, had never seen Ker before. 
    They didn't know anything about him. 
    All they know is that he had talked with the man that had made a sale of marijuana and that they knew something about.

    He stated that he had received information from Mr. Black that -- about Ker's narcotic activities. 
    So, the officers who were tailing Ker didn't know anything about him except the fact that he had talked with Murphy. 
    Then, after losing him, they ran a Department of Motor Vehicle check and found out what his name was and what the address that the automobile was registered to was and went back and saw Deputy Berman who had this previous information about the petitioner. 
    And, learning about the previous information with all the information they have, they then went out to his home.

    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    I'm quite sure that he didn't. 
    The information at any rate was exchanged after the officers lost sight of the Ker vehicle and they went out to the home of the Kers and one officer went around underneath the window because -- for the purpose of catching something that would be thrown out since he said that it was his experience that often times, when they enter apartments that the occupants will attempt to dispose of the narcotics and on the occasions that the officer -- these officers had gone into apartments, they did it surreptitiously. 
    That was their reason. 
    Another officer was sent to determine if somebody was home and Mr. Warthen, the man who actually saw the narcotics in the kitchen, went around and checked the automobile and found that the automobile was home and it was at that time that they went to the apartment manager and said they were going in and wanted the keys so they wouldn't have to break his door down. 
    The -- I think that -- I think one of the crucial things here, and I said this before, is the purpose of the officers in going into the home. 
    I think it can be -- to dispose of this problem, I think that it can be -- I think it's obvious from all of the evidence that the purpose that they had when they went into the door was to see if there was anything there. 
    We found, for the first time before this Court, that an additional item of testimony that of the defendant below. 
    The petitioner here was introduced in the respondent's brief, and that is that George Ker said that when the officers came in, they immediately handcuffed him and placed him under arrest. 
    One of them went into the kitchen and the other one went into the bedroom. 
    This, of course, is a variance with the statements of all of the officers and I think that when we have evidence like that from a person whose home has been invaded that we have to take that in a larger sense, he wasn't a professional. 
    He didn't know what was going to happen. 
    And the larger sense was that he recalled the rather traumatic experience of someone coming and walking right into his home. 
    He recalled being handcuffed and taken into the kitchen and that what he purported to give was a summary of the transaction, that he wasn't aware of the problems that we have here in the sequence of events and their importance upon a determination of whether the entry was to search or to arrest. 
    Now, to answer Mr. Justice White's question now, I think would be appropriate, and that is that there is a distinction between an entry into a home to arrest and one to search. 
    And I think that that distinction has become apparent since the case of Mapp versus Ohio in state court proceedings. 
    In one instance, we have a direct constitutional question involved under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    In the other, we have a constitutional question ins -- in what I consider to be a collateral sense because a search incident lawful arrest would depend, first, upon the validity of the arrest which is something that is not a constitutional question in the broad sense and secondly, upon the reasonableness of the search afterwards that -- and whether it's really incident to the arrest. 
    I think in both of these cases that the testimony here demonstrates that the search was unreasonable. 
    First, that it cannot be sustained as a search incident to an arrest because the primary purpose was to search. 
    And (Voice Overlap)

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You're arguing this case, at least as I understand you correctly, as if it were a federal case. 
    Is it your view that we're to judge this search and seizure in terms of federal standards?
speaker="robert_w_stanley" startTime="2031.340" stopTime="2154.725">
    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    I feel that there are minimum constitutional rights that a person now has from action by state officer. 
    And insofar as the invasion of a person's home is concerned, that the minimum right that a citizen is entitled to coincides with this Court's decision in federal cases involving the entry into a home. 
    In other cases, it may vary but, in the case that we have before us I think that -- I think they're the same. 
    I feel that the entry into a person's home is something different from other types of searches and other types of arrest. 
    And, I feel that the minimum protection a person should have before an entry is made into his home is that the facts possessed by the police should be presented to a neutral magistrate for a determination of whether or not probable cause exists because I think it's been demonstrated and I feel that this Court has demonstrated in its decisions that police officers in a zealous pursuit of law enforcement sometimes ignore the rights of individuals and that their actions are unreasonable. 
    And that -- when we present this to a magistrate afterwards, after the damage has been done, and after the -- with the benefit of hindsight and undoubtedly, some weight being given to the fact that narcotics or other contraband was actually found, that there's no real protection at all. 
    And this is -- without even discussing the cases where narcotic investigations are made, that is, searches a person's homes where they find nothing. 
    And this is something that one who practices criminal law cannot ignore because they see it all the time.

    But I think that so far as the constitutional question that's involved here is that, first, the officers, if they have probable cause, must show that -- what they have to a neutral magistrate before the entry into a person's home. 
    Now, I feel also -- I don't mean to limit consideration of this case to that point because I feel that, even with the limiting of hindsight looking at this problem that there wasn't sufficient probable cause in the minds of the officers to warrant a search of the petitioner's house, nor was there sufficient probable cause to arrest these people.

speaker="robert_w_stanley" startTime="2292.660" stopTime="2379.339">
    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    There are numerous California cases involving the search of a home without warrant for -- either for arrest or for a search. 
    And the California cases seems to be that it seemed to hold that even where the search of the dwelling is made some time after the -- or rather, the arrest was made some time after the search and it can still be sustained as a search incident to an arrest. 
    And I think the interesting thing about the California cases is that there is no case to my knowledge which actually draws the constitutional distinction between an arrest and a search, that is, a search incident to an arrest and just plain search. 
    Fortunately, the federal cases that have taken up this problem mainly concerns searches of unoccupied places as without any prior knowledge of who might be in the house. 
    Practically all of the California cases involving the search of dwellings are cases which -- in which the police officers have prior information concerning the persons who were within the dwellings as opposed to just information of what might be contained there.

    It's quite common also to find arrest made in Los Angeles similar to the Agnello decision in this case or the Chapman case where an arrest is made and then information is received about where narcotics came from and then the police would go over to that location and then search that place. 
    Now, this is quite common also and sustained as a search incident to a lawful arrest.

    And as a matter of fact our -- both of our briefs was in -- that is the Attorney General's brief, as well as the petitioner's brief, was in before Mapp versus Ohio came in.

    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    Yes, and we got permission to file supplemental briefs on that point and in our and then in the Attorney General's supplemental brief this was discussed. 
    The Court disposed of the point by saying that it doesn't matter. 
    I think it can be taken two ways. 
    It doesn't matter because this was actually an arrest and a search incident to an arrest. 
    Or it doesn't matter because California is not bound under the decision of Mapp versus Ohio to follow the federal rule. 
    I feel that in either case the Second Appellate District Court was wrong and those are the grounds that I've just discussed. 
    Now, in the respondent's brief, their position appears to be that California has a peculiar narcotics problem and because of this peculiar narcotics problem should be left a greater latitude or degree of autonomy in deciding these questions. 
    And I feel that I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt there by saying that because I feel that what they're really saying is that this isn't a constitutional question that California should be left free to make up its own rules. 
    Well, I think California, as any other state should be left free to make up its own rules only if they do not violate the minimum standards of constitutional guarantees. 
    And, those minimum standards are prescribed, I feel, by the decisions in the federal cases. 
    It may be that this Court will, in time, make those decisions different and make the rules different. 
    But at the present time, I feel that California is bound by that. 
    Of course, they can provide higher standards, make it more difficult for police officers to break into a person's home and I feel that the course of history has been whenever we make it more difficult for police officers to accomplish a given end and with the object of protecting a person's rights, that it doesn't -- as contended by the respondent, it doesn't impair the administration of justice or police efficiency. 
    It makes them better and that substantially the position that we have in this case.

    Then the car, the next day -- well, I don't think that there's any question what the search of the car the next day was an unreasonable search, although, to the petitioners, it doesn't make too much difference because that's just additional marijuana. 
    They're going to -- so far as they're concerned, if they're going to go to jail for the marijuana in the kitchen, then it doesn't matter where other marijuana might have been found.

speaker="robert_w_stanley" startTime="3133.196" stopTime="3146.211">
    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    Yes, I feel that an arrest would've been illegal at that time because those officers didn't have any knowledge about Ker and the only thing that they had seen was that he met and appeared to have a conversation with Murphy.

speaker="robert_w_stanley" startTime="3157.955" stopTime="3239.323">
    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    I do. 
    I feel that even after they received the additional information that they still didn't have sufficient grounds to arrest him for possession of marijuana, and I think that that becomes even stronger and takes on a constitution -- more of a constitutional dimension when they go into his home for the purpose of finding out if he has the marijuana and if he does, to arrest him. 
    I don't feel that there would've been any arrest here if they didn't find the marijuana there. 
    There's nothing to indicate after he made the U-turn that he had seen them or that he was attempting to get away or he was going fast or trying to dispose of something. 
    I don't feel this is a hot pursuit type of case where they temporarily lose him and then later go into his home. 
    I think that what it is that they're surveying this man they don't know anything about because they'd seen him talk with Murphy. 
    Perhaps, at that time in their mind, they may have thought that he was Murphy's contact and then, after getting the subsequent in -- they don't know where he went, as a matter of fact, or that he went to his home and they had no information that narcotics were likely to be found in his home.

   Argument of Gordon Ringer

    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3518.715" stopTime="3520.842">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may now proceed.
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="3520.842" stopTime="3655.965">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Honorable Court. 
    Before proceeding any further with the argument for respondent in this case, I would wish, if I may, to delimit the issues perhaps a more restrictive manner than Mr. Stanley has delimited them. 
    But I do not believe that this Court has faced under Footnote 9 of the Mapp decision with any problem as to the reasonableness of the search of the bedroom in which a half-ounce of marijuana was obtained, the search of the kitchen cupboard which succeeded the arrest, and the subsequent search the following day of the car belonging to the petitioner, Diane Ker. 
    It has been the law of California since the inception of the Cahan decision. 
    The citation on that is the Kitchen's case in 46 Cal.2d. 
    All the cases incidentally which I will mention in argument are compendiously contained in our summary of the California cases at the close of our brief. 
    But to repeat, it has been the law of California since the Cahan decision that unless an objection is made at the trial to the introduction of evidence whose providence is contended to be illegal, such a point may not be asserted upon the appeal. 
    Turning to the record in this case, we concede for the purpose -- at least for the purpose of review by certiorari that objections were properly made for the purpose at least to preserving the point here as to the kilo-brick of marijuana in the kitchen. 
    That case -- that was litigated at the trial. 
    As to the question of the search of the bedroom, the search of the kitchen cupboard, and the car, it was specifically stated by Mr. (Inaudible) at the trial, page 68 of the record, there was no objection to the introduction in evidence of these matters. 
    There was no litigation as to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the search which produced these items and that question isn't properly here. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3655.965" stopTime="3661.730">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was the search of the bedroom on a different occasion than the -- than finding the brick?

    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    Yes, at the probable cause hearing. 
    There's no question that was litigated.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3674.157" stopTime="3686.138">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, every time they opened a drawer or go into another room after the first search has been litigated, must they object to every question along those lines?
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="3686.138" stopTime="3732.507">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    Oh, I see Your Honor's point. 
    But the point is, assuming that I will assume arguendo the correctness of my position up to this point, namely that the officers had probable cause for an arrest, namely that the entry of the apartment was legal. 
    If my position is sound on these points, the only conceivable objection which they could have to the introduction of this other contraband is that it was produced by a skirt -- by a search party which in scope, extent, an area was not justified by the fact that it was incident to an arrest based upon probable cause. 
    That raises other issues. 
    That's a question of scope under Harris, Rabinowitz, and the other cases which apply that rule.

    So we can see what the scope of the objection of the defendant was.
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="4442.233" stopTime="4856.532">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    All there is, Your Honor, that I find is a statement at the bottom of page 36 that the -- excuse me, I've gotten my page wrong. 
    I don't find any specific statement by defense counsel, Your Honor, except this intention to call the Informer Black to controvert the contention of the officers that Black had given information to the officers respecting this defendant and reverting now to the question of probable cause for an arrest. 
    I wish to mention first that it is not California's contention that California law in this case should be constain -- should be sustained merely because it is ours and because we love it. 
    Our contention is that, subsequent to the Mapp decision, California standards should be sustained by this Court if those standards are reasonable within the due process clause. 
    We certainly do not demand absolute carte blanche for absolute everything that conceivably come into the minds of the California legislature of the California Court. 
    It is our position that the arrest in this case of petitioner, George Ker, was a valid arrest based upon probable cause. 
    The standards in this case of probable cause being the same under California law as they are under federal law that the search of the apartment was based upon reason -- excuse me, that the search of the apartment was a reasonable search as an incident to the arrest and also, if I may add, the methods by which the officers gain entry into the apartment were not illegal. 
    Now, turning to the facts, I think that Mr. Stanley in his argument for petitioner has unnecessarily restricted the meaning of the information which the officers possessed at the time they entered the apartment for the purpose of making the arrest. 
    We can speculate what they might have done under other facts, under other circumstances. 
    The question is raised if the officers believed at the time they saw Ker and Murphy at this meet, a meet incidentally in the same spot where Cook and Terrhagen had actually consummated a transaction of narcotics the night before, the only distinction being that Cook and Terrhagen were on the east side of the street facing north and Ker and Murphy were on the west side of the Fairfax Street facing south. 
    Why didn't they arrest him at this time? 
    The officers -- Officer Warthen didn't know Ker, didn't know him personally. 
    Of course he got a look at him and he was able to identify him for the purposes of trial as a man whom he saw, but he didn't know George Ker. 
    The one who knew George Ker, who had seen his picture, and who received information that Ker was a purchaser of narcotics from Murphy was Officer Berman who didn't come into the picture with respect to this arrest until later. 
    In other words, the facts in this case are a block. 
    Having failed to follow -- to track Ker to his lair due to this illusive U-turn which he took losing the officers, the officers attempted to find out who he was. 
    They checked with the Department of Motor Vehicles and they learned that this automobile which they have witnessed Murphy approach and where Murphy and Ker have a conversation is an automobile registered to Ker and registered at a given address, 4801 Slauson, which is on Slauson and extremely near the intersection of Fairfax and Slauson, near where, the night before, there had actually been consummated a narcotics transaction and where, the same night, not half-an-hour previously, the officers had seen Ker and Murphy meet. 
    And prior to that, had seen and tracked Murphy to his lair in the oil fields where he arguably, the officers had reason to believe, kept his stash because that's where he went the night before when he transacted the narcotics sale with Cook and Terrhagen. 
    Realizing now who the car was registered to, having transmitted that information to Officer Berman within 15 to 30 minutes following this meeting between Ker and Murphy, the officers tell Berman, “We've checked the car out.” 
    The officers tell Berman what they had seen. 
    Berman tells him -- tells them what he knew. 
    Therefore, this -- what to the layman might appear to be an ambiguous meeting between a narcotics seller and another man but comes in the light of the officers' experience, these were experienced officers. 
    They are not neophytes. 
    Berman had 3 years experience and had participated in 300 arrests, I believe. 
    Warthen, I believe, 4 years as a narcotics officer, had participated in what he called quite a few hundred arrests. 
    These are experienced officers. 
    These facts previously known to them, this information, we submit, reasonably justified them as prudent and cautious men, there's no doubt that they were, at that time, in a belief that there had been an actual consummated narcotic transaction between Ker and Murphy at that night. 
    And bear in mind, the information which the -- all the officers possessed at the time they entered that apartment, at the time rather that they approached the apartment was not the information which Warthen alone and Markman alone had at the time of seeing the meet, they superimposed upon that the information from Berman. 
    We submit that, under California law, as well as under federal law, the officers were certainly warranted in entertaining a belief that Ker had committed that offense. 
    Now, turning to the entry of the apartment, Mr. Stanley has made the point in oral argument that Section 844 which is the California entry for purpose of arrest statute has been made a dead letter. 
    I believe this is an exaggeration. 
    Maddox in 46 Cal.2d is the leading case on this subject, as I believe it was Justice Brennan who mentioned during Mr. Stanley's argument. 
    There, of course, had been cases subsequent to Maddox. 
    But California exception to the entry for purpose of arrest statute which requires the officers to announce their authority and purpose before entering --

speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="4882.683" stopTime="4937.365">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    They're comparable to the federal execution of a search warrant statute. 
    We do in two sections what the federal statute more compendiously does in one. 
    Now, the California exception is as follows. 
    If the officers, as reasonable men again, entertain a belief that the arrest will be frustrated, if they complied with the statutory formalities, the officers are excused from compliance with the section. 
    Secondly, the second exception, if the officers as reasonable men, entertain an honest and reasonably based belief that if they comply with the formalities contraband evidence would be destroyed, they are likewise to be excused. 
    A more recent case than Maddox upon this point is the case of Hammond which is in 54 Cal.2d involving the same situation.

    Is it a common practice in California for officers to get a key and warrant (Inaudible)?

    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    Only if the facts come within the exception that there is (Inaudible) -- would have to be -- first of all, the arrest statute allows the breaking in, physical breaking in where there is authority and purpose announced by the officers. 
    The statutory exception allows them to bust in physically if the officers are excused under the judicial gloss placed on the statute. 
    The reason for getting a key rather than busting in is of course, prevent destruction of property, for one reason why they would enter, use a key rather than bursting in. 
    And also, because as Warthen testified in this case, bear in mind, Your Honor, Warthen is an experienced officer. 
    He's participated in 300 arrests or more. 
    Warthen testified at the bottom of 93 of the record. 
    He was asked by the prosecuting attorney about the surreptitious entry into the apartment and I'll quote it. 
    It's short but I think it's quite relevant. 
    “Why would you be very careful as a narcotics investigating officer?” 
    Here is this word “investigating.” 
    The word “investigating,” I may add, is given a kind of mystic significance by Mr. Stanley. 
    “Why would you be very careful as a narcotic investigating officer to be extremely quiet when you have a key in your hand entering a house in which you think there is a possibility of narcotics possession being committed?” 
    Answer: “Because on many, many occasions, persons who flush narcotics down toilets, pushed them down drains and sinks, and many other methods of getting rid of them prior to my entrance when I had made noises in the process of entering.”

    To some extent, yes. 
    But as Justice Treanor points out in the Maddox case, I may say, first, this is contraband to which the defendant has no -- which the defendant has no right to possess anyway. 
    I'm not saying he has no standing to complain of the search, but this is contraband and the California Health and Safety Code contains provision which I understand are similar to the provisions announced in Trupiano case. 
    It mentioned that we won't return the stuff to him, but the California statutes are 11653 to 11657 of the Health and Safety Code which is the provision of the code concerning narcotics. 
    Even if Mr. Ker will acquit, his stuff could not be returned. 
    I use “stuff” as a term of art, if you please, to refer to narcotics.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    One of the things that puzzles me about this is, as I understood the Maddox (Inaudible), the exception applied only when in the particular case, there were (Inaudible) circumstances which would justify the entry without the requirement of his purpose and identity. 
    Now here, this officer says that not that there were any special circumstances that -- to this entry which he thought justified getting a key and entering rather quiet, but rather that, because of his general experience when these things happen, I gather he follows this practice in all narcotics cases. 
    Now, do your Court sustain that in Trup -- that's not what Maddox say.

    And in those circumstances, that it would be proper for the officer, and he's unreasonable, to require him first to say what he was there for.
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="5295.972" stopTime="5296.614">

    This --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5296.614" stopTime="5337.876">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    When as in this case, he has legal grounds to believe that felony is being committed and hears retreating footsteps that concludes another peril would be increased. 
    That that felon would escape if he demanded entrance and had claimed his purpose is not unreasonable. 
    But, as I understand this, if that's what your Court to sustains, this officer could do this. 
    Get a key and enter the way he did without regard to whether there was special circumstance in this case indicating a reason for not first announcing purpose merely based on his general experience that this is what happens in narcotics cases.

    Well.
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="5385.666" stopTime="5558.792">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    But sir, the rhetorical question is this. 
    What would have happened, Your Honor, if the officers had knocked, said -- someone comes to the door. 
    The officers said, “We are Officers Markman and Berman of the Sherriff's Department. 
    We are here for a certain purpose.” 
    Now, if I may make this point, just as certain weapon are tools of the police for the war against crime, indoor plumbing consisting of the toilet, the drain, and the garbage disposal are weapons of the criminal. 
    Perhaps I am stating this more eloquently than it ought to be because it's a rather minimal subject for inflated eloquence, but it's true nevertheless, sir. 
    If the officers had not, mind you, you've got a -- you've got one man in his lair who's not a simple, happy partaker of the hobby, sir, but he is -- the officers have reason to believe, a cold and calculating seller of narcotics. 
    I'll leave the words “coldly calculating” out as they merely add color. 
    But, he's a se -- believed to be a retail seller of narcotics. 
    Had they knocked at that door and demanded entry, then the officers, I believe, had reason to believe, not only incidentally that Warthen testified, Markman was outside the window ready to catch the marijuana if it would come flying out the window. 
    The officers certainly, on the basis of their past experience and the reported cases sustained them, in the 100 instances, where they do? 
    At least knock on the door and this takes place in the belief that Ker, knowing Ker to be whom they had reason to believe, would've attempted to dispose and perhaps could've succeeded in disposing that marijuana. 
    Now, having entered the apartment, if the Court please, the question arises whether the kilo-brick of marijuana which was discovered, sir, in plain sight in the kitchen without the entry of a closed door into the kitchen from the living room, was the product of a search incident to a lawful arrest. 
    California found that it was and we respectfully submit that great weight should be given to this finding by the California Court. 
    Now, the actual arrest of petitioners, according to the testimony of the officers, occurred following to the finding of this brick of marijuana. 
    California's position on this subject has been rationalized by Justice Treanor of the California Supreme Court in the Simons case, in 45 Cal.2d, using reasoning which --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5558.792" stopTime="5560.306">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's -- was Simon?
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="5560.306" stopTime="5685.294">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    Simons. 
    I can give Your Honor the page citation if you would wish. 
    It's quoted at length in our brief. 
    This reasoning I believe is sound reasoning and I respectfully commended to the Court as being reasoning which, in support of the result which is fully consistent with standards of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, in Justice Treanor's reasoning, if I may paraphrase him, is as follows. 
    The officers, as I argue here and I'll apply the reasoning to the facts of this particular case to make it more compelling, if I'm able to make it compelling, the officers have probable cause to arrest Ker for possession of marijuana. 
    Under the federal cases and I take it, that Rabinowitz obtains as it is under the law of California, the officers have the right, as an incident to that arrest based upon probable cause to conduct a search not unreasonable in extent of the person and property of the offenders, the Kers, for the purpose of -- certainly at the very least, of discovering the contraband for whose possession they were arrested. 
    There is, therefore, a right, if you will, to invade the privacy of the defendants, the petitioners. 
    I can think of very few invasions of the right to privacy more catastrophic than an arrest and it is our position here that the arrest was valid as based on probable cause. 
    If there is probable cause to make the arrest, it is certainly no more a violation of the right to privacy or the constitutional rights of the accused for the search to precede rather than to follow the arrest, so long as independently of what has turned up in the search, the officers have probable cause for making the arrest.

    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    That's my case. 
    Now, before leaving, I do wish to mention the problem of the search warrant which has been raised, and fairly raised, by Mr. Stanley. 
    And I would not seek to conclude my argument by failing to mention the subject. 
    As has been said before, the problem whether officers are required to obtain a search warrant where there is probable cause for an arrest is one which has produced manifest divisions of opinion among justices presently sitting on this Court, among justices previously sitting on this Court. 
    As we understand the law, as it obtains in the federal courts, Rabinowitz does obtain that the question is not was there time to get a warrant, but --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5810.470" stopTime="5812.465">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible) an arrest warrant in Rabinowitz.
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="5812.465" stopTime="5813.178">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    Yes, there was and that's -- I recall --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5813.178" stopTime="5815.527">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    There was a search -- but there was an arrest warrant.
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="5815.527" stopTime="5823.188">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    I recall Your Honor's statement in the dissent in Abel versus the United States that it was sanctioned only inferentially. 
    That is true.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5823.188" stopTime="5838.978">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, we've never actually decided the question (Inaudible) you're now going to discuss, whether you need a search warrant, even if there is probable cause for it. 
    Rabinowitz goes no further, does it, in that it validates the search which was incident there to an arrest under an arrest warrant?
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="5838.978" stopTime="5847.239">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    I believe there is. 
    Certainly, in Abel -- I -- here, I am trespassing on grounds of --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5847.239" stopTime="5847.384">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="5847.384" stopTime="6174.666">
    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    -- that I perhaps should not. 
    Perhaps I should not and for obvious reasons, I shan't. 
    But certainly, let me say this as a minimum, that it is at least California's understanding of the Rabinowitz decision that it goes farther than Your Honor says it explicitly goes. 
    Let me phrase it that way in a non-contentious manner. 
    Now, let us assume that Trupiano were to be restored and Rabinowitz were to be overruled. 
    Waiving the question whether this would be a desirable result, I'm not arguing that from the federal courts because I do not think this could profitably argued as a question federal law at least without the appearance of Mr. Solicitor. 
    The question would arise whether, first, if Trupiano were restored, states would under the Due Process Clause be bound to follow it. 
    And second, where even under the facts here, sir, were Trupiano the law, whether this would be a Trupiano case, I submit it would not. 
    Because the exception in Trupiano was that a warrant, even where a warrant might be required, is required only where the obtainment of a warrant would be practical. 
    Now, if I may say this, it would not have been absolutely physically impossible if the officers have delayed entry into this apartment for the purpose of obtaining the warrant, it would've been not absolutely physically impossible. 
    But, the officers had tracked this man to the lair. 
    They knew he was selling from his apartment. 
    This was at the night time, 9 o clock. 
    Be it 9:30, would've taken the officers quite some time to find a Deputy District Attorney who could write an affidavit for them. 
    Police officers don't, unless they are vastly experienced in such matters, write affidavits. 
    And the affidavit would have to be, not merely complex as the facts here are complex but sufficient to obtain not merely the approval of the magistrate but good enough to survive post-arrest attack upon the sufficiency of the affidavit to constitute probable cause for a search warrant. 
    Not only is that true, they then have to find a magistrate and Mr. Stanley has referred liberally to experience in the California Courts. 
    It's just hard to find a Deputy District Attorney at that hour, harder to find a magistrate in cases other than this where the man is tracked to his lair in a completely unbuilt up area. 
    You know how large Los Angeles County is. 
    We're 50 miles by 50 miles in both directions. 
    Your Honors have experienced this. 
    The difficulties would be inculpable. 
    It might be said, of course, that the officer could've left the man at the door. 
    But I think, and this has been mentioned in the Johnson case, the opium smoking case, they could've guarded the door. 
    It's been mentioned in Jeffers, in 342 United States. 
    They could've guarded the door. 
    But what would have happened in this case if they've left someone to guard the door while the remaining officers went out to get a warrant? 
    Ker, as they knew, supplied out of his apartment. 
    Suppose one of his clients walked up to the apartment, what could that officer do? 
    If he attempted to block that man's entrance, the man would go away and telephone Ker and within a few minutes, the officer would reasonably hear the sound of the disposal, the narcotics being disposed of. 
    And there would go the evidence the officers were out attempting to obtain a warrant for the purpose of security. 
    Now, in summary of our position, may it please the Court. 
    It is California's view which we earnestly and sincerely maintain, that, notwithstanding the argument presented by Mr. Stanley, the question remains under Mapp versus Ohio, one of due process, that under the Due Process Clause, that California's standards are reasonable and the finding based upon those standards are reasonable. 
    They should be upheld by this Court and should not be cast out. 
    It is likewise our position that as applied to the facts of this particular case, the officers, under the standards imposed under the federal courts as well as under the California Courts, have probable cause for the arrest of petitioner, George Ker. 
    As to Mrs. Ker, I rest upon what I said in the brief. 
    Respecting the entry, it is California's position that it was lawful under the exception to the statutes engrafted by judicial decision. 
    And on this point, I may make this point, and I think it's a valid one to make, that in Miller versus the United States, in 357 U.S., the Government explicitly refused to raise the question of exigent circumstances where there was an ambiguous attempt to gain entrance at the door. 
    So, I do not have against me, upon this point any case of this Court specifically examined in this --

    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    No. 
    No, though I say this. 
    It's always to the advantage of the officer executing a search warrant to have someone home if only because Your Honor will recall in the record here, although this is collateral to the main point, that the officers were quite careful to have both petitioners here with them in every room where they searched. 
    So, there could be no question of them, say, seizing jewelry and making off with it. 
    And it would probably be to their advantage, under a warrant, to have a defendant home or the person whose premises were to be seized (Inaudible) precisely that purpose.

    Yes, 1531 is the relevant section on the execution of a search warrant and it is quite similar in language to 844 of the Penal Code which is the entry to arrest section.

    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    May I make one point. 
    I think this is essential to make, certainly respecting arrest warrants. 
    That the California have permitted the police officer to arrest without warrant for felony for a much longer time than the federal statutes have permitted narcotics officers to arrest without warrants. 
    7607 of Title 26 is an awfully recent statute.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6740.673" stopTime="6758.718">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And of course, your law, your case law, and your statutory law, up until 1955, are now directing various search warrants. 
    You had the non-exclusionary rules so there was no incentive at all to get a warrant.

    Mr. Gordon Ringer 
    And there's -- oh, there's another awfully important point which I'm glad I recalled it as the hour is approaching lunch time. 
    It is the policy of the California Courts to encourage search warrants. 
    With this respect, I would like to cite the case of People versus Keener in 55 Cal.2d.

    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I only wish to point out two matters. 
    First, with respect to the beginning of the argument for the respondent, in effect, making this a moot question before the Court. 
    There was a motion made at the very beginning of this case when it was tried, much like a motion to suppress the evidence at page 16. 
    The ruling is at page 44 of the transcript at the very bottom of the page and incidentally, it's true that the -- that Exhibits 2 and 3 were not specifically discussed. 
    However, the ruling came right in the middle of the testimony and a reading of the -- of this probable cause hearing will disclose that the judge was rushing it along all the way through. 
    And he said at the bottom of the page after he discussed -- that he didn't think that Mr. Black's testimony would have much significance, so far as the defendant's preparing the case is concerned. 
    He says (Inaudible), “I think I have listened very patiently to this testimony and the Court rules that there is sufficient probable cause to proceed in this action”, and that was --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6972.996" stopTime="6976.424">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="robert_w_stanley" startTime="6976.424" stopTime="7019.469">
    Mr. Robert W. Stanley 
    That was based upon his listening to evidence. 
    On page 16, the motion was first made. 
    Apparently, the Court was apprised either outside of the record or -- it's not disclosed in the record of what the nature of the motion was. 
    Page 16, however, the defense counsel stated, “Well, for the purpose of the record, then I move that the probable cause hearing be conducted outside of the presence of the jury.” 
    Then, they proceeded to litigate that issue, and the prosecutor at that time stated, “If the Court wishes, I'd place my officers on the stand to show there was probable cause.”

    That's correct. 
    This is much like a motion to suppress. 
    It concerns the probable cause and I think the more reasonable assumption is that -- well, it's not stated whether probable cause was with relation to arrest or the search or both, that it was made with respect to all of the evidence and not any particular one item of evidence before the Court.
