    Mr. Henry Waldman 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    This is an appeal from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, which denied the petitioner, Willner admission to the Bar. 
    Willner commenced or rather applied for admission some 25 years ago. 
    It was denied and he has been fighting for it ever since. 
    Willner was the son of immigrant parents who were impoverished, and unlike we often read about young men who work their way through college, he not only had work to his way through college, and four years of law school, but he actually had to work his way through elementary school. the reason of the fact that those people were so poor. 
    Now ordinarily the average young man who applies for admission to the Bar is about the age of 25, 26, 27, when he applied he was a mature man, 36 years of age. 
    He had graduated from the School of Commerce, New York University with a degree of Bachelor of Commercial Science. 
    He then studied law for four years and graduated first as a Bachelor of Laws and then as a Master of Laws, and that exempted him from having to serve a clerkship in a lawyer's office, and that's very important in this connection. 
    He was married, had two children, a boy was suffering from asthma, was living in New York and then decided it would be better if he would move the family to the country, or at least -- and he moved it to Peekskill up in Westchester County. 
    It's about 30 miles north of the City Line. 
    And he had to make a living and what he knew was accounting, he practically finished his accounting course. 
    So he engaged in business of accounting, and that of course brought him into contact with people who had to do business with, and anyone who participates in the activities of the marketplace is bound to get an occasional cuff, bound to get into disputes like anybody else who engages in business, and he did. 
    He got into a dispute with a lawyer by the name of James Dempsey and I am not going into details regarding it, but he made a bitter enemy of Dempsey. 
    In the meanwhile, he had taken the Bar examination, had passed successfully and was ready to be admitted to the Bar. 
    Now admission into the Bar in New York is delegated to the Appellate Division. 
    The Court of Appeals makes the rules and regulations and delegates the Appellate Division, the business of admitting attorneys to the Bar. 
    Naturally the number of lawyers who apply for admission is very large in New York, and so the job of examining the character and fitness of the applicant for admission to the Bar is delegated to a committee of -- termed the Committee on Character and Fitness. 
    It consists of ten members and they are all supposed to be eminent lawyers. 
    Willner having received his certificate from the Board of the Law Examiners then applied to the -- or Bar rather appeared before the Character Committee.

    That office was apparently managed by Weider, and after he got in there he found a motley crowd of subtenants, one was a bookmaker and by that I don't mean one who publishes or writes books, one who takes bets on races, another was a handicapper and as soon as Willner saw what he was in for, he walked out, and meanwhile he gotten into row with Weidner and Weidner's partner also realizing the sort of office was in, dissolved his partnership and walked out. 
    When he came before the Character Committee, oh, yes, and Weidner also filed a complaint --

    He was questioned about them, and the Committee consisted of Mr. Strook, Mr. Ellison and Basil O'Connor. 
    Apparently when he appeared before this Committee, he was questioned very sharply and he became very much nettled and probably in all -- probably spoke rather crudely. 
    In any event he apparently made a bad impression on this committee of three and lo and behold they filed a report which stated that they were not satisfied that he possessed the character and fitness requisite for a member of a Bar of New York.

    Mr. Henry Waldman 
    Now he -- that was in 1937 and he made additional applications, about five or six more. 
    Everyone was denied without opinion, not so much as a three word sentence. 
    All unanimously denied, no opinion, and to this day he doesn't know just why he was not admitted to Bar except of course he assumes that the Dempsey and Wieder letters probably are the cause. 
    Now, the right to a trial, in a case of this kind is unquestioned. 
    When I mean a trial, I mean he has the right to face, to confront his accusers, cross examine them and in fact have a trial in the ordinary and the usual course, where common law procedure and rules of evidence are maintained. 
    As a matter of fact that right is established as case law in the State of New York and the case of a recoupment. 
    That case was argued in 1959, but decided -- published in 1960, that's a long time ago, but that case has never been overruled, modified or qualified to my knowledge and its stare decisis is still in force. 
    That case is the law in the State of New York. 
    Now that case stated that admission to the Bar was a substandard right. 
    In other words, a substantial right to which a man was entitled to confrontation and all. 
    Now as a matter of fact, the Character Committee every time is served with papers, never appeared either by serving a reply to the petition or by the personal appearance of one of it's members, all of whom are lawyers or of it's secretary. 
    He simply ignored it with a sort of silent content and that man Willner where every few years, he made a new application, denied, the Character Committee didn't appear and the Appellate Division simply denied it without opinion. 
    We finally got the petition, which initiated this proceeding was run up by Willner himself, though I think with the aid of a young lawyer friend. 
    In any event he appeared pro se and I only got into it later. 
    The petition was denied by the Appellate Division. 
    I made application to the Appellate Division for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals that was necessary. 
    Motion denied, then I made an application to the Court of Appeals and to my amazement and joy the application was granted. 
    When I of course filed a brief and the other side did not file a brief, when I appeared in Albany before the Court, the other side wasn't there. 
    I argued the appeal for about 20 minutes and two days later, they rendered their decision. 
    Order of the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, no opinion. 
    The first time that I received a brief was when I filed my petition for certiorari here. 
    And then the Attorney General of New York up here filed a brief and from the -- but only really said, was in view of the fact that his application had been denied way back 25 years ago, there's no reason why, the petition should be granted. 
    And there is that -- although he didn't raise the claims, res judicata and in my reply brief, I would like to state because I think its worth stating in answer to his claim, a distinguished general in the army attended a social function in full dress uniform and his chest covered with medals. 
    Asked how he got all of these medals, he said the first I got by mistake and the others because of the first. 
    Now the same thing here, the -- having denied his admission in 1936 and they contend that he should be denied admission in the year 1963.

   Argument of Daniel M. Cohen
speaker="daniel_m_cohen" startTime="1054.714" stopTime="1194.877">
    Mr. Daniel M. Cohen 
    Your Honor and Justices of the Court, may it please the Court. 
    I think that possibly one of the clearest answers that can be given to the petition in this case was indicated by the procedure here this morning when in connection with admissions to the Bar of this Court, each applicant was required to produce somebody who would certify that the applicant satisfied the requirements of the Bar of this Court. 
    New York has a similar requirement with respect to its Bar. 
    The process of admission as Mr. Willner has stated has been entrusted by the New York courts to the various Appellate Divisions, the four Appellate Divisions throughout the state. 
    Each of these Appellate Divisions dealing with residence in its own district has what has been described as a Character Committee. 
    This Character Committee can affect forms for the large group of applicants to the Bar in New York, the same function that was performed here this morning by previously admitted members of a Bar of this Court. 
    It examines into the character of each applicant and if the Committee is satisfied as to the applicant's character and fitness it certifies to the Appellate Division that the applicant is entitled to admission.

    Exactly Your Honor, in effect there is a monopoly, but it is a monopoly which exists under the law of the State of New York, they – there isn't any challenge as I see it to the procedural provision that requires the endorsement by the Committee that is not the question that is been presented either by Mr. Waldman, for his client or by the Bill of Rights Committee of the Bar Association, which has filed a brief amicus.

    Mr. Daniel M. Cohen 
    No, the statute does not prescribe in any sort of detail, the procedure that is to be followed by this Committee. 
    The Committee is primarily an investigating committee and is so designated in the statutes which provides for its creation. 
    The committee is -- has its procedure prescribed only in or approximately a very limited degree by stating that one of the procedures that it can require from an applicant is that he submit two affidavits in support of his application by attorney showing his good moral character. 
    Apart from that the Committee is pretty much left on its own as an investigator for the court, as an arm of the court, to go out and to obtain its information in the manner in which it deems it best to obtain the information. 
    There are no limitations on its processes of investigation. 
    The committee advertises as soon as an applicant files his application with the committee and transmits the certificate that he has satisfied the scholarship requirements by passing the Bar Exam. 
    Committee advertises in the Law Journal the names of the persons who have applied for admission. 
    Attorneys, other persons who see the advertisement in the Law Journal respond, send in whatever information they have. 
    The committee itself has investigators. 
    The staff is a relatively small staff, who are able to go out and to check up on the information that they receive, but the ultimate function of the committee is not to pass upon the application for admissions to the Bar, not to adjudicate that a person is not entitled to admission, but simply to transmit to the Appellate Division when it receives this information, which is unfavorable. 
    Now when there is no such information, when there is nothing which comes before the committee, which acts as sort of a danger signal, a warning to the committee that it should stop. 
    The committee is in a position where it can certify that an applicant is entitled to admission to the Bar. 
    When information comes --

    Mr. Daniel M. Cohen 
    This was the procedure back in 1937 and 1938. Originally however in this particular case they brought him in before a three-man sub-committee as was stated and Mr. Wieder was confronted with these letters, or this -- the record indicates one letter at that particular time, which had been received filing a compliant against him. 
    Presumably he was informed as to the substance of the complaint. 
    The sub-committee apparently thought there was enough here to worry about to have a full hearing and a hearing was arranged, Mr. Wieder, however, was not informed beyond apparently the substance of this letter as to the nature of the compliant that had been filed against him.

    Mr. Willner, the applicant was the only person present. 
    Willner is the applicant for admission, and no one was present at the hearing. 
    These hearings are held privately, secretly, confidentially, so that the facts as to an applicant are not exposed to the public at large. 
    Applicants as to whom unfavorable information is received are protected against publicity on such complaints and there is -- and possibly they may not turn not to be true. 
    Willner attended the hearing and as Justice Harlan has pointed out in the Second Koenigsberg case, the hearings are a form of obtaining information from these applicants. 
    One of the best methods of obtaining information from applicants is by examining them on the basis of information that has been obtained as to them.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Has there been a hearing before [Inaudible]
speaker="daniel_m_cohen" startTime="1870.036" stopTime="2097.479">
    Mr. Daniel M. Cohen 
    No. 
    The complainants were never brought in for hearing. 
    This was not an adversary type of proceeding, apparently what happened was that the committee, the Character Committee sent out its own investigator to check to a certain extent or as far as this investigator could, on the details of the complaints that were filed against the applicant and on the basis of the report that was brought back by the committee's own investigator, the applicant was examined before the committee. 
    Now, he was given notice through the form of questioning as to the nature of the charges and complaints that were filed against him. 
    He was given an opportunity to deny or admit the charges, in connection with the first complaint, and the first complaint was that this applicant had attempted to serve a clerkship where the attorney Weider had not completed it for various reasons. 
    The applicant admitted that he had failed in his questionnaire before the committee that set forth the fact that he had been employed by Weider. 
    Now, the fact of employment was significant because it indicated a non-disclosure of a fact that apparently the committee deemed material. 
    In view of the fact, this man actually did not require a clerkship. 
    The committee apparently did not dispose completely of the application in a negative form, but as you will see, as you go through the history of this case, it gave Mr. Willner an opportunity to come in supply whatever information he had to disprove the charges in the complaint. 
    These were not formal charges, this was just material contained in the letter. 
    The substance of my argument it seems has to be reduced in view of the short time that I have and I'm not going to try to quote with this whole record. 
    But the record will indicate that at various times the Committee deferred its disposition of this matter, granted various adjournments in effect to the applicant, to give him an opportunity to clear up his record. 
    Each time that he was given such an opportunity, there was a new complaint, there was something else that appeared that was disadvantageous to Willner. 
    Each time that the committee set this matter down for hearing that was material before it that could be considered as reflecting upon his character. 
    Now, there was no formal disposition in his first application until 1938. 
    I would say that the --

    There is no statute on it, there are no rules and regulations which have been prescribed. 
    There is just the general procedure that is available either by way of motion practice in New York or by way of our so called Article 78 review the determination of an administrative body. 
    Now in effect, what Mr. Waldman suggests that we throw away the whole book, on the record it was of what has occurred with relation to the applicant, what they have, what I have set forth as to the proceedings before the Character Committee. 
    The various hearings that were held in 1938, 1948 and disregard this record in effect what he is asking us to do is to say that any of the facts before the Committee were immaterial because his client was not given the right to cross-examine and to confront the people who filed the first two complaints against him, Weider and Dempsey. 
    Now --

    Do you know of any practice of the appellate division whereby [Inaudible] petitioner a hearing to [Inaudible]
speaker="daniel_m_cohen" startTime="2248.180" stopTime="2457.002">
    Mr. Daniel M. Cohen 
    Well, our experience in connection with these cases is very limited. 
    Generally what happens is that these committees treat these matters as non-adversary proceedings. 
    They have no ax to grind. 
    Their report goes to the court as an arm of the Court. 
    It is then up to the court to determine what it should do, but the court is in a position where on its own motion, it can direct such a hearing, it can direct that the hearing be held, whenever it wants to in -- if a situation develops that requires a trial-type hearing. 
    Most of these cases apparently are disposed by the Character Committee in a manner where they will not receive ex parte any information which the applicant is not given an opportunity to explain or to deny and the position of the committee is that it proceeds only on information which is not ex parte. 
    Now, if in connection with any particular application before, the committee has unfavorable information, information that makes it set up its own, and so here, this man must wait, the committee, it seems to me is not acting arbitrarily if it has in its possession unfavorable information. 
    In this particular case, the assumption is that everything was set against Willner in these first two complaints was credited. 
    If the complaints were completely credited and as to the first one of the charges was that the man asked for a false affidavit that he had served the clerkship. 
    I'm sure that if, if the committee had accepted that that it would never have allowed Willner later on and the Court itself would not have allowed Willner at a later day to have filed a new application for admission as it did in 1948. 
    If it had accepted the second charge, which would in effect was that Willner had engaged in a fraudulent transaction where he promised that he could put through an RFC loan that he had to pay moneys to an RFC employee to bring about the loan, if these charges had been taken in hold -- at face value by the distinguished members of the Bar who constitute this Committee then it seems to me that again the 1948 application would not have been allowed. 
    These would have been allegations of a sort that would have so, despite the man's character if accepted that he should not have been allowed to file a second application.

    I ask you the Appellant Division of the State of New York to direct the Committee to come in with a report which is specific, which contains findings which will inform me of the basis upon which my application has been denied.

    Back in 1943 and this record is rather complex and I'd had to dig it out individual file papers, he said that he knew two things, first a considerable stress had been placed at his hearing, this first hearing on the fact that he had set forth in answer to a request for information that he had served no clerkship.

    Mr. Daniel M. Cohen 
    Possibly, I have clouded the issue rather than straighten it out. 
    But let me say this, this particular Committee has acted, as Justice Harlan indicated a little while ago as an arm of the Court. 
    The Court has assumed through the years and it was not until 1960. 
    Now, that in any case, the Court of Appeals called upon the Attorney General to submit a brief or to argue in the Court of Appeals, any appeal connected with the disposition of an application for admission to the Bar. 
    The matter has always been considered as an intra-court process. 
    The Character Committee reported to the Appellate Division. 
    The Appellate Division in case there was any application disposed the application. 
    If an appeal were taken to the Court of Appeals, the papers were transmitted just as they were in this case to the Court of Appeals. 
    Now, it was not until the disposition of matter of anonymous, which I've referred to in my brief in 1960, that for the first time, so far as I know, the Court of Appeals called upon any outside agency being the Attorney General's office in that particular case, and the Attorney -- this is the second time that it has called on the Attorney General to intervene in a case, and to act as an advocate. 
    The theory of a Court being that this is a matter, which requires the Court's own exercise of discretion, apparently being -- that the theory being that these experienced members of the Bar will not out of hand arbitrarily or otherwise on the basis of ex parte evidence dispose off any applicant arbitrarily.

    The Court of Appeals indicated that if a proper application were made to the Court of Appeals for the papers, they would be allowed to be examined by the applicant. 
    The Court of Appeals in that case afforded that opportunity and directed that the confidential file be supplied. 
    Now, one of the difficulties with the position here is no such application was ever made.

    I'm afraid that Your Honor is going to have to read this record a little bit more carefully, than I've been able to explain it within the limits of a 30-minute argument. 
    The record -- this book which the Appellant asks us to disregard completely contains facts which indicate that in 1943, possibly the basis upon which a hearing could have been granted, might have been outlined by the Appellant, but there would not have been at that time an arbit -- yeah.

    I've done as well as I could within relatively few days in getting out a reply to the Bill of Rights Committee. 
    Now it seems to me that one of the things that we are heading for in this discussion of the case is a question as to whether the Bill of Rights Committee is correct in suggesting, that as to this particular type of investigation in to the conduct of a particular individual, the rules which ordinarily apply to trial type hearings should apply.

    Mr. Daniel M. Cohen 
    Well, they have said it's far from their brief. 
    I haven't had any greater advantage then, Your Honor, in being able to find out exactly where the division lies in the Committee. 
    As a matter of fact, my information up until about two to three weeks ago was that they were not likely to file a brief in connection with the case. 
    Apparently, there was a last minute switch, a brief was filed. 
    The brief is addressed primarily as I can see it to this trial-type hearing problem. 
    They -- if I can go back to a period say about 35 years ago, when I studying with Mr. Justice Douglas at Columbia Law School, I might say this, at that time I learned not to over generalize and I think that --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3957.627" stopTime="3958.878">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That's an old fashion trade.

speaker="daniel_m_cohen" startTime="3961.122" stopTime="4034.877">
    Mr. Daniel M. Cohen 
    Yeah. 
    And I should say that the over generalization that might result from the presentation of facts by the Bill of Rights Committee is that because this is a specific type of investigation, a hearing is required. 
    Now I think if we read carefully what Your Honor said the Second Canningsberg case with Justice Frankfurter has said, or Justice Cardozo said, when he was a Judge of the Court of Appeals for the State of New York, McCollum case, it will be fairly clear that the tradition in this specific type of investigation has been for the responsibility to be placed with the members of the Bar or the Court to find out and ascertain the information that was available about a particular applicant and if issues arise with relation to them, it seems to me that it is not beyond the procedures that were available without specific rule, without specific statute in New York.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4034.877" stopTime="4035.348">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well --
speaker="daniel_m_cohen" startTime="4035.348" stopTime="4064.551">
    Mr. Daniel M. Cohen 
    -- For the Court to give any man who says that he has been denied a hearing on any subject and under appropriate circumstances where the Court deems it essential or proper to even require cross examination of persons who filed complaints as to which an adjudication maybe necessary before a determination of character.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4064.551" stopTime="4102.343">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Or unless things have changed, since I've been practicing in New York, I would suppose that an applicant who had been denied admission to the Bar, where there is a matter of inherent power of the Court or under Article 78, could file a petition in the Court, in the Appellate Division saying that he has been improperly denied admission on the basis of an ex parte report of the Character Committee. 
    And if the Appellate Division thought there was substance to it, they would appoint a referee to investigate the matter and make a report. 
    Now, am I incorrect?

    If instant awareness at that time of the necessity and of giving the committee up-to-date information, which was what he hadn't done originally and he set forth as to the second matter, which he acknowledged had been stressed by the committee, “My failure to state or to explain more fully the nature of certain litigation in which I had participated at or about the time of my consideration before a set committee.

    In the first place, I was shocked to hear Mr. Cohen say that under the New York practice, an article what he terms an Article 78 proceeding could have been brought by Willner to test the validity of the action of the Character Committee. 
    Article 78 applies only to a proceeding to compel an administrative agency to do its duty and has nothing to do. 
    Furthermore, Mr. Willner at someone's suggestion took his file to Mr. Robert Roger Bryan Hunting, the Secretary of the Bar Association of the City of New York, and Mr. Hunting, two weeks later informed him that there was nothing in that in his record, which justified the denial of admission of the Bar. 
    And I might say this day Willner was entitled to be admitted at the Bar, when he first applied and in view of his age, in view of the fact that 20 years, 25 years had been lost, the Court should admit him to the Bar, direct his admission to the Bar forth with.
