    Mr. David Rein 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is here challenging the validity of the deportation order entered against the petitioner. 
    The petitioner is a Mexican National who has resided in the United States since he entered in this country in 1920 at the age of 10. 
    He is married and supports his wife who resides in this country. 
    He has two American born children and eight American born grandchildren who also live in this country. 
    Although not a citizen of the United States, he has lived here since the age of 10 and his roots are definitely in this country and not in Mexico. 
    He was ordered deported on a finding that he had been a member of the Communist Party in 1949 and 1950, and hence was deportable under the provisions of Section 241 (a) (6) (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

    Mr. David Rein 
    This Section of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides for deportation for past membership in the Communist Party. 
    And the chief issue in this case is whether or not that finding can be -- that holding can be supported on the basis of the findings made by the Board of Immigration Appeals in this case. 
    The findings upon which the order of deportation rests were set forth and summarized by the BIA and that's quoted in our brief at page 5 to 6, these are the essential findings. 
    According to the BIA, membership in the Communist Party was found to have been established on the testimony of Government witness, Scarletto, who testified that he had collected Communist Party dues from the respondent and had attended close meetings of the Communist Party with him, and the general corroboration offered by the testimony of Government witness, Elorriaga. 
    There were no findings beyond this as to the nature of petitioner's membership. 
    There were no findings that the petitioner had ever engaged in any Party activity of any kind, or that he had ever said anything at any party meetings. 
    Simply, there's bare finding that he had attended some meetings and had paid dues. 
    The Board of Immigration Appeals nevertheless held that on these findings, that petitioner was deportable within the requirements of this Court's decision in Rowoldt and I digress for a moment, this Court held in the Rowoldt case, that aliens who were only nominal members of the Party were not deportable and that it was necessary to establish deportability to show a “meaningful association” with the Party.

speaker="david_rein" startTime="217.075" stopTime="229.048">
    Mr. David Rein 
    I submit that there was no such evidence. 
    I can get to it -- I tend get to it a little later on the Government's contention, if I may, but primarily on that point, I would take this point that this --
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="229.048" stopTime="247.948">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    [Inaudible]
speaker="david_rein" startTime="247.948" stopTime="721.192">
    Mr. David Rein 
    Not to witness Elorriaga, yes. 
    The witness, Elorriaga, if I may digress for a moment, testified in this case. 
    He testified at one point that the petitioner attended meetings regularly, I think three or four times a month over a period of three years. 
    At another point in his testimony, the same witness testified that over a period of three years, he saw the petitioner at a total of two meetings. 
    Now, what is significant is that the Board of Immigration Appeals in its opinion, recognizing the conflict in this testimony, said, “We find it unnecessary to resolve this conflict, because under our view, it doesn't make any difference whether he attended two meetings or meetings regularly, he is still a member of the Communist Party, and in any event, we will only consider this witness, Elorriaga to be corroborative of the witness, Scarletto.” 
    From the portion I have just read to you, they relied upon the witness, Scarletto and said that Elorriaga is merely corroborative. 
    So you have two points, I say both reading the witness fairly, there is no such evidence, and secondly, and perhaps more decisive, I think for this Court, this Court has repeatedly said and most recently in the Burlington Truck Lines case that when a case comes here from an administrative agency, it will examine it on the basis of the findings made by the administrative agency and not go beyond it. 
    Now, the Board of Immigration Appeals made no finding that the petitioner here had attended any executive meetings of the club. 
    The sole finding on the basis of all Elorriaga's testimony was that they were considered to be merely corroborative in view of the great contradiction in his testimony. 
    So I think it's fair to say and although the Government disputes it and I have discussed their statements in my reply brief at some length, but I think there is no question that on the BIA findings, all that there is before this Court and all that there is before the BIA, and all that the BIA thought it had was attendance at some meetings. 
    And as I point out these meetings were not more than about possibly 15 meetings over a period of two years and payment of dues and nothing more. 
    Now, the BIA said and recognizing the force of the Rowoldt case that one of the prime indicia that must be examined in the Rowoldt case to see whether or not there was the necessary “meaningful association” was the alien's awareness of the political implications of his membership. 
    The BIA recognized that and in its opinion, it stated, that there was little development of the respondent's awareness of the fact that he belonged to a political organization. 
    As I indicate that that really is an overstatement because there was no development of the respondent's awareness. 
    Nevertheless, according to the BIA, the petitioner was deportable, and it arrived at that conclusion on the following theory. 
    On the theory that once the Government had shown a bare organizational membership, it was permissible to draw an inference that there was a “meaningful association” and the BIA would presume a “meaningful association” unless the alien came forward and demonstrated to the contrary. 
    In other words, the way they view the case was that once there was bare organizational membership, the burden of proof as to the character of that membership rested upon the petitioner and not upon the Government. 
    We brought a complaint originally in the United States District Court to challenge the validity of the deportation order in that theory. 
    The District Court gave judgment for the Government and on appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals affirmed agreeing with the Board of Immigration Appeals' theory that a presumption can be drawn from bare organizational membership, but it arrived at this result by a very novel and unprecedented route which was quite different from the one that the Board of Immigration Appeals had arrived at. 
    In essence, what the Court of Appeals held was as follows. 
    It read the various statutes on this subject and this Court's opinions as coming to the following conclusion that prior to the 1950 Act and going back to the 1940 Act, the Court said, “It was necessary to establish deportability to show that the alien involved had personally advocated the overthrow of Government by force and violence.” 
    It then said that the 1950 Act which provided the deportation on membership alone or did it as follows, that Congress made a legislative finding, that the Communist Party advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence. 
    It then established a legislative presumption that all members of the Communist Party advocated the overthrow of Government by force and violence. 
    And that the force of this Court's decision in Rowoldt case was that that presumption was a rebuttable. 
    We petitioned the Court for certiorari from that opinion of the Court of Appeals pointing out the novel nature of the opinion and what seemed to be a faulty analysis of this Court's previous decisions in the area. 
    The Government represented, we say erroneously and they're still apparently maintaining the same misconstruction of the record that the Court had merely evaluated the testimony. 
    Now, there's nothing in the Court's opinion could show that they were merely evaluating testimony. 
    In any event, this Court denied certiorari at that time. 
    The net result of that was that under the Court of Appeals decision which by virtue of this Court's denial of certiorari, became the final law of the case. 
    The petitioner was to be deported because he had failed to rebut the presumption that he had personally advocated the violent overthrow of the Government. 
    Since prior to that ruling, neither petitioner nor the Service knew or had a reason to know that such evidence relating to the petitioner's personal advocacy was at all relevant to the issue, petitioner requested the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen his case so as to give him an opportunity to prove that he never personally advocated the violent overthrow of the Government and hence was not deportable under the Court of Appeals' decision and the theory of the Court of Appeals. 
    He supported this motion with an affidavit to the effect that he had never advocated or espoused violent overthrow of the Government and stated that if the hearing were reopened, he would so testify. 
    The Board of Immigration Appeals granted oral argument on this petition to reopen. 
    After argument, it denied the petition to reopen on the ground that under the decisions of this Court, evidence as to whether or not the petitioner affirmatively himself espoused violent overthrow is not material to deportability. 
    It disposed of the opinion of the Court of Appeals' decision on the ground that the Court of Appeals' decision which justified petitioner's motion was inconsistent with the decisions of this Court and we concede that, as a matter of fact, we pointed that out in our original petition.

    No, I think the Court of Appeals -- let me put it this way and I will develop it much later when I get into my arguments. 
    The law of the case doctrine holds that once a -- in an appellate tribunal, sets down an issue of law in a particular case, it does not necessarily apply to other cases, that rule of law is binding on a lower tribunal whether or not correct in that same case and I submit you could not have an orderly process of law. 
    If you could have a lower tribunal say, “Well, I'm not going to be bound by what the appellate tribunal said in this case because it was wrong. 
    It does not have the authority to inquire into whether or not in that particular case, the appellate tribunal was correct because otherwise, I don't know what the force of a ruling of an appellate tribunal would be.” 
    It is bound by it and it's bound by that particular case even if it thinks it's wrong.

speaker="david_rein" startTime="887.610" stopTime="979.145">
    Mr. David Rein 
    I would -- certainly clear that this Court does not have to follow the erroneous reasoning from the Court of Appeals. 
    The law of the case doctrine makes it perfectly clear. 
    As a matter of fact, that the erroneous decision of the Court of Appeals was not even binding on the Court of Appeals and it's certainly not binding on this Court. 
    But to turn then for the question of what is the heart of the case as to whether or not on these facts, the -- the petition that comes within the Rowoldt case, I'll turn now to argue that. 
    Rowoldt against Perfetto established that the statutory provision which provides for deportation for past membership in the Communist Party applies only to membership which has a certain political significance described as a “meaningful association.” 
    Aliens whose membership was only nominal and which lacked the “meaningful association” are not deportable. 
    In Rowoldt itself, the alien belonged to the Communist Party. 
    There was much language which the Government emphasizes in its brief about how the Board found that the petitioner here voluntarily joined the Party. 
    There is no question that Rowoldt voluntarily joined the Party. 
    He belonged to the Party for about a year. 
    He attended closed party meetings. 
    He paid dues. 
    He ran a Party bookstore and to quote Justice Harlan, he had considerable albeit rudimentary knowledge of Communist history and philosophy.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="979.145" stopTime="982.257">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That was [Inaudible]
speaker="david_rein" startTime="982.257" stopTime="1262.592">
    Mr. David Rein 
    But I don't know that anybody disagreed with the Court in that. 
    Secondly, we leave that out. 
    The majority said that he belonged to the Party for about a year. 
    He paid dues and he ran a Party bookstore. 
    These findings were nonetheless held insufficient to establish the “meaningful association” which was a requisite for deportability. 
    A further gloss on the Court's opinion in Rowoldt was given by this Court in the subsequent case of Scales against the United States. 
    That case which was a criminal case involved the construction of the term “member” as used in the criminal provisions. 
    He was not necessarily member of the Communist Party, member of an organization advocating the overthrow of Government by force and violence but it involved the construction of the meaning of that word “member”. 
    This Court, relying on its previous decisions in Galvan and in Rowoldt, held that the 10-member must be confined to only active members and that it cannot be applied to nominal members. 
    In the course of its opinion, the Court pointed out that Rowoldt, in relying on Rowoldt, would not permit deportation solely on the ground of a voluntary joining of the Party and it argued that a similar construction would certainly be applied to the criminal portion of the statute. 
    It is significant and I think the Court, it's worthwhile to note that the language, so far as the word “member” is concerned, both as was used in the provision of the Smith Act involved in Scales, and both as used here in the deportation provision, both trace their origin back to the Alien Registration Act of 1940. 
    They both really go back to the same statute. 
    It is plain that the findings of the Board of Immigration Appeals, which I have quoted, cannot possibly satisfy this term of “meaningful association” or active membership. 
    Since the Board found only the petitioner attended some Party meetings and paid dues and no more and this in fact was less than was found in Rowoldt. 
    To turn very briefly to the Government's contention as to the -- what the facts are that might support other findings; they say -- as I started to say earlier, our first answer to that, would be that this Court ordinarily reviews administrative findings -- administrative orders on the basis of the findings made by the Board of Immigration of -- by the administrative agency. 
    It does not go behind it to see whether or not the agency could have made other findings and could have acted on another theory. 
    I think that that matter was put very succinctly, very recently by this Court in the Burlington Truck case saying that the Court would not have recognized appellate counsel's post hoc argument as to the rationalization of an agency's decision. 
    But leaving that aside, we turn to what the Government says, “The Board could have found even if we want to look into the record.” 
    They say first, that the petitioner was an active member of the Party. 
    Now, the Board never found the petitioner was active and unless you say that because he attended meetings and paid dues, he was an active member, it adds nothing. 
    There is no evidence of any activity and indeed, the Government points to none. 
    It then argues that he was a regular member of the Party. 
    Now significantly, it talks constantly throughout its brief about the testimony of two witnesses. 
    As I have pointed out, the Board relied only on one indicating that the other witness because of the big cut -- the complete contradiction in this testimony could be considered only corroborative. 
    That witness, one Scarletto, testified and this is Scarletto's testimony, that petitioner just went once in a while to Party meetings. 
    He testified, and if you want to really look at the testimony that his Communist Party Club in which both he and the petitioner were members, met regularly once a week at the home of a different member of the club. 
    Nevertheless, over the two-year period, he could recall seeing petitioner at the most at maybe 15 meetings or he wasn't sure.

    Mr. David Rein 
    No, it couldn't have been once every week. 
    I don't think the witness could possibly say that he was at several of those meetings when he's talking about the fact that these meetings happened once a week over a period of two years which is a 100 meetings. 
    It seems inconceivable to me that a witness would say, “He might have been at 15 but I'm not sure.” 
    And in any event, I should certainly say, all that the Board of Immigration Appeals found was that the witness attended meetings. 
    It didn't say he find that he attended and I submit it would be improper for him to find any more than that on the basis of such a vague testimony. 
    The Government also argues that there was evidence although the Board made no findings. 
    The petitioner had attended a Party convention. 
    We have set out in our footnote the testimony of Scarletto on that subject at page 7, and I can read it very briefly. 
    The testimony was, “Do you know whether Jose Gastelum ever attended any such party convention?” 
    Answer: I saw him at one convention one time. 
    Question: Do you know whether he was there on an official capacity? 
    Answer: No. 
    That's the total of his testimony on that. 
    It's perfectly clear the Board of Immigration Appeals saw no significance in that particular bit of testimony as adding to the total picture and had made no findings on it.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, the record shows exactly what I have read that there was a convention which Mr. Scarletto attended as an official delegate and was there and participated in the discussions. 
    He also said that this convention was closed to anybody but Communist Party members and then he said, “Do you know whether Jose Gastelum ever attended any such convention?” 
    “I saw him at one convention, one time.” 
    “Do you know whether he was there on official capacity?” 
    “No.” 
    “That's -- that's the total of the testimony and I submit that there are no findings made by the BIA. 
    You will find nothing in the BIA report that ever mentions that petitioner attended the convention. 
    And I say that this decision should be based on BIA findings and obviously the BIA did not consider this little bit of testimony to have any significance. 
    Otherwise, I assume it would have dwelt on it and said that its finding of “meaningful association” was based upon it because after all what is before this Court is a decision of the BIA and if the BIA says, it finds “meaningful association” solely on bare organizational membership, I don't think it's appropriate for the Government to argue and certainly not for the Court to find that maybe the BIA is wrong on that theory but it could have found something else. 
    That flies in the face of all the cases in this Court in reviewing administrative agency decisions.

speaker="david_rein" startTime="1895.141" stopTime="2005.325">
    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, I think that's the heart of the case as to who has to prove deportability. 
    Now first, let me get down to the point that if Rowoldt held and the meaning of the Rowoldt decision is what had to be proved before an alien could be brought within the scope of the statute. 
    As a matter of fact, Rowoldt did not testify at the deportation proceeding. 
    Rowoldt gave a pre-hearing statement to an immigration officer which was the sole evidence introduced against Rowoldt at the deportation proceeding, but at the deportation proceeding itself, Rowoldt like the petitioner here, refused to testify. 
    Now, there was nothing in Rowoldt that lent sanction to the idea that it laid down a new novel rule of method of proof or to suggest that the situation would have been any different as to whether the testimony came from Rowoldt or whether it came from any place else. 
    Now the important point to note here is what did Rowoldt decide? 
    Rowoldt decided that an alien is not deportable unless there is a “meaningful association.” 
    Now, it is clear and I don't think the Government disputes that the burden of proof in all deportation cases rests upon the Government. 
    If it is an element of deportability, that “meaningful association” must be shown and that burden of proof rests upon the Government. 
    So that if you have a record here which shows membership and gives you no light whatsoever on whether or not that there is a “meaningful association”, the Government has not carried its burden of proof and the case must be thrown out.

speaker="david_rein" startTime="2019.314" stopTime="2033.145">
    Mr. David Rein 
    I submit no, it's not a possible distinction. 
    If you can make inferences from which are in the record, they must be sufficient inferences to support your burden of proof in the first place. 
    And then you could say --

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    [Inaudible]
speaker="david_rein" startTime="2049.668" stopTime="2086.687">
    Mr. David Rein 
    I don't have to argue that case here. 
    You might say that attending meetings regularly every week is enough to show the “meaningful association,” but that's not a question of making an inference which shifts the burden of proof. 
    The question would be whether the Government had proved enough to bring him within Rowoldt. 
    I say and there's particularly no reason, it's a very novel rule of law. 
    It's never been applied in any other deportation case that I know of to say that any element of the deportability should be shifted to the alien and does not rest upon the Government. 
    And I might indicate that --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Rein, I -- don't we have to begin with the statute?

    Now, you -- certainly you're not -- you're not suggesting that the Government did not prove that this petitioner was a member of the Communist Party of the United States after he was -- after he entered United States, --

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well yes, it held what was necessary for the deportability --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="david_rein" startTime="2273.256" stopTime="2431.939">
    Mr. David Rein 
    -- and I would assume -- I would assume from the decision, I think there's no reason. 
    Now, let me correct myself. 
    I think Rowoldt probably read -- did say something about the burden of proof and if I refer to the language of Rowoldt, I would indicate this is what Rowoldt said insofar as it commented on the point. 
    It said and I quote from Rowoldt, “There must be a substantial basis of finding meaningful membership and a solidity of proof is required.” 
    Now, I submit it did not consider the issue on the terms on which is being presented here as to whether the burden of proof is on the alien or on the Government. 
    What -- obviously the idea that the burden of proof of any element of deportability should be upon the alien is a novel and new idea. 
    Rowoldt didn't say that the burden of proof was on the Government it just assumed it because the burden of proof and deportability is always on the Government. 
    And if this Government wishes to make a new suggestion, I might indicate incidentally for what its worth that the Government does not support in its brief or argue the validity of the BIA theory that is possible to shift his burden of proof. 
    It simply abandons the whole question. 
    I don't know what view we'll have in argument but its brief is silent on the point. 
    But deportation, even though the Court has found that it's technically, perhaps not punishment in the legal sense, this Court has recognized on numerous occasions, the harsh consequences of a deportation statute. 
    In Galvan it recognized the harsh consequences and the unjust character of this particular statute. 
    And I would certainly suggest to the Court that certainly this case is not a case in which the Court should invent novel rules of proof and novel rules of the order of proof and the burden of proof so as to make it easier for the Government to make out a case against aliens and against this petitioner then normally apply in ordinary administrative hearings. 
    I am certainly asking for no more than the application of the novel rules of proof in administrative proceedings generally. 
    The Government and the BIA would be asking to carve out an exception for a case of this kind to say that in this case, the burden rests not upon the Government but upon the alien, and I say there is no justice in that kind of a --

    Mr. David Rein 
    And then I think I probably would have been out of Court if your views have been accepted at the present time, but I'm arguing on the basis of the majority opinion. 
    Now, let me give you an example -- for example, it means -- this is presented as somewhat of a dilemma. 
    This Court has recently since Niukkan -- since Rowoldt has had one other case in which it considered the meaning of Rowoldt and what had to be proved and that was the Niukkanen case. 
    Now, the Court there affirmed on the basis of the findings of fact made by the Court of Appeals. 
    Now, what did the Court of Appeals find in Niukkanen? 
    It didn't find just that he was a member. 
    They found that Niukkanen actively participated in discussions of the policies of the Party and the circulation of newspaper as a Party order. 
    They found that Niukkanen was not an ordinary member of the Communist Party, but belonged to what members of the Party called the “top fraction,” and that he actively participated in party councils. 
    Now, these are not necessarily related to the proscribed activities of illegal overthrow, but it was necessary to find and Niukkanen did found -- it find into the Court in Niukkanen -- the Court of Appeals in Niukkanen did find and this Court sustained him that there was activity of some kind, an activity of a responsible nature sufficiently to show a “meaningful association”. 
    And I submit that that is the burden on the Government under Rowoldt and under any other logical -- I mean in view of the deportation statute. 
    And let me make this final word with respect to it, that this statute has been sustained. 
    Its constitutionality has been sustained, and was sustained in Galvan against Press. 
    The Court later recognized that it would sustain what it considered to be purely historical reasons. 
    It's been sustained on a theory that after all deportation is not punishment, but the Court has recognized consistently although not punishment in the legal sense the consequences of deporting an alien, who has lived here all his life and has his roots here, has extremely harsh consequences. 
    I submit that in a -- that type of case, there is no reason whatsoever to relax the normal rules of the standard of proof and the burden of proof assuming that we have this harsh statute and because of the nature, this harsh nature of the statute, if the petitioner and the evidence brings the petitioner within the meaning of the statute as interpreted by this Court, then he is unfortunately deportable and these harsh consequences must be visited on him. 
    But I see no reason whatsoever why the Government or this Court should stretch anything to force him within the scope of the statute rather than outside.

    The Government is asking the Court to retreat from Rowoldt and now establish a new standard at a much more stricter -- stringent standard of proof that was applied in the Rowoldt case.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    As I understand Mr. Rein, he's no longer arguing about the first issue which he presented to this Court. 
    That is whether the Board of Immigration Appeals erred in refusing to allow the reopening of the deportation proceedings for a second time to hear petitioner's proper testimony that he had never advocated overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence. 
    Now, since he is no longer making this contention, the Government's answer to this may be either irrelevant or if it's not irrelevant, it could be left to the brief. 
    I would just like to know that --

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3425.360" stopTime="3428.304">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The problem is that this case Rowoldt or wasn't it?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="3428.304" stopTime="3629.743">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    If that's the -- if that's his sole (Voice Overlap) issue. 
    If that's his sole issue, then he's also given up on another point which he wasn't quite so explicit on and that's whether he was denied any rights by the Court of Appeals in knowing -- having two judges to decide his second appeal. 
    I don't think that's a very serious issue. He only contends that this violated the spirit of the statute not its letter. 
    I think it's sufficiently answered in the Government's brief and I'll pass that over too. Turning now to what Mr. Rein says is the issue in the case, and that is whether the evidence was sufficient under the standards laid down by this Court in Galvan, Rowoldt, and Niukkanen, not merely in Rowoldt because Rowoldt doesn't purport to create a new standard, purports to follow the standard in Galvan and Niukkanen also purports to follow the standard in Galvan. 
    That under those standards, whether there was reasonable substantial and probative evidence as Section 242 of the 1952 Act requires to sustain petitioner's deportation. 
    I wish to underline the standard here is not the criminal standard. 
    It's not the standard in expatriation cases. 
    It's reasonable, substantial and probative evidence. 
    And under Rowoldt, in Galvan, and Niukkanen, that would be reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence of meaningful membership in the Communist Party. 
    Now, at the start, I'd like to emphasize that this issue has already been fully litigated. 
    The Board of Immigration Appeals found that the evidence was sufficient under the standard in Galvan in the first deportation proceeding. 
    After Rowoldt had been determined by this Court, the Board held that the evidence established meaningful membership in the Communist Party under the standards laid down in the Galvan decision. 
    In making this determination, the Board did not rely as petitioner contends on petitioner's mere membership in the Communist Party. 
    Instead the Board emphasized and this is -- Mr. Justice Goldberg pointed out that the actual findings are at page 2 of the record that after peti -- petitioner's active participation in Communist Party affairs, which the Board emphasized was totally unexplained unlike in the Rowoldt decision. 
    And the Board's determination was sustained in the face of explicit attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence by the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and then in the denial of certiorari by this Court. 
    After the Board refused to reopen the deportation proceedings for a second time, petitioner again attacked the sufficiency of the evidence in the District Court and the Court of Appeals, and both of these courts again denied these contentions. 
    This Court has repeatedly held that it will not reassess administrative findings of fact which have been carefully considered by the lower courts. 
    And we submit that it follows a fortiori in this case, that in the absence of the plainest kind of error, that the prior review of the Board's findings of fact in litigation which came through the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and to the -- this Court, the Highest Court in the land, should be conclusive here.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, I'm assuming that there's more content than just the con -- just the conclusion. 
    He says well I've read the Rowoldt decision and I am -- I'm going to testify to the conclusions there. 
    I assume that he's going to -- he's going to give to -- he's going to be specific as to why he joined the Party. 
    If that's un-contradicted by the Government and there's no reason to believe and the Government does not say that he had any other reason, and there's no way you can draw an inference from objective facts such as active participation in Party affairs which would contradict your statement, then we -- then we'd have Rowoldt.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, As I understand that the difference between the dissent and the majority of Rowoldt was in the -- was in the -- with the evidence, and also whether -- also whether -- well, I think it was mainly in the evidence that the majority said that there was no political implications in his joining. 
    The dissent in particularly relying on the appendix set out some evidence indicating that he did have political motivations in his joining and in his membership. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3888.273" stopTime="3909.854">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What the Court said was it meant -- may well have been devoid of any political implications. 
    But I do not read the opinion as resting on that fact. 
    I read it as resting on the fact that entails a consequence of deportation and it applies more solidity of proof than was [Inaudible] -- that was held there which was fairly set out in the dissent.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Your Honor, the only -- the only lack of the solidity of proof is -- is this lack. 
    I -- in this, it was just a general statement which wasn't going to be tied to any -- any of the specific evidence in the case. 
    The only thing that they specifically tied it to was this being devoid of any political implications. 
    And therefore, I have -- I have to assume --

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    I can agree readily on it that the test is a very loose one of what is meaningful, but I have found a difficulty of this term, up to this time, why -- that was not as much or more have justified deportation in Rowoldt as in this case?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="3958.649" stopTime="3988.258">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Your Honor, he -- the majority went on also to say and I gather that -- that this also a part of what it thought was lacking, presumably, he, Rowoldt had to live on something and further inquiry might have elicited that he was getting the necessities of life where he's worked in the bookshop nor was there a hint in the record that this was not a bona fide bookshop. 
    I -- the tenor of the opinion was that this was a man who was there for economic reasons and not for political reasons that under Galvan, this Court said, that person had to join the Communist Party as a distinct --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3988.258" stopTime="4005.715">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    He's been a member a year. 
    He went to all the meetings, paid his dues, and in addition to that, worked in the Communist bookstore. 
    It seems to me that your argument show that it takes a pretty heavy burden somewhere as to the kind of meaningful membership it is.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="4005.715" stopTime="4074.909">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, Your Honor, if you -- if you compare the facts in Niukkanen and in Rowoldt, they're not tremendously differently. 
    The only thing that Niukkanen had that was different than Rowoldt that I can see that's of any considerable importance is that Niukkanen didn't say he joined the Communist Party for any other than political reasons. 
    Now Niukkanen -- it is true there is evidence in the Niukkanen case that said that Niukkanen was in the “top fraction” of the Communist Party, although Mr. Justice Douglas in his dissent that he said he wasn't a functionary. 
    I -- assuming that the Court of Appeals was right that he was in the “top fraction” of the Communist Party and further that he discussed Communist actions with other people in the Communist Party. 
    I still -- that evidence doesn't advance you tremendously past Rowoldt unless you emphasize the distinction that in Niukkanen, that alien did not explain why he was in the Communist Party. 
    That's -- that is the major distinction and this is the major distinction which has been seen by the Courts of Appeals. 
    He too was --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4074.909" stopTime="4108.161">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Terris, let me ask you this question. 
    Assume -- let's discard for the moment that the ex parte statement that Rowoldt made at the time he's arrested to the effect that he joined the Party for bread and butter, or words to that effect, let's exclude that from that case. 
    Is there any meaningful difference between Rowoldt and this case with the exception of that?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="4108.161" stopTime="4140.109">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    There is evidence in this case that is different and it seems to me in at least three important respects why this case is stronger. 
    First in Rowoldt, the alien was a member of the Communist Party for a year, as long ago was 1935. 
    Now, that's a very, very different situation than a man who is a member of the Communist Party in 1948 to 1950.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4140.109" stopTime="4141.754">

    Two years instead of one.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="4141.754" stopTime="4170.301">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That -- that difference but also more important is the time. 
    In 1935, it was not -- is well known that the Communist Party was an active political organization with particular views. 
    Now, it's very hard for me to believe that any average and the intelligent person, in 9th -- who was living in this country in 1948 to 1950 had any doubts that the Communist Party was an active political organization.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    There -- there was one discrepancy in the testimony which was not brought up before the special inquiry officer. 
    Nobody noticed it. 
    It was -- he said at one point that Elorriaga said at one point the petitioner attended meetings regularly, I think it was maybe two or three times a month over the two-year period. 
    And then later on, he said, that he had seen him at two or three meetings in 1949 and 1951. 
    Now nobody noticed this discrepancy when the hearing was actually being held, and so it wasn't brought to the attention of the Government or the witness that he had testified in contradiction to himself. 
    The Board noticed the discrepancy.

    It may well be that Scarletto could testify.

    As I read this record, those two witnesses testified and nobody asked them, did he take any part from the meetings? 
    Did he say anything? 
    Did he preside at the meeting? 
    Was he a head of any committee? 
    Did he do anything? 
    And some of these meetings, most of them were as small as six people.

    Let me say -- I don't know that this is relevant but Mr. Justice Goldberg asked what employment he had. 
    The record indicates and I gather maybe he's had different jobs. 
    The reason for this, there's one point in the record which Scarletto says that he left to sell insurance for a while. 
    And then the alien registration form when he -- that he filed with the Government indicated that he was self-employed in the ice business.

speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="4886.225" stopTime="4959.594">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    But of course, that isn't the test under this provision of the statute. 
    I mentioned one other thing about what he did in the Party. 
    There is -- there is a statement that the reason he didn't attend more meetings -- and by the way the number of meetings to be absolutely accurate that Scarletto testified to is two or three in the El Sereno Club. 
    He was in two clubs, two or three in the El Sereno Club at the beginning of 1949 and at least 15 or 16 in the Mexican Concentration Club from 1949 at least through 1950. 
    Now, there's an indication why he didn't attend more meetings and that is, Scarletto says that he was occasionally transferred out by the Party to other work. 
    Scarletto apparently may not have known what the other work was or at least he didn't testify to what it was. 
    But that may explain why he didn't attend more meetings although he was a regular member of the unit. 
    He paid dues regularly and sometimes had amounted to a considerable amount of money because they had special assessments. 
    Now, I haven't yet come to the issue which Mr. Rein says this is the heart of the case and I think it may indeed be, and that is this issue which may be called the burden of proof issue.

    I can't -- can't remember the exact amount but some of those I think if my recollection is correct, would amount to $25 or $50, I may be wrong, Your Honor. 
    I -- it's not in this portion; it's not in the printed record.

    Galvan was 1944 to 1946 and Niukkanen was 1937 to 1939. 
    That's what we think the evidence here on this fact and I think it is an important fact.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, but Rowoldt purports to apply this standard. 
    That's the reason I think it's significant. 
    Galvan says that the test is whether you join the Communist Party as a political organization. 
    This Court said in Rowoldt that he joined the Communist Party for economic reasons. 
    Now, that's --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5054.764" stopTime="5104.501">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    No. 
    It didn't quite say that. 
    It said that he was not devoid of evidence from which it might be inferred that he joined for something else besides political reasons. 
    But that case unless I'm wrong that I rest on this, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter who wrote it that deportation is a very, very serious thing. 
    It must not be lightly considered to reach the conclusion that should occur, particularly in reference the man has been there 40 years and that it's got to be something more than membership. 
    This man had membership. 
    That was -- it was the approach that the Court took to the effect of deportation on the man. 
    And I don't see where it could be said that it didn't -- it didn't engraft a modification of their meaningful modification on Galvan.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="5104.501" stopTime="5111.297">

    I think it excerpted this test from Galvan and then applied it.

    And the majority says that was a question of fact. 
    They're going to accept the determination of the District Court and that -- and that under Rowoldt and Galvan, this was sufficient to show meaningful membership. 
    Now, the dissent says, that Niukkanen really hadn't done very much. 
    It says that he wasn't as functionary of the Communist Party. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals as I've indicated, said that he was a member of the “top fraction”. 
    If the dissent in Niukkanen is right, that he was not a functionary, he really wasn't very important at all, then I think Niukkanen is absolutely controlling on this case. 
    I am not going back into the record to find out whether the dissent in Niukkanen is accurate in the Court of Appeals and Niukkanen is wrong or the converse is true, but it's to the Government's benefit to if the facts in Niukkanen is weak as possible, I suppose.

    I hope you have argued on the basis a little more than that in it for this reason. 
    There should be findings of fact by the agency charged with the findings of facts that it's sufficient to support the conclusion. 
    I do not think we should be required to wade through this evidence of how much there is to make findings which the Board failed to make.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The challenge was to the fact that he said that to read that page is -- when I read it, I felt to agree with but it's largely just a recital of evidence.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    The thing is perfectly clear from page 2 that that paragraph, one of the findings of the Board. 
    We believe this record establishes the respondent's membership was voluntary, that's the last sentence of that paragraph.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I'd assume that means that the things that are stated in that paragraph are accepted as true by the Board. 
    Now, the Government says that what's found in that paragraph is sufficient under Rowoldt, and the absence of any explanation whatsoever by the alien.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5472.878" stopTime="5481.938">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The first sentence and that last sentence from the paragraph relates to whether his membership was voluntary. 
    That finding is that he was a voluntary member --

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Right.

    Right. 
    But Your Honor, let me try -- I don't think I am making myself clear. 
    That paragraph says that the following facts are true. 
    We've looked at the record. 
    We've accept it's true the following facts and they've followed a series of facts, the dues, the meetings and the like. 
    They say on the basis of those facts, we make a determination; the conclusion that respondent's membership was voluntary.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's right, voluntary.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Okay now, then Rowoldt was decided, but the alien argued to the Board that Rowoldt was controlling that the facts which had been established did not show meaningful membership, but the Board then said -- the Board then said that the facts in the record established meaningful membership. 
    Now, those facts that it had found are on page 2.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But those facts that they had there, if you call that a finding of fact, relate to being voluntary. 
    They do not, as far as I'm concerned, the facts they've stated there, if you call them findings, do not support any different kind of membership to that of Rowoldt.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="5547.546" stopTime="5553.172">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris

    No, well, what I'm trying to say is this. 
    Underneath each one of those general sentences, there are number of specific facts that are testified, they didn't testify it generally as these sentences would indicate.

    That's all I'm -- he attended executive meetings and he attended the convention. 
    That's -- that's all I'm suggesting by that. 
    These -- these conclusory sentences as to facts, grouping facts within -- with one -- within a general statement, we submit, are sufficient under Rowoldt to establish meaningful nature.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    If we went outside those findings and took a -- found something in the record that was entirely independent of those findings, different and said this supports the meaningfulness, do we have a plenary problem here or --?

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean if -- you mean -- I thought that -- it's pretty well settled that if an agency made findings, subsidiary findings, we look to them to make the findings and we didn't go look to see if other findings could have been made by them from other evidence.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, Your Honor, we -- of course this is a -- this is a -- the Board found that it believed Scarletto and it believed Elorriaga. 
    Now, I think anything they testified to can be used to support this. 
    I don't -- I don't want to press this too far because I don't think you're going to find very much other than things that are concluded within those sentences. 
    And I don't -- I think we could have a discussion but it would be -- it would be pretty theoretical --

    Now, I'd like to turn in the time I have left to the issue of -- that petitioner calls the burden of proof. 
    And he emphasizes that the Board said at one -- in one of the opinions, that there wasn't a great deal of evidence showing petitioner's awareness that he was joining the Communist Party as distinct political organization. 
    Petitioner emphasizes to show that there wasn't proof satisfying the standards of Galvan and Rowoldt. 
    But as the Board and the lower courts have all held, if petitioner had not known that the political implications joined the Communist Party, it was his responsibility to come forward with such evidence just as Rowoldt had done. 
    We submit there's nothing --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Does your case depend on our taking at that adopting a theory that we believe when a man is being deported or when a man was being tried for something, and the Government failed to put up enough evidence, somehow when he puts up a certain amount, changes the duty, and makes him -- go follow it to put on the evidence.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    No. 
    The Government's argument is this evidence is sufficient to establish meaningful membership. 
    We say that the normal inference that can be drawn from somebody showing up at the Communist Party meetings for over two years paying dues, attending a party convention, attending executive meetings is that he knew what he was doing, that he was joining a political organization. 
    We say that's the normal and reasonable inference that you can draw that kind of an inference in any kind of case.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Your Honor, that's -- that's what this Court said in Galvan and then said again. 
    That's right. 
    That's -- that's -- that's the Government's position and we say that you can draw that inference from an active participation in Communist affairs. 
    And this isn't a novel doctrine that the Government is suggesting. 
    You can do this in criminal cases. 
    In fact, in criminal cases, the burden may even be on the defendant to come forward with evidence not the burden of proof and I wanted to distinguish the burden of proof. 
    We have the burden of proof.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6397.790" stopTime="6410.411">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I've never been able to understand that difference. 
    I tried to explain my difficulty, the first year I was on this Court, an explanation that I've never been able to understand that there's any distinction between those two ideas.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="6410.411" stopTime="6416.578">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Your Honor, I -- I'm trying to explain the distinction.

speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="6422.407" stopTime="6478.956">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    The distinction as I see it is, that for certain types of things that are peculiarly within the knowledge of one party, it is required to come forward, but the finder of fact in assessing the proof which is before it assesses it on the basis that the burden of proof is on maybe -- it maybe on the other party. 
    Now, in this case the burden of proof is on the Government, but we don't have to go as far as that. 
    We say the normal inference from this -- from these -- from the facts in this case isn't membership in the Communist Party knowing that it is an active political organization. 
    Now, we say if there was any evidence to rebut this normal inference which could have been -- we say that kind of inference could be made in the criminal case and this -- and here of course, the standards that the burden on the Government is considerably less, that if that could be done in the criminal case, it fairly can be done in this case.

    That's enough.

    What's made by the burden is that if he wants to win this case is that -- if defendant wants to win the case that time, he better do something about your case.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="6493.253" stopTime="6718.972">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right. 
    Now, if he comes in and says as in Rowoldt that I joined the Communist Party for nonpolitical reasons, then the standard which the Board applies in evaluating that evidence like the Government's evidence is the Government had the burden of proof. 
    We do not say and as far as I know, none of the -- the Board did not say it, that the burden of proof shifted to the alien in the sense that he had to prove something by substantial evidence. 
    Now, I'd like to turn finally to the Scales decision. 
    And this as members of the Court have indicated the Scales decision did not involve as to the facts which were before it, deportation and all involved the criminal prosecution under the Smith Act. 
    And we don't believe that a modification in the standards for deportation which involves an entirely different statute and in fact an entirely different constitutional basis should be inferred from the Court's opinion in Scales unless the Court made that modification extremely clear. 
    Now, all that the Court said in Scales and this is what petitioner relies on, this Court in passing on a similar provision requiring the deportation of aliens will become members of the Communist Party. 
    The provision which rested on Congress is far more plenary power over aliens and hence did not press nearly so closely on the limits of constitutionality as this enactment that is the -- the Smith Act, had no difficulty in interpreting membership there as a meaning -- as meaning more than the mere voluntary listing of a person's name on party roles. 
    Then the Court cited Galvan and Rowoldt. 
    A similar construction is called for here. 
    Now, we say that all these sentence means, all these two sentences mean is what the Government concedes that more than mere membership is required both for deportation and for a prosecution under the Smith Act. 
    Now, we submit there's no basis for believing that this Court sub silentio in dictum overruled Galvan and Rowoldt and Niukkanen. 
    But even if Scales did modify those cases, we submit that the evidence here as to active membership was sufficient under the test laid down in Scales. 
    The Court said in Scales that the element of activity in the proscribed membership stands apart from the gradient of guilty knowledge in that the former, that is activity, may be shown by defendant's participation in general party affairs whereas the latter, the guilty knowledge requires linking him with the Party's illegal activities and we think the evidence here is plain. 
    The petitioner did actively participate in general party affairs. 
    He paid dues, he attended numerous closed meetings of his unit, he attended a party convention and attended executive sessions for his Party unit, and he was apparently an officer of the unit. 
    Therefore, we submit that the Board applied proper legal standards, the standards laid down in Galvan and Rowoldt in finding the petitioner was a meaningful member of the Communist Party. 
    This finding is twice been upheld by the District Court and twice been upheld by the Court of Appeals. 
    We submit that the lower courts were correct, that the Board's determination, the petitioner was a meaningful member of the Communist Party. 
    It's supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence, which is what Section 242 of the Act requires. 
    And therefore, the Government submits that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.

   Rebuttal of David Rein
speaker="david_rein" startTime="6721.089" stopTime="6843.301">
    Mr. David Rein 
    I'd like briefly to discuss the point about the actual findings of the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
    As Mr. Terris has indicated, the Board first made its findings before Rowoldt. 
    The petition for reopen was filed asking it to reconsider the case in the base -- on the basis of Rowoldt or at least to reopen. 
    And it's significant that in that decision, in which it considered the meaning of Rowoldt, this is what the Board said it had found and what its findings were. 
    And here are findings at page -- it appears at page 6 of the transcript, membership in the Communist Party was found to have been established on the testimony of Government witness, Scarletto, who testified that he had collected Communist Party dues from the respondent and had attended closed meetings of the Communist Party with him, and the general corroboration offered by the testimony of Government witness, Elorriaga. 
    Those are your findings are meant, the Board goes on to say at page 8, there was little development of the respondent's awareness of the fact that he belonged to a political organization. 
    When the case went back, it wasn't at the question of the respondent not offering evidence, the Government offered no evidence. 
    And mind you, in this particular case, they had a witness who was an undercover informant for the FBI who according to the Government had observed the respondent over a considerable period of time and had adequate opportunity to testify to anything that he did. 
    The fair inference to draw from the lack of any testimony is that there was no test -- there was no activity to testify to. 
    And I submit that where the Government has an opportunity to present testimony of “meaningful association,” has witnesses who would have knowledge or that if there were and presents no such testimony, it is certainly as fair an inference to conclude there was no “meaningful association” rather than to say that the Government had to prove it. 
    One last point --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6843.301" stopTime="6850.025">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6855.869" stopTime="6856.632">

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6857.407" stopTime="6858.566">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Scarletto, that's what I'm asking.
speaker="david_rein" startTime="6858.566" stopTime="6925.017">
    Mr. David Rein 
    The other one, the Board indicated, they could not rely in his testimony. 
    I wanted have one further point. 
    There's been much discussion here that Rowoldt joined the Communist Party merely to get something to eat. 
    I wanted to indicate and I want to read now from the opinion in Rowoldt, in which Rowoldt, the Court says, Rowoldt then explains his reasons for joining the Communist Party, “the purpose was probably this. 
    It seemed to me that he came hand in hand, the Communist Party and the fight for bread. 
    It seemed to me like this. 
    Let's put it this way that the Communist Party and the workers' alliance had one aim to get something to eat for the people. 
    I didn't know it was against the law for aliens to join the Communist Party and the workers' alliance.” 
    Now, it's perfectly clear that Rowoldt was not joining the Communist Party to get a hand out. 
    He did not think it was a salvation army. 
    He joined it as an organization which he thought would help get people food generally. 
    It was not personally to get food. 
    Now, I just want to make that point clear. 
    Thank you.
