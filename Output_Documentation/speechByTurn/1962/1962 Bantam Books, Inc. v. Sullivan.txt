    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    Mr. Chief Justice and other members of the Court. 
    The Rhode Island Supreme Court in sustaining constitutionality of both the resolution and of the Commission's actions in sending out its notices remanded the case to the Superior Court for the entry of a final decree in conformity with its majority opinion. 
    The facts of this case are undisputed and they are as follows. 
    Between July 1957, which was shortly after this Commission began to function, and early 1960 when this action was started, the Commission sent out to booksellers throughout the State of Rhode Island and also to sellers of magazines, at least 35 separate notices, each listing books and magazines which the Commission had found objectionable for sale or youth -- or display to youth under 18.

    The statute creating the Commission. 
    It's the Commission to encourage the morality in youth, but that to recommend prosecution of all the state obscenity laws including those which apply to it -- to adults.

    The public.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Everybody not just the young kids.
speaker="horace_s_manges" startTime="123.275" stopTime="363.500">
    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    That's right. 
    By early 1960, the Commission admitted that it had found 108 books and magazines thus objectionable. 
    One of the recipients of these notices was the firm of Max Silverstein and Sons of Providence which was the exclusive wholesale distributor of appellant's books for 70% to 75% of the State of Rhode Island including all of the City of Providence. 
    The first notice that the Silverstein firm received was dated July 19, 1957. 
    It appears at page 55 of the record and as you will note is on the official letterhead of the Commission as were all the other notices. 
    It contains several significant statements and I should like to read some of them. 
    This agency was established by a legislative order in 1956 with the immediate charge to prevent the sale, distribution or display of indecent and obscene publications to youths under 18 years of age. 
    “The Commissioners have reviewed the following publications and by majority vote, had declared that they are completely objectionable for sale, distribution or display for youth under 18,” then those three magazines, and then it goes on, “The Chiefs of Police have been given the names of the aforesaid magazines with the order that they are not to be sold, distributed or displayed to youths under 18 years of age. 
    The Attorney General will act for us in case of non-compliance. 
    The Commissioners trust that you will cooperate with this agency in their work.” 
    And then the notice ends, “thanking you for your anticipated cooperation”. 
    A further Commission threat to recommend prosecution to the Attorney General is contained in another Commission notice being petitioners' Exhibit 11, we being the petitioners down below. 
    That Exhibit appears at page 76 of the record and I should like to read the last two sentences. 
    “Your cooperation in removing the listed and other objectionable publications from your newsstands will be appreciated. 
    Cooperative action will eliminate the necessity of our recommending prosecution to the Attorney General's department.” 
    This coupling by the Commission of the word “cooperation” along with the mention of Attorney General's action makes it quite clear that when this Commission used the term “cooperation” in these two notices and the other 33 notices it meant to convey to booksellers a message. 
    “You either take these books and magazines off sale or else we're going to see to it that you'll be recommended for prosecution.” 
    Now, to make -- to make certain that this message would register with the booksellers, the Commission notified them that they were sending copies of all these notices to the Chiefs of Police throughout Rhode Island and the copies were so found.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    The question I want to ask you was, is there any record of the prosecution that had been brought in Rhode Island pursuant to recommendation of the Commission?
speaker="horace_s_manges" startTime="374.041" stopTime="394.226">
    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    Well, there is one statement in the Commission's annual report of 1960 that on seven cases that was cited by way of their injunction that there were three convictions and that there were three acquittals.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="394.226" stopTime="397.081">

    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    Yes sir, there's one -- there's one criminal prosecution where the defendant in connection have taken place. 
    The jury convicted and had the verdict set aside on the ground that one of the jurors was just to be related to the chief complaining witness.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="425.103" stopTime="426.685">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    They never had strategy?
speaker="horace_s_manges" startTime="426.685" stopTime="592.934">
    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    No. 
    And about two years have gone by since -- since that. 
    But the Commission was not satisfied with sending these copies to the Police Chiefs. 
    In every case, they followed up with a questionnaire to the police. 
    On this subject, the appellee McCallum, the Executive Secretary of the Commission testified and I quote from page 45 of the record, I asked him the question, “Will you tell us what do these questionnaires that are referred to in the minutes?” 
    Mr. McCallum answered me. 
    Answer: The questionnaires were sent to the various Chiefs of Police in the State asking them of why they had followed up any list if they admit any cooperation or any negative action. 
    The effect of this -- of these methods is shown by the fact that the record shows that within 10 days after everyone of these Commission notices were sent out, the firm of Silverstein received an inquiry from the Providence Police Department asking for a report of what action had been taken with the respect to every listed publication. 
    A police officer inquired as to how many copies of the publication Silverstein originally received, how many he had tried to recall from its customers, how many it had shipped back to the publishers. 
    So you see that this procedure produced the desired effect of frightening all of the sales, books that had been listed by the Commission as objectionable. 
    Thus, the record shows that every time Silverstein received a list of publications, it took off sale every copy, it sent out its field man to its retail customers and recalled every copy, and then it took all the unsold copies and shipped all of those copies back to the publishers. 
    Silverstein took this action as its manager Kaplan testified. 
    And I quote from page 25 of the record at the bottom of the page, “Rather than face the possibility of some sort of a court action against ourselves as well as the people that we supply”.

    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    I -- I treat them, Mr. Justice Goldberg as a request to take them off sale completely, as typified by the Exhibit 11 at the bottom of page 76 where it states your cooperation in removing the listed another quote, “objectionable publications from the newsstands will be appreciated and cooperative action will indeed eliminate the necessity of our recommending prosecution.”
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="641.829" stopTime="653.603">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    And yet do all of the notices speak in terms as I see them in the record being objectionable for sale, distribution or display for youth under 18 years of age, isn't that correct?
speaker="horace_s_manges" startTime="653.603" stopTime="670.461">
    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    That's correct. 
    But also, Mr. Justice Goldberg, these notices were sent to all the wholesalers. 
    Now, the wholesalers weren't selling -- they weren't selling to those under 18. 
    The wholesalers were selling it to retailers. 
    So they're obviously trying to cut off at the source of supply.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Yes. 
    They are mostly -- there are more magazines than books. 
    The book taken place published by one of our appellants was on the list and by Grace Metalious or the book the Bramble Bush by Charles Mergendahl which is a very good seller, one of the bestsellers published by another appellant, Dell, was also on the list.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="735.277" stopTime="741.961">

    You would scarcely regard the books and magazines listed, the examples in good literature, would you?
speaker="horace_s_manges" startTime="741.961" stopTime="757.454">
    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    I wouldn't stand up to there being good literature but I don't think that they're obscene and I think they're still entitled to constitutional protection Your Honor even if they're judged as obscene. 
    I think many of them -- many of them are trashy in answer to your question.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="757.454" stopTime="764.935">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Wouldn't that be a good characterization of most of the books and magazines that were listed?
speaker="horace_s_manges" startTime="764.935" stopTime="939.404">
    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    I would say many of them. 
    In the Commission's -- in the Commission's report dated January 1960, it referred further to this question of withdrawal of publications and it began to do a little bragging. 
    And I'd just like to read a few lines from the report of the Commission which was a report that was sent annually to the Governor of Rhode Island and to the legislature that this particular report is the one of January, 1960 and I read from page 103 of the record. 
    This is below the middle of page, after the Commission states that the list found objectionable is now brought up to a total of 108 that goes on to say regardless requested by Chiefs of Police distributors and educators in 1957 of the type of publications deemed objectionable for youth under 18 is still sent to all local distributors and Chiefs of Police in Rhode Island with the result that in the last six months our newsstands so at very improved condition. 
    In most cases, local distributors have been cooperative this year withdrawing publications of the type listed in the Commission guide list and returning them to publishers. 
    This Commission feels that the guide list court action initiated by this Commission and the cooperation of the Attorney Generals Department is largely responsible for the new look, and I turn this quote on Rhode Island these days. 
    From the foregoing statement of the facts, it seems clear that the effect of this resolution and of the Commission's actions there under, has had the effect, then to suppress the circulation of books and magazines in Rhode Island without any prior judicial determination that they are obscene. 
    Now, it is true under the holdings of this Court that obscene publications are not entitled to constitutional protection. 
    It is equally clear as stated by this Court in Smith against California that no state has the power to restrict the dissemination of publications that are not obscene.

    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    In answer to your question, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I would say that the provision for recommending the prosecution aggravates the situation very seriously but even if there were no such power to recommend prosecution because that evidence can really recommend prosecution without an appropriation to order that effect. 
    The general impact of that was to inhibit the circulation of books because none of these -- this was not a nullity in meaning. 
    It's supposed to be a purpose in having this resolution. 
    Now, the average bookseller didn't want to tangle with the law and he saw how that if he didn't comply with the wish of the Commission, he would be getting in dot. 
    Now, he had to bear in mind that they were recommending prosecutions not only with respect to those under 18 but with respect to those over 18. 
    So if he incurred their goodwill, this could be a very serious limitation on his career and it would seriously intend to inhibit what he would be willing to carry in stock.

    I say in answer to the first part of your question, even though this expressed power to recommend prosecution hadn't been in a law, there would be impending that the imply -- the implication that this Commission had power to wield -- wield something, had some influence over these people and that they would thread slowly and that would inhibit the circulation of literature.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Suppose the obscenity statute -- obscenity statute itself said that before any prosecution is undertaken, the District Attorney has the duty to advice the prospective defendant that the book is deemed to be obscene and to give him an opportunity to withdraw the book, would that be bad constitutionally?
speaker="horace_s_manges" startTime="1298.015" stopTime="1359.989">
    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    I think that would be bad. 
    In Bantam Books against Melko which I argued before Mr. Justice Brennan in New Jersey, the prosecutor of Elizabeth County sent out notices to the county prosecutor. 
    “The book ‘The Chinese Room' is obscene. 
    And if anybody in this county sell ‘The Chinese Room', I'm going to -- I'm going to prosecute him.” 
    Now we contended that that was unconstitutional because if a prosecutor wants to prosecute, he should prosecute but he shouldn't threaten by saying that something obscene because a prosecutor hasn't have the right to determine what's obscene or has the legislature nor has economical legislature. 
    This is a court function and constitutional privileges should not be taken away lightly.

    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    He has, Your Honor, but if the prosecutor says to a man that he sees about to burn down a building, if you burn down that building, I'm going to prosecute you. 
    That's something objective. 
    He's got a perfect right to do that. 
    But if a man says, “I'm going to take away your rights under the -- under the First and Fourteenth Amendment and deprive you of freedom of press, if you publish this book,” I say no, that's very different. 
    As this Court has said, there's a difference obtained in the mind and the belly.

    Given the constitutionality of the obscenity statute, what is the difference?
speaker="horace_s_manges" startTime="1401.533" stopTime="1485.878">
    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    The obscenity statute -- the obscenity statute alone, every obscenity statute has a slight inhibiting influence. 
    As Your Honors said in Smith against California, but Your Honors also said when you dealt with the question of scienter that that is a different problem, it's a matter of degree. 
    The existence of an ordinary criminal actions, tearing of books in the face has a slight inhibiting -- has a slight inhibiting effect. 
    Yes, but that's minimal. 
    But he doesn't know -- he doesn't know whether he's going to be convicted of prosecution because he may have certain defense. 
    Scienter, he may read the book himself and if he reads it in good faith, this Court is left open whether he may have a good defense. 
    But if he has the threat of this Commission telling him or prosecuted telling him, these books are obscene. 
    There's no doubt about it. 
    This restrain is much greater. 
    So I say in each case, it's the question of degree and with the freedom of the press and the First Amendment this Court has said time and again that it would go slow in depriving people of their constitutional right.

    So the publisher always hears about this and he would just come in to defend his book. 
    In that way, even though the bookseller doesn't defend, he will, if everybody deliberately defrauds and I see no reason for not having the adjudication of obscenity.

    Mr. Horace S. Manges 
    Thank you, Mr. Justice Warren. 
    I'm saying that while it is true that publications that are obscene are not entitled to constitutional protection, it is equally true as stated by this Court that publications that no state has the power to restrict the dissemination of publications that are not obscene at the question of whether a particular publication is obscene or not obscene, involves a question of constitutional judgment as was stated by Mr. Justice Harlan in his concurring opinion in Alberts against California. 
    Such a constitutional judgment, we say, can be made only by a court. 
    Therefore, until a court decides what is obscene, we just don't know what publications ought to be deprived of their constitutional protection. 
    If the effect of a statute is to coerce the suppression of publications without a prior court determination, we have no assurance whatever that such suppression would be confined to publications that ought to lose their constitutional protection. 
    Such a statute would have a tendency to inhibit constitutionally protected expression. 
    That was just the kind of a tendency that led this Court to strike down the ordinance of Smith against California. 
    Now, I say this Resolution 73 has this very tendency because it confers the right and the duty on the Commission to educate the public as to any publication containing obscene or other, any et cetera is the word. 
    Now any book here plainly means specific books and the Commission has construed it that way. 
    Any education of the public as to what specific books are obscene constitutes and implies threat on prosecution unless the sale of those particular books is stopped. 
    And we say that that's what exactly what the Rhode Island legislature intended. 
    Now, in the Rhode Island Supreme Court, the rationale of the Court was mainly that there is no power here to order prosecution. 
    We say that power or lack of power is not the determining factor what is fundamental and what is inescapable here that this resolution which includes that confers on an official body that threat to recommend prosecution has had the effect of inhibiting the circulation of books in Rhode Island without the prior Court determination. 
    It gives some other reasons but they're dealt with it in the brief. 
    Now, I say to inject -- they said let us all do the voluntary cooperation and the record is absolutely the contrary. 
    And we say that to argue that this case involves voluntary cooperation is just engaging in semantics and nothing else. 
    These were threats from the beginning to the end and the result is you got 108 -- 108 publications taken off sale during that period. 
    And we don't know which one of them should have lost their constitutional guarantees. 
    And if this kind of procedure is allowed to go on, we don't know how many of the other states will encourage this and you have your adult population also deprived of what the Commission was talking about should not be published for those under 18. 
    We say that both the resolution on its face is unconstitutional because you can't have -- constitutionally have a non-court educate the public as to specific books. 
    And two, that the actions of the Commission are unconstitutional. 
    We ask the judgment below be reversed.

   Argument of J. Joseph Nugent
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="2421.096" stopTime="2557.528">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    It should be noted at the outset that the appellants here, the publishers, do not challenge the proposition that we're dialing in the exercise of this constitutional mandate may enact legislation which is designed to educate the public in good reading habits and at the same time to encourage morality in its youth. 
    In view of this, there are, it seems to me, two issues to you. 
    One is the resolution in question -- Resolution No. 73 constitutional and if so, are the acts of the Commission constitutional? 
    Turning first to the terms of the Resolution, it must be emphasized that the Resolution does not permit, allow or authorize directly or indirectly the impairment of any of the constitutional rights of the appellants. 
    The Resolution does nothing more than great -- grant state sanctions to a group of individuals whose authority is limited to educating the public of Rhode Island with good reading habits and to investigate in the objectionable material and were warranted making recommendations to the Attorney General. 
    The Commission has no power beyond that listed in the Resolution. 
    It is so limited. 
    The Resolution in my opinion does not operate and cannot operate to impinge upon any of the appellant's rights. 
    With reference to these notices, I think it's fair to state that these notices are merely guides to these six distributors in Rhode Island and their advisory in character, the distributor upon the receipt can either accept them in a spirit of cooperation or he can reject them, stand on his ground, and sell these books which are on the list. 
    I also want to point out --

    I don't think so. 
    In Rhode Island, we have a very peculiar system. 
    We don't have the County Attorney system or the District Attorney system. 
    The Attorney General has exclusive jurisdiction on the prosecution of all criminal cases. 
    And he has the final word on whether or not prosecution should be initiated. 
    The members of this Commission, the most they could do would -- they recommend and the fact is they'd have recommended in some cases that I initiate prosecution against some of these distributors. 
    But there is only one case and I say that didn't -- that case did not resolve this or did not come about as a result of these notices. 
    There's only one case in Rhode Island during the last five years where a bookseller had been prosecuted for violating the criminal -- the provisions of the criminal anti-obscenity statute, and that was in the Peyton Place case. 
    So that to say --

    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Well, the State prevailed on the jury trial level. 
    The verdict was said that the bookseller was guilty of selling an obscene book. 
    The implication being of course that Peyton Place is obscene but the trial justice granted a new trial on a technical legal ground unrelated to the question of obscenity.

    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    As far as I know, there was -- there are six distributors by the way in Rhode Island. 
    Four of them complied and two of them in effect stood their ground and disregarded these notices and went ahead which they had a perfect right to do. 
    And they sold these books, and the fact remains that not one prosecution was initiated as a result of them doing that.

    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    No. 
    They're no the -- well of course, some books around these lists that were not obscene as I understand it. 
    Some of these are so-called horror books around them, and as I say in my opinion, they did not come within the definition of this Court in the Roth case.

    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    No, I'm not. 
    And I might say that there have been books that have been submitted to me for review for appraisal and I have different, come to a different conclusion that the members of the Commission with reference to whether or not they were obscene. 
    And as a result, no prosecution was initiated.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2918.907" stopTime="2963.442">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But as a matter of practical effect of this Commission, if two of the main distributors of the State have distributed these things for six years now and four of them have gone entirely out of business so far as these publications are concerned, and many of them are magazines that could not be proscribed, doesn't it follow that there has been a restraint on the publication of literature that it is not unlawful?
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="2963.442" stopTime="3288.019">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Not in my judgment, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I feel that the distributor has the choice either to stand on his ground if he differs with the finding of the Commission that these books are objectionable and to sell these books at his peril and incidentally, since the decision of this Court in the Smith case in which as you recall this Court struck down a Los Angeles ordinance which made a criminal offense to sell obscene books without proof of scienter in that case. 
    I think that in order to successfully prosecute a bookseller for violating the provisions of the criminal anti-obscenity statute in Rhode Island that a person in authority such as the Attorney General should make a preliminary judgment and put these distributors and booksellers on notice that in the judgment of the Attorney General, such and such a book is, in his opinion, legally obscene and then of course the bookseller can stand on his ground and sell a book in his own peril, and take his chances in Court with a judicial determination as to whether or not the book is or it is not legally obscene. 
    We had that situation about a year ago in Rhode Island. 
    The book ‘Tropic of Cancer' if you recall that book was band from importation of the United States from 1935 until June of 1961. 
    And in the fall of 1961, the book was on display on the newsstands, our newsstands in Rhode Island. 
    A complaint was made some May firstly that in the opinion of this person, the book was legally obscene. 
    That was on a Friday afternoon. 
    I read the book over the weekend and I concur, and I made a public announcement on the following Monday that in my opinion, the book was legally obscene. 
    And the result was that some of the distributors who had issued these books and had them on the newsstands voluntarily recalled not one bookseller or distributor chose to take his chances in Court with a judicial determination. 
    There were some criticisms of my action in that case and -- but I welcomed a court test, but it never came about. 
    And so it is with this situation here as far as the actions of the Commission to encourage morality in youth. 
    I think it's important to recognize the phraseology of this Resolution. 
    In 1955 and 1956 in Rhode Island, we have a -- an increase in these so-called trashy magazine. 
    I think that was the characterization of my brother Mr. Manges, on with reference to some of these dirty magazines. 
    And the legislature recognized that the situation and it seems to me in the exercise of that constitutional mandate, they enacted this Resolution and they were very careful with reference to the phraseology. 
    I was a member of the legislature at that time and I remembered very well. 
    And it seems to me that they actually did two things. 
    First of all, in the very first paragraph, they authorized this Commission to educate the public that was probably used under 18 but also adults as well. 
    And then later on, it also said to investigate the causes of juvenile delinquency and to make recommendations to the Attorney General. 
    And it wasn't until July of 1957 that this Commission started to send out these notices. 
    I can frankly say, “Hey, I never saw these notices before they went out.” 
    But my predecessor, Mr. -- who is now on the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, Mr. Justice Powers, he did. 
    And he advised the members of this Commission to send out these notices, these guide lists which, in our judgment, are merely advisory and nothing more. 
    And the distributor, as I said before, can stand his ground and sell these magazines, books and magazines at his own peril. 
    This situation, this factual situation, I think is very important. 
    And it's quite unlike the situation you have in New Jersey in the Melko case, and that was around 1954 with reference to the book “The Chinese Room”. 
    And in that case, the county prosecutor, one of the counties in New Jersey, he made a statement and in his opinion that this books was obscene and that anybody who had it in their possession, any news dealer or bookseller should get it out of circulation and the result was the action was instituted against it. 
    And --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What was decided?
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="3289.466" stopTime="3336.875">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    In that case, there -- actually it was in 1953, Bantam Books secured an injunction in the Superior Court against the prosecutor. 
    The appeal limited it in the appeal, the Appeals Court, it limited their decision to the single book in issue, “The Chinese Room”. 
    It rejected as rule the Superior Court's ruling that the prosecutor lack the authority to promulgate list of objectionable books. 
    The prosecutor took this as a blanket endorsement of his activities and threatened a new drive, that's a next shift in the New York Times and also it's in the 38 Minnesota Law Review at 295. 
    But this is different because in New Jersey --

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    I think as it turned out, having in mind the Smith case, I think if something like this has got to be done today by somebody in authority such as a county prosecutor in those states where they have the county prosecutor system or in those states where they have the District Attorney system who prosecutes for the District Attorney prosecutes criminal cases, or as in Rhode Island where the Attorney General has exclusive jurisdiction of prosecution of criminal cases that he has got to do something like that. 
    In other words, he's got to make a preliminary judgment and what his opinion is to put these booksellers and distributors on notice.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3409.035" stopTime="3426.186">

    I presume that's frequently done in states by prosecutors with reference to different charges or offenses sometimes for them having passed on it.

    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Incidentally, the police department checked up on these books before the Commission ever came into existence. 
    They were just following up a new policy or procedure that's been in existence for a long time in Rhode Island starting out with the City of Providence. 
    They had an amusement officer. 
    They call him amusement officer. 
    They are used to pass upon films then the scope of his work brought him to other fields probably books and magazines. 
    And as far as I know, the Providence Police Department, at least I can say this, they were the most active to follow up these notices as they did with -- at the outset, they went to Silverstein's place and to find out how many books that run on the list were in circulation and what thing did they do as a result of receiving these notices. 
    I want to say this to the Court that in Rhode Island we're in favor of giving these publishers their day in Court. 
    They've never avail of themselves of it either in the Tropic of Cancer controversy, not that it was published by any of the publishing companies that Mr. Manges represents but even with references in having their distributors and I think it's worthy of note here that the distributors are not complaining, it's the publishers who are complaining. 
    The distributor and this man Silverstein is a very intelligent man as I remember the Rhode Island bar. 
    This, in my opinion, I can truthfully say as a voluntary act on his part to cooperate with this Commission. 
    And as a result of course his cooperation, the bookstands in Rhode Island according to the annual reports of the Governor are in better condition now with reference to obscenity than they ever were in the last ten years.

    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    First, I think it's designed to educate the public of Rhode Island with good reading habits.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It's just an ordinarily language what is its objective? 
    Why did they want to do this?

    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Well, they -- it's not a question. 
    I can put it in a negative way better I think. 
    It's not a question of telling to the adult public, of course, in both classes, adults and those under 18 what they can or cannot read. 
    It's merely in my opinion, they have another side of this right away.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3939.099" stopTime="3944.268">

    They want to keep obscene literature off the stands.

    Yes, indeed it is.

speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="3949.072" stopTime="3960.720">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Well they do it in two ways. 
    First of all, by sending out these lists to the distributors of books that are objectionable for sale, distribution and display to youths under 18. 
    That's one.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3960.720" stopTime="3964.430">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What hope to be accomplished by that?
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="3964.430" stopTime="3979.208">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Well, it seems to me that those notices are designed really in the hopeful expectation that these distributors will cooperate with these notices.

    Well --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    We'll not sell those books that had come to -- that had met the display of the Commission, isn't it?

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you, what's the difference in that expression which has recently come into both of exposure for exposure's sake on that?

    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    The distinction between the two?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4006.273" stopTime="4024.902">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes. 
    What is the object of what the Commission does except to expose for exposure sake, meaning to expose in order that the people will not sell these books, that the distributors will refuse to sell these books which have met indiscretion of the Commission.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4024.902" stopTime="4027.332">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    I'm not familiar with that distinction.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4027.332" stopTime="4038.539">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that the object that by publishing it and looking into them and sending the reports that will keep the booksellers from selling the books that have met the displeasure of the State Commission.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4038.539" stopTime="4041.806">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Incidentally, there's no publication of these notices. 
    These are sent for whatever (Voice Overlap)
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4041.806" stopTime="4085.004">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, whatever is done, I believe that all words do not fit. 
    What I want to find out here if the object and purpose of this Commission, you are certainly familiar with it, is I'm not saying it's wrong or that it's unconstitutional. 
    But if there are written purposes by getting these lists of books and giving such publicity to them as they do give, whatever that is, is not his or is not with the hope and the object on the part of the State of preventing the sale of those books and these large numbers of them in state.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4085.004" stopTime="4090.042">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Well, of course, as I say, I can put it to you this way.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4090.042" stopTime="4094.239">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, is there any other purpose except that?
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4094.239" stopTime="4108.616">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Yes, there is another purpose and it's an affirmative one, to cultivate good reading habits in the adult and not only the adults but those under 18. 
    They have another list, which they recommend, of books which are --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4108.616" stopTime="4116.022">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    In other words, directory have those read they want read, they think should be read, and those not read they think should not.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4116.022" stopTime="4116.386">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    That's right.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4116.386" stopTime="4120.841">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That of course could be done with reference to political books, couldn't it?
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4120.841" stopTime="4131.330">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Yes, but their recommendations as far as the reading of these books is concerned as I say, is not compulsory, it's not a mandatory thing on the part of anybody to accept it.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4131.330" stopTime="4159.240">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But suppose, probably they wouldn't do it but suppose the same Board as to your argument, in fact there has no -- there's nothing to do that's been constitutionally, suppose it puts out a list of those books that it thought the most desirable at the State's expense to be read and divided them according to parties and they would want a party over the other, books of one party over the other. 
    Would that be permissible?
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4159.240" stopTime="4162.211">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    They don't do that in Rhode Island.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4162.211" stopTime="4164.774">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I know that.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4164.774" stopTime="4166.408">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    And I don't think it'd be permissible --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4166.408" stopTime="4181.493">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    If it's not a state activity intended to reduce in some way the opportunity to read certain types of literature, then it wouldn't violate the law from the dividing up according to political basis, would it, or religious?
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4181.493" stopTime="4187.973">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Yes, you could go on and in other classification of people too.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4187.973" stopTime="4190.096">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But you of course wouldn't say they could do that.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4190.096" stopTime="4194.398">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    No. 
    I don't mean anything and I say they don't do it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4194.398" stopTime="4211.457">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, they have gone beyond obscenity and indecency, haven't they, because you say they have included in their lists some of these books that you describe as horror books that cannot be proscribed because of any violation of public morals?
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4211.457" stopTime="4214.628">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4214.628" stopTime="4244.433">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I was saying and wondering about the same things Justice Black would, how far can they go in that if it isn't -- if they don't want to stop proscribing or recommending the stoppage of horror books, then could they go to some other kind of literatures, some other kind of literature and until there'd be -- there would be a very clear restriction of literature.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4244.433" stopTime="4283.181">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    My answer to that is that if you come to the conclusion as I have that these notices, these guide lists are merely advisory in character not binding on anyone particularly the book distributors or the booksellers. 
    I say, if you come to that conclusion, then it seems to me that they have no value whatsoever as far as official sanction is concerned. 
    It's something that during on their own, they don't have any expressed authorization to do it in the Resolution which created this Commission.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4283.181" stopTime="4301.227">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I haven't been a prosecutor myself. 
    I always felt that there was some significance to the action of a -- of a state or body saying now either you do so and so or I'm going to go to the public prosecutor.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4301.227" stopTime="4302.090">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    That's true.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4302.090" stopTime="4313.636">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And I'm just wondering if that isn't using state -- the state to proscribe the same with these things.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4313.636" stopTime="4323.488">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    And yet if that's so, Mr. Chief Justice, the bookseller or the book distributor can take issue with the prosecutor and say --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4323.488" stopTime="4328.692">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It isn't the prosecutor he's taking issue with. 
    It's these other people who are initiating.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4328.692" stopTime="4368.030">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Members of the -- yes. 
    But I don't think there's anything in the law which prohibits a private citizen from going to the local prosecutor whether he'd be a District Attorney or County Attorney or the Attorney General in making complaint that in his opinion, the individual citizen's opinion that the distributor has, in his possession, a certain book which in his opinion is legally obscene and says to this distributor, “If you don't get it out of your possession, if you don't sent it back to the publisher, then I'm going over to the prosecutor and I'm going to make a square out a criminal complaint. 
    I think there's nothing else about that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4368.030" stopTime="4392.986">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well I don't know a private citizen can save to contract in a man in that manner but I do believe that a prosecuting officer could say after reviewing the book in his opinion it is and if he continues to sell it, that he's going to prosecute him. 
    I think that's alright. 
    I'm not so sure that a private citizen could threaten a man because that could come pretty close to extortion and a lot of cases.
speaker="j_joseph_nugent" startTime="4392.986" stopTime="4449.184">
    Mr. J. Joseph Nugent 
    Well, of course, I didn't use the word threaten, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I hope that it was not interpreted to mean that the citizen was threatening these bookseller or distributor. 
    He was merely putting him on notice of this thing, that in his individual opinion that this book was legally obscene. 
    Now, if you multiply that individual by nine as you have here, this is a nine-member commission, the only thing different about that and the result is that this Commission has been created by the state legislature. 
    Actually, it's a state agency. 
    And so from that standpoint, it has some standing but the important thing, I think, to remember is that they have no power to prosecute, to initiate prosecution that that is exclusively belongs to the Attorney General and as this Court has said on federal questions, he has the final word.

    Suppose the state legislature were to pass a bill which put these particular books on the list, they were to be published, that list were to be published in showing the public that the offenses in violation of the law, could the legislature pass that law?

    Well, for one thing, first of all, you have a -- the legislature by legislative fiat declaring that such and such a book is obscene.

    Yes, (Voice Overlap). 
    Yes, alright.

    Unknown Speaker 
    At page 33 of the record, there's the testimony of Mr. Gerald Kaplan, the manager of the Silverstein. 
    Incidentally, when I subpoenaed Silverstein, he said Kaplan knows more about this than I do. 
    Please have him as a witness because he is the important one. 
    That's why Mr. Kaplan was the witness, not Mr. Silverstein. 
    The question in 64, I said to Mr. Kaplan, page 33, “The substance, as I understand it, you stated that books -- that you took books on sale and refuse to accept anymore accounts, that you didn't sell anymore books was because in effect, you didn't want to get entangled with the authorities, with the Commission in connection with any court proceeding.” 
    Answer: “That is correct.” 
    That doesn't sound as though Mr. Silverstein was reading books were obscene. 
    Now, I turn to page -- there's a very -- page 111, this is my last reference. 
    Page 111 of the record, there is an interesting exchange between two members of the Commission, Father Flannery and Mr. McAloon, both appellees. 
    And this is their question whether this was voluntary compliance. 
    In the middle of page, Father Flannery, noted that he had been called about magazines proscribed by the Commission. 
    This is their own minutes. 
    This was what they're saying, their minutes of October 9, 1957, remaining on sale after list has been sent to distributors and police to which Mr. McAloon suggested that it could be that the same magazines were seen but there are probably was not the same edition proscribed by the Commission. 
    Father Flannery, pressing the statewide compliance by the police or anyone else to get the proscribed magazines off the stand, Mr. McAloon show the Commissioners, the questionnaire sent to the Chiefs of Police from this office and return to us. 
    The word ‘proscribed' in the American College Dictionary means prohibited as, Your Honors would well recognize.
