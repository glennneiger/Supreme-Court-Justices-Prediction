    Yes, that's exactly the point that I was coming to that there are explicit provisions -- in other words -- I was next going to say that it is also improvident to enjoin petitioner's testimony before the Commission particularly were there are specific provisions in the Waterfront Commission compact providing for judicial review of a “final decision or action”.

    Well, the respondent claimed that it was in violation of his federal rights that Cleary's testimony that if it were received by the Commission, violated his federal rights, he could -- if the Commission ruled against them, he could take that contention to the state court and if the state court ruled against them he could ultimately come to this Court.

    Now the Commission may or may not accept that contention and if an adverse determination were made against Bolger, he could then go to the state courts which may or may not accept the contention and if assuming an adverse determination all the way through, he could then come to this Court.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Irving Malchman 
    No sir, I do not.

    The claimed inadequacy of the remedy of law is that once the petitioner speaks then the state determination cannot -- will not be reversed by this Court.

    Mr. Irving Malchman 
    Well, that -- in other words, that by virtue of prior decisions by this Court particularly before Mapp v. Ohio that the evidence and the question was admissible that therefore, the state criminal defendant or the state criminal respondent did not have an adequate remedy at law that therefore, it followed that a federal injunction was necessary if the defendant's or respondent's federal rights were to be protected. 
    Now, under this argument, resort in effect has had to the equity side of this Court in order to circumvent or overrule the decisions of this Court rendered at law it is a completely anomalous procedure. 
    Our contention is that there's nothing magical about a proceeding in equity that a state criminal defendant or respondent does not transmute his federal rights simply by becoming a plaintiff in equity in the United States District Court that if for some reason, the decisions of this Court should not be followed or it goes -- a dissatisfaction with those decisions then -- or if those decisions should be overruled, this should be done directly in Fort Riley at law by this Court upon a reconsideration of the merits. 
    But this Court should not allow this to be done indirectly by a flanking attack which not only really obscures the considerations involved in the merits but which creates a needless and gratuitous conflict between the state and the federal courts.

    Mr. Irving Malchman 
    Well, as a result of this Court's decision in Mapp v. Ohio, the Court of Appeals of the State of New York which is the highest court in New York has gone further than this Court has gone and has held as we set forth in our reply brief that even an omission after an illegal search and seizure by a state officer that is an omission by a state criminal defendant, comes within the poisonous tree doctrine and therefore is inadmissible under Mapp v. Ohio.

   Argument of Joseph Aronstein
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="688.300" stopTime="693.159">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Aronstein.
speaker="joseph_aronstein" startTime="693.159" stopTime="968.654">
    Mr. Joseph Aronstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    It seems to me that there are but two questions presented upon this matter before this Court as set forth in the brief of the petitioner. 
    The first is whether it is an improvident exercise of federal equitable power to enjoin the petitioner from testifying in either a state court or before the Waterfront Commission of the Court of New York. 
    It seems to me that my opponent has avoided the very question that was raised initially in the District Court and also decided by the Circuit Court and that is this; what position did Cleary assume once he came in and aided and abetted the federal officers in committing these unlawful acts. 
    There is no question that the federal officers did commit unlawful acts because even Judge Anderson who dissented in the Circuit Court from that part of the opinion that continued the injunction in effect because at page 23 of the petition for writ of certiorari, Judge Anderson says this, “There was a good reason at the time of the issuance of the injunction by the trial court before the Supreme Court's holding in Mapp v. Ohio, supra, to encode within its reach, Cleary, the state official, to prevent a violation of Bolger's constitutional rights”. 
    So Bolger then had no other recourse. 
    So I must assume that Judge Anderson found that for the purposes of this case at least, Cleary became a federal agent when he aided and abetted these federal agents in the Commission of this illegal act. 
    And it is my understanding of the law that one who aides and abet others in the Commission of any illegal act becomes a part -- possible (Inaudible) conspiracy and any acts committed during the conspiracy are chargeable, this person at the jury is before the completion of the conspiracy. 
    Now, while it is true that the District Court and the Circuit Court confined their opinion to the fact that Cleary by being invited in by the federal agents listened to and observed certain things. 
    But as Judge Bryan said in his opinion, Cleary did more than that. 
    He became an active participant in these acts of the Customs officers. 
    Because when they brought Bolger back to 201 Varick Street, New York City at which time Cleary had been called by the Customs officers, both Cleary and Lockland, one of the federal Customs officers, compelled Bolger to empty his pockets, questioned him about some keys that he had and when they discovered that one of the keys fitted a storeroom in some apartment building, I believe it was at 75th Street Western Avenue in Manhattan, compelled Bolger to accompany them in an automobile, took him into this house, compelled him to open the door and conducted a search in his premises. 
    Of course, the petitioner would like to dispose of that matter by saying, well, there was no contraband found there. 
    But that is not the important thing whether or not contraband was found there or not. 
    The important thing I believe is that when they forced Bolger to empty his pockets, when they forced him to accompany them to 75th Street, and they forced him to open the door, Bolger's (Inaudible) acts, it were clearly illegal acts. 
    The same as the other acts committed by the federal officers prior to the time they took Bolger to Keansburg, New Jersey.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="968.654" stopTime="984.481">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Aronstein, have you any comment about the suggestion Judge Anderson made at page 23 in effect that Mapp makes clear that the state courts are bound to protect Bolger against the violation of Rule 5 (a)?
speaker="joseph_aronstein" startTime="984.481" stopTime="1021.139">
    Mr. Joseph Aronstein 
    I'm sorry, I don't agree with Judge Anderson, Your Honor, because if that's true then you might as well abolish 5 (a) because even if federal agents come in to a state court you can raise that question, I don't think he can. 
    I proceeded on the theory that Cleary became a federal officer for the pertinences of this case at least when he joined in with these other federal agents. 
    Now, it didn't make a better difference whether Cleary was a civilian or whether he was a state officer or an investigator for the Waterfront Commission or anyway.

speaker="joseph_aronstein" startTime="1092.064" stopTime="1213.427">
    Mr. Joseph Aronstein 
    No, it is not but it is my view that in view of the fact that this was conducted within the private offices of the Customs officials, it would be very difficult for anybody to stumble in. 
    I mean that would be assuming something that would -- to my mind, it would be almost impossible because if anybody did come in there that wasn't permitted there, they'd be properly chased out. 
    That's a government building, the Customs office and this was upstairs in the building, it was a Saturday and they have guards there so that the probability of anybody just stumbling in on these proceeding which was conducted in private offices maintained by the Customs officials is a very, very remote possibility and I don't think could be considered at all. 
    Now, I believe that not only did Judge Bryan but the prevailing opinion in the Circuit Court disposed of that question very aptly and at page 17, the petition for writ of certiorari where there appears the opinion of Judge Clark who wrote the majority opinion. 
    He said, in the Rea case, a federal official was disabled from passing the fruits of his illegal activities on to the state through testimony at a trial. 
    In the present case, the federal officials attempted to pass the fruits of their illegal activities on to the state by calling in state officials at the time of the illegal detention. 
    Now there is evidence in the record that Cleary was called in by the federal official. 
    That's not disputed.

    I understand that.

    Mr. Joseph Aronstein 
    So I say, so having him on -- invited there by the federal officials and haven't taken it -- taken an active part in this illegal act he at least for the purpose of the Rea case became a federal official and he is amenable to the federal rules of criminal procedure and he is also amenable to the provisions of the Constitution if he has violated any of these rules.

    You don't have to have the tape recording machine present at a criminal prosecution to convict a defendant provided to have evidence.

    They don't tell me what evidence they have. 
    I have to wait for trial so I don't know what other evidence they had in addition to this evidence. 
    All I know is that Bolger is charged for further time with petit larceny and the charge having been reduced from grand larceny.

    Mr. Joseph Aronstein 
    Well, even the -- even the making of the charge against him, Your Honor, resulted in the temporary lifting of his license so that now, Bolger has been deprived of work since I believe February of 1960, unable to get work in the Waterfront which was the only work he could do.

    They've lifted the -- by a temporary suspension.

    He has been working even after he was arrested on that charge. 
    He has lost his job as hiring boss but he is working as a longshoreman and then all of a sudden they come along and says, “You're out of work, give me your pass, its temporary lifted by an order of the Waterfront Commission”.

    And that brings me to the point of the second point of my opponent's petition and that is that this injunction is stopping the State of New York from proceeding with this trial, stopping the Waterfront Commission from proceeding with the trial, well, that isn't the fact at all. 
    There's no injunction against a state criminal proceeding. 
    There's no injunction against the Waterfront proceeding.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then I suppose if Mr. Cleary had some evidence that was entirely disassociated from this particular conversation and his association with the federal officers that he is not enjoined from so testifying, is he?
speaker="joseph_aronstein" startTime="1541.363" stopTime="1677.593">
    Mr. Joseph Aronstein 
    Of course not. 
    The injunction only enjoined him of testifying with respect to the alleged admissions or confessions made by Bolger or with respect to producing any of the evidence illegally secured by the illegal search and seizure of the Customs agent. 
    So when my opponent said that Cleary is a very important witness and that as a result of him being enjoined, the state cannot proceed -- what if -- well, as far as the state is concerned just now. 
    I say, that's an assumption on his part that's unwarranted from any evidence in this case at all. 
    The District Attorney of New York County is the one who is charged with prosecuting crimes and he is the one who decides how important or unimportant anybody's -- any witnesses' testimony is. 
    And nowhere in this proceeding from the variant section as the District Attorney come in and asked to be made a party and said that I'm being stopped from prosecuting this case because of this injunction. 
    And therefore, I don't think that this question is properly before this Court, and the fact that this state prosecution is being stopped because, as I point out my brief, the law charges the District Attorney with prosecuting all criminal indictments or charges. 
    And it's always been my understanding of the law that not only from a theory but some practical purposes in my experience that it's the District Attorney decides who is dispensable and who is indispensable as a witness. 
    So the fact that my opponent alleges that this injunction is stopping the District Attorney from proceeding with this prosecution, that is not so at all.

    They just say motion denied, defendant is found guilty and so therefore I have to appeal. 
    And I have succeeded on appeal on reversing the lower courts but from my experience the lower courts -- the constitutional questions and even questions with respect to evidence. 
    Very difficult to put across to these lower court judges despite the fact that you may file on memorandum citing authorities which I assume they are bound to follow whether they like it or not, that's the law, that's what I've been taught at law school anyway.

    To me -- to my way of thinking rather, the question as it has been resolved both by Judge Bryan and by the Court of Appeals in their opinion has disposed of this and I believe that number one, beginning about Mapp against Ohio when Bol -- when Cleary joined this unholy alliance of the Customs officers, he became a federal officer and he was amenable to the federal rules and the provisions of the Constitution. 
    It brings to my mind the line of cases where I distinctly recall a New York City police officer acting solely on behalf of the United States Government come in to the federal court with the case, the fact that the New York City police officer didn't make any difference. 
    They are bound by constitutional provisions. 
    They are bound by the federal rules. 
    Though I say, that there's no question that Cleary for the purpose of this case became a federal agent and that is what in the essence or in effect the opinions of the lower courts hold. 
    And so far as the second point of the prosecutions here delayed, in my brief, I state very clearly, very carefully that they could proceed any time they want with the prosecution. 
    I have gone in to the formal court special sessions in New York County which is now the criminal court because I have demanded a trial that this case had been on 29 or 34 times now and I'm on a trial and the District Attorney said, “Well, we're not ready and under my objection the Court has adjourned the case again”. 
    Of course we have a case in the New York Court of Appeals called Prosser against the United States where I suppose, I could ultimately claim that I haven't been given a speedy trial and therefore move for a dismissal of the information. 
    But they might say to me, but it's your fault, you've got the injunction. 
    But that's the way the situation is now. 
    I say to this Court with all (Inaudible) that the Waterfront Commission could have proceeded with their hearing. 
    The state courts would have proceeded with their hearing and we're ready to go ahead. 
    The fact that they may not have sufficient evidence to convict the defendant in that proceeding or sufficient evidence to sustain the finding that they can lift his Waterfront privileges and they'll form a line.

    Incidentally, does the lifting of the license depend upon a conviction under the information or independently of a conviction even an acquittal under the information, might they still would be able to lift the license?

    Mr. Joseph Aronstein 
    Oh yes, because in their allegations, they not only put the tape recorder in but it's my recollection that they put in every article that they took from Bolger's house, every article that they removed from Bolger's house. 
    Of course the subject matter in the state court is only the tape recorder.

    But may the Waterfront Commission lift the license without -- except on the basis of an actual conviction of a crime?

    Mr. Joseph Aronstein 
    Oh yes.

    It may?

    Mr. Joseph Aronstein 
    Yes, they could do it for conduct which in their belief is sufficient to undermine the morale of the arrest of the longshoreman. 
    They have a very, very broad policy, too broad I think, they and the Parole Board of the State of New York, in other words. 
    Thank you very much.
