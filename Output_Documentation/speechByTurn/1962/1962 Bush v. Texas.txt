Bush v. Texas

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    This case raises the question first, whether the State of Texas denied the petitioner merely because he is poor, an adequate opportunity to sustain a plea of insanity. 
    It raises beyond that, if in fact that’s what happened, made the State do this consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals in the State of Texas. 
    Petitioner was convicted of the crime of felony theft of having stolen a coin collection valued at about $600 from his employer. 
    As habitual criminal, the sentence was laid. 
    There is no issue here in regard whether the crime was committed or any matter of that sort. 
    The entire issue here has to do with the proceedings to determine his plea that he was not guilty by reason of insanity or that he was insane at the time of the trial and therefore not competent to stand in the trial. 
    The facts with regard to that issue are these: Petitioner was arrested and incarcerated in October of 1960. 
    He was indicted in February of 1961 and trial set for late April 1961. 
    Three weeks before trial, because the petitioner was indigent, the Court appointed an attorney to represent him. 
    That attorney on April 21st, 1961, three days before the case was set for trial, made two motions for the trial court. 
    In each motion, counsel recited that the petitioner was indigent, that he was without means to acquire expert assistance to sustain his plea of insanity. 
    In one motion he asked that the petitioner be committed to a state mental hospital for examination and observation of his mental condition. 
    In the other motion, he asked the Court to appoint a psychiatrist or that it provide funds to retain a psychiatrist to assist the defense in the trial of the case.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Wright, I know you're here trying to prevail on what seemed to you important constitutional questions, but I trust that before your argument is finished, you’ll tell us what do you think is the effect of the supplemental brief which had been filed for the respondent yesterday I think, showing that --
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="177.335" stopTime="285.369">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I'd be very glad, Justice Stewart, to tell you that immediately. 
    The supplemental brief which was filed I think sometime in the end of last week, I saw it on Sunday, sets out two things. 
    It sets out a report of a Dr. Hug, a state psychiatrist to examine the petitioner at the state penitentiary, the date is not shown in the supplemental brief, but the date was February 6th, as the original of this report indicates of this year. 
    Doctor Hug reports that the petitioner suffers from simple schizophrenia and that he has been not responsible or best partial responsible for his actions for many years. 
    Exhibit B of the supplemental brief, his statement, that under the statutory procedure which we have in Texas, the director of prisons has had the petitioner transferred from the state prison to the state mental hospital. 
    Now, the Court asked, what effect does this have on this case? 
    In my view, Your Honor, it has none. 
    It does not make the case moot and this, I take it, was the only purpose for which a document of this sort might properly be brought before the Court at this late stage. 
    Petitioner still stands under a criminal conviction. 
    He still is subject to being returned to prison. 
    In fact, the same statute under which he was transferred on I believe Thursday of last week to the mental hospital, Article 932-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure goes on to provide in Section 15, that if at any time the director of the mental hospital finds that he has been cured or, and I think this maybe more important in this case, if he finds that the prisoner will not benefit from continued hospitalization, in that event, the prisoner shall be returned to penitentiary to serve the unexpired portion of the sentence.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I was thinking, Mr. Wright, not so much of mootness as I was of a -- the equivalent of a confession of error. 
    This -- a psychiatrist this time employed by the State.

    So far as I'm advised, Mr. Justice White, and since I received the brief on Sunday, I'm not fully briefed on the point, but as best I can determine, I can find no collateral procedure available under Texas law by which this can be brought up. 
    There is a recent case, February -- 1959 of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in which on a petition for habeas corpus, it was undertaken to show that lately discovered evidence indicated that a person had been insane at the time of the act or at the time of the trial. 
    The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that this is not a matter which may be raised by this form of collateral attack.

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Mr. Justice Brennan, the Attorney General perhaps can speak with more authority as to what course the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals would take. 
    In that event, there are a few guideposts, I think. 
    We have a statute in Texas which provides that if after convictions and during the time that an appeal is pending and that I take it this present time, there should be reason to suspect the sanity of the convicted person then the proceedings may be suspended and the person may be committed to a mental hospital until such time to see he is well. 
    But the statute is very clear, it's Article 932 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Section 3, that during the period that the person is so confined, he is to be confined as a person charged with a criminal offense and that upon his release from the mental hospital, the criminal proceeding continues just as it would before. 
    Further in that connection, the Court of Criminal Appeals has held this is a matter which not -- may not be raised before yet, the case there is Gibbs versus Texas at 308 S.W.2d 515, where an application was made to the Court of Criminal Appeals in the case then pending before it that there was no reason to believe the prisoner is insane, and the Court of Criminal Appeals said this is not a matter for us, this is a matter only for the District Court.

    Justice Byron R. White

    The States -- if the Court wishes to listen to argument on the merits at this time, the State's position as I understand it, is that they gave petitioner an adequate opportunity to sustain his plea of insanity that the county health officer testified. 
    In our view, this is even without these late revelations from Doctor Hug, a demonstrably inadequate way to put to a jury the facts as to the mental condition of the person who stands accused of the crime. 
    And I think that this is demonstrated in a number of ways. 
    It is demonstrated by testimony in the record, Dr. Dial, the psychologist called by trial counsel testified at page 70 that the adequacy of a mental examination depends upon the training of the person who is made at -- Dr. Compton, the county health officer had no specialized training in psychiatry.

    This I think is the answer to the suggestion on the State's brief that if counsel had seriously wanted him to have expert testimony, they should have moved for further continuance with some inference that it would have been granted. 
    As I read the record, the inferences are entirely the other way.

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Yes, Your Honor, the motion was made. 
    It was made during the trial in the merits in April 25th. 
    Mr. Moore moved that proceedings to be continued and in order to permit examination by a psychiatrist or a psychologist. 
    The Court said, “I appoint the county health officer,” Dr. Compton who had already testified and who was neither, Mr. Moore said, “This is not satisfactory, we want someone trained in diseases of the mind”, and the Court said, “Your request is overruled.” 
    So the request was duly made that there'd be a continuance for that purpose. 
    If Dr. Dial's testimony as to the adequacy of training, being vital in determining the adequacy of the examination were not enough, we have in our brief at pages 10 to 14 listed a great many other authorities from Isaac Ray, a pioneer psychiatrist in 1838 down to the present, authorities both Psychiatric, Legal Judicial expressing the view that a general practitioner is not qualified to give expert testimony on this question. 
    I hope on that that my view is very clear because it seems to me that the State has perhaps misunderstood what we're contending. 
    We are not suggesting at all, that as a matter of constitutional law, the testimony of lay witnesses or testimony of a general practitioner is inadmissible in such a proceeding. 
    Whatever may be the desirable evidence rule, this is surely a matter which the States must regulate themselves. 
    It is our contention that this evidence however much may have is not sufficient to provide what the Constitution does require and that is an adequate opportunity to sustain the plea of insanity. 
    And so we say, what Dr. Compton testify if you want, but make available to the Court and the jury and defense counsel testimony of a person who is trained and who is able to give a truly expert opinion on the subject. 
    That we think was not present in this case. 
    If there were any further doubt as to Dr. Compton's testimony, I think that he perhaps gives the answer himself. 
    He demonstrates that he is not trained to make the determination of this kind when he had testified at page 135 of the record that he made the same sort of examination a psychiatrist would have made, except with regard to physical examination. 
    Now the record shows, the medical text show, judicial opinion show that the kind of examination he made would consist of only three things; a history, a history so incomplete that he did not find out that the petitioner had been adjudicated insane in 1924. 
    An inquiry as to whether the prisoner suffered from hallucinations, and simple test of orientations such as whether he knew who is the President of the United States, the record shows that this is not what psychiatrists do, that a psychiatric examination requires physical examination, intelligence test, electroencephalogram, test such the Rorschach test, as well as verbal test and a good many other varieties described in the record by Dr. Dial and described by other authorities in our briefs. 
    On the assumption, arguendo that the examination which was made was not an adequate examination, what is the constitutional requirement here? 
    On this point, there is very little law. 
    The only case from this Court in point is U.S. Ex rel Smith v. Baldie and although both sides managed to find comfort in various parts of the language of the Smith case, in fact, the Smith case does not on any view control this. 
    Smith was a habeas corpus action attacking a Pennsylvania conviction. 
    In the Smith case, psychiatrist had testified, the state psychiatrist, Dr. Drayton, who unfortunately was probably insane at the time he testified and two psychiatrists called by the defense. 
    The contention which was made in the Court of Appeals and here was that further psychiatrist should have been appointed in order to assist the defense. 
    That contention was rejected. 
    There was doubt as to whether a proper request had been made even assuming the request had been made. 
    This Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Reed said first, “We cannot say that the State has this duty by constitutional mandate” and this language is very comforting to the State, but the Court went on to say, the language which comforts petitioner, psychiatrist testified that suffices. 
    And that I think puts Smith quite aside from our case, where there was no psychiatric testimony, unlike Smith, where there was testimony for both sides by a psychiatrist. 
    We find constitutional support for our position in three separate lines of argument which we hope converge the same conclusion. 
    The first is simply the Due Process Clause, that there is no fundamental fairness if a man is asked to stand trial without the kind of testimony which every professional group, every learned writer, a great many courts, legislatures more the half of the States say is necessary in order to determine whether or not he is sane. 
    This is a proceeding so fundamentally unfair as to constitute a violation of due process. 
    But we add specificity to that argument by looking to the right of counsel. 
    Surely here was a case as the Texas Court held in Ex parte Bush in 1958 where there was a constitutional right to counsel no matter what variation of Betts v. Brady one accepts, this was a case where counsel must to be appointed. 
    What then does the right of counsel mean? 
    Surely it would not be enough to satisfy the requirements of Powell v. Alabama to name as counsel for an indigent, Mr. Lewis, though he's quite learned in the law because he's not a lawyer. 
    It would not be enough to name a lawyer who does not do a competent job. 
    Now, we didn't have either of those in our case. 
    The state in its brief refers to the able and astute counsel for the defendant, a Mr. Moore who was the trial counsel, I think fully merited those compliments in the best tradition of the profession representing a defendant. 
    But what is Mr. Moore to do as trial counsel for an indigent if he had been appointed to represent a deaf mute to use, Judge Biggs example, and had not been furnished with an interpreter, there is no way he could exercise this professional talents, no way in which he could provide effective assistance to the petitioner. 
    Similarly here, he is asked to defend a man where the -- virtually the only issue in the case is the issue of the man's insanity and he has to do it without any professional help. 
    He has to do it without any testimony which even he can cross examine which is truly competent to qualify. 
    Now it is true, as Mr. Justice Goldberg pointed out, that the trial counsel was able to obtain Dr. Dial, a professor of Psychology at Southern Methodist University obtained for the trial. 
    It is true also that because of the action of the court, the examination by Dr. Dial was entirely an inadequate examination, a 20-minute examination from which he said he could draw no conclusions. 
    And the State in their brief suggest that since it is a principle of medical ethics that the indigent always have a call on doctors that the counsel should -- could surely have gone out and found a doctor, a psychiatrist to testify if he wanted to. 
    I think there is variety of answers, if the Court please, to that argument that this is to me is the most helpful answer to it. 
    It is also a principle of legal ethics that the indigent have a call on the services of lawyers and yet we do not ask that an indigent defendant go out and find his own lawyer. 
    The Constitution puts the responsibility on the trial court to obtain a lawyer to help the indigent defendant. 
    And we argue similarly that it should not be for the Court appointed counsel to go out and beg and hunt for a doctor that if a doctor is a constitutional requirement then it is the Court, the impartial administrator of justice which should carry the duty of making the doctor available, not the counsel. 
    Finally, if the Court please, we argue from the implications of Griffin v. Illinois where the opinion of Mr. Justice Black for a plurality of the Court said that there could be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has and this, I submit, is precisely the situation. 
    No one doubts that a defendant of means in Texas will have psychiatric examination and psychiatric testimony even if there are as the State shows psychiatrists in only 34 of our 254 counties, the psychiatrist will be there if there is a wealthy defendant. 
    And if the psychiatrist is there for the defendant the State somehow, I suggest, will have counsel there, a psychiatrist there also. 
    The only reason there was not a psychiatrist testifying the case of State against Bush was because Bush was too poor to hire a psychiatrist. 
    And that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1670.979" stopTime="1703.381">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How far do you think those implications go? 
    I suppose a man who is rich enough and I -- there are a good many rich men in Texas, he could get the very best psychiatrist. 
    He wouldn't be confined to Texas. 
    He might -- they might -- the best one in the United States might by common consent be in New York or San Francisco. 
    He could get him. 
    In other words, the -- those implications don't -- you can't read the literal language of that sentence which you quoted from Griffin against Illinois to the -- for the extreme implications of the State's opinion.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1703.381" stopTime="1743.938">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, I can accept that sentence from Griffin at least as an expression of the ideal to which we strive of the practical problems of course are very difficult. 
    But I think that we already have a set of answers in the decisions which have been worked out as to the right to counsel. 
    The right to counsel for an indigent does not include the right to go to Wall Street and hire the most expensive lawyer available and yet, there is some bare minimum which it does require. 
    It does not mean that someone just out of law school with a freshly signed license who does an incompetent job will be enough. 
    Is it similar beyond there and I know of no rule by which one measures it. 
    This I should think would be the answer with regards to psychiatric health.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1743.938" stopTime="1762.995">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the rules still does -- I mean, the facts whatever the rule may be and whatever the ideal may be, the facts of life are that for better or for worst, the kind of a trial a man gets does to an extent depend on how much money he has and how good his judgment is in selecting lawyers and doctors, isn't that true?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1762.995" stopTime="1763.651">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright

speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1768.798" stopTime="1783.115">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Well that the rules could do a good deal toward minimizing the disparity. 
    And I think if you deny the lawyer altogether or if you deny a psychiatrist altogether, the disparity is too great to be constitutionally tolerable.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1783.115" stopTime="1792.549">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's a matter of degree then because here you did have a physician who had studied psychiatry in medical school.

    There is nothing to show that Mr. Justice Clark nor is there anything to show that there was any examiner available who would come to make the examination prior to that time. 
    So far as the record reflects the first opportunity, Dr. Dial had was during the recess on April 24. 
    The record also shows that Dr. Dial had never met Mr. Moore before that day. 
    And I think the -- a fair inference can be drawn from the record as to the difficulty which appointed counsel have when they have no fee to offer in getting a professor or some other expert to come to another place and make this kind of an examination.

    No, Your Honor, I would say this. 
    Of course I'm Waxahachie, not in Austin. 
    This was made, I suppose, in Huntsville and the psychiatrist who made the examination, made that I assume pursuant to a request by the people there in the penitentiary after they had knowledge of this assertion that there was insanity. 
    They had the man examined and they find what's in the brief here and for – that's about all I know about it, Mr. Chief Justice.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does that have any legal effect?
speaker="bruce_allen" startTime="2096.739" stopTime="2206.156">
    Mr. Bruce Allen 
    I don't think it does, I'm glad you asked that question, I like to answer that now. 
    I don't think it has any legal effect whatever for the reason that this is after the trial. 
    We are considering here now whether he had due process at the time of the trial. 
    This was some -- 1963 that this examination was made. 
    When the first examination was made by Dr. Compton, that was on April -- that was on November the 3rd, 1960. 
    The second time he saw the petitioner, it was in April, April 21st, 1961. 
    Now Doctor Hug or Hug, I don't know the pronunciation, but he found something obviously wrong with the man, but he doesn't conclude as to what it's caused from. 
    He says it could be some emotional something or it could be some organic trouble namely maybe arteriosclerosis or the hardening of the arteries. 
    Now, whatever it might be and I can readily see that it could have been arteriosclerosis and of course I might be fast in it because Dr. Compton did see this man notwithstanding the fact that in the brief they tried to minimize this doctrine. 
    I think he's a very fine, capable and competent licensed physician, medical practitioner and who has had training in -- and study in psychiatrics. 
    There's no doubt about him --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2206.156" stopTime="2210.204">

    Now, how much training Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't know how much he had insofar as medical study and education in psychiatry, but in the record, he says he did have it.

    I'd like to call for the Court's attention to this file that a person can diagnose and not have to be nearly as well equipped if he were to treat. 
    Here's all the -- the Court was concerned with and all the State was concerned with is finding out whether or not that fellow knew right from wrong. 
    Now Dr. Compton doesn't tell that he didn't examine him thoroughly. 
    I don't know, the record doesn't reflect how long he examined that first time in his office, but he had a trial on the merits the next day in which they had the same testimony that you had on the previous trial that is Doctor -- except as you Mr. Justice Stewart observed. 
    He didn't have Dr. Dial back again and that's the thing that to me -- causes me to wonder why he was not back. 
    He had from then which was the 24th. 
    He had the remainder of that day -- that night and everyday and night since then regardless of how much time you say he could have at night, he had that time until the 27th which the trial was concluded, on the 27th in the afternoon.

    In answer to Mr. Justice White's question just before we went to lunch, I believe that the only procedure under Texas law that could be had if -- would be -- would necessarily have to be in con -- the Court of Criminal Appeals would have to remand to the District Court of Ellis County, Texas to proceed consistent with the opinion or judgment reached by this Court.

    Mr. Bruce Allen 
    I don't. 
    I mean, I really don't. 
    I don't want to take issue with some of the members of this Honorable Body, but this is a postmortem if you please, at the very time that we had the prisoner there, immediately after he was arrested, he was examined and as I say by a very competent man. 
    I don't think there's any question if any member of this Court to talk with him and know that he was a very competent man. 
    And they -- and he examined him. 
    I don't know how long. 
    It doesn't appear, but it wasn't one of those quick jobs because I'll say this to the Court and this is outside the record, I've sent two to the penitentiary, I mean to the state hospital, predicated on this same doctor's opinion. 
    I sent them there myself as I did this one. 
    I knew this judgment was pending. 
    I've sent them over there as the law authorized and that this man is required to do examining, not for the purpose of treating him, solely for the purpose of ascertaining this question, did he know right from wrong? 
    Was he mentally equipped at the time to know right from wrong? 
    And I think it is -- if this Court holds in this case that a psychiatrist is necessary it's going to really impose a burden upon this Court in the future as I see it. 
    Because these states that do not have such a requirement either one of which is Texas, medical testimony is sufficient to determine the question of right or wrong theory under the McNabb rule. 
    So, if this Court holds that a psychiatrist is necessary before a person has had due process on their Constitution, you talk about lots of work and lots of foolish petitions, they're coming for.

    He had judgment enough in a difficult mental case. 
    He would reaffirm to the specialists there in Dallas, but the fact of business is most of these small counties as mine, we don't have psychiatrists. 
    You just don't have them. 
    It's wonderful in New York. 
    They have more in New York than they do all the rest the United -- the States, the United States put together, and that's fine. 
    It's wonderful in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, where they have lots of them. We don't have 399 and half of those are in mental institutions and I might add half of them are not any better equipped than Dr. Compton as a matter of fact because of education.

    And I think that to me what Professor Wright is urging here is fine and I couldn't be more in harmony if that is with what ought all to be done. 
    It's a fine thing if we could have a Dr. Manager and Dr. Overhaulsor and these fine psychiatrists to study and treat all patients, but this is, as I see it, is not the question here. 
    The question here is, didn't he know a right from wrong. 
    The question here is was due process denied? 
    We submit that -- actually under the facts even -- notwithstanding the fact that this man examined him in Huntsville.

    We felt that this had to be brought to the attention of the Court. 
    We do not feel that it is indicative of the fact that he was per se insane at the time of trial and that he was per se denied due process, but we do feel that it is evidence of such that should be considered.

    Doctor Hug testified -- all of the above evidence if not otherwise stated was given by James during a 45-minute interview. 
    Well now, the psychiatrist, who has made this statement only examined him 45 minutes. 
    Petitioner contends that it takes a minimum of, I believe he said, a 3-hour examination. 
    Dr. Dial examined him 20-minutes, and said he could not base an opinion on that -- on that 20-minute interview. 
    We do not know how long Dr. Compton examined him. 
    It was on two different occasions; once in his office and once in the jail cell. 
    There is -- we feel that this is definitely not per se a finding of insanity at the time but it is evidence that this Court should have the opportunity to review.

    Before I get to the matter which obviously is the primary interest of the Court, there is one small detail; Mr. Justice Brennan, under the Texas statues, if at the trial, Bush had been found to have been insane at the time of the act, he would have been a free man at the end. 
    It would only have been if you were found to have been sane at the time of the act, but insane at the time of the trial that he would be committed as I understand Article 932 (b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. 
    We do not have automatic commitment.

    Troublesome because I cannot answer the Court's questions with the assurance I should like to have when I appear before the Court.

speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="5606.220" stopTime="5772.056">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I hope not to neglect that and I do want to speak a little bit more about the procedural consequences of the affidavit which the State filed. 
    Counsel suggested that this document was filed because of -- the State thought it had no legal significance. They assumed the petitioner would think it had legal significance. 
    In fact, petitioner and the State or has one on this, but I recognized that the Court's duty is not to decide the case if the case is not properly here because of this. 
    We have had available to us since -- or for 15 days we've known of this document and in for eight days, we had a copy of it. 
    We refrained from filing with the Court because on such brief study as we made, it seemed to us not legally relevant. 
    We did not know about the commitment until Sunday. 
    It seems not legally relevant to us because so far as we can ascertain both by library research and by consulting those learned in Texas Criminal Procedure, the attorney -- the Assistant Attorney General and the county attorney are absolutely correct when they say there is no judicial remedy in Texas under the state of facts, that the only remedy would be an application to the Board of Pardons and Paroles, an executive clemency from the Governor. 
    It seems to me that this is a very odd state of procedure for a State to have but on my present information, I cannot disagree with the attorneys for the State who have represented to the Court that there is nothing, as a matter of Texas procedure which a Texas Court could do if you were to remand the case to the Court of Criminal Appeals, they vacate the judgment and then say now, “Please take further action in the light of this new information.” 
    It is my belief, so far as I'm advised, that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals would say there is nothing we can do, this is final so far as we are concerned in which case, I expect that next term would find us back up here. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart suggested during argument for the State that even if there is no procedure as a matter of Texas law that that is not really the question here. 
    The question is what can be done as a matter of the powers and the procedures of this Court. 
    I'm not entirely sure, Mr. Justice Stewart, that I would agree with that formulation of the position if this were a federal case. 
    Undoubtedly, this Court in its supervisory power of lower federal courts could do what it wants. 
    I am -- I'm not certain that the Court has the power to vacate a conviction coming here from the State in the absence of or in the absence of any demonstrative state procedure for responding to the new situation. 
    I do not know that the Court has in its power to invent a new criminal procedure for Texas much as Texas may need one.

    Well then, we'll assume this may not be correct, perhaps you feel that your [Inaudible] would mean too different, we'll assume that you file something with the Court that called their attention what is here, or that that was called to their attention through some source. 
    Would not that Court have the power to consider that and to decide that there should be some sort of a hearing on that particular phase of this problem?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="5850.255" stopTime="5882.967">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Mr. Justice Clark, if I understand Texas law correctly the answer is no. 
    The answer of the Court of Criminal Appeals to whatever document Mr. Moore and I might present would be that there is no error in what happened at the trial court in April of 1961 and we cannot do anything in the light of this new information except perhaps suspend the proceedings under Article 932 (b) until the petitioner becomes sane. 
    This would not involve a retrial on the merits. 
    It would simply be -- if we won't enter a final judgment of conviction until he is finally -- be sane.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="5882.967" stopTime="5899.556">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Well, I understood the county attorney to say that very often the State's attorney did call such things to the Court of Criminal Appeals' attention and that sometimes he would recommend himself that there'd be a remand.

speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="5915.161" stopTime="5939.378">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Section 932 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Mr. Justice White, is the section which deals with insanity after conviction. 
    And I would think the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals might well say this is a compendious statute, many sections. 
    And this is the exclusive procedure and the statute nowhere provides for a remand and a new trial in the light of such newly discovered evidence.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5939.378" stopTime="5943.758">

    It would suspend the affirmance of conviction under the statute.

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I think it is quite probable, given his age in the long history that there is no successful treatment, but there is surely a difference I suggest, Mr. Justice Brennan, between being in a mental hospital as a result to civil commitment which is where I think petitioner perhaps should be and being in a mental hospital as person charged of a crime -- convicted of a crime in the trial court.

    [Inaudible] there is that last part of it, that conviction, well, would he stand convicted?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="5994.125" stopTime="6072.489">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    The conviction would stand in abeyance. 
    It would not have been affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals. 
    It would not have been reversed. 
    Actually, the statute has a further provision that even if you have a suspension of the proceeding that the defendant's counsel may then move the Court of Criminal Appeals, go ahead and decide the case, of a man who's in a mental hospital, so that we could then press for a decision in the Court of Criminal Appeals and come back here still without any decision by a jury as to whether or not he was sane at the time these things were taken from Mr. Hackler. 
    I wanted to make one further point with regard to Mr. Justice Stewart‘s suggestion, that this Court might -- by its own authority, order a new trial. 
    Even if that could be done and the fact that the problems of federalism which I see are not overwhelming, it seems to me that the result is not really a fortunate one but what would happen would be that because we have an affidavit of an examination made two weeks before the case comes on before this Court then this particular defendant would get a new trial with psychiatric testimony. 
    And the result then in Texas, I guess, would be that the only defendant who gets psychiatric assistance at the trial is one who has managed to have a petition for certiorari granted.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6072.489" stopTime="6087.952">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I say at the very outset that I know that your interest is presenting and trying to get decided in your favor and what's used in important constitutional question I understand that but after all as you recognize, we're faced with deciding an individual case.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="6087.952" stopTime="6390.816">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, my interest is representing the petitioner, not deciding a constitutional question. 
    This incidentally is the reason why there is no amicus brief question to which you referred. 
    The Court granted the American Civil Liberties Union permission to file an amicus brief over the objections of petitioner. 
    We objected to the filing even though the American Civil Liberties Union would be on our side because we believe their conception of the case would be different than ours that we were interested in representing this particular petitioner and arguing to this Court that this man on the state of facts has been denied due process. 
    The Court granted the motion four days later. 
    The counsel for the Civil Liberties Union advised the Court that they have then seen petitioner's brief in light of that and in light of the fact that delay would be caused if they prepared an amicus brief, they were withdrawing the request. 
    I was interested in Mr. Crow's reference to Smith v. Baldie as bearing on what should be done with this new last minute development. 
    It has a bearing, of course. 
    As he pointed out to you in the Smith case after it had been decided in the Court of Appeals. 
    Information appeared that Dr. Drayton, the Psychiatrist who had testified that Smith was sane had himself been adjudicated insane and that the insanity was of a sort which was progressive from which you might reasonably have been inferred that Dr. Drayton had been insane at the time he said Smith was sane. 
    Now on that showing, three members of this Court thought that the case should be remanded to, I take it, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for a new trial of a habeas corpus proceeding. 
    A majority of this Court, six judges, held the contrary. 
    Now I think, Mr. Justice Goldberg suggested that there was a distinction between these two and that here it is the sanity of the defendant by which we have no information while in Smith, it was the sanity of the Psychiatrist. 
    Of course, there is a distinction, if I may suggest sir, it seems to me that the distinction, it cuts exactly the other way that there is more reason for a remand where the newly discovered evidence goes not to the facts which were tried by a jury and decided in the case but they go instead to the integrity of the process. 
    If for example, we had information that a trial judge had been insane at the time he conducted a trial, I would think this would be the strongest kind of case for saying it must go back. 
    But here, we are asked to take the case back to decide the facts which the jury has once decided. 
    We now have more information on which to decide them, but it is simply a question of the quantum of evidence rather than something which goes to the very heart of the process itself and so I regard Baldie isn't authoritative. 
    This is the case properly here for decision by this Court. 
    The Chief Justice very kindly suggested that I not neglect to discuss the merits because of this other very interesting procedural question and I would like to say just a few words on that before I close if no further questions on the procedural question. 
    There has been some discussion of Dr. Dial why there was not more time given for his examination, why we did not have him stay over in the afternoon, why he hadn't been brought down days before when the jury presumably was not confined on a hot room. 
    I think that in part, this is a question of time. 
    The motion for appointment of the psychiatrist or for commitment to a mental institution was made and denied on Friday, April 21st. 
    The case came on, on Monday April 24th. 
    It was not until Friday that counsel knew that he was not going to get them to Court that to which he thought himself entitled and counsel then spent the weekend hunting for someone, anyone who would be upheld. 
    Dr. Dial was found, did agree to come but the question is not that of time so much as it is that of money. 
    If we had been paying Dr. Dial of fee, then we could have said to Dr. Dial then, “Please, stay over tonight after the court adjourns. 
    You can make a complete examination.” 
    But Dr. Dial was there as a matter of grace and Mr. Moore was entirely subject to what Dr. Dial wanted to do and was in no position to tell Dr. Dial what to do. 
    If the motions had been granted, if the State had appointed a psychiatrist, the court had pointed the psychiatrist, of course we would not have had that problem. 
    There has been something said also about the competence of Dr. Compton. 
    I surely would not want to be understood as suggesting that Dr. Compton is not a competent physician. 
    I have no reason to doubt it. 
    The thrust of our argument is not that at all, he is only that good as he maybe for many other ailments. 
    He is not qualified to diagnose subtle, mental illness.

speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="6410.820" stopTime="6427.619">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    -- the States. 
    The public institution is the usual place. 
    Under the North Dakota statute set out in the appendix to our brief, the Court either can appoint two (Inaudible) qualified experts or it can commit the defendant to the state hospital for the insane for observation or examination regarding his present mental condition.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6427.619" stopTime="6431.581">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course, the word expert is ambiguous --

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    It is.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6431.769" stopTime="6434.445">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Perhaps in that state, they consider any physician an expert.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="6434.445" stopTime="6651.214">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    It is conceivable that they would, but their statutory provision also authorizes them to commit the man to the mental hospital for the insane where I think they may fairly assume there are qualified psychiatrists. 
    I've observed that the State of Mississippi which is not one of the wealthier states in the union in 1960 adopted the statute requiring some relief of this kind. 
    And I would suggest that what the State of Mississippi can afford and what North Dakota can furnish, Texas can furnish. 
    This does not seem to me an insuperable burden. 
    The county attorney made it clear that if Dr. Compton had told him that in his view petitioner was insane or there was a serious doubt about it that he could have done something about it. 
    He could have taken Bush to Dallas or brought a psychiatrist down from Dallas. 
    We know where to find them in Texas if the need arises and if the Constitution requires it. 
    I think I should in closing say something in what has seemed to me the hardest question in the case or at least the hardest under the supplemental brief was filed and when we try rather imagine that the Court would put to me and that is, is there a limit to the doctrine which I am answering -- asking the Court to adopt. 
    If the Court were to say in this case that there is a constitutional duty to provide the psychiatrist, would the Court also have to say that there‘s a constitutional duty on the State to provide ballistic experts, accountants and writing experts, all those kinds of people. 
    To that, my answer is two-fold. 
    First, one can hope that or at least reasonably read the Constitution of the United States as saying, that the State is required to make available to those who were tried with the crime and who are poor, whatever kinds of expert assistance the State is able to afford for itself with the uneven struggle is not constitutional but I do not have to take that position in this case. 
    I don't believe because it seems to me there is a clear distinction between psychiatric testimony and testimony of the kinds which I have mentioned. 
    The distinction in several ways; there is a distinction in the importance of this testimony where insanity is pleaded. 
    This is usually the crucial issue in the case is other matters frequently are not so important. 
    The other distinction, the one which is to me the more compelling; I believe that counsel can get along not equally, perhaps not desirably, but counsel can see that the jury learned something if the State has called a ballistics' expert or an accounting or an accountant or a handwriting expert because of these other kinds of matters it isn't simply a question of late testimony on each side. 
    The State will have produced an expert and an able and devoted counsel can make himself expert enough perhaps to conduct intelligible cross examination and to see that the jury understands what the facts are. 
    But here, there is never a person put on even who can be crossed examined who has the qualifications to be able to answer the questions, counsel would like to put. 
    This is an all or nothing proposition and we had nothing. 
    And for that reason, those that I have mentioned we pray that the judgment below be reversed.

    It is not who pays the psychiatrist which seems to me important, it is that the psychiatrist be competent and impartial. 
    If he as though as the fact that he is a full time employee of the State, would I think that it would be immaterial? 
    His testimony would satisfy all that we ask.

    I think he does. 
    But what is the system in Massachusetts and those other states the psychiatrist make the report. 
    The report is freely available to both sides prior to trial. 
    Counsel can study and see what a competent psychiatrist had said. 
    If it's worthwhile, he can go out to talk with the psychiatrist and he can call him as witness if he wants to.

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    The State has said that we don't know such a thing as the psychiatrist in Texas that it's not defined. 
    It is a term, of course, which is used in our statutes a fair number of times. 
    This thing, a term of art fairly well understood. 
    I would want a person who is competent by the standard which the medical profession sets and licensing a person to hold himself out as a psychiatrist whether or not a psychologist, a clinical psychologist is sufficient, is a question which had divided the Court of Appeals from the District of Columbia in the Jenkins case and I would rather not have to argue that case as well as my own.

    Well incidentally Mr. Wright, I understand that whatever they are called, the psychiatrists, the general terms, the terms of expert witnesses on this question of insanity, there's considerable disagreement, I should say, within their own profession whether they‘re actually qualified on the question of guilt of innocent -- or innocence as contrasted with their qualifications to treat one who found guilty --

    Mr. Justice Brennan, there is a great deal of versions of view in the medical profession and the psychiatric profession as to whether they should say this, they chafe of course, under M'Naghten's rules and say that it asked the wrong question.

    Of course in this case, the part of your argument has been [Inaudible] as these arguments traditionally are that the defendant should -- that there should not be an unequal struggle, that the defendant should have something close to the equivalent resources that the State in all its majesty has. 
    And if that argument isn't of much relevance in this case, is it because the State didn't have any psychiatrist. 
    They didn't have any such things.

    It's like your handwriting case where you have a layman saying, “Well, that looks like his handwriting. 
    Well, in cross examination you can show that this fellow has no -- is not qualified to say -- to testify because he is -- your case is a little different, isn't it, from the ordinary case that we read about and that they're so much mooted these days where the State is armed with all these resources and the defendant is denied them. 
    Here, the State didn't have any such help and the State has a burden of proof that this man was not insane.

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Of course, I would have a much easier case if the State had had several psychiatrists, but I suggest that this is, if I may with respect sir, that this does not seem to me a material distinction. 
    The State had the ability to produce psychiatrists if it felt that they were necessary. 
    We did not. 
    Mr. Allen, as an able lawyer decided that it was not necessary since we weren't going to have a psychiatrist, but in the small town of Waxahachie, the testimony of the County Health officer, well-known there within his judgment be sufficient to carry his burden of proof and he was right, but I am sure that he would have had a psychiatrist if he had felt he had needed it. 
    The State had the potential. 
    The defendant unless the Court comes to his aid had no potential.
