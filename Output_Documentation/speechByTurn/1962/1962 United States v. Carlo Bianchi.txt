    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case presents a narrow question of statutory interpretation, but a question which is fundamental to the process of resolving disputes under government contracts. 
    In this case, the Court of Claims has reversed administrative findings of fact as not supported by substantial evidence on the basis of evidence, which had never been presented to the administrative decision maker. 
    The administrative findings were made pursuant to the Standard Disputes Clause of government contracts, which in effect charges certain government officials with resolving factual disputes arising under the contract and it makes their decisions final. 
    The Wunderlich Act, which is before us here today, provides for judicial review of such decisions for arbitrariness fraud or lack of substantial evidence. 
    And the question presented therefore is whether, as the Court of Claims has held, a Court reviewing such findings is free to upset them as not being supported by substantial evidence or as being arbitrary on the basis of evidence, which has never been presented to the administrative decision maker. 
    It is of course our position that judicial review under the Wunderlich Act, like judicial review in most other instances, is to be made only on the administrative record and not on the basis of evidence, which is never been before the administrative decision maker. 
    I'll note that our position is supported by the decision of every District Court and Court of Appeals, which has passed on this issue.

    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Well, I would say that at least one has clearly. 
    I think that two others have clearly indicated that this is the view they take. 
    In order to set the issue in its context, I should like briefly to recall to the Court the facts which give rise to it. 
    In July 1946, the respondent was a successful bidder on a contract to build an earthen dam in Upper New York State. 
    Included in the contract was the construction of certain outlet works, including a tunnel, which was to be 710 feet in length and which was to be aligned with concrete. 
    The tunnel was designed to carry water from in front of the dam to the stream below it, it was not designed for the people to go through. 
    The tunnel was to be constructed through rock and was to be free standing that is, it was designed on the premise that the rock was sufficiently stable to allow the tunnel to stand without any permanent ceiling supports, except for a short period -- short piece at either end of 50 feet in length. 
    By the end of March 1947, a subcontractor had dug the tunnel through or, hold the tunnel out to use the engineering terminology, without ceiling supports of any kind either permanent or temporary. 
    Before placing the concrete however, a factual dispute arose. 
    The respondent took the position that the underground rock was materially different from that which have been shown in this specifications in borings and that permanent steel supports were necessary in order to hold the tunnel up and that they should be installed at the government’s expense before placing the concrete. 
    It sought the payment under Article 4 of the contract, which has to do with conditions materially different from those shown in the specifications are normally to be expected. 
    The contracting officer denied the respondent's claim on the ground that the rock was in fact sufficiently stable for a free standing tunnel, and that it was of a kind which was to be expected from the borings in specifications. 
    Pursuant to the disputes clause, respondent appealed to the Corps of Engineers Claims and Appeals Board, which held a full trial type hearing where each side introduced all the evidence it desired to introduce. 
    Respondent produced nine witnesses there, but introduced the testimony of only four, including engineers and a geologist. 
    The government introduced the testimony of three witness, all of whom had personal knowledge of the fact and whose testimony fully supported the government's position. 
    I think the geologist's testimony on each side is the critical testimony before the Board. 
    The record before the Board was in our view, a classic instance of sharply conflicting testimony by lay and expert witnesses who had personal knowledge of the facts and where the finder of fact could reasonably find either way. 
    The Board found that the underground rock was of a kind to be expected and that permanent tunnel protection was unnecessary, thereby sustaining the contracting officer's decision. 
    The respondent filed a suit in the Court of Claims approximately six years later.

    Any statute limitation?
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="362.706" stopTime="452.669">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Yes, it is six years, Your Honor. 
    I think they just came under the limit. 
    I should add that the hearing before the Board was conducted, three years prior to the Wunderlich Act and that the suit was filed here approximately a few months after the Wunderlich Act. 
    The testimony was heard before a Commissioner of the Court of Claims who took evidence de novo over the strenuous objections of Government Counsel, evidence which had never been presented to the Board. 
    The respondent introduced testimony of approximately 15 witnesses and approximately six or seven times as many exhibits as it had in the administrative hearing. 
    The Commissioner made independent findings, principally on the basis of the evidence, which had not previously been presented on the basis of the evidence, which was not before the Board, and the Court of Claims overturned the Board's findings and awarded judgment to the respondent of approximately $150,000. 
    It did not find that the Board's findings where arbitrary or unsupported by substantial evidence on the basis of the evidence before the Board, but it held that it was entitled to receive evidence de novo, which had never been before the Board and that on the basis of all the evidence, including the evidence received de novo, the Board's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.

    And there was no assertion here of any waiver of the government's position. 
    We then have the principal issue here, which is whether, as the Court of Claims has held, a reviewing Court may overturn factual findings on the basis of evidence never before it or as the Courts of Appeals and District Courts have held, review is limited to the evidence, which was before the Administrative Board that is to the administrative record.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I have a preliminary argument -- difficulty with your argument. 
    You've used the word repeatedly reviewing Court and review. 
    I suppose or you tell me if I'm wrong, if jurisdiction in the Court of Claims wasn't based in this case on its -- on the general jurisdiction statute, which I think is 28 United States Code, Section 1491(4).

speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="549.207" stopTime="573.199">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Yes, I think that's the jurisdictional grant, Your Honor, but I think the Wunderlich Act itself, which is incidentally entitled an act to provide review is specifically was specifically designed with that in mind, that is to provide, to authorize judicial review in spite of the provision of the Standards Disputes Clause, which says that the administrative determination is to be final.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="573.199" stopTime="590.901">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, don't we have to kind of begin, at least we have to kind of begin with the general function and power of the Court of Claims under that statute. 
    The way that language reads, it's not a Reviewing Court, it's not an Appellate Court, it's the Trial Court.
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="590.901" stopTime="597.919">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Well that's right Your Honor, just as the District Court as the Trial Court and has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act under 1346 (a) (2).

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="599.093" stopTime="651.020">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Each jurisdictional statute gives the Court authority to hear disputes, cases arising under contracts. 
    Now if there were no Disputes Clause in the contract, then each Court could proceed to trial in the normal course. 
    This Court, in a line of decisions going back to 1878, has upheld Disputes Clauses such as this one in government contracts. 
    And in the Wunderlich decision, which was in 1951, the Court held if there is no judicial review except in the cases of fraud and bad faith. 
    So that -- although the Wunderlich Act is not a jurisdictional grant, it does provide that the Standard Disputes Clause provision will not be read to limit or prevent judicial review.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="651.020" stopTime="658.053">

    Mr. David L. Rose 
    The Court has jurisdiction and under that -- with that jurisdiction Your Honor, in the Wunderlich case, this Court held that there was no judicial review before the passage of the Wunderlich Act, there was no judicial review except in cases of fraud or bad faith, except to that extent there is judicial review, but as in other cases of arbitration there is no review. 
    So, that this statute is putting back to the Courts both the District Courts and the Court of Claims the authority to review in spite of the agreement of the parties that the decision was to be final and conclusive.

    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Yes, the statute says, “Any such decision shall be final and conclusive, unless the same is fraudulent, capricious, arbitrary or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, or is not supported by substantial evidence.” 
    So, here we have both the statute and the contract, which makes the decision final except in these limited circumstances.

    Unknown Speaker 
    [Inaudible]
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="750.653" stopTime="893.947">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    No, my argument is divided into three parts basically. 
    I'm going to discuss the language of the act, legislative history, and the purposes of the Disputes Clause and since this is a question of legislative intent, I'd like to turn first to the most authoritative source of that intent, namely the language of the statute, which I've just recited as found in pages on two and three of our brief. 
    What we understand that statute to mean is this simply, that the administrative decision is to be final and conclusive, if it was honestly made and if it was reasonable. 
    I think the terms that Congress has used here are the subtle and traditional terms for a review of factual findings both by the administrative bodies and it's quite an analogous to the situation of the Court in a jury case. 
    The term fraudulent is merely preserving the pre-Wunderlich situation and it's not involved in this case. 
    The terms arbitrary and capricious are antonyms of course for the term reasonable. 
    Similarly, a decision cannot be so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, if it's a reasonable decision, because if a reasonable man could make it, then there is no need or no possibility indeed of inferring bad faith. 
    And lastly, the term supported by substantial evidence as the House Report, which reported the final bill, which became the Wunderlich Act stated quoting this Court's decision in the Consolidated Edison Company Case, “the term substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.” 
    In other words, evidence that a reasonable person could accept. 
    As we see it then, Congress in this traditional and subtle language has said that the administrative resolution of factual disputes is binding if it was honestly made and if it's reasonable and the Court's function therefore, as we understand it, is limited to seeing to it that the adjudicator, the administrative officials acted honestly and reasonably and their review is limited to that scope.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="893.947" stopTime="915.326">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Another -- a little difficulty I have is your repeated use of administrative agency finding, the administrative process and so on. 
    This is all, but here is a contract between two contracting parties and here is the so-called administrative finding and the finding by one of the parties to the contract, it's a little different from a disinterested jury, isn't it?
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="915.326" stopTime="949.145">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    It is Your Honor, but that is what the parties contracted to do and indeed in the Martinsburg railroad case, we have the same situation where a railroad entered into a contract of this kind with a private contractor and named its Chief Engineer as the factual arbiter. 
    And as I have indicated, both this Court in a line of decisions going back to 1878 has approved this kind of a clause and Congress indeed by the passage of the act here in making such decisions final and conclusive has put its stamp of approval on it too.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="949.145" stopTime="964.768">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Well, Congress did not approve the clause [Inaudible]
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="964.768" stopTime="973.638">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Well, with that qualification, yes Your Honor. 
    I think that's -- so the Standard Disputes Clause in this form was before Congress at the time of the passage of the act.

    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Precisely.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="986.550" stopTime="997.357">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So you both agree, both you and your adversary agree that the Disputes Clause doesn't mean what it says. 
    The only question is how much --
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="997.357" stopTime="997.751">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Review --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="997.751" stopTime="999.230">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Less does it mean, and what it actually does --
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="999.230" stopTime="1004.589">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    That's right. 
    Well, we think it means that it's final if it's a reasonable decision.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1004.589" stopTime="1005.685">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yeah, but that isn't what it says?
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="1005.685" stopTime="1062.255">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    No, that's quite right. 
    And since the Court's function is limited as we understand it to determining whether the Board acted reasonably, we think it's quite apparent from the ordinary use of language that you can't go beyond the evidence, which was before the Board. 
    If the term is arbitrary, a decision cannot be condemned as being arbitrary or capricious on the basis of evidence, which was never before the decision maker. 
    And similarly, the term so grossly erroneous is necessary to imply bad faith, which is a term found in the decisions of this Court prior to the Wunderlich Act. 
    This Court in the Ripley case, Ripley versus United States in 220 U.S, 222 U.S and 223 U.S said that in substance that you can't condemned and overturn this kind of administrative decision, except on the basis of facts known to the decision maker. 
    And lastly, the term substantial --

    The prevailing view in the Court of Claims was that there was a review for arbitrary --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    [Inaudible]
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="1095.748" stopTime="1238.102">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    I don't think so Your Honor. 
    I think the Needles case, which we cite in the Dean case or Young case, indicate that the Court of Claims could not base its decision on evidence, which was not before the decision maker. 
    At any rate, this Court in the Ripley case, which I have just referred to made that quite clear. 
    There are three cases, three decisions in the same case there, where this Court sent the case back to the Court of Claims to ascertain what the decision maker knew. 
    And since that -- that was the only basis in which the decision could be overturned, on the basis of what the decision maker knew, on the basis of evidence that was before him. 
    And therefore, as we understand it, the review was for reasonableness in factual findings. 
    And if it is a review for reasonableness, the evidence which was never before the decision maker can have no bearing on that review, because the decision can't be condemned as unreasonable on the basis of material that was never before the decision maker. 
    Now the term substantial evidence is of course by now deeply routed in our jurisprudence both in decisions and statutes. 
    And we think it is quite significant that in every statute in which Congress has passed providing for such review, judicial review for substantial evidence, it has met judicial review upon the administrative record. 
    We collect some of those statutes in pages 24 and 25 of our brief. 
    And indeed in every statute where Congress has provided for judicial review without setting forth a standard, it has been held by this Court and it has been held and Congress has gone along, that review was on the administrative record. 
    As Mr. Justice Brandeis, said speaking for Unanimous Court, a proceeding under the Packers and Stockyards Act is a judicial review, it's not a trial de novo, this is page 26 of our brief. 
    The validity of an order of the secretary therefore like that of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission must be determined upon the record of the proceedings before him. 
    So that there was a subtle meaning to this term substantial evidence and the other terms are arbitrary, capricious before Congress passed this Act.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    [Inaudible]
speaker="david_l_rose" startTime="1245.941" stopTime="1473.387">
    Mr. David L. Rose 
    Absolutely Your Honor, indeed the title of the Act is an Act to provide review, meaning judicial review. 
    Well, that brings us then to the legislative history of the Act. 
    The Court of Claims has indeed recognized the logical weakness in its position, but has said in effect that this is what Congress intended and therefore we have to go along. 
    It's our position that the legislative history shows not only that Congress intended to use these terms, these subtle terms in their traditional and subtle meaning to provide for judicial review on the administrative record, but also that Congress added the standard of substantial evidence specifically to require each side to present it's case fully and openly to the administrative officers or Board. 
    And that its intent is only consistent therefore with a view that substantial evidence means substantial evidence before the decision maker. 
    That Congress used the terms in their traditional and subtle meaning, is clear from the House Report the report on the final bill. 
    On page four of that report there is reference to the terms arbitrary and capricious and Congress notes that these are the terms that's used in the Administrative Procedure Act, and also refers to the Ripley case to which I have just adverted and where this Court said, a Court of Claims decision could be upset only in the basis of facts known to the decision maker. 
    Similarly, the term substantial evidence Congress noted was included in the Administrative Procedure Act where of course review for substantial evidence is on the administrative record. 
    And Congress referred to this Court's decision in the consolidated Edison case, which was a case under the National Labor Relations Act where again review is on the administrative record. 
    So we think it is clear that Congress intended to use these terms, knew it was using terms that had a subtle meaning and knew what that meaning was. 
    Now, the main purpose of the Wunderlich Act, I think as everyone will concede was to provide or restore judicial review in situations other than fraud and bad faith, but there is another purpose and I would like to direct the Court's attention to that. 
    In the last two pages of our brief, pages 59 and 60, we quote from the House Report and I'll summarize, it's at the bottom of pages 59 and 60, and I'll summarize the beginning of that. 
    It had come to the attention of Congress that some of the administrative hearings were not full hearings in that the records were inadequate and Congress sought to change that situation and how, what instrument that it used to change the situations, the substantial evidence test. 
    If you look at the last line of page 59, this is the House Report on the bill that was finally reported. 
    It is believed that if the standard of substantial evidence is adopted this condition will be corrected and the records of hearing officers will here after contain all the testimony and evidence upon which they have relied in making their decisions. 
    And Congress went on to say, this is in effect to require each party to present openly its side of the controversy and afford an opportunity of rebuttal. 
    Now Congress could use that term substantial evidence in order to effect this result, only if it understood the term substantial evidence to mean substantial evidence on the record, because if either side could withhold evidence from the Board and then introduce it in Court to sustain or upset the decision there would not be this necessity of introducing it's case fully before the Board.

    Mr. William H. Matthews 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Government counsel hasn't commented at all on the testimony of the witnesses before the congressional committees of the Senate and the House at the hearings in connection with this legislation. 
    We deem that's very important to arrive at a fair interpretation of the provisions of this statute. 
    Now the main force behind this legislation was the construction industry and the representatives of that industry were very wrote up over the Wunderlich decision. 
    They were joined by the General Accounting Office who felt that their statutory authority had been taken away from them, the authority to adjust and settle claims by and against United States have been taken away from them by the Wunderlich decision and so they joined industry in an effort to obtain this legislation. 
    Now the only opposition to the legislation was the Department of Justice. 
    The industry witnesses have hailed the Wunderlich decision in strongest terms barring again and again from the dissenting opinions, the language used in the dissenting opinion in the Wunderlich decision. 
    The plea of the industry and all of this is on the record, was that they get back to the position that they were in prior to the Wunderlich decision and that the Court of Claims be permitted to exercise the same jurisdiction that it always had exercised over -- in testing the decisions of these contracting agencies. 
    And their testimony is very clear that they interpreted the proposed legislation as doing just that. 
    The testimony of the many witnesses to this effect is referred to in our brief. 
    One of the leading Advocates of this legislation was the Associated General Contractors and their plea was that the Committee draft legislation that will grant the Courts, “Jurisdiction to hear determine and enter judgment against United States on any claims in which the Courts – in which the contractors will seek review.” 
    Now they act as a substantial evidence standard, be applied and that the Courts be authorized to render judgment, “On the evidence presented to the Court.” 
    The testimony of the General Accounting Office witness with respect to the proposed bill was and I quote that there should -- “that they would be restored to the Courts and to the General Accounting Office, their present jurisdiction or their normal proper jurisdiction.” 
    The bill as finally enacted, adapted the language proposed by the General Accounting Office. 
    There really was no sponsor before the Congressional Committees for the government's present position that review be restricted to the administrative record. 
    Congress was made fully aware of these standards applied by the Court of Claims in reviewing these contracting agency decisions. 
    They were informed that over a period of many years the standards arbitrary and capricious had been employed and that the Court of Claims had also recognized the substantial evidence rule. 
    Government counsel states here that pre-Wunderlich the standard was limited to fraud and bad faith. 
    In that connection may I read from the government's petition for writ in this case. 
    At page 10, they say there is no doubt that Congress passed the Wunderlich statute in order to make certain that judicial review of an administrative decision under the disputes clause would also be available where the contractor establishes arbitrariness and capriciousness. 
    In this respect, Congress can be said simply to have codified the view many times by -- reiterated by this Court prior to its decision in United States v. Wunderlich. 
    Congress was also, in this testimony taken at these hearings, fully appraised of the fact that the Court of Claims permitted the presentation of evidence in open court in testing these administrative decisions of these contracting agencies and that they had done so over a period of many, many years going back to 1911 in the Ripley decision. 
    And Congress was informed why it was so necessary for the contractors that the Court of Claims exercise jurisdiction in this manner, that this disputes clause was not a matter of negotiation between the contractor and the contracting officer, but neither had the authority to modify it or change it in anyway. 
    Congress was told to through the mouths of the witnesses that a Board composed of employees of the contracting agency was no adequate substitute for an impartial review by the Court so that it will be just as impartial as trying a case before a jury composed entirely of the contractors. 
    Congress was told about the inadequate hearing procedures afforded by these contracting agencies. 
    The fact that the contractor would go in and present their witnesses, they would be subjected to cross-examination. 
    The Government would produce no witnesses of its own or in those cases where the government did produce witnesses, the Congress was informed that these Boards relied on ex-party statements, some of which were made by the very officials whose decisions where the subject matter of the appeal. 
    These contracting agencies had no statutory power to conduct a fair hearing, whether or not a hearing was afforded or whether a record was made less entirely in the discretion of the head of the department.

    Now page 109 in the record will show that the limitation imposed on these two witnesses, the total time that they were to -- had to testify was one hour.

    Mr. William H. Matthews 
    Well I would say that there have many, many times, there are many recurrent problems in connection with these hearings, because there is no power to subpoena the witnesses. 
    Take for example, and this is just one of many, an engineer, a resident engineer in charge of a project leaves the government. 
    He is an important witness, there is no adequate substitute for his testimony yet he refuses to testify. 
    The government can't get him and the contractor can't get him and there are many, many illustrations and that happens all the time. 
    And with respect to this improvement in the hearing procedures a witness who interpreted the proposed legislation as maintaining the usual procedures in the Court of Claims testified before the committee that with the addition of the substantial evidence rule, there would be marked improvement in these hearing procedures, which would be of great value to the contractors. 
    Now that certainly does -- then the committee reported -- the committee adopted this suggestion, even incorporated some of the language of the witness in their report, but it seems unlikely that the committee would use the material drawn from a testimony of a witness who interpreted the act as not restricting review from the administrative record and from that testimony draw a conclusion entirely different from that of the witness, of this same witness who testified with respect to the conduct of the proceedings and commenting on the substantial evidence rule, made reference to the Administrative Procedure Act to show that it had comparable substantive standards with a body of law interpreting them. 
    A like reference was made in the committee report to these substantive standards. 
    Now it seems clear that if the committee had intended to restrict review like in the Administrative Procedure Act, it would have at least made reference in the report to some of these procedural standards.

    Don't have any constitutional --
speaker="william_h_matthews" startTime="2579.408" stopTime="2808.890">
    Mr. William H. Matthews 
    I have no constitutional due process argument. 
    Now the petitioner counsel for government refers to statutes containing specified standards of review where review is restricted to the administrative record. 
    Now if Congress has intended to ask the Court of Claims of jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, it seems it would do exactly what all of these statutes do. 
    They provide procedural safeguards to conduct a fair and full hearing. 
    They all provide for the making of a record. 
    They grant the -- they all grant the administrative agencies, the basic powers to conduct full and fair hearings, give them the subpoena, all the subpoena powers and the other powers necessary to do that. 
    And such procedural safeguards are also found in the statutes referred to by the government counsel without specified standards of review where review is restricted to the administrative record. 
    The government counsel seems to concede that a fair trial and a complete record is essential to test the decisions of the contracting agencies. 
    They make that admission in their brief. 
    Now in many instances it is impossible for several reasons. 
    In the first place, to paraphrase the language of Mr. Justice Jackson and his dissenting opinion in the Wunderlich decision, one who acts as a judge of his own department maybe influenced by his own loyalties and it is true there unconsciously at times an employee of department, loyalty to his department will influence his decision. 
    Now can these administrative irregularities be cured by a stay? 
    As indicated by the counsel for the petitioner, the Court of Claims has no power to remand to a contracting agency and in the case of United States against Jones, this Court made clear that the Court of Claims had no such power. 
    And it certainly has no power to please the administrative agencies to assure that a full and fair hearing is granted. 
    We submit that the only fair interpretation of the statute is that Congress did not intend to change the usual procedures in the Court of Claims permitting the presentation of evidence de novo. 
    Now we submit that in the present case, the administrative irregularities committed by the Board, but wants the Court of Claims to render its decision on the basis of evidence presented de novo. 
    At the trial of this action before the Court of Claims, we established that the Board considered and relied on two documents, the contents of which were not made known to the respondent at the time of the Board hearing. 
    The principal document was a letter from the residential engineer in Baltimore to the Chief of Engineers of the Army, forwarding the contracting officer's findings and all the appeal papers and this letter contained six pages of comments on the merits of the case and recommended that all of the claims be disallowed.

    I think the Court of Claims has more rigidly enforced these standards in the last -- since the Wunderlich Act or since the Wunderlich decision. 
    And then, I refer on page 10 to the -- I mean I just mention one thing. 
    I want to take exception and strong exception to the request here by Government Counsel for this Court to pass on the sufficiency of the evidence before the Board and it's my understanding that, that has been their request. 
    They're asking this Court to do so and I refer in that connection to footnote 20 -- footnote 1 of page 20 of the Government's brief, where they say there is no issue before this Court as to the vein of the facts, before the -- and that the government's petition solely on the important legal question whether the Court of Claims was restricted to the administrative record. 
    That footnote completely misled us and we therefore thought we shouldn't burden this Court with this wrong statement of facts about -- the statement of facts of what transpired at the Board hearing. 
    So there is a record here, substantial record and it's unlike any case that's I'm familiar with where the Court has passed on the sufficiency of the evidence below. 
    But as this Court feels that it's before the Court why we trusted we will be permitted to file a statement of facts before the Board. 
    I don't feel -- I think it's clear that the government has made it clear in their brief that they were going to request this Court to pass on the sufficiency of the evidence.

    Now take for example our own case, assuming that the Board had given us a decision in our favor, we had an issue that the Boards have no authority whatsoever to determine liability for unliquidated damages, so that in our case, we were seeking damages for delay. 
    The delay was an issue before the Board. 
    If the Board had rendered a decision in our favor, we would have had to bring a suit in the Court of Claims and claim for damages arising out of the same identical facts that our claim for changed conditions and adjustments in the contract, which were all within the scope of the contract, that the Board has authority to determine, so we get X dollars before the Board.

    And furthermore there is this point -- as I pointed out in one of the amicus brief submitted here, the government has a right to counterclaim. 
    They have to start if they want a counterclaim. 
    They have to start an original -- I mean how you can counterclaim against something they started -- that they usually counterclaimed as they have to in the Court of Claims.

    I say no attention -- I don't say no attention should be paid to it, because they give a great deal of weight to the -- it seems to me from the Needles case and other cases that the Court of Claims has given a great deal of weight to the decision of the Board, and they apply the same rule -- they apply the substantial evidence rule as indicated in the committee report.

    Mr. William H. Matthews 
    May I illustrate it this way just by giving one answer. 
    In the 15 years prior, this in the record of the hearings, in the 15 years prior to the Wunderlich decision, there are only 48 cases out of thousands and hundred -- apparently, thousands and thousands that went to the Court of Claims under the disputes clause and of those 48 cases, only 16 where the Board decisions were reversed. 
    They only had about three a year, but it's vital. 
    The important part of it is the contracting officer and even back at that level, this is all under testimony, knows that his decision isn't going to be final as soon as it reaches a level of the head of department that sometime a Court can look at it and it makes a fair deal between the government and the contractor.

    Mr. Rose?

    Mr. David L. Rose 
    I should like to make two points in the time allowed to me. 
    The first is that I would agree that the association of General Contractors of America was a moving force in the Wunderlich Act. 
    Page 29 of the senate hearings, this is the review that they sought. 
    The position of the association as we believe that any decision should be subject to judiciary review in order to guarantee that such decision is reasonable, made with due regards to the rights of both contracting parties, and this is a key part, and supported by the evidence upon which the decision was based, and that is what they sought and that we submit as what they got, when they got the substantial evidence test. 
    Mr. Gaskins who was a contractor representative and one of the leading spokesman for the contractors when asked what kind of review it would be in Court, said “It will be an appellate review.” 
    Now the term appellate review to me, means review on the record and that is precisely what we contend here.

    Mr. David L. Rose 
    They can suspend their proceedings Your Honor, just as they do in the ICC case, the Pennsylvania Railroad case that we cite, suspend their proceedings with an indication that that they want the record rectified and we cite -- I see absolutely no reason why the same thing couldn't be done here at this Court in Pennsylvania railroad case approved that Court of Claims procedure in ICC cases. 
    Now, I should like to make this point at the end. 
    The purpose of the disputes clause is to provide an expert an inexpensive forum for the quick resolution of factual disputes. 
    This court has approved the disputes clause and Congress in the very passage of the Wunderlich Act approved it subject to judicial review for substantial evidence. 
    The taking of evidence de novo frustrates that purpose in two basic ways. 
    It makes the resolution of factual disputes both expensive and time consuming. 
    Here we have 17 years that this dispute has been going on whereas the dispute before the Board was over an year-and-a-half, and the tremendous expense of two trials on the same issue of liability the -- whereas one hearing before the Board, there were three hearings in three separate cities San Francisco, Washington and Boston in the Court of Claims. 
    There is a tremendous expense involved and a tremendous duplication of effort. 
    Our opposition will eliminate one whole trial type hearing and therefore accord with the original intent, which was to provide an expeditious and inexpensive forum.

    No, I think that the procedure followed in the Pennsylvania Railroad case could be followed here that indeed one of the purposes for judicial review was we think to cure the procedural defects as well as substantive defects, and in the primary jurisdiction cases the ones I'm referring to the Court of Claim is merely suspend its proceedings and the case does in fact go back to the administrative agency and the proceedings are held there, and I think that would be the comparable situation here with the sanction to impose judgment if the --

    Yes, absolutely, and we think that one should be. 
    It's our view that it should be remand, but either would cover the situation here and neither is before the Court here in our view, because here we think that each party was afforded full opportunity to present its evidence and there was ample evidence to support either conclusion before the Board.
