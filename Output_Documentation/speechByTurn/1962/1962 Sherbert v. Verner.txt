    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of South Carolina, probable jurisdiction was noted December 17, 1962. 
    The question presented in essence is whether a Seventh-day Adventist observing the Saturday Sabbath from Friday evening at sundown to Saturday evening at sundown maybe required to work on Saturday under penalty of loss upon employment compensation. 
    The basic question is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment guaranteeing the free exercise of religion is violated by the South Carolina Unemployment Compensation Act as here construed and applied. 
    The pertinent facts are simple. 
    The appellant, age 57 had been employed as a school tender for about approximately 35 years, and since 1938 steadily in the plant of Spartan Mills at Spartanburg, South Carolina. 
    From World War II, its Saturday work had been on a voluntary basis and appellant was required to work only five days a week, Monday through Friday. 
    She worked on the first shift from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
    On August 6, 1957, she became a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
    The religious teaching of that church is that the Sabbath for the worship of God commanded by him commences at sundown, Friday evening and ends at sundown, Saturday evening. 
    Without incident after her joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church and for approximately 22 months, she continued in the same regular employment until June 5, 1959, when the employer posted notice that thereafter work on Saturday would be mandatory as well. 
    After the notice was posted, she explained to her employer that her religion would not permit her to work on Saturday. 
    No relief was given to her and she was absent from work for six successive Saturdays and was then discharged. 
    She admittedly applied for unemployment compensation. 
    The pertinent sections of the state law are set out in our gray-covered brief at pages 3 and 4. 
    This statute is substantially the same as that found in most of the states. 
    Section 68-113 (3) requires it to be initially eligible for compensation benefits, the claimant must be able to work and available for work. 
    The claims examiner held her not available for work because she was unwilling to work on Saturday. 
    Section 68-114 provides that even though initially eligible for benefits, the claimant maybe disqualified for misconduct conduct -- connected with her most recent work. 
    And on that further ground, the same examiner held her disqualified for five weeks because of her unexcused absences. 
    I might say that this as applied in this case means simply that the payment of the benefits which can total to 22 weeks or deferred was deferred for five weeks and the examiner did not purport to apply a forfeiture of the five weeks of pay unemployment benefits which might have been imposed in a case that he felt was flagrant enough.

    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    Connected with her work, that’s right, Your Honor. 
    It appeared that the appellant had applied at three other textile mills shortly after her discharge, but found that they were on a six-day basis. 
    The record shows that most of the textile plants operate on a six-day basis, but this record also shows a curious case of growth of that fraction most. 
    The referee on appeal said practically all of the textile plants operate on a six-day basis. 
    The Commission said all. 
    The Court of Common Pleas said all, and when it got to the Supreme Court of South Carolina, we having taken the specific exemption to that finding because of the record showing most, the Supreme Court said that the Commission had found all operate on a six-day basis. 
    I call the attention of that because it is significant in the light of the other circumstances of this case. 
    In any event, the applicant was on an apparently very little wage because the record shows that her benefits, if paid, would have been limited to $26 per week. 
    And under the South Carolina law, this is usually taken to approximate half of the average weekly wage. 
    She stated in the hearing before the referee that she was willing to work and able to work, in any mill or in any other industry so long as the job was a decent job, and so long as it did not require her to work on her Sabbath. 
    The evidence is also un-contradicted in this record that of the 150 members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Spartanburg, all are gainfully employed and none experience any particular difficulty in obtaining jobs. 
    We think the record is clear that the appellant did not remove herself from the labor market in that area by her refusal to work on the Sabbath.

    Is there any dispute at all between the litigants here as to the good faith of her religious beliefs?
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="447.445" stopTime="532.483">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    None whatsoever, Your Honor as I understand it. 
    The claim examiner's decision was affirmed by the referee by the State Unemployment Compensation Commission and by the Common Pleas Court of Spartanburg County. 
    The State Supreme Court apparently conceded that “available for work” the classic phrase means available for suitable work. 
    In 1955, the law of South Carolina had been amended to provide specifically in determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the Commission shall consider the degree of risk involved to his health, safety, and morals. 
    The Court, however, held that this Amendment merely referred to work, the character of which would be morally objectionable to any employee, and therefore, excluded the contention there made by the appellant that consideration and application of that Amendment would require recognition that to require her to work on Saturday would be violative and -- of her religion and carry with it a grave threat to her morals and by reason of that fact would exonerate her from this requirement.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Do you consider the court below in [Inaudible].
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="596.739" stopTime="884.032">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    No, they did not consider as such. 
    It was for this reason that the decisions in the Supreme Court of Ohio in Tary against Board of Review and In re Miller in 243, North Carolina, later of which incidentally did involved mill work where it held not applicable by the state of -- the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 
    n essence, the Court concluded, “the purpose of the available for work test is to determine whether the claimant is actually and currently attached to the labor market. 
    That is to say whether or not she was offering a service for which there was a demand and which was being supplied in that area, whether or not, that there was a job open that would require her services at that time because of course, the law contemplates the compensation for those who are unemployed.” 
    Curiously, the Court went on to say, however, that the test in determining whether or not she's attached to the labor market is unrestricted availability. 
    Later on in opinion they said, but this doesn't mean on Sunday, but I'll come to that later. 
    Curiously, the Court made no further reference to the fact that there was a market for the appellant services. 
    The -- it does not refer to the fact that all other Seventh-day Adventists were able to obtain positions without difficulty and were all gainfully employed and it ignores that point completely in the opinion. 
    The state court, instead, held that by adhering to the Seventh-day Adventist Decree, the appellant had rendered herself unable or unwilling to work in her usual trade or occupation for the usual and customary number of days or hours and had restricted her willingness to work to periods that fit her own personal circumstances. 
    The resort to both those phrases apparently was occasioned by the fact that they had been used in other circumstances by other state courts in rejecting claims to compensation. 
    Because of this, the Court concluded that she was not available for work. 
    As to the disqualification to which Mr. Justice Goldberg referred, they quite made a minor shift and said that she was disqualified not for misconduct connected with her work but failure to accept without good cause, available suitable work offered to her by her employer, referring to the fact that the employer was quite willing to keep her on if she were willing to work on Saturdays. 
    As to the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion, the Court held that the law had placed no restriction of right to observe her religious beliefs in accordance with her own conscience. 
    She was completely free to do as she pleased in other words. 
    The only trouble was, she would lose the right to the compensation benefits. 
    The dissent noted, as the record clearly shows, that she had made no change in the days or hours of her usual work and that her loss of the job was occasioned by the change of the employer in shifting over to the six-day week. 
    Of course, if we can refer back to what happened 22 months before and say that she changed her religion, then yes, indirectly and remotely, her change was occasioned for her being discharged. 
    Now, free exercise of religion, as we conceive it, means exercise free of sanctions or penalties that influence or compel the person to profess her belief or disbelief in any religion, or to do an act repugnant to his religion. 
    Relying on the language of Mr. Justice Jackson in the Barnett case, we first start with the proposition here that in requiring this applicant to express a willingness to work on Saturday, she was being required to express and profess an attitude of mind in conflict with her religious beliefs sincerely held.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The difficulty with your argument so far as I'm concerned, Mr. Donnelly is that if the State had done anything other than what it did in this case, it would have violated the Establishment Clause because it would have favored one religion.

    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    Well, I think that the -- to say that that's a violation of the Establishment Clause is to give undue weight to the state -- statement that there is a wall of separation between church and state.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="914.012" stopTime="919.423">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I wholeheartedly agree with you but I'm talking about the Establishment Clause that has been construed by this Court.

    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    I -- I'm not aware of any case that says that to give effect to any person's religious belief is to -- and permit that person to exercise his religious belief is a violation of the Establishment Clause.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="938.399" stopTime="944.921">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The Everson -- the Everson case says that any state which favors one religion violates the Establishment Clause.

    And the Everson --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="946.444" stopTime="956.638">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And so the Act -- the -- the -- if the State took the action which you say should have taken here would have favored the Seventh-day Adventist and therefore would have violated the Establishment Clause.
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="956.638" stopTime="983.128">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    And the Everson case also said, “Neither the State nor the federal government can force or influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.” 
    Now, I submit that here --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="983.128" stopTime="989.647">
    Justice Potter Stewart

    Yes.
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="998.460" stopTime="1060.796">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    -- that is correct. 
    This was reiterated in the more recent decision in the Braunfeld case. 
    If the purpose or effect of the law is to impede the observance of one or all religions or as to discriminate invidiously between religions, that law is constitutionally invalid even though the burden maybe characterized as being only indirect. 
    And of course, if your argument or your point is valid, Mr. Justice Stewart, I submit that to recognize any right of religious freedom in any particular individual, in any particular case, first, is not in derogation of the presumed right of other individuals having other religions to exercise that same right free of sanction or trammel.

    I submit that it aids no religion in permitting an individual to practice her or his religion. 
    This is the basic freedom. 
    This is the dignity of the individual on which I think the First Amendment was based and that in both the Establishment Clause as barring the right to permit the exercise of religion by the individual is an untoward extension of that Clause.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1097.072" stopTime="1102.193">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I agree with you but I'm just suggesting that these statutes are vague.
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="1102.193" stopTime="1249.275">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    Now, continuing, this Court has of course recognized that in the welfare state, the sanctions that maybe imposed by withholding the numerous so-called privileges of compensation for unemployment and public housing and in most recently in the Spicer case, the tax exemption for veterans tantamount to sanctions equivalent to a penalty and I believe, it equate -- with those, equate with a prohibition of law. 
    Now the appellee relies chiefly as I understand your argument upon the contention that in the Braunfeld case, the Sunday law cases, this question was already decided that this is an indirect burden and falls with it. 
    They lack the result in that case. 
    I still lack the language in the Braunfeld case because in this case, it cannot rightly be asserted that there is any indirect pressure because there, in distinguishing the Flag Salute case, this Court pointed out the statute before us does not make criminal, the holding of any religious belief or opinion nor does it force anyone to embrace any religious belief or to say or believe anything in conflict with these religious tenants. 
    Or as Mr. Justice Brennan considered in his dissent, the distinction was based on the fact the laws do not say that appellants must work on Saturday. 
    Now here, if we concede that the imposition of a criminal penalty or a fine as in the Sunday law cases is equivalent to or equaled by the penalty imposed by the withholding of the unemployment benefit, then I submit that here, we have a direct penalty and the direct burden because the individual is left with no intermediate choice such as it was brought in the Sunday law cases. 
    Here he has only two choices, two alternatives. 
    He works on Saturday, he expresses a willingness to work on Saturday or he sacrifices his right to compensation, and the Court of South Carolina suggests no alternative. 
    This Court further in the Braunfeld case says --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1249.275" stopTime="1257.707">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Does the record show where these other -- what is it, a 150 members of the Jehovah's Witnesses based in Spartanburg, where they -- where they employed?
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="1257.707" stopTime="1294.647">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    No, it does not, Your Honor, and I think there's something in this record and the appellee nurtures it in a certain extent of the idea that this is a mill town but Spartanburg as this Court may traditionally notice has a population of 47,000 and it has a surrounding county that is build up in a total area or the immediate surroundings are probably approximately 150,000, so that we're not dealing with the one industry town. 
    This Court also recognized in the Braunfeld case, if the State regulates --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1294.647" stopTime="1296.568">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Excuse me, I meant the Seventh-day Adventist.
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="1296.568" stopTime="1296.986">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    Pardon me.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1296.986" stopTime="1298.323">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="1298.323" stopTime="1382.331">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    This Court also said that if the State regulates conduct by enacting a general law within its power, the purpose and effect of which is to advance the State's secular goals, the statute is valid despite its indirect burden on religious observance unless the State may accomplish its purpose by means which do not impose such a burden. 
    Even -- this is a negative way of stating the Shelton against Tucker rule even though the Government's purpose would be legitimate and stifled, that purpose cannot be pursued by means of broadly stifled fundamental personal liberties when the end could be more narrowly achieved. 
    The breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the basic purpose. 
    In this case, the only suggestion made by the appellee to justify this rigid rule that excludes consideration is the possible of fraudulent -- possibility of fraudulent representation that the individual entertains these particular beliefs. 
    The answer to that is two-fold. 
    In a number of the cases including the Schneider case, this Court has pointed out that there are laws against fraud that can be enforced. 
    Secondly, in our appendix, we have about 30 states' administrative decisions, but most of which have recognized this right and none of which, so far as I can recall, referred to any difficulty in ascertaining whether the person was fraudulent or was sincere.

    Mr. Daniel R. McLeod 
    Exactly, no question about that, Your Honor. 
    If the Court please, the primary purpose, of course, unemployment compensation law is to take care of the effects of unemployment that is brought about not by the voluntary action of the employee, but by the involuntary action of the employee. 
    The unemployment laws recognize that there would be dislocation industrially and economically resulting in involuntary unemployment. 
    The line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court of South Carolina and by, I think a majority of the other states, with respect to questions similar to that presented here is this, that if the unemployment is brought about as a result of economic or industrial dislocation, then it is compensable, but it is brought about by something that is personal to the employee. 
    Some personal action that does not come within the scope of the statute or the administrative construction of the statute, then it is not compensable. 
    That can be illustrated by a number of cases, one of which has been before the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 
    For instance a workman or a worker having to care for children, having to care for sick husband, a very laudable purpose that one requires that she not be at her job, but nevertheless in circumstances such as that, compensation is denied. 
    That has been decided by the Supreme Court of South Carolina and by a number of all state courts. 
    Cases involving the cessation of work by a wife when her husband has been transferred away from the site of her employment; she may form religious or other reasons to be compelled to be by the side of her husband but nevertheless that is not held to be a suitable ground for ceasing work and in that case, unemployment benefits are withheld. 
    An exception is made to some extent administratively in South Carolina with respect to cessation of work by reason of pregnancy up through a certain stage of the pregnancy period benefits are payable, beyond that, there are none.

    Mr. Daniel R. McLeod 
    In those particular industries which allow the breaching of the Sunday rest day, I feel that the distinction is this, that the Sunday is a day of rest day, stand in a category by themselves, and that if there's an exemption as was in the Massachusetts statute in a very detailed manner, so much so that the Circuit Court of Appeals said that it rendered the statute in veritable hodge-podge. 
    Exemptions from the Sunday closing laws are not unusual, and as I see it, they are tacitly recognized as valid by this Court. 
    This is one of those exemptions. 
    And therefore, to say that it invidiously discriminates against these members of this faith who won't work on Saturday and they're thereby penalized by being withheld from unemployment benefits. 
    To say that is to say also that the exemption granted for the Sunday closing statute must be granted in all other fields: unemployment benefits, public employment, appearances in court. 
    If one exemption would stand there then the exemption would necessarily by that process of reasoning be applicable in every other field of activity in the State. 
    And therefore, I feel that there is no invidious discrimination.

speaker="daniel_r_mcleod" startTime="2451.206" stopTime="2619.465">
    Mr. Daniel R. McLeod 
    One point that I think is of vital significance is the thing that not only that we think benefits were that -- the worker is unemployed, but the statute requires that employment be secured for these unemployed as far as possible so that they maybe placed back in the working force. 
    The textile industry in my state is the largest single employer. 
    Spartanburg got -- where this case originated is the largest textile manufacturing plant area in South Carolina, employing about 14% of all the textile labor market. 
    The Court will note that the five -- that the reference in the transcript of record to the fact that this employee, since 1900 and since the end of the World War II had worked on Saturday for a period of about five years prior to the time this case arose, but that was voluntarily done and permitted by the employer. 
    The employer was operating on a six-day schedule and the mills are operating on six-day schedules now with three day -- three shifts each. 
    When conditions worsen, the work force is not reduced but first the days are shortened so that you may have three days per week, but all of three shifts each. 
    I am pointing that out to emphasize that economic conditions in the textile industry where this appellant worked for 35 years are good and that employment is available, but that -- this employee has restricted her availability for employment. 
    Number one, by refusing to work because of her religious beliefs on Saturday but it maybe noted incidentally that she is a first shift employee. 
    That's the shift that normally goes to the senior employees. 
    Being a first shift employee, she is available for work on five days of the week. 
    But on the second shift, and on the third shift, those shifts overlapping sundown Friday until sundown Saturday, on those two shifts, she will only be available four days per week. 
    Now that's given some recognition by the administrative agency in the -- in the State, but it restricts her appeal of employment so that we are now attempting to place not a textile worker, but a Seventh-day Adventist textile worker.

    All of them, all of them do. 
    The counsel for -- it was -- it was associated with the general counsel for the mill's employer involved in this case and he's closely associated with mill and he so informed me. 
    The phrase “suitable for work” is one that has been referred to Mr. Justice Goldberg a moment ago, noted almost the -- all of the matter, the criteria that is set forth to determine what suitable for work means in the statute. 
    It is not set forth in its complete detail in the transcript nor in the jurisdictional statement. 
    In addition to the fact that the health, safety, and morals of the person must be considered in determining whether the work is suitable -- other criteria coming -- a physical fitness in the work, the prior training, the prior experience, the prior earnings, and length of employment, the prospects for local work in the customary occupation of that employee, the distance of that available work from the employee's home, all of those, may it please the Court, are secular criteria and none of them has any religious significance whatsoever. 
    I feel that it's a reasonable deduction to make when I say that if this appellant is entitled to unemployment benefits and still refused to take work in her customary occupation on Saturday by the same token, the employer would be required to compensate her for any number of days that they might want to work depending upon their particular religious faith and with 300 or more various religious faiths in the country and to employers, will be placed in an intolerable -- intolerable situation.

    I feel that if one person's faith may require him to work on three days of the week, for instance, the Muslims as I understand it, requires a religious holiday on Friday.

    But suppose -- suppose if the legislature want to make it Saturday and it said that those who had conscientious reasons to get working on Saturday. 
    It attaches conscientious reasons. 
    The cases the Court held at least the majority, believed that the statutes were not based at this time on any distinction because of religion, it was a day of rest, but here, your statute says, they want to get up on Sunday for a conscientious reasons and why wouldn't it be precisely the same if it said they wanted to get off Saturday for conscientious reason except in that instance, it would let all Seventh-day Adventists.

    Yes. 
    With this exemption, I reiterate repetitious perhaps, but this is a limited field, a limited economy, one that was called upon by the war department in time of emergency to a very large extent, perhaps larger than or more so than any other industry and this exemption was made to give relief in the seven-day work period and not for any religious purpose.

speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="3355.920" stopTime="3383.086">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    I may endeavor to answer some of the questions that are raised by the Court. 
    As I recall, the only provision in the federal statute setting standards that would be pertinent here was the one which I believe is embodied and followed in Section 68-114 (3) (c). 
    This is not set out in our briefs, but this is in the state statute, and it reads, “Not with…” --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3383.086" stopTime="3384.850">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    68-114.
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="3384.850" stopTime="3467.790">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    68-114 (3) (c). 
    I believe this conforms -- was put in to conform to the federal requirement. 
    “Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, no work shall be deemed suitable and benefit shall not be denied under this title to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions. 
    (1) If the position offered is vacant due directly to strike, blackout, or other labor dispute. 
    (2) If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual, then those prevailing for similar work in the locality, or (3), if as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.” 
    I happen to know about this Section, Your Honor because I thought it was somewhat ironical, that the individual could not be deemed to be offered suitable work if it required him to resign from a union, but under the interpretation of the South Carolina Court, he is offered suitable work though his work would require him to work on a Saturday and in effect to resign from his church.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3467.790" stopTime="3472.271">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do I understand you to say that that is put in there by reason of the federal statute?
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="3472.271" stopTime="3485.596">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    I believe it will found that the federal statute requires that those provisions be in the state statute and if the state statute does not contain those provisions, it will be deemed not to comply with the exemption granted in the federal statute.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3485.596" stopTime="3520.215">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But, the statute to which I called attention is -- is the Title 28 United States Code, 2403 which requires that any actions suit or proceedings of the United States or any agency of it, is not a party within the -- wherein the constitutionality of any Act of Congress affecting the public interest is drawn in question, the Court shall certify such fact to the Attorney General and should permit the Attorney General to intervene in the presentation of evidence and so forth.
speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="3520.215" stopTime="3552.378">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    I'm familiar with the statute, Your Honor. 
    I don't believe it has application for here, in this case. 
    For example, a number of states -- I've cited them in the brief, three of them, at least have held that their statute does not require the Seventh-day Adventist to work on Saturday and there is not -- have been deemed to be any conflict in that construction with the federal statute. 
    So the federal statute still remains in full force and effect unaffected by the construction which we suggest is necessary to comply with the Constitution.

speaker="william_d_donnelly" startTime="3572.944" stopTime="3625.149">
    Mr. William D. Donnelly 
    There's only one other point that I wanted to mention. 
    The peculiar Sunday law that was a subject of the discussion earlier is referred to at record 48 by the Court as the reason for accepting the requirement of working on Sunday. 
    It's significant that they did not rely on the general Sunday law prohibiting work on Sunday by an individual and I speculate, but I think the reference to the statute will show that this was done because within a month, before the decision of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, the general Sunday law prohibition had been amended radically to provide that many types of work were permissible on Sunday under the impact of the decision in the Sunday law cases and a threat that the old statute was going to be enforced very rigidly. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
