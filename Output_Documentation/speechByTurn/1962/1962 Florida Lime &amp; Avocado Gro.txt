Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul
speaker="isaac_e_ferguson" startTime="0.000" stopTime="234.683">
    Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson 
    May it please Your Honors. 
    This case is here for the second time on direct appeal from the judgment of a three-judge District Court. 
    The previous appeal was from a judgment dismissing appellants’ complaint for lack of jurisdiction. 
    That judgment was reversed by this Court because it was remanded to the District Court to try the case on the merits for other proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this Court. 
    The present appeal is from the judgment after trial on the merits, denying the relief prayed in appellants’ complaint. 
    I remind the Court that the appellants are growers, handlers of avocados produced in South Florida, and that the avocados marketed by appellants are sold without restriction in all states of the union except California, the only other state in which avocados are produced commercially. 
    I remind the Court further that all of the avocados grown in the Florida production area are marketed in interstate commerce or directly affect interstate commerce. 
    And that since June 11, 1954, all marketing of the Florida avocados has been governed by a marketing order made by the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. 
    The essence of the marketing order is the establishment and enforcement of standards of maturity and quality as the condition precedent to the marketing of the Florida avocados. 
    The complaint of the appellants is that notwithstanding compliance with the maturity and quality regulations imposed under the federal marketing order, an near embargo against the marketing of the Florida avocados in California is enforced by prohibiting sale of the avocados in that state, unless they contained 8% or more of oil or fat as required by Section 792 of the Agricultural Code of California.

    Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson 
    Oh, yes Your Honor. 
    Yes, indeed. 
    It follows the complaint in the first volume and begins -- Page 50. 
    This 8% oil requirement is foreign to the nature of the avocados grown in Florida, also foreign to the maturity and quality regulations under the federal marketing order. 
    Such embargo, appellants contend, flaunts the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, at the same time thwarts and undermines the effectiveness of the regulation of the marketing of this fruit under the federal law. 
    On the previous appeal in this case, it was held by this Court, first, that a three-judge District Court was properly convened to hear the case since the complaint seeks to enjoin enforcement of a state statute in application to the marketing of the avocados handled by appellants on substantial grounds of federal unconstitutionality. 
    Second, the direct appeal to this Court from the judgment of the District Court was proper notwithstanding the joinder of a claim that enforcement of the state statute in the manner complained of is a violation of an Act of Congress regulating interstate commerce. 
    Third, that it was not incumbent upon appellants prior to consideration of their complaint in accord of the United States to apply for the desired relief in an action in the California Courts. 
    Fourth, that appellants are entitled to have determined in this federal court action on the merits the rights asserted under the Constitution of the United States, also under the Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 enacted by Congress pursuant to the authority granted by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. 
    It said in the opinion of the District Court that but for the direction of this Court to hear and adjudicase -- adjudicate the case on the merits, the District Court might either have declined to exercise equitable jurisdiction in the case or it might have withheld exercise of jurisdiction to await state court adjudication of the controversy. 
    I respectfully submit that this statement of the District Court is quite immaterial. 
    That it is of no moment how the District Court might otherwise have disposed of the case if not constrained by the decisions of this Court. 
    I submit likewise that the reargument by appellees in the form of cross-appeal of issues decided by this Court on the former appeal calls for no consideration on the present appeal. 
    On the merits, I submit, the record is devoid of any support for the judgment of the District Court. 
    The essential elements of appellants’ case are virtually uncontested. 
    The most striking circumstance of this case is that nowhere in the evidence is there the least suggestion of fault in the Florida avocados. 
    No suggestion of unhealtfulness, unpalatability, or inferiority of quality in any respect. 
    The challenged California statute says in effect that all avocados with less than 8% of oil are immature, but no witness says that this is true of the avocados grown in Florida which come to market with less than 8% of oil content. 
    On the other hand, it is affirmatively established by the extensive and an impugned scientific research that some varieties of Florida avocados attain maturity and are ready to be marketed with oil content as low as 2% or 3%, while other varieties which may ultimately attain 8% oil content, do so only in minor volume and late in the marketing season for these avocados and even then without the requisite consistency for affecting -- effective marketing in face of the 8% oil barrier. 
    The main -- the evidence regarding the marketing of the Florida avocados covers the period since June 11, 1954 when the Federal Florida Avocado order went into effect. 
    No question is raised by the appellees as to the validity of the Act of Congress pursuant to which the marketing order was made. 
    However, an abortive attempt was made by the appellees to show that the regulations issued under the marketing order and the methods of administration thereof have failed to comply with the requirements of the Marketing Agreement Act. 
    Oral testimony was taken and a great many exhibits for identification in furtherance of this defense, but upon the trial of the case, the defense was withdrawn. 
    Nevertheless, it is reasserted in the brief by the appellees in this Court. 
    It set forth in answer in appellants’ reply brief. 
    The reason for adoption of the Florida Avocado Marketing Agreement was the need to establish and enforce satisfactory standards of maturity and quality for the marketing of this fruit in place of the ineffective self-regulation then prevailing in the industry. 
    Since 1954 by the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture from season to season, standards of maturity and quality have been established and have governed all marketing of the avocados produced in the South Florida area. 
    No shipment of Florida avocados is permitted without a certificate of compliance with these regulations. 
    A certificate issued after inspection of the fruit by the Joint Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Florida Department of Agriculture. 
    In California alone, on arrival of a shipment of avocados from Florida, the federal certification of the fruit as of requisite maturity and quality is disregarded and instead the 8% oil test is applied. 
    Under the federal regulations, oil or fat content does not enter into determination of the maturity or quality of the Florida avocados. 
    By a decade of scientific research, the years 1951 to 1955 by Dr. Roy W. Harkness at a subtropical experiment station of the University of Florida, Homestead, Florida and in years from 194 -- 1954 onward by Dr. Paul L. Harding, and his staff of assistants at the United States Horticultural Field Station at Orlando, Florida, also at the agricultural marketing station of the United States Department of Agriculture at Miami, Florida, it has been irreputably established that oil content is not a scientifically valid determinant of either the maturity or quality of the Florida avocados. 
    That there is no consistent relationship between the oil content of the fruit and the maturity or palatability, that some varieties of the Florida avocados attain maturity and maximal quality with a little as 2%, 3% or 4% of oil, that of the other varieties, although some may ultimately attain as much or more than 8% of oil. 
    This occurs only late in the marketing season for these varieties that only inconsistently and well past the time when they have attained maturity and are ready to be marketed. 
    It has also been determined by checkup on the marketing of the Florida avocados from year to year since 1954, that maturity and palatability of these avocados is assured by prescribing permissible shipping dates for each variety of the fruit in each season in correlation with attainment by the fruit of specified minimum weight or diameter. 
    Accordingly, under the federal marketing order, the Secretary of Agriculture has in each season since 1954 issued maturity regulations establishing permissible picking dates for each of some 40 varieties of the Florida avocados, dates when avocados of the designated variety may be picked and shipped if then of the specified minimum weight or diameter. 
    Both Dr. Harkness and Dr. Harding were examined as witnesses in this case, and the record on appeal exhibits the nature sent, the results of their studies of the maturation and palatability of the Florida avocados.

    Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson 
    The District Court in making that finding disregarded entirely the testimony, the only testimony in the case regarding the Florida avocados, disregarded all of the testimony of these witnesses, leaving no testimony in the record of this case to support any such finding in relation to the Florida avocados.

    Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson 
    I say, no counter testimony was introduced on the subject nor the testimony of Dr. Harkness, Dr. Harding impeached in any respect. 
    Of course a finding without a vestige of support in evidence -- this is no way binding of this Court. 
    There could be no finding in this case regarding the validity of this standard of 8% oil content in relation to the Florida avocados of the numerous varieties that is not consonant with the testimony of Dr. Harkness and Dr. Harding. 
    There is no other testimony. 
    There is shown in several ways in the record of this case the inapplicability of the oil standard to this as proof. 
    Many thousands of oil tests were made in the research project conducted by Dr. Harkness and then in subsequent years by the staff of the Department of Agriculture. 
    They established, first, affirmatively that these avocados do come to maturity with less than 8% oil content, in fact many of them with less than a half of that oil content. 
    That the other varieties, if they ever attain 8% oil content, do so only five, six, seven, or eight weeks after they are mature in accordance with the standards established under the federal regulation. 
    Your Honor, I'm answering your question at this time in a sense out of order because the argument to which I am now directing myself is the fact that standards have been established under federal law, that these are the standards prescribing the condition for the marketing of this fruit in all 50 states of the union.

    I'll do it right now, Your Honor. 
    Dr. Appleman said that he was not making any study of maturity of avocados, but his contact was as a chemist making -- doing certain research work in which he used two varieties of California avocados as subject material. 
    The varieties called the Fuerte and Hass which incidentally account for the overwhelming share of the whole California crops. 
    These are of very high oil content. 
    As to Florida avocados, Dr. Appleman said candidly, I know nothing at all about Florida avocados. 
    In fact, he did not claim knowledge of any varieties of California avocados other than the Fuerte and the Hass. 
    He simply was permitted to say without any support whatever that in his opinion, the 8% oil standard was the best available at this time and of course on his own test to me -- testimony, that could've been applicable only to the California avocados.

    In other words if it were merely a repetition, if the state standard were merely a repetition then it might be argued that there's no conflict. 
    So it shows affirmatively by overwhelming evidence and undisputed evidence that they are radically and fundamentally different so that there is conflict. 
    And as a matter of fact, the Florida avocados could not get out of the state unless they complied with the federal regulations then the situation would be that they would be validated, certified under federal law and 49 other states could say, “No, we don't like that test.

    No sir. 
    There isn't a word in the record of this case about any taint in the Florida avocados.

speaker="isaac_e_ferguson" startTime="2026.329" stopTime="2057.382">
    Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson 
    No. 
    There is a fact -- a claim made on the other side which is ironically, and this is part of Dr. Appleman's testimony to show that the fat in avocados is not of the type which creates cholesterol. 
    Now, I am no expert on this but if he says that that -- apologizes for that fat and he says --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2057.382" stopTime="2062.375">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    He is proving that that -- their avocados won't make you fat, or inflicts some other (Voice Overlap).
speaker="isaac_e_ferguson" startTime="2062.375" stopTime="2142.674">
    Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson 
    And it's not dangerous fat, not dangerous to the heart. 
    So that the 20% or 30% California avocados need that apology, but the Florida avocados with their low oil content do not need any such apology. 
    That is all there is in this case and the word health isn't mentioned and of course, it would be a strange situation if the Federal Government in making standards of maturity, quality did not take into account the welfare of the consumers just as much as the -- any state establishing such standards. 
    The real effect of the thing is that the Californians are told, “If you want to eat avocados, you have to eat avocados with high oil content.” 
    You can't choose to take the avocados with low oil content even though they are mature and of good quality by standards established under federal law after thorough research and after years of practical experience.

    They -- an ironical element of this case is that the biggest handler of California avocado is taking an active part from this case through its counsel and that organization, Calavo Growers of California served as the selling agent for the leading handler in Florida, one of the appellants in this case sold those avocados all over the country and never paid any attention to oil content and resold them in the neighboring states when they were rejected in California.

speaker="isaac_e_ferguson" startTime="2543.543" stopTime="2849.587">
    Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson 
    And Your Honors would see how thorough that study has been. 
    I would like to diverge probably marketing order, the contention that the California standard cannot validly be substituted for the federal standard to say that there is another aspect to the case that even independently of the congressional enactment and the establishment of federal regulation thereunder that the restriction of sale of the Florida avocados in California in violation of the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. 
    175 years ago, the authors of our National Constitution then Clause 3 of Section 8, Article 1 of that very document, first thing in Congress, plenary power to regulate commerce among the several states, the provision accounting in large part for the making and adoption of the Constitution. 
    There by as construed by this Court, there was established at one stroke a common market of all the states, a market rid of all barriers against the free flow of commerce from state to state, a market to be kept immune from all such barriers. 
    Great many cases have come to this Court wherein state or municipal action claimed to be valid within the -- of the local police power, has been challenged under the Commerce Clause because of direct or indirect interference with interstate commerce. 
    And the rulings of these cases have turned upon consideration of the precise nature of the challenged local action and the precise effect of such action upon interstate commerce, if any. 
    The result of these cases if generalization may be ventured is that the police power of the state and of the municipal governments, no matter how broadly defined has not been permitted to override the national interest by arbitrary and burdensome infringement upon the freedom of interstate commerce envisaged by the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
    In the case at bar, an agricultural standard a -- standardization law of California when applied to avocados grown in Florida and shipped in interstate commerce results in nearly total exclusion of sale of this fruit in California. 
    At best, sporadic sales late in the season, no opportunity to market when the avocados are ready for marketing under the federal regulation, no ability to promise deliveries at the state that interposed that would be desired by a chain of supermarkets, so at most these shipments that have been made to California are of that limited and sporadic character. 
    It is argued that this standardization law protects potential California consumers from purchase of immature avocados. 
    Truth is, however, that the California 8% oil requirement when applied through the avocado shipped from Florida denies to the people of California opportunity to buy the avocados which are of their nature of low oil content, but are nonetheless mature and wholesome and of excellent quality.

speaker="isaac_e_ferguson" startTime="3154.815" stopTime="3302.517">
    Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson 
    Florida might well have adopted standards. 
    It didn't do so. 
    That's why the Federal Government came in. 
    The Marketing Agreement Act had advantages which Florida could not give because as Your Honor knows, the Marketing Agreement Act avoided violation of the Sherman Act. 
    It was the kind of joint action that might have been challenged under the Antitrust Act. 
    It also had other possibilities which Florida could not have given. 
    That's why the growers and the handlers who wanted to see that no harm came to the industry by anybody offering undesirable fruit and hurting the reputation of Florida fruit, petitioned the Secretary of Agriculture to make this agreement and after the procedure, it calls over the Act in an extensive hearing, it was found desirable and necessary in the general interest of the Marketing Agreement Act which is to promote the welfare of agriculture. 
    I think in a mixed way of arguing the situation because of the Marketing Agreement Act from the regulation there under and the general question of violation of Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause, I say this is the only result here of this regulation so far as the Florida avocados is concerned, is invidious discrimination. 
    It keeps out avocados that are helpful, no way deleterious, but you can't get in because they happen to be varieties which are of low oil content as are probably most of the avocados produced in the whole world, South America and Cuba and elsewhere.

    Mr. John Fourt 
    If the Court please before proceeding to the problems of federalism which are involved in this case, it's necessary that we make comment on the state of the evidence. 
    As by way of example, counsel referred that to the evidence that the California statute was ultimate -- practically a total embargo on the shipments Florida avocados to California. 
    There is no such evidence, no such proof in evidence. 
    What happened at the trial was that handlers produced but one witness, a Mr. Harding who was in-charge of the federal research program. 
    Their main proof was in the form of depositions. 
    These depositions and exhibits take 297 pages of federal record. 
    These depositions were taken pursuant to a writ of stipulation which is part of the original record on file that all objections, except the form of the question are to be reserved until the time of trial. 
    And that the parties then may enter their exceptions to the depositions as if the witnesses were personally on the stand. 
    Now, these depositions were taken before a notary public who does not have authority to hear objections, therefore counsel as a matter of practice, the taking of depositions allows wide latitude for questioning in order to allow -- for discovery. 
    State officers then at the trial were entitled then upon objection to have them read at length at the trial, handlers at the trial. 
    Now, the handlers are the handlers that Mr. Justice Goldberg referred to are the two Florida appellants. 
    I refer to the parties as the handlers who are the appellants and state officers who are appellees. 
    Well, handlers at the trial did not offer to read the depositions and exhibits into the record as is normally done instead they offered them in mass, and state officers promptly objected and asked that they be read at length. 
    The District Court reserved ruling on the admissibility of these depositions and in a post trial written order after the parties had filed briefs in which both sides discussed the evidentiary objections to the depositions, the District Court expressly excluded the depositions from evidence.

    What theory, what ground?

    [Inaudible]
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="3491.598" stopTime="3587.591">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    Well, the point here is twofold. 
    We think that first, if handlers wish to contest of this exclusion of depositions that they should have posted in one of the questions presented in their jurisdictional statement which they have not done. 
    And secondly, that in this mass of 297 pages, we are confident that much of it is inadmissible and that it is not incumbent upon the District Court or in this Court to go through each page and separate the admissible from the inadmissible. 
    Therefore, it was reasonable for the District Court to exclude all the depositions. 
    Now handlers, both in the trial court and in this Court, assert that the depositions and exhibits were in evidence at the time of the trial because state officers in our previous motions to dismiss had made reference to them. 
    Now, in a motion to dismiss in the trial court it's proper for the District Court to look at the depositions to ascertain its jurisdiction. 
    This Court so held in Land versus Dollar, but the party filing a motion, such a motion to dismiss, does not waive their objections to the introduction of the depositions and evidence at a later time. 
    They are making a concession provisionally for the purposes of the motion only and this is the ruling in the Sixth and Seventh Circuits on motions for summary judgment and motion for -- motions for judgment in the pleading. 
    So --

    Mr. John Fourt 
    Right. 
    The -- because the trial court reserved ruling on the admissibility of the depositions, the trial court did look at the contents of the depositions in writing the memorandum opinion. 
    Then they instructed the winning party which was the state officers to prepare findings and the findings as we have gone through in detail of our brief are supported by the evidence in the record and do not relate to the excluded depositions so that there is evidence supporting each of the findings. 
    Although the trial court in its -- although in writing -- reaching its decision did consider the depositions and simply found them unconvincing.

speaker="john_fourt" startTime="3717.907" stopTime="3802.854">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    Yes. 
    At the trial, state officers faced the problem of having depositions which made good evidence or may not and so we made an extensive offer of proof in the trial court that if the depositions were admitted and particularly the lengthy portion was related to oil test, then state officers has rebuttal testimony that we wanted to put in and our offer of proof is in the record. 
    Now, the offer of proof is material because the -- as part of our offer of proof will show that the oil test techniques used make the Florida tests on the avocados fail substantially to extract all of the oil out of the avocados and that by making test with the proper equipment, a smashing action instead of a cutting action making test on Florida avocados, we first test with their method and then our method and our results are substantially higher, greater oil contents than their results. 
    Now, we would suffer material prejudice then if the Court is going to look at the depositions because we have not had an opportunity to rebut that testimony in the trial court. 
    And indeed the District Court, both in its memorandum decision and in its findings and judgment expressly reserved to two state officers the right to introduce rebutting testimony added through the trial. 
    Yes sir.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    [Inaudible]
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="4844.076" stopTime="4953.181">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    Yes, sir. 
    Turning to the preemption issue, I think I'm going to stick with my order but speed up. 
    The avocados are grown commercially in California and Florida. 
    Now, avocados are picked for commercial marketing in a hard inedible state and it cannot be told from looking an avocado whether it's mature enough. 
    Now, if the avocado which is picked is immature, then it shrivels and it becomes inedible. 
    On the other hand, if at the time it was picked, it was mature, then in the period of four or five days at room temperature, then it will soften into a normal fruit. 
    Now, the problem arises in the avocado industry because the nature sets the end of the shipping season for the avocado grower. 
    The fruit becomes overripe right on the tree and drops, so the only control the grower has is at the beginning of the season. 
    Now, the beginning of the season, the price is high and so there's a temptation for growers to ship their avocados early even though the avocados may be immature. 
    Now, for this reason, California, very early, sought a way of protecting the California consumer from the deceptive marketing of avocados which were immature. 
    And it was observed that as the avocado matures the oil content increases. 
    And it is a practical matter in avocados that had 8% oil content would mature into a soft edible fruit and avocado that had less than 8% oil content would not so mature.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4953.181" stopTime="4957.845">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do any of the California avocados have as little as 8%?
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="4957.845" stopTime="4960.384">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    There are varieties which --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4960.384" stopTime="4962.447">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And --
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="4962.447" stopTime="4965.920">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    Well -- well, of course all of the avocados start at zero and go up, yes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4965.920" stopTime="4972.784">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I mean, when they get a -- what -- what you're talking about mature, are there another avocados that below this 8%?
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="4972.784" stopTime="4979.753">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    Well, yes. 
    Virtually, all varieties are put on the market immediately as soon as they hit 8% oil, oil content.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4979.753" stopTime="4985.536">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is there any difference between the oil content of avocados supplied in California?
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="4985.536" stopTime="5009.375">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    Yes. 
    The -- there are three types of varieties of Florida avocados, the Guatemalan and hybrid varieties. 
    Dr. Harding testified that these varieties reached up to 20% as high as 20% in oil content during the period of their commercial maturity, during their shipping season.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5009.375" stopTime="5010.227">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Where are they from?
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="5010.227" stopTime="5128.737">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    Yes. 
    And these varieties during the 1959, 1960 year constituted 88% of Florida production and these varieties are increasing in importance, in -- this percentage is increasing year by year. 
    Now, there is also a West Indian variety of Florida avocados which -- in which the -- some varieties are very low in oil content. 
    Other varieties during their shipping season would be both below and above the 8% oil content standard. 
    Now, the point is that the hybrid and Guatemalan varieties, the District Court [Inaudible] can be shipped to California because at -- during the shipping season, they go way above 8% oil up to 20%. 
    Now, the Guatemalan varieties are highly perishable, more perishable than the Florida Guatemalan and hybrid varieties. 
    The experts testified at the trial that the -- because of this perishability and something the industry calls short shelf life, that when the West Indian variety goes into a grocery store, it ripens extremely fast, particularly, after long transportation and these experts testified that by reason of this perishability, it would not be commercially feasible to transport them across United States to California. 
    Now, for this reason, the District Court found that the application of the California statute to West Indian varieties was hypothetical. 
    Now, it should be pointed out that in a -- really handlers case on the Commerce Clause, Burnham Commerce then, means that they wish the California statute invalidated on a hypothetical situation, that is the West Indian varieties so that then they may market their Guatemalan and hybrid varieties in California free of the California requirement.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5128.737" stopTime="5132.913">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean brought about Guatemalan avocados grown in Guatemala?
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="5132.913" stopTime="5139.046">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    The Guatemalan variety, it's a variety that's traced from Guatemala but it's grown in Florida.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5139.046" stopTime="5143.663">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So this is aimed by the [Inaudible] that type of avocado grown in Florida?
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="5143.663" stopTime="5147.586">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    No. 
    The Guatemalan and hybrid varieties --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5147.586" stopTime="5148.099">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well then, that variety?
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="5148.099" stopTime="5184.830">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    Yes. 
    Now, those varieties, during their period of commercial marketability, reach as high as 20% in oil content. 
    Now, for that reason then, the inference is that they can reach and be marketed in California at the -- which requires an 8% oil content standard. 
    And that those varieties, the West Indian varieties of Florida avocados which would have difficulty meeting the 8% oil contents here couldn't be shipped there anyway because of commercial impracticability. 
    And the reason that they're not shipped there has nothing to do with our 8% oil content standard.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5184.830" stopTime="5189.000">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The evidence by Dr. Appleman has indicated did it not, that he didn't know about Florida avocados?
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="5189.000" stopTime="5214.475">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    Yes, that is correct. 
    Yes, his testimony referred to California avocados. 
    Now, the inference there is that for the California varieties, the 8% oil standard differentiated with -- and kept out immature avocados, and that the -- those 88% of Florida volume, Guatemalan and hybrid varieties, that goes high as 20% could also meet the California standard.

    Mr. John Fourt 
    They reach as high as 20%. 
    Well yes. 
    The problem there is that if you take any avocado and you pick it early enough, it won't have 8% oil content. 
    So the problem is to keep it on the tree until it reaches 8% oil content. 
    Now, the California packing houses make oil tests at the packing house and therefore they do not offer for market the avocados unless they knew it's going to reach 8% oil.

    Mr. John Fourt 
    Yes. 
    And the reason is because the congressional intent in the Federal Marketing Act was for a different objective than the California statute.

    What was that?
speaker="john_fourt" startTime="5829.986" stopTime="5914.160">
    Mr. John Fourt 
    The Federal Marketing Act was, as you just has stated, economic in effect designed to be controlled by the local industry and administered at the local level. 
    Now, for example, if the local grower feels that the shipping limitation is too restrictive, he may go to the administrative committee and obtain an exemption. 
    He doesn't have to go to the Secretary of Agriculture and these powers of exemption are in the hands of this local administrative committee. 
    Well, we want to give an example of the type of situations we think would exemplify our argument. 
    If for example, avocados left Flor -- the Florida marketing area and they were of sufficient size to meet the federal regulation but they arrived in California coated with a deadly spray, we believe that California, under its police power would be entitled to inspect those avocados for that deadly spray. 
    Now, to be sure, our statute which is intended to protect the consumer from receiving immature avocados is not so dramatic. 
    But we think that that there's no intention of Congress to prevent the state from exercising this type of protection for its consumers.

    Mr. John Fourt 
    That is correct. 
    Now if, as we pointed out here, the program is managed -- administered at local level by the Florida avocado industry, the program can be terminated by a majority vote or a majority who's growing a -- over half of the volume at any time the marketing program displeases them. 
    If the local group there in Florida does not want a shipping regulation such as was argued here, they need not make a recommendation and there would be no regulation. 
    Now, it seems possible that if a local industry group wished to strike down a state law that they did not like, that the technique for them to do would be to form a marketing order and issue some kind of a regulation controlling the flow of their commodity in market. 
    Now, it maybe a high regulation or low regulation presumably to maximize returns, it would be a low regulation and if the position of handlers is correct here, any regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture, the recommendation of this local committee would preempt the field of regulations. 
    And not necessarily then would there be any protection for the consumer and we do not imagine that Congress had intended that this type of self-help regulation would be utilized to strike down state statutes which are otherwise within the state police power.

    I think this is the danger. 
    The state law is fixed. 
    It cannot be amended except by the legislature. 
    These regulations can be amended in 48 hours notice by the recommendation of the local committee and it's been said that there's nothing that ripens on avocados like an F.O.B. cash ready. 
    In closing, we would like to point out that there has been no intervention in this case and no objection made by the Secretary of Agriculture that the California statute has in any way frustrated the objectives of the California -- of the Federal Marketing Act of 1936 -- 1937. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson 
    That's right and here it is absolutely complete because it is the only standard applicable to these avocados. 
    Just a moment about the evidence in this peculiar after trial statement that they were not admitted, repeatedly Your Honors will see that these depositions were admitted. 
    They were offered and admitted. 
    And then as Mr. Fourt says, he wanted to -- have them read, I never objected to having them read but the judges didn't want to sit and hear them read. 
    And the -- he said, “We object Your Honor and we respectfully ask permission and request that they'd be read in order that we may make objections to the testimony. 
    We have a written memorandum prepared outlining objections to each proposed item. 
    We have objections to many of the answers as being hearsay.” 
    Then Judge Goodman said, “We will mark the depositions in the evidence and we will reserve ruling on the objections that had been filed when we have had a chance to examine them.” 
    And Mr. Fourt protested like this, “Thank you very much.” 
    Then at a later time, at the end of the case, when the Court told us what they wanted in the way of a transcript, Judge Albert said, “You don't have to reproduce what's in this record that was before this Court for all these depositions were here before” and it was not my argument that they couldn't make objections. 
    They made all of the objections they wanted to. 
    As far as I was concerned, there was no ruling on the objections, no place. 
    There is no ruling on the objections and the elementary rule is that if an objection is made and not ruled upon, then it is nothing, the record stands and it's admitted. 
    This is repeated several times that these depositions and the exhibits are admitted subject to objections. 
    This after trial statement is not a ruling on objections. 
    A typical objection is that the depositions were taken pursuant to depositions -- to stipulation were not admissible because the witnesses -- it wasn't shown that they resided more than a hundred miles away from Sacramento. 
    The depositions were taken in Miami. 
    Is there any ruling on that objection? 
    Is there any ruling that any particular thing is hearsay? 
    Your Honors will look in vain, any place in this record for rulings. 
    That is why we had no occasion in our brief in this case to say anything about it and it has been pointed out here the Court considered them. 
    The -- and the -- one statement is that they considered them arguendo. One statement is -- it considered them offers of proof. 
    I made no offers of proof. 
    I offered them in evidence. 
    They were received in evidence and as was pointed out here, even in this post trial statement, it is said they were considered by the Court. 
    And then the opinion of the Court, it says, they were assumed to be admissible, all assumed to be admissible and considered arguendo whatever the word arguendo may mean then. 
    Now, it is admitted over and over again here in the briefs of the other side that the West Indian varieties which have importance as particularly one of them, the -- all of them has had sizeable production and could have a great deal more. 
    And it would come at a time when it would have a very favorable market in California in September and October when California avocados have practically disappeared from the market. 
    That they never attain 8% oil content, that's admitted here. 
    Then they argued the merchantability and when His Honor put the question what is -- what would be the case if they were delivered by airplane, actually, the argument is suspicious. 
    The practicability, it depends on speed of transportation and refrigeration, both of which have advanced greatly from year to year. 
    And it's a merchant's question to answer whether they can be successfully marketed in California not a judicial question and many other things is a grossly distorted statement here about Dr. Harding's testimony about oil content and that some of them have attained 20% during the shipping season and he argued nothing -- he stated nothing of the sort. 
    There are various other things but I see a red light here and I thank Your Honors again.
