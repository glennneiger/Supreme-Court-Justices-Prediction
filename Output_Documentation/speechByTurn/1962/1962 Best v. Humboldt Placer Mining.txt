    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices. 
    This case presents the issue whether the filing of a proceeding to condemn lands to which the United States has legal title but as to which there may be there is asserted rights under the public domain, especially here the mining laws, deprives the Department of Interior of its ordinary jurisdiction to determine the validity of such claims. 
    We are dealing here with the question of power of the District Court, not as to exercise the discretion I believe because as I would trace in a minute the District Court exercised its discretion in favor of permitting the administrative proceeding to proceed in a normal manner. 
    The facts are few. 
    The United States is undertaking the Trinity River project, heart of the Central Valley project in California. 
    This is in the northernmost project. 
    It has been added to the project in recent years as another feature. 
    In January of 1957, condemnation proceedings were filed covering some 3000 acres of land for the purpose of that project. 
    The lands were for the most part, public domain on which there were many outstanding mineral entries under the mining laws. 
    In that proceeding, as the District Court has specifically found the right to retain administrative authority to proceed in the usual way to determination of validity of the claims was expressed expressly reserved. 
    The Department acting under the regulations and the procedure in 1958 instituted proceedings, of what is called a contest --

speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="235.661" stopTime="342.864">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Well, I think it was put in the complaint simply -- so that it would not be read as an admission that all the mining claims were valid. 
    I don't think that was inconsistent with the specific finding that the right was retained to determine that validity. 
    I think there are two different things and I think it was simply making claim, which we often do in filing these complaints when for some reason or other, we have a claim but we want to condemn, in any event, to make that allegation in the condemnation case, so as to put the landowners on notice. 
    Actually, it isn't provided for in the Federal Rule. 
    The Rule 71A concerning the allegations of the condemnation complaint do not contemplates any pleadings on matters except right to take. 
    The matters of compensation are not the matter of ordinary pleading and the form in there, as you'll see, has no provision for it. 
    The only provision is statutory authority to take what the purpose, what title do we -- what are we condemning and as I say, we put these allegations in there so that people won't be misled, but a lot of times the -- it's the idea, that mere filing of a complaint admits the property right. 
    Of course, that was the subject of a 93 Acres case, not long ago in this Court where it was held that there was no such admission or election to treat the property right as valid.

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    On the entire 3,000 acres which was the subject of this condemnation case, I think there -- I think there were some outstanding other interest, I'm not certain. 
    But as to this Humboldt case because this comes up in collateral way, we brought the condemnation proceeding --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="368.648" stopTime="369.662">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Then there was an injunction?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="369.662" stopTime="394.184">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Then the Humboldt Company brought a separate suit seeking an injunction against the administrative proceedings on the ground that -- as their complaint alleged, all questions of title and a right of the United States to the use and occupation of said premises are wholly and entirely within the exclusive jurisdiction of it, by the entitled court.

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    That's right. 
    That's right and that was their theory that the institution of the proceedings had vested in the condemnation court, complete and exclusive jurisdiction and the obligation to determine all matters. 
    And that's what the issue is here, whether it does so or not.

    And what -- our view actually is as was done in this case and I say, has been done in many others that we file the proceeding, we obtain the possession, which is needed whether the claims are valid or not. 
    Then action is withheld in condemnation while the administrative proceedings proceed, then the administrative decision is brought back to the condemnation case, and appropriate proceedings then take it.

    So that I -- as I under -- as we read their opinion they put it on an election as a matter of law which follows from the fact they found in the complaint.

    Even though you disclaimed the --
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="526.712" stopTime="681.199">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Even though we disclaimed the intent to do so, I think they made it quite plain that their notion is that our intent makes no difference. 
    In the course of this discussion, I think we have summarized what the case is about and I will turn to -- first, the District Courts, it granted summary judgment for the United States. 
    On three basic ideas expressed in its opinion that invoking the principle of a court with jurisdiction over in the entire controversy, may defer its ruling, withhold action as to a particular matter while that matter is determined by some other special tribunal. 
    Second, that the Bureau of Land Management has special competency in determining, contesting claims to public lands, that the Star Chamber charged with the plaintiffs in the case had made against such procedures was unwarranted and that there was every reason to allow the agency to adjudicate these claims. 
    Finally, he pointed out -- he said, there was no multiplicity of trials because the Court will not try the issue of validity of the mining claim which is a different, much a different issue from the validity -- from the question which -- would ultimately be presented if the claim is valid as to the amount of compensation based on market value of the claim. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed. 
    It expressed this idea of election and I think its one sentence on page 40 of the record epitomizes its notion. 
    No statute or controlling authority has been called to our attention, indicating that the Administrative Tribunal was in the Department of the Interior, retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the validity of mining claims after the Secretary of the Interior has invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court by the filing of a condemnation action in which has raised the same issue.

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    No, 40. 
    Our argument is four basic ideas. 
    First, the general principles was -- become known as primary jurisdiction. 
    The power of courts to defer to administrative agencies, to state courts is very well established.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="720.292" stopTime="728.126">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And is this I gather that aspect of primary jurisdiction which relies principally upon the so-called expertise?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="728.126" stopTime="785.811">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    I -- that is -- a great deal out of it, yes. 
    I think that expertise in the sense, not only of familiarity but I think also important here is expertise in the sense of having procedures adapted to the subject matter you're dealing with. 
    I think that's important because in condemnation courts, as I pointed out, there are no pleadings relating to other matters than right to take. 
    So the -- to the condemnation courts undertake the pass on these mining claims. 
    As we point out, a great many of them are dormant or stale. 
    The administrative procedures dispose of them by defaults or some sort of a ad hoc procedure would have to be adapted by the courts to set up some system of pleading, answer, publication, trial of the issue --

    (Voice Overlap).

    Mr. Marquis, what are the provisions for review of the administrative determination?

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    But as to judicial review, as I will summarize a little bit later, in land matters there has never been any general statute for court to review. 
    The exercise has been in terms of the narrow mandamus jurisdiction in the District of --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="821.351" stopTime="866.304">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    No, (Voice Overlap) -- it's alright. 
    I might as well finish the subject now while I'm talking about it and call the Court's attention to a recent statute in October, which was primarily because of public land matters of various kinds in which Congress authorized as a matter of venue. 
    This is very general and we're going to have our problems but they authorized Federal District Courts throughout the country to (Inaudible) exercise the same power to review in the nature of mandamus which has been exercised here in the District of Colombia arising under the old common law --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="866.304" stopTime="872.315">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, could this be done then under this new arrangement in the condemnation court?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="872.315" stopTime="886.659">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    It would be the same court. 
    There we get into a question of a -- I don't know, I -- you get into procedural questions then, I suppose of whether it's a condemnation court as such or whether it was the same court in a proceeding unless that --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="886.659" stopTime="889.111">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And probably would be the same judge in any way, is that it?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="889.111" stopTime="1071.574">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    I think, undoubtedly, it'd be assigned to the same judge. 
    I don't believe there's any reason can be given, why not and there are very many reasons why the rule of deferring to expertise, when available, should apply to condemnation cases. 
    Third, I will briefly deal with the thought of filing of a suit constituting an election and I think for reasons very similar to the 93 Acres case, and then a very short extension of that case to this, that such -- no such election should result from filing, simply from filing a condemnation case. 
    And fourth, we have developed in our brief in some detail the background of public land law makes it especially desirable. 
    I think that this power of the Department to determine these complex matters should be preserved. 
    I don't think I need to elaborate on the general principle of power to defer to states courts, to administrative agencies or particular matters but certainly this Court has had many cases on that general subject in various particulars in recent years. 
    The condemnation cases that we have noted in our brief, not infrequently, wait or could -- before concluding a condemnation case until state courts shall determine title matters or for instance, tax matters that may arise when there is a lien tax under complicated state laws, various subjects like that, matter over the title to real estate. 
    They may await the determination. 
    We see no reason why those general principles should not apply to condemnation cases. 
    A matter -- as a matter of fact, it seems to me that the -- this Court's decision in the County of Thibodaux case is very close to that, this -- that aspect. 
    If you recall, that was the case where the -- of the City of Thibodaux, Louisiana Power and Light case. 
    If you'll recall that was a case where a state condemnation case had been removed to federal court under diversity and this Court held that the problem there of whether there was a right of eminent domain in the particular circumstance by the city should be deferred until the state court could determine the matter. 
    Certainly, it seems to me --

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    That's right. 
    That's right but I think that -- that demonstrates that there isn't this complete jurisdiction of a court, such of a condemnation court, since that it cannot await the decision of some other body and that -- I -- when we're dealing with the question of power, that is distinguished of whether the circumstances are appropriate for wait -- waiting. 
    And the question of power, I don't -- it didn't seem to me there's any difference whether we're dealing with the administrative agency or the head of Government or whether we're dealing with state courts or state administrative agencies if the problem arises.

    Well, that's something else. 
    That's (Inaudible) -- that's the area as to exercise of discretion. 
    That is where the fact of the mining law, the public domain background and the broad powers that have been always vested in the Department of Interior and in the General Land-Offices since -- oh, 1812, I think it is. 
    The broad power to deal with the federal property becomes important. 
    But I think on the question of power these cases are in point.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    There none have been over the objection of the United States and really I don't think you get into that because here the Court, in the exercise of his discretion has said, “Well, I will defer to the Departments”. 
    I certainly think that that is a justified. 
    I think the history of Public Land Law (Inaudible) -- not only the difficult factual problems you get into, the lack of procedure of the court as contrasted for the administrative procedure available, which is much more suitable to adjudicating these matters.

    Adjudicating the title?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="1269.654" stopTime="1347.626">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Whether the title -- whether some title of the United States has been transferred to the claimants. 
    That is our basic problem that this is -- this is the United States dealing with its own title. 
    I think that's the reason in that background why such broad authority, in terms of generalizations, have been given over the years to the Land Department and that's why this Court has over the years, many times said that the Land Department is a special tribunal constituted for this purpose, who's rulings and for example in many areas, and I won't go with the details, in many areas their ruling is conclusive. 
    When a patent is issued, it can't be attacked and there is a long history of administrative process and of wide administrative discretion and all implications, this is perhaps one of the rare fields where all implications of anything that ought to be done is in favor of power of the administrative authority unless some specific statute denies it.

    Maybe a little bit of description of this rather unusual mining law procedure would be helpful. 
    There are three stages of the mining law procedure. 
    First is prospect, you can prospect as long as you go peaceably and you don't get into fights about the gold claims or something like that. 
    A person can -- first goes and prospects and his possession, in his prospect is a valid right as against third parties but is no right at all, the mere prospect is no vested right at all as against the United States. 
    He discovers his mineral. 
    The gold miners found their gold then there is the established procedure called location. 
    Whereas you put up monuments around your -- you state your claim, you file under local law in the County Recorder's Office or according to local requirements. 
    That's one of our difficulties. 
    That's the way the thing has grown up. 
    It still is true so that there's no notice on the federal records of these mining claims. 
    A proper discovery and location, you can then proceed to work that mine and you have a right, a vested right to that possession as against the United States as well as against the whole world.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the patent?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="1486.181" stopTime="1488.376">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Then you don't have to patent.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1488.376" stopTime="1490.125">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    No, but you do -- you can't patent --
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="1490.125" stopTime="1577.825">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Well, then that's the third step, the final step. 
    Then patent, you have to follow procedures, publication. 
    You have to prove what -- claims to the Bureau and go through all of that procedure. 
    Payment of $500, I believe, I meant $5 per acre, goes through all those procedures then you obtain the patent. 
    Of course, there's a difference and it works both ways. 
    There are attempts to use a mining claim as a basis for securing a patent when actually you're going to use the property for some other purpose once you get the fee. 
    That's one aspect of the matter. 
    The opposite aspect of the matter is that if you're mining, if you have a mining claim, for example, you can use the timber on their land only to the extent that it can be used and contributes to your mining operations. 
    You're not a general owner of the timber, had the timber, so that -- but on the other hand, people may go on, mining for years without seeking a patent for tax or other reasons. 
    Because when their concentration is on the mineral, they don't need any more right in order to mine the mineral, so that we have a variation of types of rights that may be created as against the United States in this field. 
    So that's what I answer when I talk about title that's sort of a small answer to the matter.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1577.825" stopTime="1580.681">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And in this case were there any patent issued?
speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="1580.681" stopTime="1789.956">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    In this case, they're all unpatented mining claims. 
    So we're in the area of where they're claiming that they made a location and made their discovery. 
    Now, that discovery is the complicated field that you get into because the general standard is and has been over the years, what a person of ordinary prudence would be justified in further expenditure of his labor and means with a reasonable prospect of success in developing in mind. 
    Having in mind all the physical situation of the quantity, quality, the available market, what kind of mineral you're talking about, all of which gets into a very complex subject of expertness. 
    The field manual, I think this is something, it's important to keep in mind in this case that when we're talking about mining laws today, where this is a real -- it's real vital today because these mining laws, as distinguished from the Mineral Leasing Act, whereby the federal properties are simply leased. 
    That applies to oil and gas and coal and three or four other minerals. 
    That mining law still apply today to all other minerals, Uranium, there's 14 -- there's a field manual for examiners that go out from the Department of Interior, to engineers to do the field of examination on all these assets, whether there is a valid mining claim or not. 
    In which at least, I think 14 pages of double columns of various kinds of minerals and their chemical content and their technical name and the like. 
    So it's -- that is the area which we're dealing today. 
    This particular claim of Humboldt is a placer claim from a -- for gold. 
    I don't know but I think it is one of the secondary recovery processes that have been going on in California that going up the streams where the 49'ers and the like they got out the gold that a lot of particles went down the river and now it becomes valuable enough to reclaim those. 
    The -- turning back just a moment to the question of whether there is anything that prohibits the trial court -- the condemnation court to permit the administrative agency to complete its pro -- proceed with its process. 
    There's nothing in the statute authorizing institution condemnation proceedings, it's just as -- it says nothing at all that can be construed that way, it's simply the general statute providing that the Federal District Court shall have jurisdiction and proceedings brought by the United States to condemn property. 
    I see nothing in there denying that normal power.

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    No, no not this. 
    There was another one which we just referred to as being existent which has no particular relevance. 
    This describes the kind of examination, the field examinations, the expertness, the matters that have to be gone into. 
    There have to be tests, samples taken, samples analyzed, let's say there have to be examination with local records, there have to be -- all of those matters. 
    Local recording records have to be looked into, the business situation has to be looked into to determine whether there is -- one of these questions, as one of the cases we have cited is whether there is presently a demand for this mineral, such as to justify the validation of the claim as distinguished from an attempt to get possession of the land to use it for some other purpose. 
    All of those matters, I think certainly in dealing with a matter of this size where we've got as many cases as this District Court had pending in its civil docket at the time certainly would explain the reasons for not acting any quicker in filing the complaint, because as you will see in the record, the administrative complaint, the procedure, the contest so-called, which can be started by the Government under the procedures starts on page 10 of the record and it's quite detailed. 
    At page 11, you have the particular claims and the location of their recording and they have particular matters that are dealt with, with respect to particular claim (Inaudible) number 2 at the bottom of page 13 and the allegation is that they are nonmineral in character, minerals have not been found within the -- insufficient quantities to constitute a valid reco -- discovery. 
    All those matters had to be predetermined in this process before this particular complaint as to Humboldt could be filed.

    Well, of course if he has -- if he has a valid claim there is a taking at the time of possession and he secures 6% interest. 
    The market value of his claim is determined as of that date and he receives 6% interest as compensation for delay until final award is made. 
    That has always been considered by this Court to be adequate compensation for delays between possession and final payment of the money.

    They're -- for instance, the first project is 291 unpatented claims, 121 not examined, 55 had been validated. 
    Soon as they're validated, then they go back to the court for determination conferences.

    -- because I think the issue of this Court is whether the District Court has power to defer on any circumstances and that would be a matter -- that would be unless you could say that the plaintiffs had to stop themselves to challenging the power which would be going or rather far ahead. 
    So I don't think that that has really any bearing on the issue here. 
    Just a brief reference, as I said the statutes are silent with --the Court of Appeals ceased on the language of Rule 71A of the Federal Rules, the concluding sentence of Rule H which is determining the matter of method of trial. 
    As Your Honors may know when this rule was adopted in 1951, prior to it, there had been a great controversy as to just what method of trial should be adopted. 
    This rule was the result and that was the main thought that was being dealt with here and in great detail they spelled out which cases shall be in tried -- to be tried under these various alternative procedures on the issue of compensation, that's where all the focus was. 
    Just the issue of compensation and then simply on the end and make sure we're not going to have title matters go to a jury, it is the sentence, trial of all issues shall otherwise be by the Court. 
    We think it's clear there was nothing in the mind of the rule makers at the time and no warrant for reading part of the rule to exclude the -- as we say, the normal power of a court to defer to an expert body, administrative -- or administrative decision.

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    You appeal to the Bureau of Land Management in Washington, the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. 
    There is an appeal from his decision to the Solicitor of the Department of Interior to whom the Secretary has delegated the power to pass upon these matters then you go into the District Court of the District of Columbia under a proceeding in nature of mandamus. 
    As I say, under the new statute you can go -- I think you could go to the various District Courts throughout the country. 
    It's a venue provision which a new statute which it won't get into here. 
    But turning briefly to this matter of election, as I say -- I think the finding of the District Court makes it plain that there were no intentional of election to forego the administrative jurisdiction to pass on (Inaudible). 
    I submit that the -- there's no basis for saying in law there was a compulsory election. 
    In the 93 Acres case this Court held that there was no compulsory election or remedies when we brought a proceeding of property which we had leased and we argued alternatively, the lease was revoked and it -- if that had no right and alternatively that if they did have the right we would condemn it. 
    Lower courts had held that we elected our remedy by bringing the suit. 
    This Court refers to it and said we see no reason even justice or authority, why such a Hobson's choice either to give up our claim or to forego possession should be forced to -- should be imposed upon the Government. 
    Here we have the same basic problem. 
    First, I would like to note that we're dealing here generally with condemnation cases. 
    Its mere accident of allocation of responsibility that this condemnation case was filed by the Solicitor of the Department of Interior because it is a reclamation project, presumably no distinction can be made between cases as in Southern California filed on behalf of the Army and the Navy, Marines and the various other agencies. 
    And certainly, there isn't any way in which you could say that those officials of those agencies waved the authority which the Secretary of Interior has under the public domain laws. 
    The decision would present three choices. 
    First, postpone the project. 
    Postpone possession until it claims can be adjudicated under a departmental procedure. 
    This would certainly be prejudice of public interest in a lot of cases. 
    Second, to secure possession in the condemnation proceedings, waive the administrative authority which would then impose on the courts the burden of determining these myriad of claims and again I think it's plain that there would be great -- considerable delay in the matter of adjudicating the matters which would of course prejudice the United States in terms of interest liability and of claims getting old if there -- as they are processed.

    The factual findings of the Department under the public land laws are practically conclusive and it's just legal arguments they get into. 
    There is very narrow scope of review and there always has been in these public land matters because of course there didn't have to be any review at all. 
    This was simply the United States giving away -- disposing that public domain for its purposes and which as I have said, Congress has always given a very broad discretion to the agency and a very limited review.

    That is very rough, my statistics are just out of the air but that is very roughly -- as I say you -- at each step, as in all such procedures, some of your people see that -- well, they have no claim they give up or they see that the matter has been decided. 
    It's a factual matter that the hearing examiner decides and that's the end of it.

speaker="roger_p_marquis" startTime="3078.535" stopTime="3128.617">
    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Well, I think it goes back to the history of it. 
    And as this Court has said many times that this is a special tribunal dealing with the land matters and it's the function of the Department of Interior to adjudicate between claimants and to protect the rights of United States and to get the policies carried out which was, of course, to have the lands developed for the general economy of the country. 
    So that having in mind all of those aspects, there was always the broad discretion given to the Department and the General Land-Office which was described often as a special tribunal to handle these matters with a special competency to do it. 
    That is a history --

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    Oh yes, oh yes. 
    There's a very -- one of the many functions and that's one of the peculiarities of these cases that we get in the District of Columbia that there are two claimants, very often. 
    Say to an oil and gas lease, yet, we're in a case as a defendant defending the Secretary's decision. 
    Quite often, the other parties will come in and we will find -- we'll have (Inaudible) in essence, a three-party controversy that way.

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    The very general authority is in the power to -- it actually traces back in the earliest days to the general authority to make rules and regulations for the public domain. 
    It's rather startling how broad. 
    A general definition was given in the very early days to the General Land-Office which then proceeded as matter of history to devise its procedures. 
    I think you'll find that one of the most interesting spelling out of all these matters as to -- particularly as to mining claims is as sought in the case. 
    Mr. Justice Van Devanter in the Cameron case which we have cited, he spelled out in detail what all these are and I was just turning to it to see whether he had given the citation for this question you asked. 
    He's -- it goes back to Catholic Bishop of Nisqually --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3241.868" stopTime="3242.518">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Of what?

    Mr. Roger P. Marquis 
    -- of Catholic Bishop of Nisqually in 158 U.S. is quoted in Cameron. 
    While there may be no specific reference in the Act of 1848 of questions arising under this grant to the Land Department, it's that administration comes within the scope of the general powers vested in that department. 
    It may be laid down as a general rule in the absence of some specific provision of the contrary. 
    To the contrary, in respect to any particular grant of public land, its administration falls wholly and absolutely within the jurisdiction to the Commissioner of General Land-Office under the supervision of Secretary of the Interior.

    There are a few things that I would like to bring to the attention of the Court that have been omitted by counsel for the petitioner. 
    This Court, beginning back in about 1874 determined the question of the character of a mining location upon the public domain and throughout all of the time down to the latest case, wherever that question has been in litigation and has reached this Court. 
    This Court has held that that mining location, as long as it is a subsisting matter of record is in a state of inheritance, it may be bartered and sold as any other form of real estate. 
    The person who owns that mining location or his successors in interest may mine that property until the mineral is totally exhausted and still never have to acquire a patent. 
    That character of a title to a mining location is unique. 
    Let us not confound it to a mineral lease under the Act of 1920, because it bears no -- none of those earmarks. 
    This record of a mining location is made wholly and entirely in the County Recorder's Office of the county of that particular state in which the mining location is situated. 
    Now, to argue for the -- before this tribunal, points of law that refer to some other form of holding could not possibly be germane to this particular issue. 
    This people were in possession of these mining claims. 
    It is not in the record but in as much as we've been arguing beyond the record and all over the map in this particular case, I might as well call the Court's attention to the fact that of the claims that are involved in this particular condemnation proceedings and this is only one of five that's against this company are a matter of a patent application that was pending for two years, that whatever filed in the condemnation proceeding when they try to bring to this Court the statement the they didn't know anything about the claim, while that county was overrun with experts from the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service.

    Mr. Charles L. Gilmore 
    Will be nothing, as far as this people are concerned because, frankly, I can write that decision. 
    It's going to be eventually written by the Solicitor for the Department of the Interior for he has already said and he determined and they're defensive and their particular defense in this case is predicated upon the principles that the Solicitor for the Department of the Interior has declared the claims invalid. 
    That's where we start from. 
    We have not had any hearing at -- to determine anything about these mining claims and as long as they are a subsisting matter of record and until they are cancelled they are real property and they're our property. 
    They don't belong to the Bureau of Land Management and it doesn't belong to the United States because this Court, in any number of cases, has said that the individual in the possession of that mining claim cannot be interfered in his possession. 
    You must get rid of him by some other process. 
    You can't go in and arbitrarily take it. 
    The United States in it's -- because of its powers under eminent domain has the right to go in and take any kind of property for it chooses. 
    Now, we admit that and the statute so provides.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4009.365" stopTime="4016.335">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But the Department also has the authority on the statutes to adjudicate the validity of the mining claim.

    Mr. Charles L. Gilmore

    Mr. Charles L. Gilmore

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4026.073" stopTime="4034.096">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The part of your case here is the Department has no authority anyway, is there, under any statute to adjudicate the validity of mining claims?
speaker="charles_l_gilmore" startTime="4034.096" stopTime="4177.495">
    Mr. Charles L. Gilmore 
    The only time they've ever had any authority is when they took it and they talk about the Cameron case, the Cameron case this Court was careful to state at its outset that Cameron went into the -- into that case without objection before the Land Department. 
    But some 30 odd years later, the Department of the Interior had to change forces, put up a new rule because in the case of O'Leary and Moore the Secretary of the Interior ruled that there was no statute providing for a hearing and in the contest against the mining claim. 
    And Congress does not pass any statutes since that time. 
    I don't -- to my knowledge and counsel has not pointed out any statute either. 
    We're not dealing with a license. 
    In the brief that has been filed here in the petition for this writ, counsel has stated that a mining location is a gratuity from the United States. 
    It is not a gratuity. 
    It is a grant, it is a grant. 
    A grant of this full and complete as if a patent had issued to it, as long as that man complies with the law, does his annual labor and he doesn't even have to ever get the patent. 
    There's our -- there's the question, we stop right there. 
    There is no analogy between that and such cases are -- as are cited here. 
    We -- let us go back and take the situation with ration -- with relation to a matter of eminent domain. 
    In 28 U.S.C. (a) 13 -- Section 1358 is a very short section that says, “The District Courts shall have original jurisdiction of all proceedings to condemn real estate of the use of the United States or its departments or agencies”. 
    It's about shortest act of Congress that I know of and that what is very clear is very succinct. 
    It means what is says. 
    When the United States filed its condemnation proceedings in that District Court then that District Court has a original jurisdiction of all those proceedings, there is no exception.

    Mr. Charles L. Gilmore 
    Over that, the Bureau of Land Management has no power in the case of adverse claims. 
    That's -- that has to be referred to a court of competent jurisdiction to try the rights between the two parties because of Section 52 of the Code, 3 U.S.C (a) says, that in actions between private individuals, the fact that the -- that this -- the paramount title may be in the United States has nothing to do with the case. 
    It's settled without that because there are -- they're based upon peculiarity of the mining law. 
    It's either one that's claiming under a grant and therefore the determination of a right of the title of two parties in conflict with each other must be referred to a court of competent jurisdiction.

    In other words, they took possession of our land under their writ of possession on the 24th day of June, 1957. 
    Now, on the 18th day of April, the respondents here filed their proceeding in the District Court. 
    There was (Inaudible) -- they got a temporary restraining order to restrain the officials from proceeding any further with any contest because they had just filed a contest on -- I think, it was the 19th day of March of 1960.

    But if the Bureau of Land Management has had the opportunity over the period of years to institute its proceeding in -- to contest the validity of this claim, under these claims, and if they believe they had the right then why wait for two years and eight months after the federal court had been asked by the chief law officer of the Department of Interior to bring these proceedings in eminent domain. 
    Now, the chief law officer is the Solicitor for the Department, he has said in his letter to the United States Attorney General that the claims are invalid. 
    This whole case rests upon that statement, using that as the basis. 
    We are charged of withholding claims of -- that are invalid. 
    Property that belongs to the United States, properties to which we have no title, we've have never an opportunity yet to have the question of our title determined by anybody, anytime or any place. 
    It should be determined, I believe, in the District Court which was importuned in the first place by the Department. 
    If we go into a contest before the so-called hearing examiner system invoked under the Bureau of Land Management at the present time, the prosecuting attorney sitting right there is an Assistant Solicitor for the Department of the Interior. 
    That hearing examiner works under direct instructions from the Sec -- from the Solicitor for the Department. 
    Now, just what kind of opportunity do we have to present our case to an impartial tribunal?

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Oh, that's a different question because if you choose, if you don't get a fair hearing before the Department, you got a court review?
speaker="charles_l_gilmore" startTime="4835.373" stopTime="4918.940">
    Mr. Charles L. Gilmore 
    Yes, but the question is how far can the Court go on a review in such cases? 
    I don't know. 
    I have no -- we've never reached that far yet in the Department of the Interior with this present day set up. 
    Up until 1956, hearings were conducted by the register and receiver, later by the managers of the Land-Offices until the case of the O'Leary-Moore and then -- when this one, Secretary Seaton decided in that case in 1956 that there was no statute providing for hearings in mining location -- mining claim cases. 
    And therefore, the Department would have to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act but the Department has not complied with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    Their appointment and their methods of handling cases to this hearing examiner system of their own does not comply with the Act because the hearing examiner is not an independent judge, if you put it that way, is not independent. 
    He's under the domination and under the direction, and under the control of the Solicitor for the Department of the Interior.

    That's right. 
    Then the -- as I say, the -- for Your Honor's information, the -- we are only -- this is only one of five condemnation cases in which properties of this company are involved. 
    We have a lot of other properties in there because if there's a -- of the vast builders and all time hydraulic mining operation, where you put water up against the bank and wash her out and get the gold. 
    Purely a gold producing matter, we have alleged it in our complaint in the injunction suit that their valuable claims were -- they were being worked for their gold content and -- but we've had no -- we've got no -- nothing to reshoot that. 
    We still maintain that we have valid existing mining claims and on the decisions of this Court, they constitute grants from the United States and they can't be taken from us except by due process of law. 
    Now then, if have to go back into a hearing before the Bureau of Land Management, we are prohibited the right to have the question of compensation, determined by a jury and in -- so, in that respect we are denied due process of law.
