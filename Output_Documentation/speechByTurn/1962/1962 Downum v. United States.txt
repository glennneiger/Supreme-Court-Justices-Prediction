    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Raymond Downum, Petitioner, versus United States. 
    Mr. Tinsman.
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="9.075" stopTime="178.750">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is a case involving the question of a former jeopardy and the sole issue presented here is the question of jeopardy. 
    The petitioner was convicted by the Federal District Court for the Western District of Texas on six counts of an indictment which charged conspiracy, to steal, forge, and pass United States Government checks, forging and passing two of those three checks and passing the third one. 
    He was convicted and an appeal was made to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on the sole ground of former jeopardy and the opinion was affirmed -- conviction was affirmed and here, we are appealing on that sole ground. 
    As the Court of Appeals stated in their opinion, the facts are undisputed and very simple in relation to the jeopardy question. 
    The petitioner was arraigned before the Court without jury. 
    Then sometime later, both sides were called and announced ready for trial. 
    A jury was selected in the morning and the jury was instructed to return in the afternoon at two o’clock. 
    Then sometime before two o'clock, apparently an out of court conference in the judge's chambers was had between the prosecutor and the Court. 
    And at two o'clock, the Court announced in open court without the jury being in the room that the Government had informed him that a witness as to count six and seven which involved one check was absent and that the Court was going to discharge the jury. 
    The defendant's counsel objected, asked that the Court proceed on the other four counts for which the prosecution admittedly had enough witnesses to convict; the Court overruled this motion. 
    The defense counsel then moved to dismiss the counts six and seven for which there was -- the evidence was not available, the Court overruled this motion, and discharged the jury. 
    Two days later, apparently, the missing witness was found. 
    And another panel was called, another jury was selected, and this jury convicted the petitioner on all six counts. 
    A plea of former jeopardy was interposed before the second trial which was overruled by the trial court. 
    So we are here today on the question, because it was developed in the trial that the only reason that the first jury was discharged was because the prosecutor didn't have a witness and this witness had not even been served with subpoena. 
    But the prosecutor had failed to check with the U.S. marshal's office directly across the hall from his own before he selected the jury, and before he announced ready.

    But he just didn't make any check and the subpoena was not served; he announced ready and then found that during the noon hour and then the Court discharged the jury.

    But it's our contention that this was a foreseeable circumstance that the prosecutor used the barest minimum of preparation to check and see if this witness' subpoenas had been served.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    The plea of jeopardy is designed to protect the rights of the defendant and has nothing to do with the prosecutor. 
    In this case, it was the Court that discharged the jury. 
    The Court could have refused to discharge the jury, but in fact, the Court's opening words on page 10 of the record after the out of court conference was that the Government's key witness is not here. 
    It was just as to one. 
    They announced ready and didn't have the witness when they announced. 
    So I'm going to discharge the jury from this case and pass it before a prosecutor had said anything in open court, before defense counsel had said anything. 
    This jeopardy provision is designed to protect the defendant against actions of the Court because anything a prosecutor does, the Court can overrule.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    I think as to the two counts that they were not ready on. 
    I think he would have been in position, but of course if he'd been convicted on the first four, the Government probably would have dropped them as a practical matter.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="364.286" stopTime="374.626">

    He would have been entitled a plea once in jeopardy if -- even though his counsel made the suggestion that they go to trial on the four counts?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    That's right. 
    The reason we made this suggestion is we were satisfied with the particular jury that was selected and we wanted this jury to try them with the evidence that the Government had ready.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="384.268" stopTime="399.970">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, but if the Court had followed your suggestion of trying them on four counts and then later, as you suggested, trying them on the other two, do you think he'd been once in jeopardy?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="399.970" stopTime="426.189">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    On the following two counts, I think he would have. 
    Of course, I think the Court should realize this was a complete shock to me when the Court came in and announced with no knowledge, we were there ready to go to trial and this is what our position was at that time. 
    We have not researched the law in jeopardy or anything else and I think the Court hasn't obviously because I don't think the Court would have done what he did, had it researched the law on jeopardy.

    First, the cases that have been already decided on this question of jeopardy, and secondly, what should the law be because here there is, there's nothing been decided on its precise point and yet there is a conflict between the Fifth Circuit in this case and the Ninth Circuit back in 1931 in Cornero.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    In our district, the counsel are only asked -- allowed to ask general questions of the panel and anyone that answers the general question, they're permitted to interrogate, and I think it took approximately 15 minutes. 
    But I will say this although it's not in the record, the jury was such -- the next defendant took the jury in toto without picking another jury.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Yes sir, [Inaudible] that's on the jury.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="553.859" stopTime="554.509">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You had what?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="554.509" stopTime="830.786">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Nine [Inaudible] on the jury. 
    [Attempt to Laughter] 
    Actually in this field, there are three important cases that we consider vital and that's the Cornero case decided in 1931 by the Ninth Circuit, the Gori case that this Court decided in June of 1961, in a five to four decision where Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote the majority opinion and Mr. Justice Douglas wrote the dissent, and the Perez case decided by this Court in 1824. 
    Now, the Cornero case, of course, is the -- actually the strongest case that petitioner has. 
    In this case, the defendant was charged just a one count indictment with conspiracy to “possess and transport” intoxicating liquor. 
    He was indicted with three other co-defendants and they had all plead guilty at a previous -- previous hearing and they were out on their bond and their bond required them to return when the trial of the fourth defendant, Cornero, came up. 
    And so the prosecutor announced ready on the assumption that these other defendants would not forfeit their bond and would appear since they‘d already plead guilty. 
    On the day of the trial, the witnesses didn't show up. 
    And so the prosecutor announced that he wasn't ready and in this case, Cornero asked for a continuance and they went out and tried to find the witnesses. 
    Well they got continuances for five days and they still couldn't find them so the judge dismissed the jury. 
    Two years later, they finally found them. 
    So they brought Cornero back; they've picked another jury, he was convicted, and he appealed aptly a former jeopardy. 
    The Ninth Circuit held he had been placed in jeopardy. 
    And the language of the Ninth Circuit is particularly significant, and we would like to call it to the attention of the Court. 
    It said the fact is that when the District Attorney empanelled the jury without first ascertaining whether or not his witnesses were present, he took a chance, this appears in page 7 of our brief. 
    There is no difference in principle between the discovery by the District Attorney immediately after the jury was empanelled that his evidence was insufficient and the discovery after he'd call some or all of his witnesses. 
    So we say that the Cornero case is similar that this was after the first jury was picked, no evidence was put on, the witnesses weren't there. 
    The jury was discharged and he was tried and convicted by a different jury. 
    Now, the Government points out in this case, it's virtually on all force, the Government devotes only one paragraph to it on page 33 and 34 of their brief. 
    And their only method of distinction it says, it says, “In a realistic sense, it could be said that the Government proceeded the trial without his evidence in Cornero, but in this case on the other hand, the Government was not preceding the trial without knowing that it had the witnesses to prove its case.” 
    Well frankly, we do not see the distinction the Government makes. 
    The only essential distinction is that there was two days rather than two years. 
    And we say that this is not a meaningful distinction in the concept of jeopardy. 
    The Gori case test is not the test of harassment which apparently the Government on page 39 would indicate that the test in jeopardy cases are. 
    The Gori case indicated that they specifically said, “We will not anticipate the situation in which a judge exercises his authority to help the prosecution at a trial in which its case is going badly by affording in another more favorable opportunity to convict the accused. 
    Well, in this case, it's our position that in a sense, this is exactly what the Court did, and the Government was not ready, it couldn't convict on count six and seven and so the judge gave it a new -- another chance to convict not only on both counts, but on all of the other counts in the indictment. 
    Now, I think it's also significant to look at Justice Douglas' language in the dissent where he says that, “Once a jury has been empanelled and sworn, jeopardy attaches and a subsequent prosecution is barred if a mistrial is ordered, absent the showing of imperious necessity.” 
    The prosecution must stand or fall on its performance at the trial. 
    I do not see how a mistrial directed because the prosecution has no witnesses. 
    It's different from a mistrial directed because the prosecutor abuses his office and is guilty of misconduct.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="830.786" stopTime="844.309">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Suppose the jury has been discharged just after the case both sides then came to the jury before they were sworn, the jury then is discharged.
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="844.309" stopTime="902.701">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    This is a slightly harder question but on theory, I don' think it would, Your Honor, because I think the basic proposition is whether you‘re giving this -- the Government a chance to go ahead and pick the entire jury, didn't look and see what kind of a jury they‘re getting and then elect. 
    Well, we got one witnesses to a few counts of this multi-count indictment so we'll get a new jury as to the whole. 
    The Government in this case could have gone ahead and tried the defendant on those four counts that they were ready on, they elected not to do so. 
    They could have requested a continuance. 
    They elected not to do so, and use the same jury. 
    And we feel that when the Government asked for a discharge of the jury, well, the Court grants one rather than getting a continuance after announcing ready, I don't think the mere swearing of the jury is anything once they‘ve seen who all the jurors are and the strikes have been announced, and the 12 people have been picked, I think that's the essential thing as far as reasoning goes but of course we don‘t have to consider that here because the jury was sworn.

    There was no indication that the Government was dissatisfied with the jury?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="906.812" stopTime="912.362">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well there was no indication one way or the other. 
    Now, the Government makes a contention in their brief, there was no way --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="912.362" stopTime="915.429">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How many peremptory challenges did the Government use?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="915.429" stopTime="919.089">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    In the first trial, the Government used three. 
    In the second, they used all six.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="919.089" stopTime="920.396">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Out of how many?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="920.396" stopTime="1351.831">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Three out of six. 
    Second trial they used six. 
    The Government -- the Government of course relies on the Perez case and particularly on the broad language of the Perez case where it states that the law has invested courts of justice with authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict whenever in their opinion taking all its circumstances into consideration there is a manifest necessity for the act or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. 
    I think that this broad language of Perez which is also quoted in Gori is something that is used sometimes out of context because of course Perez was only a case which established that a hung jury did not result in jeopardy. 
    And it's particularly significant that while the Government says that the manifest -- the ends of public justice should be a consideration. 
    In effect, the Fifth Circuit said it should be the only consideration. 
    On page 40 of the record, they wrote that Perez held that a judge may discharge a jury within sound discretion without operating as an acquittal when the ends of public justice require it. 
    But we say that the Fifth Circuit is just -- by that language saying that the discretion as to -- the question of jeopardy is completely within the discretion of the trial court. 
    And we think that it is not -- if there is some limits on the trial court's discretion. 
    And we think one of them is that when the trial court declares a mistrial, purely to help the prosecution prove its case against the defendant that in that case, the jeopardy does attach. 
    Now, we'd like to say one thing about the Government's contentions in their brief that seemed rather odd to petitioner. 
    On page 31 of their brief, they state, “However the fact the jeopardy may have attached does not however compel a reversal.” 
    On page 32, they say, “The prior jeopardy in this case was jeopardy only in the most technical sense of the term, but it's our opinion that jeopardy is jeopardy and it's like saying that somebody is just a little bit pregnant.” 
    There just isn‘t any in between and in fact on page 7 of their brief they say, “Contrary to petitioner's contention, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not impose a fixed rule that once a defendant has been placed in jeopardy, he cannot be brought before a second jury.” 
    They cite no case for this and it's our contention that this is the very question this Court must decide is whether or not, the defendant was placed in jeopardy. 
    The legal sense of jeopardy is in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution and that's the real question. 
    Not whether he was in technical jeopardy or any other kind of jeopardy but whether he was in jeopardy at all. 
    Now, I would like to comment on the case of Wade versus Hunter that Mr. Justice Black decided that the Government relies on. 
    This was a case involving unforeseen circumstances as it was clearly shown by the opinion. 
    A court marital of the defendant was recessed because of a tactical situation of the army in the field. 
    The army had moved forward, the witnesses were not available. 
    And the Court held that this was such a case of unforeseen circumstances that jeopardy would not attach. 
    We are not saying that the Government sets up a strong man and in effect and they say with the petitioners contending for a rule like -- of Cornero that whenever a jury is discharged after it is empanelled and sworn, the jeopardy attaches. 
    That is not our position at all. 
    Our position on page 13 of our brief is that jeopardy attaches when there is an imperious necessity, unforeseen circumstances or the mistrial has been granted in the sole interest of the defendant as it was in Gori, but in here, none of that exists. 
    There were no unforeseen circumstances that the prosecutor couldn't have found out if he'd exercised the least diligence whatsoever. 
    There was no doing just for the interest of the defendant; it was purely for the interest of the prosecution. 
    And finally, there was no imperious necessity that this be done again. 
    The cases that have held that are -- and that jeopardy did not attach are cases were something that couldn't be determined. 
    A hung jury, for example, is an unforeseen circumstance. 
    Now, we're not actually trying to change the law. 
    We cite in our brief, the Shoemaker case which was decided in 1840 and one of the old federal cases and this says, “However guilty the defendant may be, he can only be convicted according to law. 
    And a jury having been sworn to try his case, he has a right to their verdict unless some inevitable occurrence shall interpose and prevent the rendition of a verdict. 
    Before he goes to trial, the prosecutor should see that his witnesses are in attendance and that he is prepared to try any issue.” 
    This was as far back as 1840. 
    He also cites the Watson case in 1868. 
    So we are saying that here, the law is that a mistrial, because the Government has no witnesses as to a few counts of a multi-count indictment for which the prosecutor could have found out that he didn't have witnesses before he announced ready, is something that places the defendant in jeopardy. This falls within none of the exceptions of the jeopardy rule. 
    Now, the second point is, well -- what should the law be? 
    Because as we saw on Monday, the Court can change the law as they changed Betts and Brady. 
    We feel that there's no question that this is the way that the law should be. 
    This -- the alternatives were very simple. 
    The Court could have simply declared the continuance, told the jury to go home, come back whenever they found the witness. 
    They found him two days later. 
    The Court stated in page 10 of the transcript, “We expect to give you a trial this week.” 
    There was no necessity for discharging this jury. 
    We feel that the basic vice in this is that it opens, although in this case there was no abuse. 
    We are not saying that the prosecutor was hiding this witness out. 
    But that this case, if it is affirmed, opens the door to abuse, opens the door to a government prosecutor in an important case to have one witness as to one or two counts of a multi-count indictment, some place without a subpoena served on them and then if he gets a jury that is unsatisfactory, go to the Court and say, “We can't locate this witness.” 
    We would like this jury discharged and another one had and here's the authority for Downum versus Unites States. 
    And we say that when you open that risk of judicial arbitrariness that Justice Douglas talked about in the opinion in Gori, that this is something that shouldn't be done. 
   
   
   
   Argument of William A. Geoghegan

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Geoghegan.
speaker="william_a_geoghegan" startTime="1363.221" stopTime="1845.908">
    Mr. William A. Geoghegan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court. 
    In 1949, Mr. Justice Black, speaking for a majority of this Court in Wade against Hunter had this to say with respect to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
    It does not mean that every time a defendant is put to trial before a competent tribunal, he is entitled to go free if the trial fails to end in a judgment. 
    Such a rule would create an insuperable obstacle to the administration of justice in many cases in which there is no semblance, the type of oppressive practices at which the double jeopardy prohibition is aimed. 
    Some years earlier, Justice Cardozo speaking for this Court in the Palko case warned that the tyranny of labels must not lead us to lead to a conclusion that a word which in one set of facts may stand for oppression or enormity is of like the fact in every other. 
    Justice Cardozo was there again speaking about the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
    The petitioner in this case would have this Court adopt a very rigid and inflexible rule which under some circumstances would always mean that after the discharge of a jury, the defendant had been in prior jeopardy so that he could not be again tried. 
    The rule might be stated simply as this, “The absence of a government witness never justifies the discharge of a jury and the retrial of the defendant.” 
    That is the rule which the Court in Cornero, in the Ninth Circuit handed down in 1931. 
    The reason why the Government in its brief in this case did not spend much time discussing Cornero is because that rule was vigorously urged upon this Court in Wade against Hunter, specifically urged and specifically rejected. 
    And quoting again from Mr. Justice Black's opinion in that case, we are asked to adopt the Cornero rule on which -- under which petitioner contends the absence of a witness can never justify discontinuance of a trial. 
    Such a rigid formula is inconsistent with the guiding principles of the Perez doctrine to which we adhere. 
    So this Court has had this argument before. 
    This question as to whether or not, Cornero sets the rule which should be followed by this Court and it has specifically adopted it. 
    Now, I'd like to view this case from four aspects, which I think are very important. 
    First of all is that – in this case the jury was discharged before it even assembled to hear the case, before opening statements had been made, before witnesses were sworn or any testimony heard. 
    Secondly, no prejudice whatsoever resulted to the defendant in this case in being tried by a different jury two days later. 
    In fact, there is no claim of prejudice. 
    And thirdly, that the culpability of the prosecutor in producing the circumstances which caused the Court in this case to discharge the jury to the extent that it existed at all was slight understandable and excusable as I will develop. 
    And fourth and finally, when the Court in this case discharged the jury, he was acting in an area in which this Court has time and again says it has wide and broad discretion. 
    I don't believe that discretion should be disturbed in this case. 
    Going to the first point which I mentioned, the fact that this jury was discharged before it had even assembled to hear the case, I'd like to compare this case with some of the other cases in which this Court has dealt with this problem of whether or not jeopardy attaches following a mistrial so as to prevent the retrial of the defendant. 
    I might say parenthetically at this point that this question appears to have been before this Court on seven different occasions and in each of these occasions, the right of the retrial was upheld. 
    In the first such case, the Perez case decided in 1828, we have the classic example of the hung jury and the Court, this Court for the first time held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment did not prevent the Government from retrying a defendant under those circumstances. 
    A later case in 1949 is Wade against Hunter to which I have already referred. 
    This is the court-martial case where one of the members of the Third Army during the war was charged with the rape of a German citizen. 
    The case was fully tried before the court-martial and was submitted on the evidence and it was under consideration by the Court-Martial Board when the Board itself decided they wanted to hear additional evidence, it wanted to hear the testimony of the mother and father of the victim, which may be presumed was for the benefit of the prosecution in that case are operated to the benefit of the prosecution in that case. 
    When it became apparent that the military situation made it somewhat impractical or difficult, certainly not impossible to obtain these testimonies since these witnesses were about 75 miles away from the scene of the court-martial, the Commanding General of the Third Army ordered that the Board be dismissed and the case was again heard by another Court-Martial Board of the Fifteenth Army. 
    That Board convicted and on appeal to this Court following habeas corpus proceedings, this Court reviewed the entire proceeding and held that under those circumstances, the defendant had not been placed in jeopardy so as to prevent his retrial. 
    This Court did not specifically decide whether or not the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment applied to court-martials, but it did decide that even if it -- even if they were applicable, it had not been violated under the circumstances of this case. 
    Now, I submit that any rule of law – that if the rule of law permits a defendant to be tried twice, maybe three times or more after a jury has heard all the evidence in the case for and against him but he's not able to agree on a verdict, it would be a most incongruous result to say that the law prevents under the circumstances of this case the defendant from being tried even once on the -- for the offenses charged in the indictment. 
    Second point I would like to discuss is the fact that no prejudice has been shown in this particular case. 
    There is no claim of prejudice as Mr. Tinsman has pointed out in his argument. 
    There was some suggestion in the petitioner's brief that perhaps the first jury might have been more favorable than the second jury, but that the plea of jeopardy should not depend upon whether or not he can prove that point since he's not susceptible to proof and I agree. 
    He's not susceptible to proof and whether or not one jury would be more favorable than another jury I think is irrelevant. 
    Neither the Government nor the defendant is entitled to a favorable jury, only a jury which is fair and impartial and this record does not suggest in any way that the Gov -- that the jury which tried the defendant was in any way not fair or impartial. 
    Moreover, as was indicated in counsel's argument, neither side in this case apparently took much time in the selection of the jury nor did the composition of the jury seem to be of great importance. 
    So I don't think that we have any element of prejudice whatsoever in this case. 
    The third point I would like to discuss is the culpability of the prosecutor, if any there was, in producing the circumstances which cause the Court in this case to discharge the jury which had been first sworn to try the defendant. 
    On Wednesday or Thursday, a week before these proceedings occurred, the United States Attorney's Office was notified by the Court, 12 cases were going to be called for trial on Monday. 
    At that time the record reveals there were two assistants available to try cases in United States Attorney's Office in San Antonio. 
    The Assistant United States Attorney who did try this case, Mr. McDonald, stated that he had to issue more than 100 subpoenas between the time he received this notice in Monday of the week in which these proceedings occur.

    In any event, this was number 10 of the 12 cases which were set for trial. 
    And Mr. McDonald stated in the colloquy which ensued between the Court and counsel at the time the first jury was discharged, that he had no reason to believe that he was going to come up as it did the following day, Tuesday. 
    On Monday afternoon, on Monday afternoon, Mr. McDonald checked in the marshal's office to determine whether or not the subpoena on this witness had been served. 
    He learned that this -- that this witness who was a traveling salesman was out of town. 
    The witness lived in San Antonio but the marshal's office had contacted his home. 
    They reported that his wife said that she would get in touch with Mr. McDonald. 
    And that was all he did Monday afternoon. 
    On Tuesday morning, he was completing the trial of another case when he was notified that this case was to go to trial. 
    He apparently left from one case, from one courtroom right into another courtroom. 
    He announced he was ready for trial when this case was called. 
    The jury was empanelled and sworn; the Court recessed for lunch. 
    Two o'clock, they came back after lunch and it was at this point the judge announced that he had been advised by Mr. McDonald that the Government's key witness was not available and that he was going to discharge this jury and set the case again for trial later that week and that is what he did.

    I think it's unfair to say that the Government showed any lack of diligence in preparation of -- for this trial in view of the circumstances with which they were faced. 
    Now, the Government was operating under quite some burden in trying to secure that this defendant and to other defendants their constitutional rights to a speedy trial. 
    Now, the fact that the Government when operating under some burdens may create a circumstance such as it occurred in this particular case, doesn't in and of itself obviate the defendant's constitutional rights, but I may -- I maintained that when no harm is shown as a result of what occurred that it's just absurd to say that this defendant cannot be tried once for the offenses charged in the indictment, because a witness wasn't present. 
    This United States Attorney had 100 witnesses to subpoena. 
    On Monday, he didn't know this case was coming to trial on Tuesday. 
    The judge was obviously doing what he could to see that his docket was made current in trying these cases, giving these defendants as they're entitled to under the Constitution of a speedy trial.

    Mr. William A. Geoghegan 
    I don't think we are -- I don't think we are at all. 
    If we view -- if we view the privilege as one that's designed to protect the defendant, to protect him from harassment, unfair practice, oppression, certainly in this instance, when he was tried two days later by another jury, there's not nearly the oppression, the harassment, the expense that occurs when he may have to be tried two and three times, because the juries disagree or it's because in Wade against Hunter, the Court-Martial Board wanted to hear additional evidence from two other witnesses. 
    I think as I said before that it would be a most incongruous result that if we can put a defendant to trial two and three times, and make him go to the expense, and keep him under the suspense that's involved in those situations, it's the most incongruous rule which would say that this defendant under these circumstances -- and I'm stressing the circumstances of this case can't be tried even once where the offenses charged in the indictment. 
    If I may borrow from the [Inaudible] of the tax lawyers, I think such a rule exalts form over substance.

    Now, judge put him; he could have held this jury, he could have held this jury and continue the case for one, two, or three days until this witness was located and was ready to testify or he could do what he did. 
    Now, he decided that this jury could be put to work and the record indicates that they were. 
    So that the other defendants, other people who were in the jail at that particular time could have their constitutional right to a speedy trial observed, and if -- and it's just --

    No, but I think we have far -- there's far greater danger to future defendants in a rule which restricts the discretion of the trial judge than one which maintains that discretion unfettered at least operate in circumstances as were before the Court in this case. 
    I think it works to the benefit of the defendants that the trial judges have wide discretion to declare mistrials when the interest of justice demands.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I guess you would say that the defendant usually had the right to have the decision made when he is present. 
    But something in the preference of proper for the prosecuting defendant to go to see him and tell him that I want to present that to you when we get back. 
    There's quite a difference in that, isn't it, than just the judge coming in and say, “I'll continue the case”?

    Mr. William A. Geoghegan 
    Perhaps there was some irregularity in the way it was done. 
    But surely, the question of whether or not the Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment applies to the second proceeding before the second jury can't turn on the manner in which the judge received notice of the fact that one of the --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Not the way the judge had quite noticed -- but the way that the circumstances I know of which it occurred. 
    The whole action, all the circums -- maybe you're right in that the circumstances don't make it out, but that is certainly a circumstance, isn't it? 
    The defendant usually -- somehow might have a decision whether they're going to be tried, particularly after the jury has been selected. 
    The decision is supposed to be made in open court after the facts are presented for all kind of opportunity to contest.
speaker="william_a_geoghegan" startTime="3494.407" stopTime="3514.931">
    Mr. William A. Geoghegan 
    Well, I will agree that the record indicates that this judge's mind had been made up when he assumed the bench at two o' clock because he's starting off by saying, “I'm going to discharge the jury”. 
    He did permit some further colloquy to -- between the counsel and the Court. 
    I don't think his mind was perhaps irrevocably made up at that particular point.

    I had just been looking at the petitioner's brief on which I was unable to read. 
    I don't find any suggestion in the brief intimation that the way in which this matter was handled by the judge to distinguish whether there was negligence or whatever you choose to call it in the part of the District Attorney and not having the witness present. 
    I don't find any suggestion that there was any impropriety in the way this matter was brought to the attention of the judge.

    Mr. William A. Geoghegan 
    No such claim has ever been made, Mr. Justice Harlan and I frankly can't see the relevance -- the relevancy of all that. 
    It would seem to me that the question merely turns upon whether or not the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion acted fairly in the -- in line with what were the interest of this defendant and the interest of the public in seeing that this man received a fair trial that the -- he should be certainly. 
    I think most people would agree that the Government is entitled to one trial which we haven't had or wouldn't have in this case, had to discharge -- had the discharge in the first jury, had the effect at two o'clock on the afternoon -- on that afternoon of acquitting this defendant, so he walked out of the court a free man. 
    I don't think the Fifth Amendment requires that result.

    Mr. William A. Geoghegan 
    I know. 
    I think that points up the unrealistic position that the petitioner takes before the Court at this particular time. 
    It's obvious that no one in the courtroom at two o'clock that afternoon thought that the discharge of that jury would have the effect of acquitting the defendant right then and there, because the judge announced that he's going to reset the case for trial two days later, the counsel for the defendant wouldn't have urged the Court after the Court announced that he was discharging the jury, he wouldn't have urged the Court to go to trial on those other four counts. 
    And surely the Government's attorney didn't think that such an absurd result would occur but the Government would've done -- the U.S. Attorney would've done what he could to salvage what there was in the indictment could go to trial on the other four counts.

   Rebuttal of Richard Tinsman
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3657.472" stopTime="3659.959">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Tinsman.
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="3659.959" stopTime="3766.422">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    I would briefly like to reply to the Government's contention that there is a danger in future cases if this case is not affirmed. 
    I think if -- I mean if this case in Hunter that the Government's condition -- contention is not sustained. 
    If the Court reverses this case, the only thing it will be saying is that Government prosecutors must ascertain whether not their witnesses are served with the subpoena before they announce ready for trial. 
    And if they announce ready for trial, and then find that their witnesses aren't present as to some count of a multi-count indictment, they cannot secure a discharge of the jury without putting the defendant in jeopardy. 
    And once this case has decided that way, I don't think any government prosecutors will the mistake that Mr. McDonald and the Court made in this particular case. 
    The -- much of the argument was devoted to this excusable nature of what the prosecutor did, but I think it's implicit from the record. 
    The defendant was in the county jail. 
    This was the number 10 case. 
    Obviously, arrangements had to be made to bring the defendant from the county jail. 
    During that time, when the defendant was being brought from the county jail, there's no showing that the prosecutor could not have checked his witnesses. 
    There is a showing in this case that in the colloquy between counsel after the concerning his preparedness that there were a number of secretaries in the office, five secretaries. 
    He could have asked one of the secretaries, go check and see if all the subpoenas were served on the witnesses before I announced ready for trial. 
    The marshal officers right across from the U.S. Attorney's office and in fact he's right down the hall from the courtroom. 
    There was no real --

    No sir, I do not because they had contacted his wife and she had told obviously he was in Big Spring, they've contacted his wife so she was to call him and tell him to come in. 
    So the marshal, instead of calling him himself, simply relied on the wife to call him and tell him to come in and the real point is not whether the subpoena was served, Your Honor. 
    The point is that the prosecutor didn't check and see whether or not it was served before he announced ready.
