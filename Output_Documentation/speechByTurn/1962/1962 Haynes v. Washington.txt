    Mr. Kain.

    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    The petitioner in his opening argument related to the facts, surrendering original detention of the petitioner, Raymond Haynes. 
    I would like to cover some of the facts that occurred after this original surrendering detention. 
    After Mr. Haynes had been taken into the police car and transported to police headquarters --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="39.815" stopTime="42.365">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What time did that happen? 
    What time of the day?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="42.365" stopTime="185.664">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    He was arrested at 9:25. 
    He reached the police headquarters at about 10 p.m. 
    That's indicated at the record -- in the record on page 55. 
    He was there questioned by Lieutenant Wakeley for a period of one-half hour and one-half hour only. 
    That also appears at page 55 of the record. 
    At that time, he confessed in detail to the robbery of this service station in conjunction with the help of his brother. 
    When Lieutenant Wakeley testified, he was not asked the question: Did Raymond Haynes asked you if he could call a lawyer or asked you to call a lawyer for him. 
    Lieutenant Wakeley was never asked this question.The questions in this regard were asked at page 56 of the record. 
    After the petitioner orally confessed to Lieutenant Wakeley, the lieutenant testified that he may have asked to call his wife, and the lieutenant told to petitioner Haynes that his wife would be called. 
    The petitioner in his testimony did not testify that he had ever asked Lieutenant Wakeley to call a lawyer. 
    The lieutenant testified at the trial and he stated in detail what Mr. Raymond Haynes had told him with respect to his oral confession. 
    No objection of any kind was offered by the defense to the lieutenant's narration of this oral confession. 
    The lieutenant finished with the petitioner, Raymond Haynes. 
    In other words, he finished talking to him at 10:30 p.m. on the evening of his arrest. 
    That's found in the record at page 55. 
    The petitioner was placed in a lineup for about 15 or 20 minutes according to his own account. 
    That appears at page 98 of the record. 
    He was then taken to the city jail, not the county jail. 
    The city jail is in the same building with the detective headquarters. 
    This appears in the record at page 98. 
    The petitioner himself indicates that he was taken to the city jail. 
    The petitioner himself testified that nothing else was done that night. 
    That's found at page 98 of the record. 
    This puts aside any question as to whether or not there was any nighttime questioning.

    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Page 98 of the record. 
    The petitioner testified that nothing else was done that night. 
    The time as near as we can determine from the record that he was placed in the city jail was about 11 p.m. to 12 midnight. 
    There's no real way of telling what time it was. 
    There's no indication of any deprivation of adequate food or adequate sleep. 
    Now, the petitioner testified that Detective Pike who worked at 4 p.m. to midnight shift on this evening, made promises to him, and that he asked Detective Pike for an attorney. 
    The record shows, however, that Detective Pike never talked to the petitioner that he was in the same room with him; that he dealt with the petitioner's brother Keith Haynes but that he had no dealings with Raymond Haynes other than to place him in the lineup.

    Yes, nothing was said, Your Honor, with respect to the delivering of messages or anything of that nature. 
    And in this case, of course, the lieutenant told the petitioner that he would inform his wife that he was being held. 
    I can contend that this is a means of communication, both of these.

    (Inaudible)

    Mr. George A. Kain 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    The -- the next morning, the morning after the petitioner's arrest at 9 a.m., the petitioner was fingerprinted. 
    At 9:30 a.m., Detectives Cockburn and -- not Detective Pike but Detectives Cockburn and Peck first talked to the petitioner. 
    They interrogated him for one and one-half to two hours according to their version indicating they started at 9:30. 
    This is found in the record at page 67. 
    Actually, they interrogated Petitioner Haynes for one and one-half hours because a stenographer testified that she completed the dictation of the written confession, Exhibit 6, at 11 a.m., one and one-half hours after the two detectives first spoke with Petitioner Haynes. 
    During this one and one-half hour period, the Petitioner Haynes made an oral confession to Detectives Peck and Cockburn. 
    The oral confession was a detailed one. 
    Detective Cockburn testified in detail at the trial as to the contents of this oral confession and there was no objection of any kind to his testimony. 
    According to the petitioner's version, he was questioned one hour or longer by these two detectives; that's found at page 99 of the record. 
    The petitioner in this written confession made no request to call --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was there any -- excuse me for interrupting you. 
    But the -- was there anything in the record as to whether during that conversation that you just related, he asked to see either his wife or an attorney or to communicate with them?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="455.069" stopTime="481.121">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Yes, Your Honor, there is. 
    The petitioner testified that he asked these two detectives for permission to call his wife, not an attorney, but his intention was to call his wife. 
    He testified that they promised him this telephone call if he would confess. 
    I contend that the record is conflicting because of his own later statements and because of statements of Detective Cockburn who testified.

    What did he say?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="494.008" stopTime="501.531">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    I might first state, Your Honor, that the petitioner in his confession made no request for an attorney, nor did he request --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="501.531" stopTime="504.649">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean the confession is testified too by the officers.
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="504.649" stopTime="544.003">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    In the written confession, Your Honor, made no request. 
    He did request to call the prose -- to see the prosecuting attorney. 
    He made no other request to that of any nature. 
    As I indicated, he attributed promises and denials of communication to Detectives Peck and Cockburn. 
    However, when he was asked a few moments later, the determination of this written confession, he was asked this question: “Did we --” meaning Detectives Peck and Cockburn, “-- make any promises or threats to you?” 
    And he replied, “No.” 
    Now, this was in direct and absolute conflict with his testimony at the trial. 
    He was then asked --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="544.003" stopTime="557.730">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Pardon me but, I thought at the end of the written confession, the questions and answers, there was a statement by him that he had to -- they had promised that they would call his wife.

    Yes.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, that doesn't -- I just didn't quite understand it, how you reconcile with that?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="565.150" stopTime="606.735">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Well, Detectives Peck and Cockburn said to him, “Did we make any threats or promises?” 
    The petitioner replied, “No.” 
    The detectives then asked, “Has any police officer made you any threats or promises?” 
    And the petitioner, in response to that question, even though he did in his testimony, he attributed promises to various officers, in response to that question, he said only one thing, “No, except the lieutenant promised me that when I was booked and not when I confessed, that the lieutenant promised me when I was booked, I could call my wife.” 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="606.735" stopTime="611.234">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, the officers have already testified that he wouldn't be booked until he did make a statement.
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="611.234" stopTime="614.909">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    No, that is not correct, Your Honor. 
    They never testified to that. 
    There's -- there can --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="614.909" stopTime="617.429">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What did they testify to in that regard?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="617.429" stopTime="637.777">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    They testified, Your Honor, that in this only that he could not call until he had been booked. 
    The officers never admitted and it is our contention that it does not occur that he was ever told that he could call his wife only when he had confessed or cooperated. 
    That was contended but that is not our position and no --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="637.777" stopTime="642.647">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was that categorically denied by the officers?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="642.647" stopTime="753.582">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    The officer who testified Detective Cockburn was asked, I believe, first of all, whether or not, the Petitioner Haynes had asked to call his wife and I believe Detective Cockburn indicated that he could recall no request of this nature. 
    He did not category -- categorically and unconditionally deny this. 
    He was asked whether or not, he promised the Petitioner Haynes the right to call if he confessed or cooperated, I believe. 
    He did not categorically deny this but he did say, “I don't recall”, or “I don't remember”, or “I don't recall any such request.” 
    Now, that doesn't mean, Your Honor, that a request was made. 
    It means that in this officer's recollection, he recalled no such request by the petitioner. 
    And my contention is this: the petitioner himself said there were no promises in his written confession which he signed. 
    Then two or three hours after he dictated this confession, he was asked to read this confession over and make corrections if there were any mistakes. 
    He read this confession. 
    He did make corrections, but he did not make any corrections with respect to whether he had been made any promises, indicating at that time that the only promise he had been made since his arrest was the promise that he could call his wife when he had been booked. 
    And I submit that this promise call for nothing from this petitioner. 
    It depended upon his being booked, in other words, that arbitrary point which the officers wrote his name in another section of the log in the jail charging him with a specific crime.

    Your Honor, possibly a -- I didn't -- I didn't make myself clear.

    But if it was induced by promises or hope of reward, then they could use it against him.

    Mr. George A. Kain 
    I believe at that time, Your Honor, they were permitted to consider the statement and the effect that the inducements -- excuse me, may have had with respect to voluntariness, and I believe the next paragraph of that instruction holds that if the jury found that the inducements were sufficient to overcome voluntariness, then they were not to consider that confession.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1186.661" stopTime="1200.934">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    A different distinction being if -- they could consider their confession even though it's induced by promises, but they could not sustain a conviction unless there was corroborating testimony about it.

    Well, as I read the fourth paragraph Your Honor, they were permitted. 
    The jury were permitted to consider the statement and the inducements. 
    However, setting aside the question of corroboration, the jury was to decide whether or not these inducements were sufficient to overcome the will of the accused.

    (Inaudible) to get you to cooperate?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="1284.717" stopTime="1429.739">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Oh yes, what I -- what I meant to say, Your Honor was that they were to consider inducements if they existed and consider whether or not the inducements were sufficient to overcome the will of the accused. 
    The question, the prime question before the jury was, is this confession voluntary? 
    The trial court under the Washington practice at that time had only this authority if the State conceded that the confession was involuntary or the admitted facts show that the confessional was involuntary. 
    The trial court could withhold it from the jury.Other than that, the jury decided the question of voluntariness just as they decided the question of guilt or innocence. 
    The petitioner when he testified with regard to the post-confession procedure made this conclusion in answer to a question that he was not allowed to call his -- to call his wife. 
    He indicated that he had no purpose to call an attorney and merely said to call his wife. 
    There was no testimony of any request that he actually made to anyone to call other than the request to the lieutenant and the conflicting request made to the conflicting evidence as to request made to other police officers. 
    There were no jailers produced at the trial to indicate that they had received request and refused them. 
    The petitioner's wife testified. 
    She indicated that -- she went to the city jail the day following the petitioner's arrest and she asked merely this question, or she called the city jail by telephone. 
    She asked this question. 
    “Is Raymond Haynes in jail?” 
    And she was told, “Yes, he is.” 
    She then asked why and she identified herself and said that she was Mrs. Haynes. 
    The police at that point refused to give her further information. 
    Of course, this was a telephone call. 
    They had no way of knowing that this was Mrs. Haynes or merely a curious neighbor. 
    And they said if you want to know why he's in jail, read it in the papers. 
    She did not --

    Yes.

    -- did they?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="1432.948" stopTime="1488.030">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    She did not ask to see Mr. Raymond Haynes. 
    She did not ask to call him by telephone. 
    She made no request at that time other than why he is in jail -- why he was in jail. 
    And this is found at page 131 of the record. 
    Now, the following day, she again went to the city jail and she asked about Raymond Haynes' automobile. 
    She talked to Detective Cockburn. 
    She did not ask to visit him at that time. 
    Now, bear in mind that this is after the confession, after the booking so that the rule did not prevent her seeing the petitioner. 
    She could have seen him had she sought too, because there was no so-called small book rule once he had been booked. 
    She went to the jail personally after he had been booked but she did not ask to see him, she did not ask to telephone him, she did not ask that a message be delivered to him. 
    She only asked about the family car.

    -- as you say. 
    Although as I indicated, the rule did not prevent communication once the man had been booked, the rule, it was enforced at that time. 
    And the petitioner's wife testified that she first saw the petitioner one week after his surrender. 
    That's on 131. 
    She didn't testify that she'd ever tried to see him before that. 
    She merely said she first saw him at that time. 
    And the rule would not have prevented her seeing him, nor would the rule have prevented the petitioner's calling out. 
    The rule applied to those held by the police charged with merely investigation for a crime and not booked for a specific crime.

    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Well, Your Honor I'll have to admit this case without the confessions was rather unusual. 
    There were two eye witnesses.

    Yes. 
    Yes, he did. 
    And he identified the accused and his brother as being those two persons who had committed a robbery upon himself at his service station. 
    Of course, these three oral confessions, the confession to the uniformed officers, the confession to Lieutenant Wakeley, and the confession to Detectives Cockburn and Peck were also in evidence.

    Well, Your Honor, each party of course had the duty to designate those portions of the record to be prepared for this Court and in view with the cause involved, I felt that I -- if I set forth a portion of the testimony of the actual victim, the owner of the service station, that would indicate that there was at least one eye witness. 
    I then went to the portion of the record which covered the wife and I could find no small number of pages that encompass this identification that I could pick out and put in the record so I left at it indicating that the owner himself had identified the accused.

    Since that -- since you've stated -- said that, you have said that they did positively identified him.
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="1800.127" stopTime="1955.376">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Well, the record indicates the identification of the husband, the owner of the service station. 
    And my recollection is that his wife was not as sure in her identification as he was. 
    That's all I can say, Your Honor. 
    If the Court please, under a consideration of all of these circumstances, it made the following observations to be compared possibly with other cases although that is not critical or decisive. 
    The petitioner here was an adult. 
    He was a person of average intelligence according to his testimony at the trial. 
    He was a skilled workman. 
    He was a sheet metal worker. 
    He'd been convicted of five serious crimes including robbery, theft of a car, breaking and entering, jailbreak, resisting arrest. 
    He was on parole at the time he came to the State of Washington and he was pretty familiar with the law enforcement procedures. 
    In other words, he -- as our -- the Supreme Court of the State of Washington held he was not a lamb. 
    He was told only that he could call his wife when he was booked on a specific charge. 
    He was never told according to the undisputed evidence that he could call his wife only when he confessed. 
    He made two oral confessions after his surrender and initial confession. 
    He was detained for about 14 hours without being permitted communication prior to signing -- excuse me, 14 hours prior to the dictating the written confession. 
    And he was detained 16 hours prior to his signing this written confession. 
    He was giving -- given a hearing as I indicated before a committing magistrate within 17 to 19 hours after his arrest and the day following his arrest when the courts were not in session on the day of his arrest. 
    And this is kind of unusual. 
    It's contrary to the majority of the confession cases, at no time did this petitioner denied his guilt to the police. 
    From the very moment of his arrest, he did not deny his guilt; he confessed. 
    He was interrogated for a total time of one hour and 15 minutes according to one account, the maximum time that he could have been interrogated by all persons concerned was two hours and 20 minutes. 
    During this time, during this two hours and 20 minutes maximum, he made four separate confessions; three of them oral and one of them written.

    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Well Your Honor, confessed, when I use that term, I didn't mean a confession in detail. 
    He said he was the one they were after. 
    He got in the car and said he'd robbed the service station. 
    He then pointed out the service station he had robbed. 
    In other words, to my way of thinking, that's a complete admission of his guilt unless a confession brief as it may be.

    I don't believe he'd been booked at that time, Your Honor.

    They're placed on this book when they‘re -- all it is, is a jail log. 
    And their names are placed in this jail log when they're taken to the jail.

    What is the purpose of the small book?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="2121.527" stopTime="2159.381">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Well, Your Honor the -- the small book, other than the infamous name it's acquired recently, the small book is just a log, as I indicated, in the jail, and the booking procedure required that a man who is booked on a specific charge would be put in what I would imagine they must have called the large book. 
    And if no specific charge had been brought against the man, in other words, if he had until that point at which a warrant and a complaint had been filed, he could be held only on the small book.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2159.381" stopTime="2189.591">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean that if the police arrest a man a few moments after a robbery and he is identified by the people whom he robbed and he confesses to the robbery, that he -- he isn't arrested, in the normal sense of the word and -- and then subject to all of equal processes that are either available to or against him as an arrested man.
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="2189.591" stopTime="2196.931">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Well, Your Honor, I must admit that the practice in Spokane, Washington at that time until this day is this. 
    That --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    To this day exists, you say?

    Mr. George A. Kain 
    No, no, not this small book rule, Your Honor. 
    People now are permitted to use the telephone, permitted communication with friends and attorneys. 
    This small book rule didn't last for any period of time. 
    But the practice, they does continue in the City of Spokane is this. 
    That when a man is arrested even though the question of his guilt is obvious, he is not taken before a committing magistrate until legal process had be filed in the Court, because the purpose of the judge is twofold. 
    First, to advice the man as to his constitutional rights, secondly, to set bond, he cannot set bond until he's been fully apprised to the facts surrounding the offense and he sets bond by looking at the allegations and the warrant questioning the officer and then deciding what the bond shall be. 
    So the practice is that within a reasonable time after an arrest, the complaint warrant are tied up, presented to the judge for signing, and at that point, that the man is given a hearing.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2266.276" stopTime="2277.547">

speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="2277.547" stopTime="2307.146">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Well, Your Honor, I can say this. 
    If the -- if this had occurred during the ordinary business hours, he would have been taken immediately to the prosecutor's office on the basis of what he had said, a complaint and warrant would have been typed up because it was obvious that this man had -- a crime had occurred and this man had committed it. 
    This would have been presented to the judge and then he would have been given an appearance at that time, because the judge would have had something to deal with.

    Mr. George A. Kain 
    The brother was convicted and received probation, yes. 
    If I could complete this summary, Your Honor, the -- there were no false inducements to confess in this case. 
    There was no indication of lack of adequate food and rest. 
    There was no nighttime questioning unless we consider nighttime from 11:00 to midnight. 
    There was no physical violence. 
    He was questioned by only four officers, I submit, in contrast to the petitioner's briefs. 
    He was confe -- questioned by officer -- five officers. 
    Officer Usher, the uniformed officer, Lieutenant Wakeley, Detectives Peck, Cockburn, and Detective Pike. 
    In this case, no person, relative, friend, or attorney actually sought to visit with petitioners and was turned away. 
    The testimony undisputed is that if an attorney went to the jail to see him, he would have been admitted. 
    The petitioner's wife knew of his incarceration at least the next day, the next morning and could have seen fit to her an attorney who would have been admitted in the jail even under the rule excluding friends.

    (Inaudible) Err, excuse me, “Is my husband Raymond in jail?” 
    You can take that either way that she'd been told and was verifying it or that she had not been told and was there asking for him because possibly he hadn't come home.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I thought the lieutenant testified that he could not, am I -- you know the record better than I do. 
    If he didn't -- if he didn't say that why -- we got it -- those -- the rest of your argument but I thought the lieutenant said that -- I think the -- one of these questions asked of Lieutenant Wakeley, “When was he booked? 
    “He wasn't booked. 
    He was booked for investigation. 
    That is an open charge after the people picked him out of the lineup.” 
    “This book for investigation is what you call a small book down there.” 
    Answer: “That is right.” 
    Question: “And when a person is booked for investigation, are they allowed to make any telephone calls, whatsoever?” 
    Answer: “No.” 
    “Are they allowed to have any contact with the outside world?” 
    Answer: “No, we don't allow them to use the phone to call out, if some relative wants to contact the lawyer that is their privilege.” 
    Question: “That is assuming the relative knew that the party was in custody.” 
    “That is right.”

    That a lawyer could see an accused even though he was on the small book if he knew he was in jail. 
    I feel that the answer of Lieutenant Wakeley if somewhere he wants to contact -- if some relative wants to contact a lawyer, that's their privilege. 
    There wouldn't be much sense in making that statement.I contend if the lawyer couldn't do his job once he'd been contacted. 
    And Lieutenant Cock -- or Detective Cockburn testified that a lawyer could, under that rule, visit with an accused booked on the so-called small book or held for investigation only.

speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2724.276" stopTime="2736.806">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Well, I see it. 
    I do know what the -- attorney does come to see an individual being held, that is a driving privilege.
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="2736.806" stopTime="3038.438">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    I -- I've compared the facts in this case even though at first blush they seem extremely vicious with two cases that were decided by this Court solely on the basis of age and I'd like briefly to refer to the facts in those two cases. 
    I know that each case determines -- rest upon its own facts but I feel that there is such a divergence in the facts between these cases that they're worthy of mention. 
    The first is Haley versus Ohio, 332 U.S. 596. 
    In that case, the petitioner was 15 years old contrasted to Mr. Haynes' age of 25 to 30. 
    He was questioned for five hours and this questioning didn't start until midnight. 
    The five or six policemen questioned him in relays. 
    He denied implication in the crime until he was shown alleged confessions of coconspirators. 
    On the other hand, Petitioner Haynes admitted from the very inception that he was the guilty party. 
    The petition -- Mr. Haley, the young man, was told that his confession was voluntary and he was told that no promises have been made. 
    He was not asked this question as was petitioner, Mr. Haynes. 
    A lawyer in the Haley case actually tried to see this young boy twice and was turned away. 
    We don't have that situation in the Haynes' case. 
    His mother wasn't permitted to see him for five days. 
    He had no court appearance for three days after the confession was signed. 
    And there was some evidence of physical abuse in that case without citing the law that this Court set forth had held that this case depended basically upon the tender years of the petitioner. 
    And this Court held that what transpired would make -- make this pass for careful inquiry if a mature man were involved. 
    It then went on the hold because this was a mere child. 
    The record should be very carefully scrutinized. 
    Referring to the nighttime interrogation from midnight to 5 a.m. by relays by police officers, the Court held in part, we cannot believe that a lad of tender years is a match for the police in such a contest. 
    In Gallegos versus Colorado, a recent case cited by this Court, the petitioner was only 14 years of age. 
    His formal confession was signed five days after his arrest. 
    He'd been held incommunicado all of this time. 
    His mother actually sought to see him. 
    She actually went to see him and was refused. 
    This Court, citing the Haley case, held that the fact that the petitioner was only 14 years of age, puts this case on the same footing as Haley versus Ohio. 
    They held in part, we deal with the person who is not equal to the police in knowledge and understanding. 
    In that language, in those two cases, I feel is the -- the crux of the situation here because I submit that the petitioner, Raymond Haynes, was very equal to the police in knowledge and understanding. 
    In the Gallegos -- the case of Gallegos versus Colorado, this Court held that the young man, 14 years of age, cannot be compared with an adult in full position of his senses and knowledgeable of the consequences of his admissions. 
    And therefore, even though Mr. Gallegos confessed immediately upon his arrest, they held it because he didn't know what his constitutional rights were, that this immediate confession shouldn't be considered. 
    But in this case, Mr. Haynes, I submit, had the adequate edu -- as adequate an education as Mr.Crooker did in the case of Crooker versus California. 
    Mr. Crooker had a college education and some law school training. 
    I asked you to consider the conduct of a law -- a freshman in law school when detained by the police and then consider a man in the position of Mr. Haynes when detained. 
    A man who had been convicted of, I believe, six crimes, five of them serious crimes, three of them appeared to be felonies, one of them was armed robbery, the facts indicated in this case, he had committed another armed robbery. 
    He'd been on parole, I think, the record said for some two years is that -- is as indicated in the decision of the Washington State Supreme Court with no disrespect, they held this man was not a lamb. 
    I feel that under the facts, he was as adequately equipped to deal with the police as Mr. Crooker was in the case of Crooker versus California.

    Mr. George A. Kain 
    Well, Your Honor, there is nothing in the printed record indicating that any exceptions were taken by the defense.

    Mr. George A. Kain

    Sometimes they are transcribed if it's an important case where a counsel requests that they'd be transcribed in cases which are a matter of course. 
    I can't say in this case. 
    Continuing, Your Honor, I -- I submit that the liberal consideration given to the petitioners in Haley and in Gallegos versus Colorado not be given to this petitioner because the facts, they were not on the same footing. 
    The facts here are basically boiled down to this. 
    What -- I suppose some people would call a hardened criminal was told that you can't call your wife, not an attorney, but you can't call your wife until you've been booked. 
    I was only held 17 to 19 hours before an appearance and he signed a written confession after 16 hours.

    Did he also say -- first call -- ask for an attorney?Asked if he could phone an attorney?I thought he first asked -- said he asked for -- in contact with an attorney and then later he just asked for his wife and he testified that after awhile he thought it over and concluded that he didn't want his wife perhaps to get a lawyer or him get another one and then have two lawyers settled on him.
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="3193.080" stopTime="3202.881">
    Mr. George A. Kain

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You joined issue with the statement of a dissent on page 150, do you not? 
    Had the Court said that -- the judge said that the appellant was allowed to communicate with anyone not -- were not allowed to communicate with anyone outside despite his repeated request to do so. 
    And the appellant's wife had telephoned at city jail where he was incarcerated to refuse any information at that time except the fact that he was being held. 
    The following day, decided it, she called at the jail in the futile attempt to see him not successful until Thursday, December 26, one full week after the arrest. 
    Do you think the record does not bear that out?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="3254.427" stopTime="3320.346">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    That -- my contention is, Your Honor, that their facts were actually disputed. 
    The judges of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington didn't really differ on the law to any great extent, they differed on the facts. 
    Half of them or five of them took one version and four of them took the other version. 
    The judge who wrote this portion of the dissent took a version which, in effect, favored the petitioner, Haynes. 
    My contention is that the facts were in dispute on every material issue except those, of course that have been conceded before this Court, that the trial court and the jury decided those facts against Haynes, and of course, he was an impeached witness. 
    They apparently didn't believe what he had to say and they decided those facts against him.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3320.346" stopTime="3331.586">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you also join the issue with the statement that during the time he was being held, he begged for the opportunity of talking to the prosecutor?
speaker="george_a_kain" startTime="3331.586" stopTime="3589.648">
    Mr. George A. Kain 
    I concede that when the written confession was dictated, he did ask -- I don't say that he begged but I say that he asked to see the prosecutor, for what reason I cannot say. 
    The petitioners have assumed the reason, I'm not -- I can't say why he made that request. 
    To touch briefly upon what has been charged in the petitioner's supplemental brief as an unlawful arrest in the consequent, illegal seizure of oral declarations from the accused, I briefly state that our position is this. 
    That first of all, this attack was raised for the first time not in the trial court, not in the State Supreme Court, not in the petition for certiorari, not in the petitioner's brief on the merits, but for the first time by the petitioner's supplemental brief filed before this Court. 
    There were no objections or motions made before the trial court on this matter. 
    The Supreme Court of the State of Washington was not permitted to consider it, whether or not the arrest was unlawful, whether the admissions were illegally seized under the authority cited in the respondent's reply brief. 
    I submit that that matter is not here for consideration at this time. 
    Assuming that an objection was made, it was not properly preserved according to the state practice which requires assignments of error in the briefs and actual argument in the brief on the point alleged to be error under authority of Beck versus Washington, 369 U.S. 541. 
    I submit that an illegal arrest and search and seizure of oral declarations is not an enlargement of an argument made in the state court system that was discussed in the case of Wilson versus Crooker. 
    Now assuming, just for the purpose of argument, that the error had been preserved the facts conclusively show that the arrest was lawful. 
    There was a description of the guilty party. 
    A policeman testified that the petitioner was stopped but he didn't quite fit the description. 
    The petitioner himself says that when they stopped him, they asked him about another man, “Did you see somebody go by?” 
    Or words to that effect. 
    He was released. 
    At that point he was released. 
    He walked up the sidewalk of a house. 
    The policeman waited, he returned, got back in the car. 
    The policeman was still seated in the patrol car apparently for time he walked up. 
    He surrendered. 
    He said, “You've got me, let's go.” 
    When he talked to Lieutenant Wakeley, Lieutenant Wakeley testified that he said, he might as well give up. 
    So he told them he was the man they were looking for. 
    That's what Petitioner Haynes told Lieutenant Wakeley about the surrender. 
    And in his written confession, he said, “I gave up the ghost.” 
    The meaning of that is pretty obvious. 
    “I gave up the ghost”, and told him, “I might as well ride downtown with him.” 
    The petitioner seeks to apply the doctrine of Wong Sun versus the United States to this situation. 
    I feel that the facts are a great deal different in Wong Sun where doors were broken down on partial information regarding assumed possession of contraband or narcotics. 
    In this particular case, we have to assume that the arrest was illegal. 
    I submit that the arrest was not illegal but the petitioner surrendered. 
    When he surrendered and at that moment, he was arrested not before because he was merely questioned. 
    He says, the petitioner himself says he was questioned as to whether somebody else might have gone by or run by or been in the area. 
    So when he was questioned at that moment or when he admitted at that moment that he gave up, he then was taken into custody. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Lawrence Speiser
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="3591.935" stopTime="3752.459">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    We have in this case a number of factors that the Court has considered in the past in other cases. 
    The difficulty with applying a subjective rule to determine whether there was a voluntary confession or a coerced confession is highlighted by this case just in the fact that the two brothers, one of whom had no criminal experience before and was belligerent as testified by the police officer refused to confess at first. 
    And this man who had had a prior criminal experience at some length, confessed initially and then confessed before his brother. 
    Therefore, I think the subjective rule or the subjective factor is not a good basis in which to determine the inadmissibility of a confession. 
    By looking at the objective facts as to what the police did and whether their methods were impermissible under the standards of a civilized society, I think will give a standard here, a more exact standard, in determining the admissibility of the confession. 
    Here, the police did hold the man incommunicado and they did it for a purpose. 
    And the purpose was to nail the case down. 
    And they continued to attempt to nail the case down not only after getting the signed confession in the interrogation room of the police department but there was also subsequent attempt to get succeeding confessions signed before the prosecutor. 
    The police admit they have this practice. 
    I think that -- to suggest that the man could have made phone calls before he was placed on small book would -- is totally unrealistic. 
    I think the small book is merely an expression of police department policy but as far as police department practice is concerned, it's fairly evident that this man could not have made a phone call out anytime until he was booked. 
    Now, it's been suggested that at first, that he could -- that they were awaiting to present this to the prosecutor. 
    However, it's to be noted that he wasn't brought before a magistrate until four o'clock in the afternoon.

speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="3759.436" stopTime="3827.274">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    Yes, and this appears in the written confession itself. 
    There are some things we don't know about what was said in the interrogation by this man by the police officer since there was no secretary present and this was not taken down, but in the written confession itself, there was a request by him to see the prosecutor. 
    Now, Spokane is like most that is I assumed that the magistrate was available at ten o'clock or nine o'clock in the morning, the following morning after his arrest. 
    Nevertheless, he was not brought before a magistrate at that time when he could have been informed of his rights. 
    He could have at that point, attempted to contact an attorney perhaps although we can't tell for sure from this record whether this was possible simply because of the fact that he wasn't able to -- as he can testify to contact an attorney for or to contact his wife to contact an attorney for several days after the confession.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Would you state Mr. Speiser what your (Inaudible)
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="3840.838" stopTime="4010.771">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    Well, I think it can be done in several fashions, Mr. Justice Goldberg. 
    It can be done in the way the Court has looked at the cases in the past in looking at a totality of circumstances and seeing whether the totality adds up to some impermissible method. 
    This would involve looking at the factors of the incommunicado detention. 
    It would look at the factors of not bringing before a magistrate. 
    It would look at the factor of not advising the individual of his constitutional rights. 
    It would look at the factor of whether he had counsel to advice him, if he requests a counsel at any time before signing a confession. 
    I also urge the Court that it could be done on anyone of these factors. 
    There was a statement in the case of Ward versus Texas which indicates this but as yet the Court has not made any ruling on that one score. 
    And the cases that have come up to the Court in which the particular emphasis has been on the -- that facet of the Due Process Clause involving the right to counsel in Cicenia versus Lagay and Crooker versus California. 
    The Court has not been -- was not willing to rely on that one factor alone which was the only factor that raised this constitutional issue before the Court. 
    But those cases, perhaps, can be distinguishable although in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart yesterday, I urge that they'd be overruled. 
    They can be distinguished, I believe, on the grounds that in both cases, in Crooker, there was evident in the record that he had been advised of his right to refuse to answer questions and that the statements would be used against him. 
    Also, there was that very unique circumstance that he had attended law school and presumably therefore knew what his rights were. 
    In Cicenia, there was a similar awareness of rights and there was a contact with an attorney, with an assumption that an attorney had, in fact, consulted with him prior to his surrender at the police station. 
    Now, in both of those cases, it seem to me that one of these facets that I've mentioned has had been satisfied as far as the courts are concerned. 
    And I suggest that this is a distinction in -- as far as those two cases are concerned. 
    There's nothing in the record here to indicate that this man had an opportunity to consult with an attorney, to talk with an attorney before he confessed.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Now, what you're saying is exactly (Inaudible) the instruction to be given by a court or magistrate (Inaudible)
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="4046.649" stopTime="4068.836">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    I -- I agree.Unfortunately, there was no objection to this instruction, as far I could tell from the lower court record, however, I'd like to point out in the case of Terminiello versus Chicago, the Court decided that case based on a faulty instruction that was not objected to in the trial court, was not considered in the state courts before it reached this Court.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4068.836" stopTime="4108.787">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well then, the instruction didn't stop there. 
    The Court went on to say, “If you find from the evidence in this case that any officer having custody of either defendant in this case denied him communication with his friends or an attorney in violation of the above statute, then I instruct that you may consider such denial in connection with the voluntariness of any statement made.” 
    Now, that instruction certainly conforms to the law up to date in this Court.
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="4108.787" stopTime="4123.941">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    And I -- and I am suggesting that the -- that position I have taken in response to Mr. Justice Goldberg's question is slightly different. 
    I --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4123.941" stopTime="4134.515">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You're asking us to substitute at least in some facets a courtesy test on voluntariness rather than the test that up to now has prevailed.
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="4134.515" stopTime="4153.207">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    I would even suggest eliminating the word “voluntary” as a needlessly confusing term to define to determine whether confessions should be admitted which have been obtained by impermissible methods in line with civilized society standards.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4153.207" stopTime="4170.563">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    In other words, to put it in another way what you'd like to see is the prophylactic rule that is applied in the federal courts under our supervisory powers as represented in one facet by the Mallory rule, you'd like to see something of that kind extend to the States.
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="4170.563" stopTime="4191.245">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    Yes. 
    Obviously the prophylaxis of the -- of the exclusionary principle is something I'm urging before the State. 
    It has been adopted by Mapp versus Ohio in applying as far as one facet of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause illegally -- unreasonably search and seizure evidence --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, that wasn't based on the idea, was it, that if you -- that we had to sit and determine whether or not the conduct opposed -- violated civilized standards.
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="4206.825" stopTime="4257.220">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    No, there are -- there were -- there are several factors, it seems to me, in the adoption of the exclusionary rule which have been -- were referred to in Mapp versus Ohio and in other cases in which they come up. 
    There has -- it has been suggested, it has a deterrent effect on the police and this has been mentioned in determining whether the exclusionary rule had a constitutional basis. 
    But in addition to that, there was the factor of whether the courts are going to become part of governmental lawlessness that the integrity of the judicial procedure was at stake and for this Court to uphold the utilization in a trial of evidence obtained by unconstitutional methods --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4257.220" stopTime="4258.493">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That is quite different.
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="4258.493" stopTime="4280.811">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    Yes. 
    I -- I'm suggesting that these two reasons have been both been stressed and I recognized that some justices prefer one reason rather than the other but they have -- are both apparently appear -- appeared in the cases that have discussed the reason for the exclusionary rule.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4280.811" stopTime="4298.362">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Of course, if we would hold as a general rule as we could upset any state law, any state action at anytime on our basis of whether or not it violated civilized standards, there would be some question about the lawlessness or the lawfulness of our conduct, would there not?
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="4298.362" stopTime="4308.343">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    Yes.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4308.343" stopTime="4321.339">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I'm not talking about judicial restraint. 
    I'm talking about interpretation whether you -- interpreting the Constitution according to this language or introducing a new factor rather what the Court thinks it violates civilized standards.
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="4321.339" stopTime="4336.280">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    Well, the definiteness of that has been subject to too much criticism and an easy answer then would be the civilized standards or whether there's been a violation of the Constitution in some fashion --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4336.280" stopTime="4338.877">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That would -- suits to be better.
speaker="lawrence_speiser" startTime="4338.877" stopTime="4513.141">
    Mr. Lawrence Speiser 
    I'm always willing to try to suit you, Justice Black. 
    The exclusionary rule has had a benefit on police lawlessness. 
    There -- were refusing cries about the Mallory-McNabb rule and I realized that that was based on the supervisorial capacity of the Court over the -- over the federal courts. 
    But in spite of the cries that the adoption of McNabb-Mallory rule would prevent efficient law enforcement, efficient law enforcement has gone on within the District of Columbia. 
    Oliver Gasch who was formally the U.S. Attorney here indicated that that was only an issue in approximately 5% of the cases and it has had some effect on the police practices here to the extent that arrests for investigation are to be ended here in the District of Columbia after a thorough study by indicating that they were unconstitutional. 
    The effect of Mapp versus Ohio is completely still too early to say, however, the benefit of experience in the States that have the exclusionary rule indicated that it had a beneficial effect. 
    But we have had, in the courts since 1936, a series of so-called coerced confession cases in which they have been earmarked by arrest on suspicion, incommunicado interrogation which involves refusal to permit contact with friends and relatives, no informing of rights to silence in the counsel, delay in bringing before magistrates and a denial of bail and a denial of writ of habeas corpus during that interim period. 
    The governments and the states have in effect become lawbreakers and there's a very intimate relationship between the willingness of the people to observe laws and their cynicism which will develop if they feel that the Government itself is a lawbreaker. 
    Justice Brandeis in his dissenting opinion in Olmstead, it seems to me, made the most eloquent statement as to the value of this. 
    To declare that in the administration of the criminal law, the end justifies the means. 
    To declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal would bring terrible retribution. 
    Against that pernicious doctrine, this Court should resolutely set its base.
