Avent v. North Carolina

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    From the calendar, John Thomas Avent, et al., Petitioners, versus North Carolina. 
    Mr. Greenberg.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="13.515" stopTime="77.841">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Carolina and presents principally a well-defined and circumscribed issue and that is whether in the particular legal and factual context of these sit-in demonstrations the arrest, conviction and sentence to prison of students, or the petitioners here, denied to them equal protection of the law secured by the Fourteenth Amendment and whether these judgments of conviction should be reversed. 
    At the outset, before stating the facts and elaborating their legal argument, petitioners would like briefly to outline the principle elements of this case which as we stated circumscribe and define the issues here and those elements are that in this case we have first of all state action in the form of an arrest, trial, conviction and unless these convictions are reversed an actual sentence to prison.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What was the sentence?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="79.450" stopTime="125.506">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Three of the petitioners got 30 days, two of them got 20 days and one of them received 15 days. 
    And two of them, the young ladies involved, the prayer for judgment was suspended. 
    Secondly, this state action enforced racial discrimination. 
    Thirdly, in this case, there has been conceded by the State to exist in North Carolina a statewide custom of racial segregation and we submit this custom has been fostered and infused by a complex network of state segregation laws, including an ordinance of the City of Durham requiring racial segregation in restaurant facilities.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="125.506" stopTime="129.134">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Mr. Greenberg, was that ordinance ever mentioned in the trial below?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="129.134" stopTime="253.990">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    No, it was not, Your Honor and we plan to discuss some of the problems and issues that that may present. 
    Fourth, the State trial conviction and so forth that I've mentioned protected and asserted property right of Kress' Dime Store. 
    And this so-called property right upon analysis turns out only to be an asserted right to exclude Negroes and their white companions from a single unseverable portion of an establishment open to the general public in which these very petitioners were welcome to trade except at that particular counter while being seated. 
    Fifth, the premises in question were extensively licensed and regulated by the State with respect to its service of the public. 
    And finally, the State of North Carolina contrary to the assumptions made by this Court in the Civil Rights cases does not protect persons against racial discrimination in the premises in question. 
    Petitioners submit that these very well defined considerations typical to a very substantial extent of almost all of the sit-in cases to find the issues presented to this Court in a way which makes unnecessary for a decision any of the great variety of hypothetical cases imagined by legal writers and opposing counsel. 
    This case therefore does not involve state enforced racial segregation in private homes or country clubs. 
    It doesn't involve discrimination against persons because they may be redheads or personally disliked, personal enemies nor does it involve the extent to which the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the law of trusts in the States and so forth and so on. 
    Such hypothetical cases would call into play countervailing constitutional consideration such as rights of privacy and so forth none of which are involved in the case now at bar. 
    This case involves only the combination of the legal and factual circumstances of this type of sit-in which I said is typical of virtually all the sit-in cases not only here but throughout the country.

    There are I think 15 or 16 cases in this Court at this time and I was about to say I particularly checked North Carolina because I thought the question might arise. 
    There are approximately 162 cases pending in North Carolina in seven different jurisdictions in various stages of trial and appeal, all of which have been stayed by stipulation awaiting the outcome of this case. 
    And similar stipulations, though I don't have a count, have been made in other jurisdictions, other states awaiting the outcome of these cases. 
    But in North Carolina I've asked counsel in that State to check and there are 1 -- at least 162 cases in seven different jurisdictions.

    No, they did not. 
    For example in Rowley there was no ordinance. 
    In Monroe there is no ordinance. 
    In Charlotte, I don't believe there was an ordinance. 
    In fact I think Durham is perhaps the only city in North Carolina that has one, but I could get that precise information too.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg

    It was [Inaudible]?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="361.717" stopTime="406.290">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes. 
    On May 6, 1960, the petitioners who are five Negro students from North Carolina College and two white students from Duke University bought some small stationery items at the counter at the first floor of Kress' in Durham. 
    Kress' as I stated earlier serves Negroes and whites without discrimination throughout its various 50 counters in the store except at a seated service lunch counter. 
    There is a stand up lunch counter at which Negroes and whites are served without racial discrimination. 
    There's no racial sign at the entrance of the store nor are there any racial signs in the store indicating this segregation. 
    There was a sign stating however invited guests and employees only.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="406.290" stopTime="412.255">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Could the Durham ordinance before to make the so-called integrated lunch counter illegal?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="412.255" stopTime="594.800">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    I would think so Your Honor. 
    In discussing the application of the ordinance to this case, I plan to discuss that because our point is the ordinance in this case is not involved in the technical orthodox legal way that an ordinance might be involved in such a case, but more as an expression of community policy as it affected the situation because in fact the manager was not and no one has ever enforced the ordinance at that stand-up lunch counter. 
    And the manager himself testified that it was the custom of the community he was following and unlike in the Peterson case in South Carolina where both the manager and police stated they were relying on the ordinance and the Gober case out of Birmingham where there was an effort to develop the significance of the ordinance. 
    In the Durham case, neither the State nor the petitioners view the case as involving the ordinance in the normal -- in its normal legal application because the manager in fact was not obeying it at stand-up counters. 
    So we feel the ordinance plays a different kind of role in this case than it does in the others. 
    There was a sign at the lunch counter staying invited guests and employees only but no invitations were sent out as the manager states. 
    He just said that white persons automatically were considered guests and Negroes were not and Negroes and their white friends were not. 
    Racial discrimination was the custom of the community in North Carolina and that's why the manager said that he was segregating. 
    On page 22 of the record, he said that, “It is the policy of our store to wait on customers dependent upon the customs of the community.” 
    And lower down on that page, it said, “even if Negroes accompanied by white people were orderly at our luncheonette because of the policy of the community, we would not serve them,” and that was our policy prior to May 6 in various other places in the record, page 23 and 44, he said the same thing. 
    The Negro students who ordered were not served. 
    One of their white companions, a girl purchased some food and handed it to a Negro companion and she was asked to leave also. 
    They were all asked to leave. 
    While they remain seated, the police arrived. 
    It's not clear who called them, asked the petitioners to leave. 
    When they did not, they were arrested for trespass. 
    The petitioners for a long time have been customers of the store. 
    They were at this time sitting in as part of an informal student organization to protest segregation. 
    They did not desire to be arrested. 
    They did not expect to be arrested. 
    They were hopeful that the policy of the store would change. 
    They were indicted under a North Carolina statute which appears on page 2 of our brief which states, “Trespass on land after being forbidden.” 
    If any person after being forbidden to do so shall go -- enter upon the lands of another without a license therefore, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and so forth and we plan -- we have argued in our brief and if there's time plan to argue orally that this statute could not possibly get any notice that what these people had done was a crime. 
    They were sentenced as I said earlier three of the young men got 30 days in prison at labor, one got 20 days at labor, one got 15 and the two young ladies had prayer for judgment suspended.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Well, didn't they know, Mr. Greenberg that Negroes were not served in these luncheon counters before this entry? 
    Wasn't the purpose of the test to challenge the policy that had existed?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="605.860" stopTime="623.519">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes, it was. 
    They knew Negroes were not served. 
    They were hopeful that as had occurred in other communities that their sitting there would induce the propriety to serve them as indeed ultimately it has subsequent to these convictions. 
    I think the record is quite clear on that.

    On 23, he said I did not seek police protection and I may have that confused but I -- we don't rely on the fact that -- as to who called the police or deny them. 
    Yes, he did say, you're correct. 
    Yes, I was looking at page 23. 
    In addition to the -- we -- this case as I stated involves three issues; one, the petitioners denied equal protection of the laws, did the statute give adequate notice that this conduct was crime and were petitioners denied free speech secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    First argument, the equal protection argument is that under the well circumscribed issues presented by the facts of this case, the criminal conviction should be reversed as denying equal protection of the law secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    In Shelley against Kraemer, Barrows against Jackson, and Girard College case all make clear that State enforcement of racial discrimination even when initiated by private persons denies equal protection of the laws. 
    Indeed this case, we submit is stronger than Shelley against Kraemer because in Shelley, all the State did was hold its courts open to suitors to come in and enforce private agreements and here the State has taken an active initiative in prosecuting sentencing for jail and in fact the state prison system will be employed here unless these convictions are reversed.

    -- things as they are in North Carolina?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1080.973" stopTime="1178.045">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    That's correct. 
    We have argued that North Carolina, that the custom of racial discrimination is widespread. 
    We have an elaborate argument to that effect and the State comes back in its brief and says, “They don't see why we say that. 
    We're laboring the obvious” and I think perhaps we're laboring the obvious. 
    But a distinguished body of North Carolinians and North Carolina State Advisory Committee and the United States Commission on Civil Rights has concluded that these state laws caused private individuals to discriminate and segregate on the basis of race and otherwise they might not. 
    We got that cited in our brief too. 
    Now, North Carolina as in Louisiana and in other southern states, Negroes are segregated from birth to the grave. 
    There's an outgrowth of the state public policy set forth in the statutes. 
    When born, they are born in a segregated hospital. 
    Their race is recorded on a birth certificate. 
    When they go to school, despite the repeal of a North Carolina school segregation provisions and the decisions of this Court, they are assigned pursuant to the North Carolina people assignment laws to segregated laws and the United States Commission on Civil Rights has found as we cite in our briefs that under that people assignment law, not a single white child was assigned other than to a white school and a single Negro child into a Negro school as on -- upon that publication since and there have been a few. 
    But I believe it's correct to say that there are fewer Negroes in white schools in the entire State of North Carolina certainly not many more than in the City of New Orleans. 
    The state public policy is so well entrenched, the state law is not necessary. 
    Every school board knows to do it and does it on its own and only after extensive litigation is this pattern will breach the door.

    Again, going through the entire pattern of segregation that there is in North Carolina where Negroes go to work in plants, factories. 
    These are segregated by late -- by race and in some respects, that's required by state and municipal law. 
    And they pay taxes, the tax rules are segregated. 
    When they marry by constitution, they may marry only members of their own race and race is recorded on the marriage certificate. 
    Should they attempt to serve their country in the National Guard, they must be segregated. 
    And indeed there is a specific statute that a Negro may never command a white man. 
    And if anything, this really indicates the subordinate role which the state law has intend -- intensely placed Negroes in. 
    Should they unfortunately enough to go to a mental institution, orphanage, school for the blind and deaf, training school or prison, it must be segregated.

    Should a Negro fall into difficulty with the law as these petitioners did, the indictments, as the indictments in this case note their race.

    And when they die the cemeteries in which they are buried are segregated and one of the reasons I went through this is to show this is precisely the situation that we have in New Orleans and Louisiana. 
    Perhaps it's a little worse down there in terms of state law but at the same order of magnitude where there is no ordinance and so this ordinance is merely a part of the entire picture.

    It's extensively licensed and regulated by the state and by the municipality and all these licensing regulations statutes as set forth in our brief.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, I think that helps determine what his right is to the extent that it can be enforced by the police. 
    If there were but one or two segregation laws in the State, I mean it is a spectrum in a sliding scale, but when you reach a State which segregates from the cradle to the grave by state statute, constitution, and municipal ordinance, and you have all these other factors involved, I think that is a totality of state action as in another sense it was set forth in the Burton case, the Wilmington Parking Authority case.

    He says, “I'm -- I merely reflect the community,” that's all he said. 
    There's no privacy.

    The property right he was asserting in this case simply upon analysis of a property is just a bundle and [Inaudible] -- of rights and privileges as Justice Cardozo said, the property right was the right to discriminate racially against an invited customer at this particular portion of the store. 
    Now while that may be called a property right is, any relation -- legal relationship among persons with regard to things may be called a property right, we submit that it is not a property right of such dignity.

    My idea is frankly that they -- that they have not. 
    As I said in a minute in my brief, we were raised and we were reared in the near view and a pattern of segregation that was handed to us, has passed it on to us. 
    We -- and as I also want to say, we had legal sanction too. 
    As you know from Plessy against Ferguson and James against Canada and in Thomas against the Board of Education and that line of cases, we had some judicial sanction for the positions that were -- that we had even from this Court.

    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    Mr. Justice Goldberg, I don't know of any case that I could point to or where any question has arisen at all. 
    As a matter of fact I think that colored people have gone to their own hotels and have -- if there had been any that wanted for instance in the [Inaudible] that wanted to go, “Sir Walter, I haven't heard about it in main hotels”. 
    I just don't know what the attitude would be. 
    I am saying that innkeepers under our law, statute law which is in cooperation of common law and the -- that there were some exceptions other than the property rule here that I am contending for under a general trespass statute which I say is a valid statute and which I say does not segregate or pick them out as a class or a group at all. 
    It doesn't pick them out as any class or group and it does not make any arbitrary classification for that matter. 
    In regard to them, the statute is -- neutrally it applies to all people and if a person as we see it and as we enforce it whether right or wrong, if people come to the land -- on my land and I don't want them I tell them to get off. 
    If they come in my store and I don't like them, I tell them to get out. 
    This perhaps like in the old days, one of the Hatfields would've told the McCoys in one of the feud -- in the feuding days, and as far as I know our statute has been enforced that way as a -- not as a statute passed against colored people. 
    It's almost 100 years old. 
    There's no -- the -- he can't go back and generate a discriminatory basis in history for the passage of this statute at all. 
    As far as I can tell it didn't arise that way at all. 
    And as you go up through the cases, you only find these are the first ones I know of that color -- the colored people, I think this is sponsored organization by -- he says it's informal. 
    But they said they had a slogan that Mr. M. L. King had furnished them and I think it's a [Inaudible] is alright, I'm not going to raise any point about that. 
    But this statute -- they cannot -- any case be made that this statute has been administered, singled out -- colored people have been singled out and it's been administered against them. 
    It has not.

    If its -- his brother was killed by a redheaded man, he don't like redheaded people, excludes them from that or any other reasons. 
    It's his property and I say that he puts -- he arrogates property to just a merely bundle of rights and maybe it is.

    No, I think the Court can, but that -- they were -- in the Shelley case, in the first place, the people there were in agreement. 
    They were in agreement there, that were the -- the colored people and the white people both in -- I believe they've executed the deeds and they were all in agreement there in the Shelley case and furthermore that's buttressed by this statute that gives them the right, the same as anyone else to negotiate and acquire property. 
    Now, of course the argument was made well, you can do that for a -- the white for whom -- do the same thing or deny it on for white people.

    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    The 42 students are brought to attend in Durham. 
    I think that's this year. 
    Let me see if I can find Your Honor where it is -- give the date. 
    It was 1962-1963 school year.

    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    That's right and of course Mr. Greenberg's Civil Rights Committee didn't have -- wouldn't have had that -- of that report. 
    Now, Judge Stanley in the District Court found in the Durham case, he found this. 
    In his opinion, he said it should again be emphasized we're not dealing with the situation where a school board has a fixed policy of maintaining a totally segregated school system. 
    A dependent board has assigned Negro children to Durham High School, Broaden junior school, Collar junior high and he gives a list of schools which I not take up the time. 
    Now he finds that in his order. 
    So as Mr. Justice Clark they -- there are some suits pending in local units. 
    There are no suits pending at the state level and you mentioned by being in the Attorney General's office. 
    I looked after those at the state level. 
    After several suits at the state level, no more room. 
    Now, let me answer some of these charges. 
    I've already dealt with segregation in mental institutions and told you that we admitted they were entitled to go in a lawsuit. 
    As to the cemeteries, I know of no law that segregates as to the cemeteries. 
    He cites a statute before a municipality to cover cemetery, if they were predominantly white people in it, they'd follow that, predominantly colored, they'd find -- they would follow that. 
    And the statute he cites however to maintain his proposition, he doesn't bear that out because the statute he cites if you look at it has simply provided that where prisoners died in the penal institutions and their bodies were not claimed, the bodies of the colored prisoners would be turned over to the colored funeral homes and the bodies of the white to the white funeral homes. 
    I know of no reason in the world legal or otherwise why a colored person cannot obtain these services. 
    I see -- I found maybe he has but I found no prohibition why colored persons can't obtain the services of a white funeral home director and vice versa. 
    Now he should --

    Well, one reason we have that frankly is this -- simply is a fair their rate is higher than ours.

    As a matter of fact, the true picture of this whole thing is these are lingering along in the statutes. 
    They will be taken out of the general statutes commission. 
    And he has presented a picture here that as a matter of practical operation and light doesn't exist. 
    For instance he -- he's got us charged here with laws about the waiting rooms, in the bus stations, and the railroads. 
    Well, those laws may still be there. 
    They've got to come out, but as a matter of practice, there's no segregation that I know of in North Carolina on waiting rooms at all. 
    I ride the buses and I see them. 
    I walk by the bus station every morning to work and I see colored people in there with the white people in the waiting room and here are some lawyers from Durham and they know that it's true up there too. 
    I've got the letter of the Trailway executive vice president, and he says they have obeyed the order ever since it was issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    And I ride the buses and I defy them to prove it if that -- there is any seating arrangement that relates to race on the bus because everybody rides where they want to and where they can get a seat and sit down.

    Mr. Chief Justice I think what we did was that when the Interstate Commerce Commission issued its order we obeyed it. 
    We had separate waiting rooms and we've got them both open today and today a large fraction of colored people prefer to go over into other waiting room where they used to go and talk and deal when their served.

    Probably it wouldn't have been eliminated at all because that hadn't been the law because we have that way of life and we practice that way of life and it was the thing we were born into and it is the thing we did just as many other groups religiously or otherwise are born into that thing that they practice in to. 
    I am -- before closing of this amount of time, I wish to deal just a minute with the question that a restaurant as a matter affected with the public interest. 
    Now I don't know what the -- if a restaurant is affected with a public interest just to this particular reason or not, I do say that under your decisions which I have quoted copiously in my brief, the ordinary occupations in economic life from New State Ice Company against Liebmann, Standard Oil Company will effect and in the terminal taxi cabs and all those, this is not a public facility that you've been dealing with and according to the definations that you've been given which have been exclusively devoted to public service and necessarily it would not be because those have -- most of those have a monopoly. 
    This thing about restaurants and cafes is a thing that rises and falls in the flux of economic life. 
    Some institutions grow up and establish chains and new forms of furnishing food come in and drive the others out. 
    And I -- to me it's not of any -- well, a permanent, enough economic nature to be affected with the public interest. 
    And if it is may I -- would not the doctor with his office soaking out on the street, wouldn't he be affected with the public interest? 
    Would not the lawyer be affected with the public interest?

    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    Well I am saying this -- I think this and I have been obscure about that but here's what I'm trying to get across. 
    He is arguing in his brief that these restaurants and cafes and these sandwich shops and everything in a certain sense or impressed this instrumentalities of the Government, they are affected with the public interest and therefore, if that's true, there is the intrusion of the State into it when you get there. 
    And --

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    That's right sir.

    He's bringing the State in by the theory of a public interest.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose the State had passed the law which says that the merchant could not serve white people and colored people together, would you -- would argue that that's a good statute?

    Oh, we have many cases and you are familiar with them where -- like the picketing cases, you don't need a statute of the State.

   Rebuttal of Jack Greenberg
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="5723.476" stopTime="5749.923">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    May it please the Court. 
    Concerning the Durham schools and school segregation, in North Carolina generally, I respectfully refer to the Court to the recently decided decision of the Fourth Circuit sitting en banc in Wheeler against the School Board of the City of Durham which case went on for a period of over three years until Judge Stanley was unanimously reversed and at this time, approximately 40 some odd children are being admitted to the Durham City schools.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5749.923" stopTime="5751.361">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Not by court order, is that --
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="5751.361" stopTime="5914.288">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    It was not by court order but the court order is on the way. 
    That's true that the court order has not yet -- there has not yet been a hearing on the order, but there has been a unanimous decision of the Fourth Circuit following three years of litigation during which they kept separate school zones and they still have them at this time so far as I know. 
    Secondly, the main point that I'm afraid that I got away from during the argument was that this is not a case involving redheads or Hatfields or McCoys. 
    This is a case involving the question of racial segregation and I would like just to read a few sentences from the conclusion of the Shelley opinion which I think is crucial here. 
    That is that the historical context in which the Fourteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitution should not be forgotten. 
    Whatever else the framers sought to achieve, it is clear that the matter of primary concern with the establishment of equality in the enjoyment of basic civil and political rights and the preservation of those rights from discriminatory action on the part of the states based on considerations of race or color. 
    75 years ago, this Court announced that the provisions of the amendment are to be construed with this fundamental purpose in mind. 
    And we submit as we did at the outset that there is more state action here than in Shelley and the state action bites more deeply. 
    Here the courts have not held themselves open to persons who have agreed to discriminate and said that we will implement your agreement. 
    Here, the State has taken an active initiative in prosecuting and trying these students and it threatens as I said to send to jail unless these judgments are reversed. 
    Shelley, I was said involved some sort of a two-party contract in which both parties agree but that is not so. 
    Shelley was a tripartite or there were more people involved. 
    Those covenanters were involved in the contract too and they had a property right too and their so-called property right was the right to insist upon racial discrimination on the part of the buyer and the seller. 
    And it was that that this Court held could not be enforced through the courts and to that extent, Shelley is similar to this and also the statute that supposedly was -- statute was involved in the Shelley speaks of personal property as well as real property as well. 
    There was a question about the innkeepers' law in North Carolina. 
    The law of innkeepers in North Carolina State -- in State against Steele at 106, 766 -- North Carolina 766 and racial discrimination is an exception to the innkeeper's rule. 
    An innkeeper can keep out a person on the grounds of race if he so desires. Guests of a hotel and travelers or other persons entering it with a bona fide intent of the coming guest cannot be lawfully prevented from going in or be put out by force and so from the so on, unless they be persons of bad or suspicious character or a vulgar habit are so objectionable to the patrons of the house on account of the race to which they belong and so forth.

speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="5934.012" stopTime="5954.060">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    There is a North Carolina statute and the North Carolina statute embodies the rule of State v. Steele which says that it shall apply to persons whom the innkeeper may accept as his guest in his inn or hotel. 
    And it is annotated -- that statute is annotated to State v. Steele obviously and he may -- need not accept persons on the grounds of race.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5954.060" stopTime="5955.604">
    Unknown Speaker 
    There's no race in the statute.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="5955.604" stopTime="5994.358">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    There's no race in the statute. 
    That's true, but the case says that he need not accept Negroes as guests. 
    And we respectfully submit to this Court that for the reasons we have given that this is a case in which there has been an arrest, a conviction. 
    The courts and police have acted. 
    This is something that bites deeper and harder than Shelley and there was all these additional state action that we've spoken about involved in the cases as well but for the reasons given, these convictions and the judgment below should be reversed.
