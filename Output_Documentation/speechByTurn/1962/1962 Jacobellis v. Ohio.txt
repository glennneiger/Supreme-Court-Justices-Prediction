Jacobellis v. Ohio

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 11, Nico Jacobellis, Appellant, versus Ohio. 
    Mr. London.
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="54.525" stopTime="247.524">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices. 
    If the Court please, this is a reargument of an appeal from an order of the Ohio Supreme Court affirming the conviction of Jacobellis, the appellant, on two counts. 
    One count was for possession of a film, motion picture film, that was found by the Court to be obscene and the other count was for showing or exhibiting the film. 
    The picture that's involved in this case is the motion picture called “Lovers.” 
    The first question that's presented by the appeal is whether or not this picture is obscene, if it is not obscene under constitutional standards. 
    That's an end of the case. 
    And to make that or to consider that question, I think we must first consider the standards by which a film must be judged and I should add that I don't think that this film can be judged obscene by any constitutionally acceptable standards. 
    But the criteria for judgment in determining whether or not a film is obscene are set out in Roth and Alberts. 
    But the highest courts of the various states had considerable difficulty in applying those standards. 
    And there are many questions that have been raised with respect to the meaning of the Roth-Alberts standards. 
    The first question in which there have been differences of opinion in the state courts is whether it was intended by the Roth-Alberts decision to allow the suppression of punishment of only what is termed hardcore pornography. 
    And I hope that that I won't be asked to define that term but it's been used by many of the courts and I understand that to mean that which is not only obscene but so flagrantly, patently, blatantly obscene. 
    That there could be no difference of opinion between men of -- whose opinion is to be respected between reputable people with respect to whether or not that matter is actually obscene or not.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    At least you mean in any -- in any given moment in any given time.
speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="252.608" stopTime="373.976">
    Mr. Ephraim London 
    Well, I assume that the society is ours and I think we're going to have to explore that question too because that question of which society is to be the judge or according to the standards of which society is another matter that is involved here. 
    And there's also another matter about which the state courts differ in connection with a specific application of the term community standards, what the community has intended to be. 
    But if I may speak first to the question of hardcore pornography, I take it from reading of the cases that this Court has decided that have related to punishment of -- of matter found to or suspected or charged of violating federal law. 
    That something like the standard of hardcore pornography does apply where a federal statute is involved and where a federal prosecution is involved. 
    I've made that assumption from a reading of the various cases that this Court has -- has determined, some without opinion and such cases as Manual against Day where the -- certainly, the -- at least one of the opinions is very clear in indicating that only what was patently offensive and obnoxious would be considered obscene. 
    In relation to a federal case and the question is whether the same rule will apply where there is a state prosecution. 
    None of course relates to the very much broader question as to whether the First Amendment means the same thing in a state prosecution as it does in a federal prosecution.

    Mr. Ephraim London 
    The punishment was the fine of $500 on one count and the maximum fine of $2000 on another count. 
    The Court had the option of either imposing a fine or an indeterminate prison sentence of not less than one or more than seven years.

    Now, before going into the question of whether or not the federal standards are to apply here in a state prosecution, I think I -- I should state and I think the record clearly indicates that if this were a federal prosecution, this motion picture could not possibly be considered obscene under the standards that have been followed by this Court in a federal prosecution.

    Mr. Ephraim London 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But I -- I said before that I had indicated my understanding of the federal standards from a consideration of the various cases that this Court has passed upon many without opinion. 
    For example, the -- the Mounts (ph) case, the one case where there was material involved which I think would be considered obscene perhaps by other standards and where perhaps the Court might have -- might have been -- where -- where I think it was pretty clear that the Court was insisting that the work be more than merely what is -- might ordinarily be considered obscene. 
    But as I stated before this picture that we have here couldn't possibly under the -- what I conceive to be the federal standards be judged obscene and constitutionally punishable or suppressible. 
    It's a picture that has been examined by a number of censorship boards that are in the business of detecting obscenity and passed by them ultimately, found to be not obscene by at least six or seven of them.

    And of course available for the Court's examination but it was passed by censorship boards in Maryland, by censorship boards in Providence, by censorship board finally in Chicago, in New York and Boston. 
    Now some question has been raised as to whether New York and Boston, not the other places that I've mention but New York and Boston have seen a revised version and the fact is that they did see a version that is 131 feet less which is less than a minute showing time, 131 feet less than the version that was shown in Chicago, the version that was shown in Columbus, Ohio and the version that is being prosecuted today.

    It had been recommended and nominated for an award as one of the ten best films, not only by the New York Times but by the Saturday Review of Literature, I think three different critics had -- had made that recommendation. 
    Now, the question of -- of whether or not the First Amendment standards can vary from state to state, there's never been specifically passed upon by this Court. 
    And that is the appellant's position here that the standards are the same whether the prosecution is by the federal or by a state government. 
    As I understand it, the -- it is the First Amendment, whether it has become part of the Fourteenth by incorporation or whether by absorption. 
    It is still the First Amendment that has become applicable to the states. 
    And the first Amendment Right, I should not think would vary from state to state.

    There is an excellent exposition which is not quoted in my brief but I think that the whole question, I -- I think there is an excellent -- excellent statement of the question and discussion of it in that New Jersey case. 
    Now in relation to the application of national standards again, with respect to the criterion of community standards, the Roth case says that a work, if it is to be judged or one is to judge whether or not it is obscene must be judged according to community standards and the question as, what is meant by the term community. 
    Is it, as the New Jersey Court suggested, national standards? 
    In a state prosecution, is it the state standards? 
    Is it the county in which the defendant is being prosecuted or as if no community at all as the State of Kansas has suggested in its brief in the following case. 
    The -- the State of Kansas suggest that society at large as -- as its standards are interpreted by a particular judge or a jury, is the community that the Court intended in Roth against United States.

   Argument of John T. Corrigan
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2703.966" stopTime="2707.572">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. -- Mr. Corrigan.
speaker="john_t_corrigan" startTime="2707.572" stopTime="2914.867">
    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Perhaps it is well to begin with giving the Court a bit of a background with regard to how this case is here before the Court. 
    An arrest was made after a showing of a film entitled “The Lovers” in Cleveland Heights a suburb of the City of Cleveland. 
    After this arrest was made, the film in question was submitted to a grand jury and the grand jury returned an indictment charging the defendant with two violations of the law. 
    That of possessing with knowledge and I've seen motion picture film and a certain count of exhibiting knowingly and I've seen motion picture film. 
    The defendant was entitled under the law to a trial by jury but elected to move the Court to have a three-man court try the case and under the Ohio law, this is discretionary with the Court and the Court granted the motion and permitted the trial by a three-man court. 
    The three-man court in its memorandum opinion which is set forth in the brief of the appellee recites the rule of the Roth case as the basis for its finding. 
    The case subsequently was appealed to a three-man appellate court. 
    And the appellate court again cites the rule of the Roth case as its basis for affirmation. 
    The case was then appealed to the Ohio State Supreme Court and the Ohio State Supreme Court again affirmed six-to-one citing the rule of the Roth case as its affirmation. 
    Now, going immediately to the question of whether or not the rule is or should be hardcore pornography. 
    The law of Ohio and the law of the 50 States and the law of the United States in dealing with the obscenity as I understand, have used the term obscenity and not the term hardcore porno -- pornography nor have the decisions of any state or the decision of this United States Supreme Court at any times that the rule is with respect to hardcore pornography. 
    Let us assume however for a moment that that was so. 
    Pornography as I recall has its derivation at a Greek word which means, dealing with prostitution. 
    So, pornography is now all inclusive in the term obscenity because much obscenity deals with matters other than that which deals with prostitution. 
    However, in the instant case, Justice Radcliffe of the Ohio State Supreme Court in his majority opinion stated that this was worst than hardcore pornography. 
    So, in order to be worst than hardcore pornography, he undoubtedly found that to be such. 
    I know of no rule of law that is reiterated more often in the reviewing courts than the rule that a reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for the finders of the fact where there is evidence to support that finding.

    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    No. 
    I do not say that it forecloses that Your Honor. 
    Now, the statement was made by the appellant that this motion picture film has been reviewed by a number of reviewing boards and has had no difficulty. 
    I ask you if you will to go to the record page 376 and in the testimony given by Mr. Frankel, the President of the distributor of this film. 
    The question that was asked to him was -- that shown at the top of the page, was that shown to the censor board in Chicago, Illinois. 
    The answer Yes sir. 
    Was it censored by the law and the State of New York? 
    Isn't that correct? 
    The answer was yes. 
    Now, the same film that was shown in Cleveland Heights is not shown to the public in the State of New York in its entirety. 
    In its entirety, no. 
    And I'm moving further down the page. 
    So far as you know, there are two prints of this film, generally speaking, two different versions. 
    His answer to that is, yes sir. 
    Now, the one shown in Dayton, Ohio, that was the same as the one shown in the Cleveland Heights Theater? 
    Yes sir. 
    This film -- and no version is being shown in the State of Maryland? 
    Have attempts been shown -- have been made by Zenith International to show the film in Maryland? 
    An attempt was made by Zenith International and I was present to secure a censor seal from the State of Maryland. 
    Well, the State of Maryland requested several deletions, isn't that right? 
    Yes. 
    There were two deletions requested. 
    Moving down the page in the film "The Lovers" isn't shown in any version in the State of Maryland? 
    Answer: No. 
    This film is not shown on any version in the State of Virginia? 
    Answer: No, sir.

speaker="john_t_corrigan" startTime="3080.565" stopTime="3407.020">
    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    The only version here is the ver -- is the film that was shown in Cleveland Heights and the film that was shown in Dayton, Ohio. 
    Now, in Dayton, Ohio, this film was shown to a jury and the jury made a finding of guilty. 
    However, the charge there was predicated under a misdemeanor statute of the -- of Ohio. 
    This did not require scienter as did the felony statute. 
    An appeal was taken from the Dayton case, an affirmation was had in the Court of Appeals and when it got to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court found the misdemeanor statute unconstitutional because of the lack of the scienter provision in keeping with the Smith case of this United States Supreme Court. 
    Now, the appellant argues that as interpreted, this statute was violative of the constitutional guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendment. 
    As part of his argument, he cites the Mapp case. 
    The Mapp case was a case wherein the question of possession of obscenity was an issue and Miss Mapp was found guilty and upon appeal to the United States Supreme Court for another reason involving search and seizure, a reversal was held. 
    This Court did not pass upon the question of obscenity in the Mapp case. 
    However, the facts of the Mapp case were such that they concerned -- were concerned with mere possession as opposed to possession for commercial purposes. 
    The appellant contends that in the Mapp case, there was a lack of guilty purpose or mens rea announced by the Court as an element of the obscenity law of Ohio. 
    The Mapp case did not say that guilty purpose was not a necessary element. 
    The Mapp case merely concerned itself with a factual situation of a mere possession knowledgeable but not a possession for commercial purposes or for -- with a guilty purpose. 
    In the instant case, we are concerned with a knowing possession for the purposes of public exhibition. 
    State versus Mapp did not foreclose the ban on possession for purposes of exhibition. 
    Again, for purposes of clarification may I say that four out of the six charges in the Mapp case found that as applied to the Mapp -- Mapp facts, the statute to be unconstitutional. 
    Though, four out of the six so found that this is not sufficient in Ohio to make a law unconstitutional, the reason being that it is necessary in an appeal from a lower tribunal that all but one of the justices must find it to be unconstitutional in order to make a statute unconstitutional. 
    In Alberts versus California passed upon by this Court, this Court found the constitutionality of a state statute which provided for the lewdly keeping or sale of obscene materials. 
    Much more so, the constitution of -- constitutionality of the Ohio statute should be upheld for prohibiting the knowing possession, the control and the knowing exhibition of obscene motion picture films. 
    Mapp is generally in point only and that it deals with the question of this statute whereas State versus Jacobellis which is the State case of this case before this Court now and State versus Wetzel, W-E-T-Z-E-L which was decided at the same time is specifically in point and this clearly gives the interpretation of the Ohio State Supreme Court relative to the construction of the Ohio statute. 
    There can be little doubt but that in the Mapp case when Justice Stewart said and Justice -- Justice Stewart said in Mapp, "I would however reverse the Judgment in this case because I am persuaded that the provisions of 2905.34 of the Ohio revised code upon which the petitioner's conviction was based is in the words of Mr. Justice Harlan not consistent with the rights of free thought and expression assured against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment." 
    In this instance, the Justice had in mind a mere possession as opposed to a knowing possession for purposes of exhibition.

speaker="john_t_corrigan" startTime="3989.488" stopTime="4419.084">
    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    In Ohio? 
    No. 
    I have no idea Your Honor. 
    In our -- in our jurisdiction perhaps, the whole gamut of obscenity in the course of the year, maybe a dozen to 15 such cases. 
    And with regard to motion picture films, this is the second since 1957, the other one was appealed to the Ohio State Supreme Court in a -- it was affirmed in that Court that appeal was not taken to this Court with regard to other type of material, literature, as I say, maybe as many as a dozen a year. 
    The majority -- the vast majority dealing with pictures and magazines depicting sexual activities between both female and males and in most instances, these are not appealed and in most instances, I might add a -- a plea of guilty as the result rather than a trial. 
    But I would say that there -- in a given year probably or not in excess of 15 in Cuyahoga County which has a population of approximately 1,700,000 people. 
    Moving on to the second point of the appellant's argument and I submit that this should not be before the Court or in the jurisdictional statement, the appellant did not set forth. 
    This is one of the bases of his appeals. 
    For the first time, he submits to the Court for its consideration the entire statute and the -- the constitutionality are the same. 
    When I submit that the constitutionality of a statute should never be tested in the abstract, and only in the -- with respect to the legal rights of litigants, should it be adjudged? 
    However, out of an abundance of caution, I would like to address myself to this point, the appellant argues that the statute is unconstitutional and the majority of its intended applications. 
    And then he speculates and he engages in conjecture and as exceptions to the general rule that the Court will not go beyond the limits of the facts in litigation. 
    The appellant sets up three exceptions. 
    The first being with the statute and question has already been declared unconstitutional the vast majority of its intended applications. 
    This is not so here. 
    This statute has not been found to be unconstitutional in any of its applications. 
    The second is, where the statute would have an inhibiting effect on expression. 
    For this exception, the appellant relies on Smith versus California which we distinguished because that lack the scienter provision which is in the Ohio law. 
    He relies also on the Thornhill case. 
    This we say is distinguishable because the finding against the defendant in that instance was in the general language of the statute and not by any specification of the evidence or any specific portion of the statute. 
    He further cites Herndon versus Lowry to support this position and I contend that this case is distinguished because here, the Court found the statute to be vague, so vague as to make a criminal and -- to make criminal and innocent utterance. 
    The third contention is that where the statute is left standing, it would not give fair warning of its prohibition. 
    Here, to support this position, the appellant in my opinion dissects the statute and he argues for example that the statute provides where a material is not wholly obscene but contains lewd and lascivious articles that violates the Roth rule. 
    A reading of that statute sets forth that no one shall knowingly sell, give, lend away -- lend, give away a book, picture or film and so on which is obscene. 
    And then it goes on and we states and no one shall give, lend away -- lend, give away a book, picture, film and so on not wholly obscene but containing lewd and lascivious material that purpose of this statute is that we conceivably could have a magazine that would have many articles in it and one of those articles could be most obscene and the rest of the magazine be devoted to wholesome material. 
    Under the Ohio statute, an individual could be prosecuted for the exhibiting, selling of that obscene material. 
    I do not think that the Roth rule is a rule of quantity but rather a rule of quality. 
    You could not conceivably have a book that would be a hundred pages and 49 of which would be obscene and 51 not obscene and then say that therefore, this book could not be found obscene. 
    The appellant argues also that this section in part provides that no person shall -- shall give away -- show to a minor an obscene lewd or lascivious work. 
    And in support of this -- this contention of the statute is unconstitutional, in this application, he cites Butler versus Michigan. 
    Butler versus Michigan was a case wherein you will recall where an adult was prosecuted for the possession of materials that would tend to the delinquency of a minor. 
    The Ohio statute provides that an adult would be prosecuted if there was a sale to a minor not merely the possession or if there was a knowing exhibition of the material to a minor so Butler isn't -- not at all in point. 
    He says that this section is unconstitutional because it contravenes the Equal Protection Clause of the constitution and that it accepts from its application works of art. 
    This in fact is not so. 
    It accepts from its application bona fide works of art. 
    Bona fide works of art are defined as being works of art that are not obscene. 
    It provides also that these bona fide works of art be --

    Antiquity? 
    I'm just interested in that provision, how does it work?

    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    It would be a bona fide work of art. 
    And -- and in addition to that, even if it were not, it is not obscene on any sense by any test that I know. 
    And with respect to the bona fide work of art coming from an association, the bona fide art association is defined as one in the law as an organization not in contravention with other sections of the law that deal with obscene language, nudism, obscenity, seduction, sodomy, wife slavery, adultery, fornication and the like. 
    So a bona fide association is one that has proven names of conformity with the well ordered society. 
    And I submit that if this movie was published by an art association, the exhibition of the film would still be subjected to the criminal law and therefore, there is not an exception on the law which would be violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the constitution. 
    He contends also that a matter having second class mailing privileges is exempted from the application of the law. 
    This, we contend is a justified classification or no mail -- no obscenity maybe mailed by any class whatever and we contend that this is a proper classification. 
    Thank you Your Honor.
