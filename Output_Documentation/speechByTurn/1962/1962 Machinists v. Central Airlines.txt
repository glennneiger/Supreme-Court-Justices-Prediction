    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, when a lawyer stands up to argue a case before the Court, the traditional, may it please the Court, is always seem to me to be somewhat like the same lawyer who holds up a high ball to his friend and says, “here is to you” and drinks it himself. 
    He, in a sense, has intention of pleasing himself or his client by his argument rather than the Court. 
    Now, I express that view to an English Solicitor and had a 45-minute lecture, as a result, as the derivation of that phrase that it had nothing to do with making the Court happy, that it derived from the, I suppose law equivalent of, may the Court be pleased to agree with me and grant my prayer. 
    And that it was used, he told me and I'm sure he's right, in a sense that may I convince the Court, may I get the Court to agree with me. 
    Now, if I'm going to get the Court to agree with me in this case, I think that I'm going to have to argue the case not with a broad-brush that was used by counsel for the petitioners, but to confine the argument as much as I'm permitted to the exact facts of the case, what is actually before this Court. 
    What we have here is a case in which a complaint was filed and it was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. 
    We haven't tried the case on the merits, had the petitioners elected to accept order of dismissal and try it in state court. 
    We might have been here on the merits and the counsel could have pointed out how he had been mistreated or I might be able to point out how the Texas Court had misinterpreted the law depending on the outcome of the trial, but it is not that case. 
    We have here a simple question of the jurisdiction of the District Court to hear a lawsuit. 
    Not a theoretical lawsuit, not a lawsuit that might have been filed, not involving questions that might or might not arise, but one that is presented by the complaint filed in this case. 
    The complaint fails to show jurisdiction for at least two reasons, one, which, frankly was not raised in the trial court of the court below and that is that this complaint was based solely on Section 1331 (a), there being no diversity. 
    And there was a failure to allege that each of the individual plaintiffs had a lawsuit involving more than $10,000.00. 
    I don't want to spend a lot of time arguing the point, but I do want to suggest one thing to the Court. 
    In the reply, petitioners have asked to leave to amend under, I believe that's Section 1653 with provides that amendments to this -- to furnish defective -- correct, defective allegations or jurisdictions may be made on the terms in the trial or Appellate Court.

    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    Well, I read it as being both, but for the point I want to make Your Honor, I think it's -- well, I'll assume it either way or assume it's both. 
    My point is that under this Section, the right to amend, adapt that any party after he has a judgment against him in the trial court, can be allowed to amend to show that the trial court's judgment is wrong. 
    To reduce it to absurdity, a suit is filed without diversity in the United States District Court on an ordinary automobile accident and the court dismisses it because there's no diversity and there's no federal question. 
    So on appeal, leave is made to correct it by showing that the suit is one which does involve a federal question setting up an entirely different cause of action. 
    Now, I don't mean to make a big point of it. 
    I just want to say that this particular statute has never been interpreted by this Court, but -- and I find no cases under it. 
    The -- but the -- I just doubt that a -- an Appellate Court can render, can permit an amendment which will make a trial court's judgment wrong. 
    I think the statute means that amendments may be allowed to validate a judgment of the lower court not to make it incorrect. 
    Now, that's rather narrow point and I'd like to pass on to the real point in the case.

    If -- Your Honor, I'd say no and yes and let may put it the -- first, if it had not been for the specific allegation as to the fact that this was under 1331 (a), a specific direct allegation, my answer is Your Honor, of course not. 
    If on the other hand, in this particular instance, there was a limitation as to what they were claiming jurisdiction under, that was the case presented to the trial court. 
    He was told, we say there is jurisdiction here under 1331 (a). 
    I don't mean to intimate for one minute, had there not been the limiting allegation that a general allegation and the facts were alleged which brought it under a particular federal statute that it would be defective.

    But let me pass to the main points in the case. 
    This is a suit by six plaintiffs, each of whom has an award in his favor and each of whom wants to have that award enforced. 
    Now, the award is not under the Railway Labor Act in the sense that it's under the Railroad Adjustment Board. 
    It is not under the 301 of Taft-Hartley Act, that type of thing. 
    This is a system board of adjustment. 
    The --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="638.062" stopTime="640.474">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How was it created, under what law?
speaker="luther_hudson" startTime="640.474" stopTime="654.155">
    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    The -- there is a statute 184-2045 U.S. 184 which orders the parties to enter into an agreement providing for a system board of adjustment. 
    The --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="654.155" stopTime="655.284">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Federal statute?
speaker="luther_hudson" startTime="655.284" stopTime="656.137">
    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    Yes sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="656.137" stopTime="656.835">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Federal --
speaker="luther_hudson" startTime="656.835" stopTime="929.803">
    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    Yes sir. 
    That is no question but what the contract was entered into under that statute and that will let me bring one of the points I want to make. 
    There are ‘any number' of cases, I'd say any number, there must be 10 or 15 cases in which both this Court and the Circuit Courts have said that a refusal to abide by that law and enter into a contract is a federal right. 
    That is the cause of action to force a compliance with that statute. 
    There are no cases which says that -- which say that after you have complied with the statute, a cause of action arises under it. 
    I can make an illustration Your Honor. 
    In my state as in most states, there is a statute that says, automobiles must be operated with adequate breaks. 
    An allegation that the automobile was operated with breaks that were inadequate would arise under that statute, but an allegation that an automobile was equipped with adequate breaks and the statute complied with would not rise under that. 
    So we come to the single question and I think it is in this case and that is where the plaintiff's cause of action arises under the federal law. 
    And for that purpose, Your Honor, it makes no difference whether it's 1331 or 1337. 
    The test arises is the same under both. 
    First, let's see what the plaintiff's complaint shows. 
    All he says -- all he says is that back in 1955 or 1957, I've forgotten which, a contract was entered into as required by the Railway Labor Act between the union and the company. 
    And then as part of that contract, there was a system board of adjustment created that these six individual employees were discharged and each filed his grievance and each was processed up to including the system board of adjustment which deadlocked and a neutral was called in and the neutral entered award which ordered reinstatement with back pay. 
    And to answer the question which Mr. Justice White asked, this award is not a money award because the amount is not stated in it. 
    It is merely that is left for determination either by the party's agreement or by litigation. 
    So that is the lawsuit that he alleges. 
    He says he wants that award enforced and for the court to determine the amount that he's entitled to, and order the defendant to give him back his job. 
    Now, let's stop there, attached to the petition is a copy of the award that he's suing on, the award that he says, “Gives him a cause of action.” 
    The award that he says entitles him to the relief he asked for. 
    That award doesn't mention the Railroad Labor Act. 
    It doesn't appear in the award even by inference or by a reference. 
    It refers to a contract. 
    It refers to provisions for the working of overtime and the giving of notices for the processing of grievances and for the representation by union representatives of the employees and grievance procedures. 
    He sues here not by a reason of statute. 
    There isn't a statute in the books that says that he is entitled to reinstatement. 
    There isn't a statute in the books that says he's not entitled to reinstatement. 
    There's not a statute in the book that says he works overtime. 
    There's not a statute in the book that says we can discharge him if he doesn't work overtime when he's ordered to. 
    There's not statute in the book that says that the grievances must be handled as they were in this case. 
    There is no possible statute which says that this man can recover or cannot recover. 
    Now, on the face of the complaint, what federal question is raised --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="929.803" stopTime="935.643">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What are the keywords of the statute, jurisdictional statute that you think would construe this?
speaker="luther_hudson" startTime="935.643" stopTime="938.282">
    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    The -- if you mean 1331 (a).

    And the other one says arises under the laws of Constitution and credos of the United States I believe is the phrase. 
    I'll read them to you if Your Honor --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="960.127" stopTime="963.970">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. Luther Hudson

    And I hope I can understand them, but I have a hard time remembering styles, but I think the Pan American is probably the most recent case.

    But the -- under --

    But we have to construe it?
speaker="luther_hudson" startTime="996.967" stopTime="1123.243">
    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    But the -- under those cases, the fact that the cause of action has its origin in a federal statute, does not give the District Court jurisdiction. 
    The cause of action itself must be based upon the statute. 
    It must show on the face of the complaint under those authorities. 
    It must show on the face of the complaint that the constitutionality, the construction or the application of a federal statute will be necessarily instant to a judgment in the case and you cannot get that into the complaint in this case. 
    The counsel for the opposition in effect conceded that yesterday. 
    He was asked the question whether -- and I believe it's Mr. Justice Potter asking the question, whether or not the failure of Congress to put a provision for federal jurisdiction in the airline portion of the statute with inadvertence and he answered yes. 
    Now, I concede to some extent the necessity of courts taking care of mistakes but I do not concede the right to include a provision, “suits to enforce awards maybe brought in the federal court.” 
    I've got a good story that will illustrate my point and I want to tell it because it illustrates it and because it's a good story. 
    In legislature back in 1930s when I was working away through school, I remember a Senator by name McGregor. 
    Mr. Justice Clark may remember him. 
    He was rather powerful and effective State Senator. 
    And his wife was badly injured in an accident because she got on one of these roads that had a one-way bridge. 
    And he started to crusade to require bridges in Texas to be wider and he got this bill passed. 
    And it was a slight mistake and he left out the “G” of “bridges” and the statute required all brides in Texas to be 40-feet between the bucker systems. 
    Now, that's large even for Texas.

    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    No sir may -- I say that the Court would I think, as matter of reading the caption and reading the emergency clause, it'd be justified there in inserting the “G”. 
    Certainly, I've got married on the assumption that the “G” was in there and my wife could not qualify. 
    Now, that -- let me make the point I was trying to make a minute ago. 
    I don't question for a minute that when you have a statute which clearly shows that it regulates bridges and that it is -- deal solely with bridges that you can insert a “G”. 
    But when you have a statute which plainly does not contain a provision saying, “Suits to enforce the awards of adjustment boards shall be brought or maybe brought in the federal court.” 
    I humbly say that the Court cannot enact that statute.

    Well, I suppose the Court will fashion a law of some sort to cover this. 
    I will say this, I was hoping that someone would point out to me as I think you're leading up to that the reason this is final is not because this Court says that it's final or not because the statute says it is final but because the party said it was final.

    If their party's statute says that these boards cannot have jurisdiction exceeding that of a board under the Railway Adjustment Act. 
    Now, it doesn't say they have to be equal.

    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    I can very easily and I can stay inside the record and do it Your Honor. 
    This time, I don't mean to tell the Court because when we try this case, there will be amended pleadings. 
    But under the current pleading, the easiest one to state, the one that I think shows on the face of the record is that these six employees were discharged for two reasons. 
    They were ordered to work overtime and refused. 
    Second, they were told to report and give their reasons for their refusal which they refused to do. 
    The award in this case decided only that they were justified in refusing to give their reasons because the union representative wasn't present. 
    He expressly refused to pass on the right to discharge these men for refusal to work overtime. 
    My point is, as I put it in the brief, an employer fires an employee for murdering his foreman, burning down the plant, and wearing a red tie. 
    And the arbitrator decides that wearing a red tie to work is not grounds for firing him. Consequently, he needs not to decide whether murdering the foreman or burning down the plant were sufficient grounds.

    Your Honor, in the few cases that we had in the past, that was true partially. 
    It was not true in the situations where, for example, insurance contracts provided for arbitration of damages. 
    Those were executory agreements. 
    There is -- it isn't true on the other hand, the State of Texas after the arbitration agreement has been made between parties enforces it. 
    And here again, I'd like to say that counsel has howling before he's hurt. 
    There is, to my knowledge, no case in Texas to cause him heartburn over the Texas rule with reference to arbitration of labor disputes. 
    There's only one that ever got to the Supreme Court that I know about in the last ten years. 
    And there's certainly nothing in that case to cause him to worry and I think that we would be much better off here to criticize the Texas courts if we had to try this case on the merits and they had done something real bad.

    Under that very -- because of the fact that their court had been given -- the District Court had been given jurisdiction of that action. 
    Now, I don't mean to catch you all, but I'd like to carry the point a little further. 
    The provision there is not applicable to airlines specifically. 
    There is a provision with reference to the railroad adjustment board that's not applicable to airlines. 
    And I don't, for the life of [Inaudible], why the fact that they say that we're not subject to this one which says federal jurisdiction and we're not subject to that one, which says federal jurisdiction, you can construe that as mean -- they meant that we're to be subject to federal jurisdiction. 
    I don't -- it just seems to me that it indicates a pattern, but I'll go a little further and answer your question that I'm -- I hope that was going to be asked to counsel and that is, if it was an oversight, if it was a rank oversight, I don't think that gives District Court jurisdiction. 
    I don't think there is jurisdiction by oversight.

    Mr. Luther Hudson 
    The -- because of two reasons, Your Honor. 
    Factually, under the allegations in the complaint he says, “By contract, I have certain rights.” 
    But secondly, there are many instances where the man's rights are determined under federal law where it is exclusively state court jurisdiction. 
    The one that I know best is the Federal Employers Liability Act which is part of the Railway Labor Act. 
    It has a safety appliance provision in it. 
    Now, that same act says when an employee is injured, he has the right to go into either state or federal court. 
    But when a non-employee, when a passenger on a highway is injured or I mean a driver on a highway or passenger or someone working on the car is injured by a safety appliance defect, then it has to go into state court but there isn't any question but what that state court would be applying federal law to decide the rights of the parties. 
    There's another illustration that goes out of the same section and that is the three cases as I remember them. 
    There's the Moore case and the Caldwell, and the Slocum, in which this Court said that the same plaintiff, Mr. Cornstubble, has the option when he's fired. 
    He can file a grievance procedure or he can say, “I'm fired.” 
    And he can walk in to the State District Court and sue for wrongful discharge.

    No sir, these are not employees. 
    Now, if they were employees then the statute as I remember Section 52, says that, “An action to recover, maybe brought in either the state or federal court.” 
    There's a statute that specifically provides for concurrent jurisdiction. 
    And I want to say this that as counsel said yesterday, there were two lawsuits. 
    We filed one in the state court. 
    He filed one in the District Court. 
    He removed it and the Court held that the removal was wrong, at the same time they dismissed this one. 
    It's pending down there and I know no reason since it's rather obvious, since the Dowd and Lucas cases, that they would be at most concurrent jurisdictions that I can set that case down for trial. 
    I can set it down in April and try it, and we'll come up here, I don't -- through the state courts. 
    And I didn't -- I haven't thought of it until -- frankly, until I heard the counsel arguing yesterday, but I think maybe that's what I ought to do. 
    And then we'll find out how bad the state courts are. 
    We'll find out whether or not they -- they tried this case, they applied federal law. 
    We'll find out whether we tried it on something that didn't involved federal law. 
    We'll find out whether they correctly applied it. 
    And then we will have before this Court a fair sample of the treatment or the mistreatment that supported the airlines and their employees under the system board of adjustment award.

   Argument of Bernard Dunau

    Mr. Bernard Dunau 
    I think Mr. Justice Black that the case you were thinking of that you had written was Bell v. Hood. 
    We haven't cited in our brief, but it appears at 327 U.S. 678. 
    This action to enforce a system board award does not exist in limbo. 
    Some law must apply which says that this action is good or is no good. 
    That law, by everybody's concession is federal law. 
    There seems to us inescapable that once it is said that it is federal law which makes this action good, the case arises under a law regulating commerce or under a federal law. 
    If that is correct, then the general jurisdictional statutes give us a right to be in a Federal District Court. 
    It doesn't matter whether the airport or the Railway Labor Act omitted a specific conferment of jurisdiction by inadvertence or not. 
    Our question then would be not was there an inadvertent omission of jurisdiction as specific to confirm it either in the airport or the Railway Labor Act rather is there anything you can draw from the Railway Labor Act which would show an implied repeal of the general jurisdictional statutes. 
    And unless there is something in the airport or the Railway Labor Act to show an implied repeal, we are properly in a Federal District Court because Congress since 1875 has said, “If you have an action arising under a law, regulating commerce or under a federal law, you maybe in a Federal District Court.” 
    Now, let's illustrate it in this case by the very point Mr. Hudson says, he wants to make whenever he gets to a court to try this case on the merits. 
    He says that an arbitrator here made a mistake because as he concedes that there were two issues to be decided. 
    The arbitrator decided one issue and rendered a judgment based or rendered an award based solely on that one issue. 
    That award is therefore void because it didn't decide all the things that should have been decided. 
    The contract here says that the award shall be final, binding, and conclusive. 
    How far back a final, binding and conclusive responding can go to show error becomes a question of federal law, because it is federal law which will spell out whether our contract, when it says final, binding and conclusive means utter finality so that you cannot go back of it at all. 
    It means almost utter finality so you can go back off it, somewhat to show some basic prejudicial defect, like bias of the arbitrator or fraud, or it can go back a good deal further to show that there was not enough evidence to support the award, or it can go all the way back and redo the whole thing de novo. 
    But whether you give it utter finality or give it no finality at all, depends upon what the federal law is. 
    So it seems to us inescapable that what we have here is a question of federal law, a case arising under it. 
    We have a claim which must bring -- which must have support from some law and the only law we have is federal law. 
    Now, this is not a question of invidious comparison between state courts and federal courts as one better than the other. 
    Congress has said when it enacted the general jurisdictional statutes that for the enforcement of federal rights, you can go into a federal court. 
    Now, if there's any invidiousness in this field, it's because the general jurisdictional statutes have said they want -- the Congress wants two court systems at work here and we're not here saying we want to be in a federal court because we like federal courts better than state courts or we think state courts are worst than federal courts. 
    We are in a federal court because Congress says with this kind of a claim we can be in a federal court. 
    Now, in any specific case, the lawyer make -- may have a big mistake as to his choice are forum and not know until he's all through, that he has made a mistake, but obviously, one doesn't decide jurisdictional questions on that kind of an invidious basis.

    If we bring it in a state court or if the other party brings it in the state court, there can be a remand to a federal -- there can be a removal to a federal court, so in that sense there is a control over the forum if a party wants to be in any federal court.

    This is with regard to [Inaudible]
speaker="bernard_dunau" startTime="2859.060" stopTime="3058.568">
    Mr. Bernard Dunau 
    The statute doesn't say specifically when it confers jurisdiction on a Federal District Court to enforce an NRAB award that it's exclusively in the Federal District Court. 
    I read it that way, but I think it's open to argument that it may not be that way. 
    I read it that way because there are certain other perquisites to getting into a Federal District Court like attorney's fees that can be paid if you prevail, the cost of the suit are borne out of the appropriations of the United States Courts, these things may show that under the -- when you bring a suit in effect -- that the only place you can bring an NRAB suit to enforce an award is in a Federal District Court. 
    Now, what we say here is that if you want to distinguish between what you can do with the system board award and an NRAB award, the differentiation would be that for an NRAB award, you must go only into a federal court. 
    With a system board award, you may go either into a federal court or into a state court. 
    But the differentiation does not argue in favor of saying that the only place you can go with this kind of a suit is into a state court which is the argument that is made here by the respondent. 
    Now, I think I can illustrate this by two things which have already been adverted to and may profitability perhaps be repeated. 
    Now, the court below bases its view on two things. 
    It speculates that in 1936, state courts were hostile to the enforcement of an executory agreement to arbitrate, but favorable to the enforcement of an award once it is rendered. 
    Now, in Texas, it happens -- the law happens to be the common law rule that you can revoke in executory agreement to arbitrate at any time prior to actual submission. 
    Now, the Court says because the state courts were hospitable to the enforcement of an award, we imply that Congress was willing to have this whole system, at least with respect to the enforcement of an award, be committed exclusively to the state court system. 
    But you take that same speculation and the Court has been saying because the state courts are inhospitable to the enforcement of the executory agreements to arbitrate, well that kind of a suit you can get in to a Federal District Court. 
    That means if you carry it out, that I can sue Central Airlines to force them to go through arbitration and get into a Federal District Court to do that. 
    Having done that, if an award issues then the Federal District Court has no power to bring to fruition the very thing that it has the power to start, we can't cut this baby in half there. 
    If the Federal District Court has the power to enforce the executory agreement to arbitrate, it surely must have the power to carry through the process and enforce the award and the other part is the one that Mr. Justice Goldberg mentioned. 
    If a Federal District Court has the power, as we think it has, to enjoin a strike if a dispute is pending before an adjustment board, certainly it has the power having protected the process, then bring it to fruition by enforcing an award which eventually raises from that procedure.
