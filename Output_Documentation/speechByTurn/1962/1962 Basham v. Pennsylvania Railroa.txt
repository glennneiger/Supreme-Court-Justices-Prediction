    Number 512, James Basham versus Pennsylvania Railroad Company. 
    Mr. Gammerman.

    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    This is a Federal Employers' Liability Act case, which was tried initially in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Kings County before the court and jury. 
    The jury returns the verdict in favor of the petitioner in the amount of $15,000.On the respondent's motion the trial judge set that verdict aside and also granted respondent's motion to direct the verdict for the defendant, the Railroad. 
    An appeal was taken to the Intermediate Court of Appeals, the Appellate Division of the State of New York. 
    And that court affirmed the action of the trial judge by a vote of four to one. 
    A further appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals in Albany. 
    That court affirming the action of the trial court unanimously. 
    As I've mentioned this is a Federal Employers' Liability Act case. 
    The petitioner at the time of the accident was an employee of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the respondent. 
    The accident occurred in January of 1956. 
    The petitioner was working for the respondent as a car repairman helper in the respondent's Sunnyside Yard in New York City. 
    In those yards the respondent maintains wheel pits. 
    These are pits which are used by respondent's employees to remove old wheels from railroad cars and install new ones. 
    The pit itself is very similar to a grease pit underneath an automobile. 
    That is, if they cleared out the space between the running rails on which the railroad car sits so that the men can get down into the space from three or four feet and work beneath the car. 
    The wheels are replaced by moving the car over the pit and rolling underneath the car a movable hoist to a jack which is attached to a movable platform which rolls at the bottom of the pit. 
    The hoist is then raised to the level of the wheels. 
    The wheels are disconnected from the car, lowered to the bottom of the pit and rolled out. 
    The old wheels are replaced by new wheels which are again rolled underneath the car on this movable platform and raised by the hoist to the point at which they can be securely and firmly affixed to the railroad car. 
    It was the job of the petitioner to assist in this operation being performed that one of these three pits. 
    That his job at the time of the accident was to stand on this wooden movable platform and hold with both hands a rather heavy spring as the new wheels were being raised to be placed in position where they could be securely affixed to the car. 
    As he was doing this, the platform on which he was standing suddenly shifted or moved causing him to lose his balance.

    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    The petitioner put out his hand to regain his balance when the spring that he had formerly been holding jumped out and fell on his hand then he sustained the injuries. 
    I think it's important to the case and the issues to discuss just for a moment the apparatus that was being used. 
    Starting from the top and down there is the railroad car which sits on the rails which straddle this pit. 
    Extending down from the body of the car and attached to the car are two pedestals or a pedestal linings, I'll refer to them as pedestals. 
    These are U-shaped receptacles into which a portion of the wheel assembly which is being raised from the bottom of the pit fits.

    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    Yes. 
    Yes Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    They are shown in the plaintiff's Exhibit 1 on page 113. 
    That's a photograph of the wheel pit of the car and the pedestals, the pedestals are the U-shaped receptacles extending down from the body of the car. 
    This incidentally is a photograph taken after the wheels have been fully installed and secured, that is attached to the car.

    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    Well, it's a little -- it's somewhat difficult on that photograph to see it. 
    Perhaps you can see better on page 117, which is defendant's Exhibit B, which shows the receptacles at a point at which the wheels were being raised into the position to which they will be secured to the car. 
    You see that there's -- there are some chalk letters SS Smith on one side of the receptacle.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Go ahead.
speaker="ira_gammerman" startTime="334.160" stopTime="416.975">
    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    Now, into these receptacles as being raised, the wheel assembly, the wheel assembly consists of a -- an axle with two wheels, one wheel on each end. 
    And outside of each wheel is a journal box, which is a lubricating device. 
    That's the device that's apparent on page 113, on the outside of the wheels just above the rail on the photograph, plaintiff's Exhibit 1. 
    Now that wheel assembly is being raised by a lift. 
    The lift consists of a vertical member and a crossbar or tee at the ends of which are two V-shaped prongs into which the axle fits. 
    The crossbar is attached to the upright portion of the lift by a nut. 
    And there's motion at that point that is the bar on which the wheels rest can tip. 
    Now, as the wheels are being raised, the journal boxes, that is -- these lubricating boxes on the wheel assembly slipped into the receptacles and are raised further and further into the receptacles until they fit all the way up into the receptacles and it -- at that point, that the wheels are secured to the car.

    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    No. 
    There are -- there are certain facts which are not disputed. 
    There was a movable platform. 
    That is the platform on which the petitioner was standing was movable. 
    It could move some 11 feet in one direction and some three inches in another direction.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="446.086" stopTime="448.476">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That's what the pictures showed?
speaker="ira_gammerman" startTime="448.476" stopTime="460.675">
    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    The platform? 
    No. 
    I think the -- the only photograph that gives some sort of hint of it is on page 116, which shows the crossbar.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="460.675" stopTime="461.595">
    Unknown Speaker 
    On these bars?
speaker="ira_gammerman" startTime="461.595" stopTime="680.738">
    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    That's correct. 
    That crossbar goes down some three or four feet and is attached to a movable platform. 
    That's the platform that the petitioner was standing on at the time of the accident. 
    As I said, there's no dispute that there was motion at the point shown in defendant's Exhibit A on page 116 marked with the initial “N”. 
    That's the nut that attached to the crossbar to the upper right portion of the hoist. 
    It was -- there's no dispute that at the time of the accident the wheel assembly had been raised to a point where the journal boxes were partially inserted into these pedestals. 
    I believe there were in about one quarter of the way. 
    There's no dispute that they have not been fully raised and that the wheel assembly had not been as yet firmly secured to the railroad car. 
    And there's no dispute that there was some motion possible at the ends of the wheel assembly even after the journal boxes were inserted into the pedestals. 
    It's the extent of this motion that constitutes the issue of fact that was raised between the parties. 
    Now as I've said, the petitioner testified that as he was standing on the platform during this operation it suddenly shifted. 
    He also testified that there was motion both at the juncture of the upper right and the crossbar and motion at the ends of the axle when the journal boxes were inserted into the pedestals. 
    A mechanic, employed by the respondent some seven or eight years working in these pits, also testified. 
    And testified that at the time of the accident, he too saw the platform on which the petitioner was standing moved. 
    He testified that the motion was present at the two points that the petitioner testified to. 
    And he testified that because of this very situation, he himself at a safety meeting held before this accident had complained about this condition to the foreman, that is the railroad foreman. 
    And that in response to the complaint, a safety device in the form a hook-and-eye had been stalled in one of the three pits in the yard to hold the platform in position, but that no safety device or no clamp or hook-and- eye had been installed in this particular pit. 
    So the Railroad counted the testimony by producing one of its assistant foreman who testified as an expert but testified solely based on his experience, that is, he was not an engineer and brought no engineering background to his testimony. 
    He testified that in his experience, there was not this one to two inches of movement as testified by the petitioner at the point at which the journal boxes were inserted into the pedestals. 
    But that the movement was only a quarter of an inch. 
    And that therefore in his opinion, the movement was limited to a quarter of an inch at the platform level and that the platform could not move. 
    That's a -- disputed fact was raised with respect to the snugness of the pit, the snugness of the pit between the journal box and the pedestals. 
    The Railroad assistant foreman testified that the pit was quite snug indeed. 
    The petitioner and the mechanic testified that the pit was not quite as snug as testified by the railroad foreman, it was some one to two inches. 
    I submit that this was a disputed fact which was resolved by the jury in favor of the petitioner. 
    But the trial court however, resolved the dispute otherwise.

    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    The trial court -- and that's the only opinion, we have decisions of both the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals. 
    But the trial court obviously, if you -- on reading it's -- on reading it's opinion, resolved an issue of fact. 
    The -- and I think the trial court recognized that because when the respondent's attorney moved that the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, that's on page 54 of the record, there was a motion made to dismiss the complaint. 
    And the respondent's attorney argued to the trial court that the platform could not move because the journal box has been partially inserted into the pedestal. 
    The trial court stated, and I'm quoting, “I have witnesses who came here and said that it moved and could move. 
    Now, if you have expert testimony to the contrary, that may become an issue of fact.” 
    Well, the Railroad did have expert testimony to the contrary. 
    And that did become an issue of fact. 
    And I submit that that's all it was. 
    It resolved one way by the jury, the opposite way by the trial court. 
    The trial court was obviously evaluating the credibility of the witnesses here. 
    The opinion of the trial court deals at some length with a test -- a statement introduced by the respondent taken from the mechanic, that was the man in charge of the pit who said that the platform moved, he saw it moved, and that -- there was sufficient mobility or movability, or play, that is the pit was not as snug as the foreman had said it was. 
    And the trial court in characterizing the statement and I'm reading from the trial court's opinion, which is on page 124 of the record, stated, “Further, the testimony of the -- of petitioner's fellow employee”, that's the mechanic, “was directly contrary to his prior written statement given immediately after the accident in which he blamed the accident on petitioner's carelessness and exculpated the defendant railroad from any negligence.” 
    The trial court also in its opinion stated that the Railroad's evidence that the platform was immovable was not rebutted by petitioner when the fact was that petitioner testified specifically an answer to questions on a cross-examination by the Railroad counsel, that the platform was movable, that the journal boxes, when they fit into the pedestals, did not fit that snuggly, and that the mechanic had testified to the same effect. 
    The Appellate Division, although it wrote no opinion, published a decision and the decision picks up the language of the trial court and states that there was uncontroverted proof that the platform could not move. 
    I submit that the trial court and both the appellate courts were in effect weighing the credibility of evidence in doing what this Court has said in Lavender against Kurn, “Is an undue invasion of the province of the jury.” 
    The decision of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, which appears on page 15 of the petitioner's appendix, deals at considerable length with the so-called contradictory statement. 
    As a matter of fact, the statement is almost completely summarized in the Court of Appeals decision. 
    I've cited in my brief, the cases of this Court, dealing with this question, that is Lavender against Kurn, Wilkerson against McCarthy, the Rogers case, the Schulz case, and this Court within the last 30 days or so has decided at least two cases on this very point, the Gallick case and the Harrison case. 
    The Court has repeatedly held that the fact issues which are raised in this F.E.L.A cases are to be resolved by the jury, not by the trial court and not by the appellate courts. 
    Here, the trial court and the appellate courts weighed the testimony and resolved these fact issues in favor of the Railroad. 
    The jury came to the opposite conclusion and I submit that it's the jury's decision on these fact issues that should stand.

    The second is, assuming for the moment that it did move, was it reasonably foreseeable that the platform could move and would move in such a way as to cause a petitioner such as the one in this particular case, harmed? 
    And I point to the very reason of the decision of this Court in the Gallick case in which the Court held that reasonable foreseeability of harm is an essential ingredient of Federal Employers' Liability Act negligence.

speaker="david_j_mountan_jr" startTime="1191.435" stopTime="1310.983">
    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr. 
    No, I did not. 
    Not on that point Mr. Justice White. 
    Now, insofar as the first question is concerned, was there sufficient evidence? 
    As petitioner's counsel has pointed out, the petitioner, a car repairman helper in the employer, the respondent Railroad, was working with three other employees in the number three wheel pit of the respondent's Sunnyside Yard in Long Island City at approximately 2:15 a.m. on January 7, 1956, engaged in changing a pair of wheels on a passenger car. 
    At pages 114 to 120 of the record are printed photographs of the type of equipment involved in the operation which the petitioner and his fellow employees were engaged in. 
    The various photographs show various of the stages involved in the operation of changing a set of wheels. 
    And I might point out that the photographs themselves are, in my humble opinion, the most convincing evidence that we have in this case, that the platform did not in fact move. 
    I refer to plaintiff's Exhibit 2, which is printed at page 114 of the record. 
    This is a photograph which shows either the work completed or the work not having started except that the gate rail has been swung open to permit the wheels to be taken from the car.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    This of course has not been -- this is a photograph of another?
speaker="david_j_mountan_jr" startTime="1315.146" stopTime="1506.461">
    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr. 
    It's a similar car Mr. Justice Black. 
    It's the same type of car that was involved in this accident. 
    We can see both of the journal boxes in the petitioner's Exhibit 2. 
    We can see both of the helical springs which are on the truck of the car. 
    We can see the truck frame and the pedestal lining which lines the arch into which the journal box fits. 
    And in res -- in petitioner's Exhibit 2, we can see that the flanges on either side of the journal box on the outside of the truck are sliding along the pedestal lining and are in a position where the entire flange is alongside of the pedestal lining, and where the bottom of the flange is considerably above the bottom of the pedestal lining. 
    We can also see that the equalizer bar which -- on which both of the springs rest has fit into a groove on the top of the journal box itself. 
    Respondent's Exhibit A printed at page 116 of the record shows the type of hoist involved in the operation but before being raised to the axle of the wheels. 
    It will be seen in this photograph that the wheels over the hoist are still on the rails. 
    This photograph shows a portion of the piston. 
    And this piston admittedly, is physically and permanently attached to the platform. 
    It shows the crossbar with the prongs or forks at either end which fit on the axles of the wheels with the highest point of the forks farthest away from the center of the hoist. 
    It also shows the nut and bolt marked with an “N” by which the horizontal bar is attached to the cylinder portion of the air hoist. 
    The respondent concedes that with the platform in this position, it can move laterally from side to side. 
    The testimony of the petitioner's witness was that with the pair of wheels on the hoist it took four men to move the platform. 
    So that we can see it's not something which readily moves. 
    The wheel, the set of wheels weighs approximately 3100 pounds plus the weight of the platform and the hoist itself, the testimony was that it took four men to move it one way or the other. 
    Respondent --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1506.461" stopTime="1510.243">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Their testimony is to how far it could move on those circumstances?
speaker="david_j_mountan_jr" startTime="1510.243" stopTime="1925.939">
    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    It can move the -- pit itself was twenty-three feet in length. 
    The platform, I believe was twelve feet in length so that it was approximately eleven feet of movable distance, which is required in order to take the platform with the wheels out, put a crane down to take one set of wheels off, replace the wheels with the crane, and then move it back under the car so that the new set of wheels can be applied to the car. 
    In other words sir, the platform itself had to come out from underneath the car so that the wheels could be physical removed from the platform and a new set applied. 
    Respondent's Exhibit B, which is printed at the 117 of the record, and this shows a truck assembly with the type of journal box involved in this case. 
    The journal box has moved up into the pedestal lining and the position that was in shortly before the petitioner and its mechanic put the coil spring in the cup. 
    This photograph, respondent's Exhibit B, clearly shows the pedestal linings which line the sides of the arch of the truck. 
    We also see the grove at the top of the journal box into which the equalizer bar fits. 
    In this photograph, the journal box has not yet moved up to the position where the equalizer bar has fitted into the grove. 
    This photograph also shows the flanges of the journal box on the outside of the journal box. 
    There are similar flanges which slide along the pedestal lining, the same pedestal lining of the same truck on the other side of the same journal box, that is on the side of the journal box closest to the wheel itself. 
    This also shows the journal box fitted into the arch of the truck. 
    Exhibit B of course shows only the wheel and journal box on one side of the car. 
    There was a similar journal box with its flanges and similar pedestal linings on the other side of the car. 
    In other words we can only see two flanges on the outside of the car. 
    There are in fact four flanges for each journal box and two journal box for each set of wheels so that in fact we have eight flanges that are involved in moving this one set of wheels up into the pedestal lining. 
    Respondent's Exhibit C is a photograph printed at one -- page 118 of the record. 
    This shows the same equipment with the journal box now moved up further into the pedestal lining and with the equalizer bar now in the grove at the top of the journal box. 
    This was concededly the position of the equipment just at the time that the petitioner and his mechanic put this spring seat and that's the spring seat which is shown in respondent's Exhibit B printed at page 119 of the record, in the place designed for it on the equalizer bar and then inserted the coil spring into its position between the equalizer bar and the underside of the frame of the truck. 
    It will be noted that at this time and this is the time just before the helical spring was inserted into the cup. 
    The entire length of the flanges have moved up to a position along the pedestal linings where the bottom of the flanges are some distance from the bottom of the pedestal lining. 
    Respondent's Exhibit E is a photograph printed at page 120 of the record. 
    This photograph concededly shows a man holding the helical coil spring in approximately the same position as the petitioner claims to have been holding the helical spring at the time of this accident. 
    We can see that the spring seat is in position on the equalizer bar and the coil spring is in the cup on the underside of the frame and in the cup of the spring seat. 
    It is the contention of the petitioner that while he was holding the helical spring in the position shown in this photograph, respondent's Exhibit E, printed at page 120. 
    And while the air hoist was moving the set of wheels further up into the truck, he saw the platform move. 
    It is the respondent's position and has always been the respondent's position that this testimony is incredible. 
    This was at 2:15 in the morning. 
    The testimony was that there were lights shining down on the men working in this pit but that there were no lights at the bottom of the pit. 
    You will note in the photograph that in holding the helical spring, the man is directed towards the car and I say and it has been our position throughout that to say that this man saw the platform beneath him move is incredible. 
    And it's interesting to note that neither the petitioner nor his mechanic at anytime said, “How much it moved? 
    In which way it moved, whether it moved up, down, sideways or whether it merely vibrated?” 
    All they testified to is movement. 
    And I say and it has been our position throughout that in the position that this equipment was in, the platform could not move.

    This -- the -- Harper was in a position and the record is not exactly clear as to just where he was. 
    He was at some place in the pit operating the apparatus to raise the piston and nearby the wheels into the position of -- in the car in which it was ultimately going to go. 
    And he also testified that he saw the platform moved or he said he saw the table move a little. 
    He also testified that he didn't know which way it moved or how much it moved. 
    The only thing we have is that there was movement. 
    Whether it was a vibratory motion, whether it was side to side motion, whether it was an up and down motion, there was nothing in the record to indicate.

speaker="david_j_mountan_jr" startTime="1984.489" stopTime="2041.182">
    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr. 
    My theory is very simple one Mr. Justice Goldberg and that is this, following this accident, this -- the petitioner was interrogated by his gang foreman as to what happened. 
    And you will note that in defendant's Exhibit E, the man is holding the helical spring with two hands. 
    What I believe the petitioner was doing was holding the helical spring with his right hand and holding his left hand on the gate rail which is swung open and which is shown directly below the man. 
    And that -- when this -- a bar moved up, holding it with one hand, the testimony is that you cannot hold it properly with one hand, that you must hold it with two. 
    That as he was holding it with one hand, as it went up to go into the seat on the truck of the frame, it kicked out and that he was not able to hold it with one hand, and as a result of that it came out and struck him on the finger, on the hand which was resting on the gate rail.

    This was the ordinary way in which this was done. 
    It was the way it had been done for years. 
    That is holding it with both hands and that the man himself was the sole cause of this accident by failing to properly hold the -- and give his attention, his entire attention to holding this helical spring as this was being moved up into position.

    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr. 
    Well, my position Mr. Justice Black is two-fold. 
    First, we contend that there was no movement. 
    Now, if the jury found movement, this we believe would not be sufficient to establish responsibility on the respondent. 
    There must be movement and according to the recent pronouncement in the Gallick case, which reaffirmed previous opinions, there must be a reasonable foreseeability of harm.

    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr. 
    Reasonable foreseeability of harm? 
    Oh, very definitely, very definitely. 
    That's the second point to which I'm arguing before the court. 
    And I will -- I think I will be able to demonstrate that even assuming that there was movement, which I don't see how it was possible, even assuming there was, there was certainly no reasonable foreseeability that there would be movement. 
    My position is this that if we have testimony --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2197.300" stopTime="2202.799">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    No reason for foreseeability that there would be movement and no reasonable foreseeability that it would injure, which is (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr. 
    That would -- there would be harm, that there would be harm. 
    I believe that there must be two. 
    There must be a reasonable foreseeability of movement and reasonable foreseeability of such movement as would cause harm. 
    There are many times in the operation of a railroad when the railroad knows that there would be movement during a particular operation. 
    For example, in operating a train when the train operates there was movement. 
    But there must be an addition to that reasonable foreseeability that harm will result from such movement.

    Now it may have been and the record is completely devoid of any information on this. 
    I can merely assume that there was some particular reason for putting it in 2, and not for putting it in 3 and 1 because the -- Harper, who has petitioned as mechanic, testified that the complaint was made as to 2.

    That there -- that there was some motion, it's not -- there is no indication as to when this motion took place and as a result of his complaint which was denied by the way, as I said by the foreman, but as a result of his complaint, they put a hook-and-eye in wheel pit number 2. 
    The testimony further established that when they renewed the table in this same pit, pit number 2, they did not replace the eye on the -- on the table. 
    So that this became in disused and the evidence firmly established that when these pits were designed, there was nothing in the design of the pits that -- for any hook-and-eye. 
    And I think that if I may Mr. Chief Justice point out, that a hook-and-eye from its very nature would permit some motion, however slight, otherwise you would never be able to get a hook into the eye. 
    So that the hook-and-eye which was used was not designed to act in such a way that there could be no motion of any kind. 
    The testimony of Mr. Brunner was that it was put in so that when the men came to work, the pit -- the table would be in position for them to do their work.

    Well, the two men, the mechanic and the petitioner put it into the seat. 
    You see it fits into a seat on the equalizer bar. 
    Once it's in that seat, then the petitioner, who was the helper holds it while the mechanic goes and lifts this whole apparatus so that it now puts tension on the spring.

    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr. 
    You will see that the wheel as it comes up goes against a brake shoe and that when it goes against the brake shoe and the apparatus there, there is some pressure put on this coil spring and that is the reason why the men has to hold it with both hands so that it stays in place.

    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr.

    And he says it hit him because the thing moved. 
    You say that there's no reasonable foreseeability on the part of the rail -- that the railroad couldn't reasonably foresee that if it did move, precisely as he said it did, and all the evidence showed it that you would still say that it couldn't have been foreseen that the men might get hurt.

    Now, let's assume that is the (Inaudible) -- at the time that -- just before it happened, there was a movement of this other thing like they said, a sudden movement. 
    The man was there holding and it was a 109-pound operator -- operation. 
    Do you say that the railroad couldn't have reasonably foreseen if it left that thing there, subject, it was movable, it was moving, might move and knew that the man would be working on that heavy thing at that time, that they couldn't reasonably foreseen that the man might get hurt?

    Mr. David J. Mountan, Jr. 
    Well, I understand Mr. Justice Black.

    Certainly, the court would not accept my testimony to that effect even though it is some evidence. 
    And we must see what type of movement could possibly occur as to see whether or not this type of harm or any harm was foreseeable.

    You can see that he is pressed right up against both the spring and against the flange that comes out there to the extent that it either pulls his -- his coach sleeve up or he's going down and would he be inclined to hold that 109-pound spring in that -- in that place and leave his left hand disengaged?

    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    Well, I don't want to labor this point about the 12 juror. 
    I tried the case, and I spoke to the jury, and the juror who voted for the defendant told me that he wanted to award 10,000 instead of 15,000. 
    In answer to the point Mr. Mountan discussed with you Mr. Chief Justice, the evidence was that the petitioner was not an inexperienced workman. 
    He had done this work --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3090.641" stopTime="3091.293">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I didn't quite understand --
speaker="ira_gammerman" startTime="3091.293" stopTime="3219.602">
    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    The evidence was that the petitioner was not an inexperienced workman. 
    He had done this type of work holding this spring in position on many, many occasions prior to the night of the accident. 
    With respect to the question of foreseeability, there was evidence in the record, specific testimony that a complaint had been made and the complaint had been made not about another pit or not about this pit but about the pits in general. 
    The question was asked of the mechanic whether or not he has made a complaint at a safety meeting. 
    He said he has and he complained that the platform moved. 
    He happened to be working at another pit and incidentally the record indicates that the pits were all alike. 
    He happened to be working in another pit at the time he made the complaint and it was in that pit that the safety device was installed. 
    Perhaps, if he had been working in this pit, the safe -- when the complaint was made, the safety device hadn't -- wouldn't have been installed in this pit. 
    The pits were one right next to the other on three adjacent tracks. 
    The question of whether or not the platform could move really depends on the distance between the flanges and this pedestal. 
    That is how tightly does the flange gripped the pedestal. 
    The photographs that Mr. Mountan discussed show the outside of the flange against the pedestal. 
    There is nothing in the photograph which indicates whether or not there was a quarter of an inch between the flanges and the pedestals or two inches between the flanges and the pedestal. 
    The respondent's foreman or the assistant foreman who testified said that it gripped it so that there was only a quarter of an inch. 
    The petitioner and the mechanics said that it didn't grip it that tightly at all. 
    That there was about two inches and that the whole thing was not secured until it was raised up to the point where the wheels were attached to the car. 
    And then it was secured, and at that point there couldn't be any movement. 
    But it's not disputed that at this point, during this stage in the operation the wheels were not secured to the car and that the only thing that was limiting movement was these pedestals around the flange.

    Mr. Ira Gammerman 
    Well, this is again arguing to the jury but I argue to the jury that you had an imbalance in pressure. 
    There was evidence that the fact that the wheels when they raised -- would raised at an unequal rate so that the wheels on one side were raising or could raise at a speed higher than the wheels on the other side. 
    That is -- that was the significance of that tipping in the crossbar. 
    When the wheels were raised -- if the wheel on one side make some resistance, there will be a considerable pressure to the wheel on the other side to move up suddenly. 
    And when the wheel on the other side moved up suddenly, the platform would shift a little bit to equalize that imbalance between the wheels, and that was what caused the -- that was -- nobody knows precisely what caused the platform to move. 
    That's what I argued to the jury and that's what the jury obviously accepted. 
    The facts were all there to support that argument. 
    A complaint had been made about this dangerous condition and something had been done but unfortunately not in this particular pit.
