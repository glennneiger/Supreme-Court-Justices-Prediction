Brady v. Maryland
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="28.405">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    - 490, John L. Brady, petitioner versus Maryland. 
    Mr. Jamison, you may continue your argument.
speaker="thomas_w_jamison_iii" startTime="28.405" stopTime="140.716">
    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday before the recess, I had sought to establish two facts which I believe must be considered during the study of this case. 
    First of all, the statement of the confederate, Boblit, contains nothing, which would exculpate Brady from guilt of first-degree murder under the Maryland felony murder statute. 
    It merely contains the assertion or the admission that Boblit himself actually strangled the victim, but it places Brady at the scene of the crime as the man who knew Brooks, as the man who said, “We have got to kill Brooks,” as the man who said “We've have got to strangle Brooks.” 
    Secondly, the attorney representing John Brady determined before the trial even began that the real issue in the trial was not guilt or innocence, but penalty for murder in the first-degree. 
    In other words, he sought to persuade the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder without capital punishment. 
    Now, at the trial of the case, Brady took the stand and again Brady admitted as he had in his statements, which he had given to the police prior to his trial, he again admitted he had participated in the robbery, but denied he had actually committed the homicide. 
    In his --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Jamison what happens in Maryland if a man pleads guilty to the first-degree murder or doesn't that really happen?
speaker="thomas_w_jamison_iii" startTime="149.992" stopTime="163.456">
    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, if a man pleads guilty to first-degree murder then the court would have the option as to whether or not to sentence him to death or to sentence him to life imprisonment.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="163.456" stopTime="165.451">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And he doesn't get a jury trial on that punishment?
speaker="thomas_w_jamison_iii" startTime="165.451" stopTime="167.116">
    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    He would not have a jury trial.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="167.116" stopTime="170.129">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This is a function of a single judge, is that it?
speaker="thomas_w_jamison_iii" startTime="170.129" stopTime="224.969">
    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    That's correct Your Honor, it's merely a question of sentence. 
    The closing argument or at least the -- the closing argument to the jury by a counsel for Brady consisted of a confession of guilt of first-degree murder. 
    Now when Brady again went to court himself to testify at the post-conviction hearing before the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, he again admitted his guilt of first degree murder. 
    He admitted that he was there and he participated in the robbery. 
    He admitted the facts which constitute first-degree murder on the statute. 
    So --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="224.969" stopTime="241.558">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And also that the murder was committed at the time of the robbery, not later, is that correct, because I did notice some place along the line here where it was contended that the murder was detached from the robbery itself?
speaker="thomas_w_jamison_iii" startTime="241.558" stopTime="246.027">
    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    I believe Mr. Chief Justice that point was raised in Brady's appeal from his conviction.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="246.027" stopTime="250.567">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But not at the trial, I think you answered that yesterday?
speaker="thomas_w_jamison_iii" startTime="250.567" stopTime="261.159">
    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    I stand corrected Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Bamberger reminds me of Boblit's appeal that actually raised that point. 
    They were tried -- they were argued together, the two appeals were tried under one argument.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="261.159" stopTime="264.310">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I see and Brady did not raise it at all?
speaker="thomas_w_jamison_iii" startTime="264.310" stopTime="265.173">
    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    Apparently not Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="265.173" stopTime="266.636">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="thomas_w_jamison_iii" startTime="266.636" stopTime="334.592">
    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    But at any rate this point was brought up at the post-conviction hearing. 
    Now throughout the other proceedings in this case, it had never been controverted that Brady has always admitted his presence at the trial -- at the robbery and his participation in the robbery and I think it is also important to remember that there was a judicial confession in effect at his trial when Brady admitted his presence and his participation. 
    Now, in view of these facts and the fact that the Court of Appeals in its opinion states that nothing in -- well, this withheld confession this appears on page 52 of the record, nothing in it could have reduced the appellant Brady's offense below murder in the first degree.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="334.592" stopTime="359.744">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May, I ask you just one more thing before you get into another phase of the case? 
    On page 26, item 25 that we talked about yesterday somewhat, would you mind telling me when that statement was made by counsel for the defendant and in want context please?
speaker="thomas_w_jamison_iii" startTime="359.744" stopTime="484.461">
    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    It was made prior to the trial at a conference in the judge's chambers with counsel for a coconspirator or the confederate and they were discussing various aspects such as we have a jury trial, which defendant will be tried first and so forth and at that time, Counsel for Brady said that his trial would be limited to penalty for murder in the first-degree. 
    Now, in Maryland, the Constitution provides that the jury is the judge of the law as well as the facts. 
    This provision has been in the Constitution of Maryland at least since 1867 I think and to my knowledge has never been applied in exactly the way it is sought to be applied in this case, but the Court of Appeals of Maryland in a recent case, Giles versus State said this. 
    “It is the duty of a jury to decide a case according to the established rules of law.” 
    In all frankness, I must admit that this statement was made from the other side of the coin, dealing the duty of the jury from the standpoint of the defendant other than the standpoint of the State, but I respectfully submit that the duty of the jury is the same whether it acquits the defendant or convicts him, it is nevertheless the duty of a jury to decide the case according to the established rules of the law, in spite of this constitutional provision. 
    Otherwise, we would have nothing but chaos.

    What I'm saying though is that although the jury has the right to decide the law, they have the duty to decide the law according to their conscience, according to reason, according to their best efforts and not according to some whim or fancy. 
    They have the same duty to decide the law as the trial judge would have to interpret the law according to their best ability and not to ignore the law, or disregard the law, or twist the law for some purpose or other.

    Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III 
    It is my opinion that it adds very little to the power of a jury or to the -- what it would ordinarily be the case in other jurisdictions. It maybe that when the constitutional prevision was enacted, the idea was to give a great scope of authority to the jury, but I believe that in view of the two recent cases, the Giles case and the Brady case, the Court of Appeals has indicated that it feels there was a very limited scope to this provision.

    That is exactly our position. 
    That no jury acting in good faith could possibly under the facts of this peculiar case, could possibly have rendered any verdict except guilty of first degree murder or not guilty of anything at all. 
    But since there was a judicial confession in Court by the defendant, the jury really could not bring in a verdict of not guilty. 
    However, the Court -- the trial judge was entitled at the trial to instruct the jury that they could bring in a verdict of guilty of first degree murder, guilty of first degree murder without capital punishment or not guilty. 
    On the facts of the record as it stands now however, in view of all the facts and the way in which the trial was conducted, it is our position that the defendant was not denied due process of law by being given a new trial on the issue of punishment only.

    If you go back on the question of punishment, then you were at the beginning of the trial and the reason I ask you that question is because of what occurred here on page 26 of the record and I think you were testifying at the time.

    Yes sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1510.955" stopTime="1624.315">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Who was present then sir. 
    It was Judge Michelson, Mr. Stowes, Mr. Turk, Mr. DeBoe and myself, I think that was all. 
    I don't think the assistant state's attorney was there all day. 
    What was discussed at that conference? 
    Answer: quite a number of things, what we wanted to go to trial, what day we wanted to go to trial, and how we elected trial. 
    And I recall I stated that in view of the fact that they took a jury trial, I wanted my mine first and that the case would be limited to penalty for murder in the first-degree. 
    Well, why would it be limited to that penalty sir? 
    Answer; because there was absolutely no justification or reasons, or rhythm, or rhyme for killing a man and both of them were at least engaged in robbery or larceny which is a felony and understanding of law if both of them involved in the felony. 
    And there was an objection to him explaining the law and it was overruled and the witness, the counsel went on and said and both of them were in fact committing a felony, they were charged each with a greater offense and one of them committing murder which everyone of them -- it was -- would be, would automatically charge the other one with murder. 
    And then I understand that Brady after that testified that he did participate in the robbery and the murder. 
    Now, how or in what respect will you injured if you in fact to have his punishment only determined in the light of that approach that was made at his original trial?
speaker="e_clinton_bamberger_jr" startTime="1624.315" stopTime="1673.627">
    Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I do not think we can consider this case as if the statement by Boblit, the withheld statement is the end of the evidence that we could discover or that the withheld statement is in itself the truth of what occurred. 
    The point is that this was a statement which was the fifth of five which was a statement made after four denials of having anything to do with the murder. 
    Now the man came so far in that statement, he still implicated Brady. 
    At this point all interrogation of him stops. 
    He was never again questioned by the police. 
    He was never questioned by counsel for this defendant, and the point is where would this have led to, I don't know, I don't know. 
    I mean the --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1673.627" stopTime="1680.340">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, the counsel apparently knew the facts at least as he got them from his client Brady --
speaker="e_clinton_bamberger_jr" startTime="1680.340" stopTime="1681.141">
    Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1681.141" stopTime="1695.242">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And he said that the only issue was the issue of punishment because his client had clearly committed first-degree murder under any reading of the facts.
speaker="e_clinton_bamberger_jr" startTime="1695.242" stopTime="1790.788">
    Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr. 
    But I can't reach into his mind, but I think that part of what he is saying there and this is my understanding of it is, that he had these arguments before the jury, he had the issue of both guilt and punishment, but on the question -- on the issue of guilt he had no evidence, no evidence outside of the denial by this man Brady himself. 
    And so he chose rather than to put both these issues to the jury, he made a tactic, he made a choice of strategy and he decided instead of putting both these issues to the jury and maybe angering them, because I don't have very much to say about this guilt thing, I am going spread the cards on the table and I am just going to go hard on this issue of mercy and on the question of the punishment. 
    But that's a choice that he made after he had been overreached by the state and as much as that is speculation, so I would have to speculate to say to you how the trial would have deferred, if before the trial began he had that fifth statement where the man -- you see at this point this is a statement made when the man knows that the other man is in custody and when he is told by the police that there are some discrepancies in what you said before and he comes -- he changes the story. 
    Now he doesn't change it so far as to exonerate this man, but where might further interrogation of him by the police led, where might it have led further interrogation and investigation and a testimony of the trial by counsel for Brady, this is speculation, I don't know.

    You could offer the man --
speaker="e_clinton_bamberger_jr" startTime="1864.790" stopTime="1974.116">
    Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr. 
    We could offer the man himself and maybe the use of that statement might lead to some other evidence which would be admissible and helpful and I don't know, but this is really the crux of our problem in this Court that there was an unconstitutional suppression or a withholding of evidence prior to a trial, and now we are only going to have half of that and we are going to have a different trial than anybody else would have and we are not going to have the trial of the Court of Appeals said we should have had. 
    They admitted that the first trial was unfair and we should have had another trial and then they -- I assure you that the Court of Appeals of Maryland as certain as I can be or any lawyer can be of what a court decides, never meant to decide in the Brady case that it was tacking on any additional limitation to the Maryland Constitutional Provision. 
    The best proof that I can say for that is that it was not discussed in briefs. 
    It was not discussed at oral arguments, and in the Giles case where they was a vigorous attack on this Maryland Constitutional Provision, it was held has violating the due process clause and as violating the equal protection clause. 
    The court went at great pains to cite the history of this constitutional provision and they cite the limitations which have been engrossed on it through the years. 
    And there is no mention of the Brady case, nor is there any mention of any additional limitation that the Brady case put upon this constitutional provision. 
    And the Giles case was decided in just last year 1962 and I -- there was no intention in the Brady case to change the law of Maryland that the jury has the right to judge the law in a criminal case.

    In what legal category according to your idea that the Supreme Court put its refusal to let this case be retried so that evidence could be offered on the merit.
speaker="e_clinton_bamberger_jr" startTime="1988.493" stopTime="2052.268">
    Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr. 
    The only category it seems to me Your Honor is that they said this comes by post-conviction and under the post-conviction statute we have a broad area of the remedy which we may apply. 
    I say this because in the opinion, Chief Judge Burns refers to that section of the post-conviction act, but he says also that he compares it with the rule of the court which in an ordinary criminal appeal gives it the same kind of a power to tailor the remedy. 
    Now I think the only category that I can put John Brady in is that he is placed in a category of a man whose constitutional rights have been denied by the suppression or withholding of evidence. 
    And who either wasn't smart enough to find it out until he had, the time for a direct appeal had expired or the state so cleverly hid it that he couldn't find it out until the time for direct appeal had expired and so he is forced to come up by the post-conviction remedy.

    Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr. 
    He was tried after. 
    This is when the -- his fifth statement was offered in evidence. 
    At his trial, his counsel objected, because he hadn’t signed it. 
    The trial court erroneously excluded it. 
    It was discovered by counsel for Brady later when a clemency petition was being prepared and this -- the reference to the statement in the record arouse some curiosity, that’s the first time that Brady or his counsel knew of the existence of it and this was to go back to the beginning of this argument. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, this conference in the Trial Court’s Chambers was -- at this point, Brady’s counsel made it perfectly clear to the state that the one defense that was being asserted that Brady wasn’t the man who actually did the killing. 
    Now, he could have argued with on that point with that evidence. 
    He could have argued to a jury that you ought to construe the felony murder statute that the man who actually pulls the trigger in the commission of the felony is the man who will get the death sentence, but the other man won’t. 
    And -- but he apparently made a choice that he didn’t have any evidence to support a strong argument on this, because he had only the testimony of Brady, and he might have made a far different choice, if he knew of the statement and he might have had for a stronger evidence and the statement alone, if he knew of it.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you recall Mr. Bamberger how this case was argued? 
    Did the counsel for Brady concede on the argument after Brady’s testimony that he had participated in the robbery? 
    Did he concede on the argument that Brady was guilty of first-degree murder, but that he should not receive the maximum penalty?

    Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, the argument was not transcribed. 
    The only reference to that is at the beginning of the Court’s instructions, where the Court says that -- and the Court feels that even though there has been a confession by counsel for the defendant that this traverser is guilty of murder on the first-degree without capital punishment. 
    I take it that at this point, having no evidence to support any argument, any strong argument that they ought to find the man guilty of something less than first-degree murder that counsel had in effect said to the jury, “I want a verdict of murder in the first-degree without capital punishment and we lay ourselves in your hands.” 
    I don’t know what he said.

    Let’s assume that the Court has -- you said the function of the jury in this man’s case in the State of Maryland that it has decided as a fact what these -- under Maryland law would be left to the jury to decide?

    Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr. 
    Well, I’d say it would violate the equal -- certainly the equal protection clause, because it sets this man aside in a different category and gives him a trial before a jury with his guilt already determined and just on the question of punishment. 
    And the only reason I can see to put him in that classification is, because he didn’t discover the overreaching by the state until after the time for a direct appeal had expired.

    Now in all the cases in which this Court has considered denials of due process I have not found any case where the Court segregated the conviction and the guilt or any part of the case, but have always said it vesicates the conviction. 
    And one very important consideration by this Court in doing that is, what are you encouraging law enforcement officers to do and I think that’s important in this case. 
    If this results stand then what’s to prohibit the prosecutor with perhaps not the most honorable motives to take the same kind of chance with evidence in a first-degree murder case knowing that --
