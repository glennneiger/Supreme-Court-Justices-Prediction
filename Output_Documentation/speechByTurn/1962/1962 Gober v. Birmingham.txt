    Number 67, F.L. Shuttlesworth et al., Petitioner, versus City of Birmingham. 
    I beg your pardon. 
    This is Number 66, James Gober et al. versus City of Birmingham. 
    Mrs. Motley.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The petitioners in this case are 10 Negro students attending Daniel Payne College in Birmingham, Alabama. 
    They are here pursuant to Title 28, United States Code Section 1257, seeking a reversal of their convictions for trespass after warning by the Alabama Court. 
    Now, relying on the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, these petitioners repeatedly find the law and assert here that their convictions are constitutionally void because they are the product of state action manifestly prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now all 10 petitioners were arrested on March 31st, 1960 following sit-in demonstrations in five Birmingham department stores. 
    They at that time were seeking food service at a lunch counter limited to white persons. 
    Each petitioner was charged and convicted of violating Section 1436 of the Birmingham Code, a trespass after warning statute which appears on page 2 of our brief. 
    There are five trials in these cases, one, petitioner was tried and then it was stipulated that the testimony as to that one petitioner would apply to his companion. 
    You see, two petitioners went into each of these five stores. 
    And they were first tried in the Recorder's Court of the City of Birmingham and convicted and then appealed to the Circuit Court, their convictions were -- they affirmed and affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Alabama which is the only court that wrote an opinion and certiorari in the Supreme Court of the State was denied. 
    Now the significant facts in all of these cases are relatively the same. 
    The first important fact is that Birmingham has a city ordinance which makes it unlawful to serve Negroes and whites in the same room. 
    That ordinance appears on page 2 of our brief. 
    Now this ordinance is a part of a massive state policy of racial segregation, is set forth in our brief the Alabama segregation statutes. 
    All of the petitioners of course are Negroes. 
    For one successfully sought service in department stores where Negroes are welcomed and served at all counters except the lunch counter where this ordinance requires that there be racial segregation. 
    Now, in every one of these cases, the petitioners were asked to leave the counter by some representative of the store in the sense that they were told that they could not be served there or we have a counter for Negroes on the fourth floor, in the basement once you go there. 
    Or in some instances, the counter was closed after the Negroes appeared and were told this and didn't leave. 
    Now, the police arrived and the police arrived in some instances when the people were still eating and the police arrived and not pursuant to a call from any member of the store in any case. 
    And this -- that the record is absolutely clear on that that no employee in any one of the five stores called the police. 
    Moreover --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Does the record show how the police got there? 
    Why they --

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes. 
    And every case, the officer testified that he was directed to go there either by a superior officer or by a call over the radio in his car from police headquarters.

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="287.707" stopTime="301.042">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    No, it doesn't. 
    But he testified that he was directed by a superior or a call from the police headquarters and every store employee testified that he or she did not call the police --

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="374.462" stopTime="435.190">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes sir, on page 24 of the record, the representative from Kress' Department Store was on the stand and he was asked what the petitioners have been told. 
    Answer, on page 24, he told them, “It would be against the law to serve them there”. 
    Then petitioners counsel asked him about this ordinance which I've just referred to and there was an objection by the respondent -- by the lawyer for the city and the judge sustained that, he said he didn't think the witness -- his knowledge of the law was material or anything like that and the counsel for the defendants here said, “This is the whole theory of our case”. 
    And the Court would not permit him to develop that theory of the case. 
    He said that, “We want to show”, as he says at the bottom, “It is our theory of this case, it is one, they simply on the city segregation ordinance”.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="435.190" stopTime="438.851">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Oh, I assume the -- I assume that such an ordinance would be unconstitutional.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="438.851" stopTime="439.462">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Oh, certainly.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="439.462" stopTime="455.996">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And a -- but and a -- is there anything -- is there -- there is some evidence in the record that this wasn't a dead letter of ordinance, it was just a -- hadn't been cleared from the books (Inaudible) but that it really had some teeth in it that it was a meaningful ordinance in this context at this time?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="455.996" stopTime="480.396">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, as I say that the Court was not -- have been to develop it but I think this case shows -- this record shows that this ordinance was what was being enforced because each police officer came in to the store and on the stand he was asked, “What did you see unusual as you came in to the store?” 
    And each one replied, “I saw two Negroes sitting on the couch”, and for him that was enough.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="480.396" stopTime="483.958">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Isn't -- this didn't have specific reference to the ordinance now --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="483.958" stopTime="515.172">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    No, he didn't refer to -- specifically to an ordinance but in one case, he said, “I arrested them under the authority of the City of Birmingham”. 
    But the police officer, he -- in most instances he spoke to no one as he came in. 
    In one case he said, “Mrs. Evans gave me the complaint”. 
    The petitioner said, they never saw Mrs. Evans until that -- she got to court, the Recorder's Court so that the testimony in each case says that the police officers went in and did not speak to any employee of the store --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="515.172" stopTime="524.319">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It doesn't simply get a reference to the ordinance as being a factor in the storeowner's decisions in any of the cases --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="524.319" stopTime="525.225">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, what I just read --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="525.225" stopTime="526.909">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Except that it's against the law.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="526.909" stopTime="527.493">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="527.493" stopTime="528.737">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But that's just in one case.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="528.737" stopTime="529.661">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="529.661" stopTime="531.432">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And there's nothing I gather in the other cases.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="531.432" stopTime="536.550">

    Justice Byron R. White 
    He was -- yes.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="538.133" stopTime="551.722">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    And then in another place, the lawyer for the petitioners wanted to bring out that these people would have been served if it hadn't been for the ordinance and the Court cuts that off.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes sir. 
    It's -- one on page 67 and one on page 168. 
    The Court said at this point in the middle of that page, “Is there any question before the Court now?” 
    And Mr. Hall, the lawyer for petitioner said, “If Your Honor pleases, we have asked Mr. Sterling (ph) about new various policy.” 
    The Court - “That is not competent”. 
    And then he took an exception.

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="594.341" stopTime="619.596">

    He -- they didn't say anything about that specific ruling. 
    They ignored all the evidence of the State policy -- the State ordinance. 
    And said, the owner here was exercising his right to choose his own customers. 
    As to the ordinance, they said it has not been pleaded and therefore they wouldn't pass on that but there is a statute in Alabama which requires the Court to take judicial notice of an ordinance.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="619.596" stopTime="622.126">

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, they said that it should have been pleaded that we should have by some pleading set forth that ordinance. 
    Well of course, I don't believe that's true because number one, you could take judicial notice of it, and number two, the petitioner said my whole defense is there. 
    And certainly, that was before the Court when it reviewed the case.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="644.487" stopTime="655.953">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How is the State in a position despite all that? 
    How was the State in a position to say that this is voluntary action of an owner when he'd be a criminal under that state law if he did?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="655.953" stopTime="689.596">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, of course they're not and I -- the Court in making its decision just ignored all of the evidence here that the police came in, that the storeowner did not call the police that even after the police arrived, the storeowners did not request the arrest. 
    And the officer was asked in every case, “Was an arrest requested?” 
    So it's clear I think that the State was acting in this case to enforce a state policy regardless of what the owner's policy might have been.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes.

    No evidence.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="706.930" stopTime="719.478">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, I think that in each of these cases, the petitioners were asked to leave the store by some representative of the store and in that sense, this evidence that they were asked to leave.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="719.478" stopTime="720.533">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I see.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="720.533" stopTime="778.708">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Now, as to the Garner case, what we say with reference to that is that this situation is like the opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan in Garner that here, the storeowners were apparently willing to endure this controversy. 
    They did not call the police. 
    When the police came, they didn't ask if they'd be arrested. 
    And so these petitioners were there demonstrating against the state's policy of enforcing segregation and they demonstrated in this manner by sitting themselves at the counter, quietly asking for service like anyone else who as white does. 
    And the owner apparently was willing to, as I say, endure this kind of controversy in this manner. 
    If he was not, he obviously would have called the police. 
    When the police arrived, he would have said I wanted them arrested. 
    And there's no question that they were peaceful. 
    There were only two in each store.

    It's very confusing. 
    I was not at the trial and the way I read it here this is what he was really doing.

   Argument of Watts E. Davis

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Davis.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1116.562" stopTime="1205.681">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    May it please the Court. 
    First, if I might clarify one or two items that have just gotten into this matter, we've been discussing here the unusual circumstances of the Court's ruling and I think simply it was a slip of the tongue. 
    You'll notice Mr. Hall and the judge have been discussing this matter from page 24 through 26. 
    And I think the judge forgot the frame of the court -- the form of the question of the objection at this point. 
    It was simply going along with the thing and overruling. 
    When he says overrule, I think he means the “overrule” is a general approach to this thing that you're getting into the surrounding or -- irrelevant matters. 
    But another thing that I want to mention before I go into what I had in mind, addressing the Court on is the propositions that counsel has said apparently they were willing to tolerate this condition. 
    And I believe in briefs, they mentioned the proposition of economic give and take. 
    And I might throw this question out for an answer if they desire to answer it. 
    Why would the storeowners have turned out the lights if they want them to sit there and tolerate this? 
    Why did they ask them to leave if they were willing to tolerate this? 
    Why did they say we cannot serve you here if they're willing to tolerate it?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1205.681" stopTime="1212.227">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, he just said immediately before, he cannot serve them there. 
    He told them it would be against the law to serve them.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1212.227" stopTime="1270.424">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    I would like to go back to that page 24, Mr. Justice Black, and follow that if we may of the language, the comptroller, both Pizitz -- I believe his name is Mr. Gotlinger who was testifying at the time and this was cross-examination. 
    And Mr. Hall is asking Mr. Gotlinger, what some other person said? 
    What Mr. Pizitz, Dick Pizitz, the assistant -- I believe the assistant of the president. 
    He said, “What did he tell them?” 
    He told them, “They couldn't serve there and we had facilities in the basement to serve them”. 
    He told them that it would be against the law to serve them there. 
    He told them it would be against the law to serve them there. 
    What law did he have in mind, do you know? 
    Answer - I don't know. 
    Question - He didn't say it was against the (Inaudible) policy to serve them there and this is the key. 
    He used the term we cannot serve you here. 
    Question - And you assumed that he meant it that it was against the law? 
    I assumed that.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How can anybody think in Birmingham just live there and knows it but Mr. Pizitz's store all these years didn't know that it was against the law to serve them together. 
    That may be legal. 
    You may have a right to do it legally but how could anybody be assumed not to know it when it was on the books and that -- when its been the practice since time immemorial.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1321.033" stopTime="1326.898">

speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1336.398" stopTime="1373.480">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, I think it goes back to the question of which comes first, the chicken or the egg.Wasn't that the custom existing at the time the ordinance went into effect so there was no occasion for any change. 
    But I would say this to his honor and I'm a little bit ashamed to admit it, I was only with the city attorney's office a few months when this case came up. 
    I didn't know there was such an ordinance on that book and I didn't think there was and when Mr. Hall got into this question, he'd been shooting constitutional objections in every direction. 
    I thought this was another one of these generalized objections that segregation was an issue. 
    He had no city code on his hand. 
    He was citing it --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1373.480" stopTime="1380.201">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1380.201" stopTime="1396.902">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, let's get back if I may to the basic question that I think is basic in this question -- in this whole controversy. 
    First, what were the issues in this case? 
    We filed a complaint charging one thing that they trespassed after warning. 
    They concede that in each case the evidence shows --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1396.902" stopTime="1397.624">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes, but it (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1397.624" stopTime="1397.936">

    -- that they didn't.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1397.936" stopTime="1405.545">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But they hadn't trespassed after warning. 
    They would've been -- if the man had not warned them, it could've been against the law from -- to go in there and sit there.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1405.545" stopTime="1411.241">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, we have a void ordinance which we concede is void. 
    I've never known of the thing -- a case yet --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1411.241" stopTime="1411.770">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, the merchant --

    -- before (Inaudible) come in.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1412.757" stopTime="1419.545">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    A merchant can't be put at the risk of having -- saying that maybe they'll hold it void for him to set up against the validation.

    I --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1419.823" stopTime="1440.094">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I personally do not see how in this case, it's possible to say for anybody to reach a conclusion in a matter of this importance that this merchant acted because he wanted to rather than because it was against the law. 
    As far as I'm concerned, I see no answer to that thing.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1440.094" stopTime="1441.439">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, I think there is --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, I see a great difference. 
    I don't misunderstand it. 
    I see a great difference for myself when a merchant deciding he doesn't want to sell to somebody. 
    I don't care what the ground is. 
    Deciding he won't sell them and not sell them. 
    And having a law that tells him he can't sell them and then say, “Well, because of his own choice he didn't sell them”.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1462.057" stopTime="1469.378">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, Mr. Justice Black, my answer to that is this. 
    You of course are familiar with the locality of Birmingham and --

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    You know that there's an abundance of attorneys down in the City of Birmingham and notwithstanding this whole expression you can't fight City Hall. 
    You know that many of them down there do fight City Hall and if they wanted to for a moment --

    No sir, but many others and if the merchant wanted to bring this thing ahead and see what their rights were, well I think it would've been very long ago. 
    But again, I think it goes back to the question that custom preceded the ordinance and the ordinance didn't bring on any occasion whereby they should change that custom but we concede that the ordinance was invalid --

speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1553.022" stopTime="1573.348">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Very definitely. 
    I think there are some factual differences certainly. 
    But as far as the law and the powers out of the constitution are concerned, we think private property is private property whether it's in your home, whether it's in your office or whether it's in a small store or big store. 
    But the prime question that I think is of importance for this case is, what were the issues?

    I suppose if you're right on that then what you do would be to use the constitution to drive the wedges of segregation deep into all of our society.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1584.274" stopTime="1594.685">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    No sir. 
    I construe the constitution as a limitation of power and not some affirmative instrument to use to do positive things but a limitation upon the states not to give anybody --

    But if you can use private property in this way and what you will do would be to use it to -- in a constitutional way to engraft segregation as the way it wanted.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, some people use the word segregation, some use the expression of racial discrimination. 
    I prefer the (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Yes, I further think that racial discrimination of a different sense, racial choice or racial selectivity. 
    I know that an Irish man prefer Irish man or at least I've heard that, I'm not Irish. 
    I know there's a Chinese community in our hometown.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="1634.785" stopTime="1640.976">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    But you get a different problem when you go to a judge and say, “Put this man in jail because he violated my prejudice”.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="1640.976" stopTime="1826.789">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    No sir. 
    I don't think its prejudice. 
    It's a personal taste. 
    I'm told by responsible neighbors, they have segregation among themselves in our city. 
    You say -- some people have feeling, I think that the Negroes don't prosper in the South. 
    Well, I can assure this Court in my hometown they have beautiful residential districts and I feel right ashamed when I see some of their Cadillac's, new ones and I have a 10-year-old automobile. 
    That's the rule and not the exception to the rule that I make to this Court. 
    But the issue we're getting out here is how was this case tried out in the state court? 
    To me, it was just another lawsuit. 
    We filed a complaint saying, “Well, you didn't leave when you were asked to”. 
    Trespass after warning, a simple city ordinance. 
    They came along and they filed a motion to strike the complaint. 
    Supreme Court decided authority and two cases have been in this Court, one is (Inaudible) versus Birmingham and the other, Taylor versus Birmingham. 
    A motion to strike in this type of action which is a quasi civil action does not serve the purpose to attack the validity or the sufficiency of the complaint. 
    They don't say that it does. 
    They -- haven't taken an issue with that proposition. 
    The motion to strike went out the window whether they come along with the next, to set demurs in this case. 
    The Court of Appeals in Alabama said two things, first, they were all general and we have a code section, this issue must file a specific demurs specified forth in the complaint you're objecting to and not be general. 
    The Court of Appeals said every one of those were general. 
    In addition to that, they raised certain constitutional objections, they said, “As applied to this defendant, this press -- this ordinance does so and so and so”. 
    Well, the Court said, “That was a speaking demurrer because it required evidence”. 
    It didn't appear on his face how it was going to affect a particular defendant. 
    They took evidence. 
    That was a speaking demurrer. 
    They haven't denied that that was -- or claimed that that was an erroneous ruling. 
    So what do we normally come to than a plea of general issue? 
    There they trespassed after warning. 
    Isn't that the only question we had in the trial court? 
    We're charged they did, they say, “We didn't.” 
    Now they come along and say all but the city was negative state action. 
    Under what theory are we required to make it if anything? 
    They drew the boundary lines in this dispute. 
    They didn't file a form or any special plea. 
    They brought up nothing of that nature that the Court could adjudicate. 
    This Court in Hill versus Mendenhall, about -- in 88 U.S., announced the fundamental question of pleadings, pleadings apprise the party on the Court of the facts and issue, the Court that it may declare the law in the parties that they may know what to meet by their proof. 
    And here, we're sitting here with the general issue to how they say, “Well, you can take judicial notice”. 
    They're asking the lower court to act as counsel. 
    When they say that -- judicial notice is not a substitute for pleading if I may (Voice Overlap) --

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2092.896" stopTime="2100.864">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I think that -- that's an essential element as that he did it himself, not because the State made it, I would think.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="2100.864" stopTime="2107.628">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, if that were the law that in every case and I'm not a prosecutor that you probably guess, I'm a land attorney --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="2108.014" stopTime="2195.934">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    -- in the City of Birmingham. 
    But I don't think the law places any burden on the prosecution to come along in negative every possible defense it may creep into a situation. 
    As I see this, this is a defensive matter and you'll notice in the discussion plea, Mr. Hall and the Court -- Mr. Hall says first, “That if the had not gone in to Pizitz's store and Mrs. Pizitz have not told them to get out the store”, and that's on page 24 and 25. 
    He says, “We wouldn't be here”. 
    And the Court says, “Well, is there any (Inaudible) between you and the city on this?” 
    In other words if Pizitz hadn't told them to get out, well, they wouldn't have been prosecuted and he says, “I don't know”. 
    Then the Court says this, “In the issue in this thing whether they trespassed after warning”. 
    And he said, “I think so Mr. Hall”, the petition for counsel -- counsel for petitioners. 
    Then the Court says one other thing, “Well, isn't that issue, isn't that the thing that you mean?” 
    And what did he say, “It certainly is Your Honor”. 
    So how could we be more doubly sure of what we're trying in this case? 
    What the issues were? 
    How we were to fix the boundary lines of the dispute and not only by the pleadings but by the admission of the counsel himself that the boundary lines are -- is -- has there been a trespass committed? 
    Isn't that the issue? 
    Isn't that the thing which is the main --?

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    It is beyond a reasonable doubt but may I say this at this point? 
    They have cited the Thompson versus Louisville case and of course the Garner case and we would like to join them in citing those two cases. 
    The rule that this Court enunciated and as I recall correctly in Garner was that the test is not the sufficiency of the evidence before the trial court but whether there was any evidence before the trial court. 
    They concede the evidence is positive in each case. 
    The employee of a store ordered them the premises. 
    So we have no issue there really.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2284.013" stopTime="2290.728">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Did the Court of Appeals get in considering the exclusion of the evidence that was excluded --
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="2290.728" stopTime="2442.911">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    No, it was not argued. 
    It's mentioned in the Court's opinion that they had five assignments of error which they must -- if they had to rely on them, assigned as error and argued. 
    The fifth, what it was, some question about evidence. 
    I believe it was in the evidence sufficed the prejudice, that's my recollection but it appears in each case, the assignment of errors. 
    But they didn't even argue that. 
    They didn't argue any question of evidence, whatever in the case. 
    They simply argued that demonstrations were -- that there were demonstrations, there were symbols of communications or symbols of something rather. 
    And if you know, the Court took off on one or two of those arguments. 
    But the only thing they argued before the Court of Appeals was the overruling of the -- and they didn't argue this, they've cited this error. 
    You're reeling a motion to strike complaint that emerged and they file this motion to exclude the evidence, a motion for new trial. 
    And that -- unless this motion excludes the evidence, may I say this, this question of state action gets into it. 
    If you'll notice, there are 8 grounds, grounds 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 say this if I may point out to the Court and invite your attention to them. 
    I think on page 6 you'll find the first one in the Gober case (Inauidble). 
    In five of those grounds, they say it's not the policy of the City of Birmingham or the State of Alabama. 
    They say it's the policy of the customer and the usage of (Inaudible) or whatever particular department store was involved that has deprived them of their Fourteenth Amendment yearns. 
    The other three grounds, they don't attribute to fall through -- direct in accusing things as to anyone but that simply was a confirmation as I view it and what the simple issue was in the trial court in the first place, did they or didn't they trespass after somebody told them to get off the premises. 
    And we had no other question and they didn't bring that up until they got to this Court. 
    But the local counsel, there were five of them who were experts in this matter. 
    You will notice that motion to exclude the evidence five times of the eight grounds they assert. 
    It says it was the policy of the store or the policy custom in usage of the store, or the custom or the preponderant number of department stores in the City of Birmingham that deprived them of their rights. 
    So we were not arguing any constitutional issues in this thing. 
    But since they brought them up, I think right here, the local counsels directs them to the policy of the stores themselves as confessed with the State and the city. 
    It fairly -- clearly answers the question.

    And then after the evidence was taken now we went to issue on that several question. 
    After the evidence was there and they come along and filed a motion to exclude the evidence never suggesting that the evidence was sufficient in any way. 
    They simply say the evidence shows that these stores were exercising these policies.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Thank you sir. 
    May it please the Court. 
    One other question which was injected into the controversy here and I say here because I respect to submit it was never injected under the controversy in the state courts. 
    Was this question a police action? 
    As I mentioned earlier in Alabama, you assigned to their appellate courts your errors that you wish the Court to consider. 
    Now the Supreme Court rules specifically state that if you don't assign them or don't argue them they won't consider those grounds. 
    But these acts considered -- are injected into the thing by appellate counsel and not by a local counsel in the state courts. 
    But it has been injected under the thing here which I don't think it's a proper forum for it without the Court having first had a chance to rule on it. 
    They bring up the question how the arrest were effectuated and brought about. 
    Again, I say that the plea was a simple general denial. 
    Had we known that this was one of the channels that they wanted to proceed on by the pleadings then we would have brought the police records to Court? 
    We could have mastered up the complaint records. 
    We could have looked for witnesses to say or to find out who made this report to the police. 
    The police didn't come there through some form of mesmerism. 
    Someone initiated this thing but it was not upon us to explain that situation under a simple general issue in this matter.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2679.850" stopTime="2687.299">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, we've had a good many of these sit-in cases where the police did initiate it and we had to reverse it for that reason.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="2687.299" stopTime="2688.192">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, I think that would be the problem, right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2688.192" stopTime="2690.031">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So, it is a mesmerism, that's a (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="2690.031" stopTime="2788.026">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    I think that would be a proper action. 
    But I think this that we've got to try the case within the framework of the pleadings. 
    We can't shoot mugshot in every direction and hope one will hit here and one will hit there. 
    Going back to your Hill versus Mendenhall case, the fundamental principle of pleadings is to define the issue so the Court may declare the law and the parties may know what to meet by their proof and agreement. 
    But in any event, the petitioners themselves, elicited from the officers who were testifying that for us who's in possessed, when the arresting officer arrived, he or his superior is talking with people in the store presumably witnesses who had seen this thing, getting information and they directed the arresting officer to make the arrest. 
    They brought it out also that in Laughlin's, one of the officers through cross-examination, one of his superior officers have been told that two of these volunteers have been told to leave and refused. 
    So it -- there was a duty on him to make an arrest. 
    An ordinance had been violated. 
    And in the case of (Inaudible) they -- I think as they have brought it out in the trial court, Mrs. Evans, the (Inaudible) manager told the officer she had told the two boys to leave and they refused and that in his presence she told them. 
    So in the presence of the officer, the offense was committed. 
    But I say again and I hope the Court would adhere to its rulings. 
    It has adopted in the past that these matters which are not before a state court will not come up here for a first hearing. 
    In other words, not let them come here to try the case.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, I would've said that, it would've been a very good false value -- it had Mr. Pizitz up there and testified to that and prior to that it could have pleaded to that effect and let the Court know that that was an issue in this case as well as the question did they or were they in fact ever told to leave and did in fact leave after they were told to. 
    Those were the two issues that were there. 
    They could have put the other issues in and in fact, I think it would have been advised to bring Mr. Pizitz to say, “Well, I want them to sit at the lunch counter. 
    I'd like to have them here.”

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    It said that after being warned, I think we have to assume it comes in our Code out of the chapter heading of trespass and of course trespass assumes that there is a proprietary address and I don't know how we could assume that the police officer had any proprietary interest.

    Except the ordinance itself does not require the warning to be by the owner.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="4138.412" stopTime="4152.260">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    I think by implication, you'd have to construe it that way and its context as a trespass ordinance. 
    Someone in possession or some agent, designee or a servant of the person in possession or at least Mr. Pizitz's greater -- must be greater than the customer who is directed to leave.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="4152.260" stopTime="4158.689">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    In other words, what you're saying here is that the ordinance doesn't say so but it would have to be construed that way.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="4158.689" stopTime="4159.917">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    I think he would have.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="4159.917" stopTime="4183.337">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    But wasn't the complaint here based upon the ordinance and the complaint itself also didn't say anything about the owner. 
    So isn't the non-guilty plea then putting an issue -- all that was put in an issue by the complaint?You refer to the complaint? 
    The complaint also doesn't say who did the warning but just says after being warned not to do so.
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="4183.337" stopTime="4185.206">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, that follow the language of the ordinance after --

    Yes.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    So from the standpoint of the pleadings going back to the point which we have been discussing, didn't the not guilty plea put an issue to everything that the complaint alleged.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    That's right sir, yes sir. 
    And if someone other than a person in authority had ordered them off, that would be an issue. 
    We must prove that they were warned and I think it goes without saying that a proprietary address must be involved in that person warning.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="4211.043" stopTime="4221.118">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Well, must you prove then that they were warned and in fact ordered off by the defendant and not by the State -- by the owner and not by the State?

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    No sir. 
    I think the evidence showed that these were employees which they concede. 
    They have never denied that. 
    They don't raise the issue to some stranger or some policeman ordered them off the premises. 
    And I don't think the officers could order them off. 
    They took the reports after talking with the people there.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I think the controlling consideration is whether the court below or the highest court of the State which could have rendered an opinion or did render an opinion, considered and disposed of the constitutional issues which we are here presenting to this Court. 
    And on page 61 of the record, the Court in the last paragraph of its opinion says, “Counsel has argued among other matters, various faces of constitutional law particularly as affected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution such as freedom of speech”, in regard to which counsel state, “What has become known as a sit-in is a different but well-understood symbol, meaningful method of communication”. 
    And the Court says, “Counsel has also referred to cases pertaining to restrictive covenants. 
    We consider such principles entirely inapplicable to the present case.” 
    And on page 60 of the record, they point out that they can consider in this type of proceeding because the civil rules govern on appeal, the matters raised and argued in the brief. 
    And so --

    That's right but then they -- as to that ordinance. 
    But then they went on to decide that this case was not governed by the restrictive covenant cases. 
    And the only reason we're assigning the ordinance was to show that there was state action and violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    But again, even if the ordinance were not involved here, we would still be properly before this Court on Shelley against Kraemer because there was this massive state policy of racial segregation which we say compel the owner to put these people out and the State cannot escape responsibility for that.

    There was in the record a stipulation that the rulings made in the first case would apply to all other cases and that appears on page 106 of the record and on page 122 of the record. 
    Not just the pleadings were to be the same but the rulings which he has made in the first case were the rulings in the other cases and that's why they didn't again raise that question as to the ordinance.

    122, 106 and 122. 
    And as I‘ve said before in closing, this ordinance was just a part of a massive state policy here of racial segregation and the owner was influenced and compelled by this policy to refuse service to these petitioners at this counter. 
    And the State bears full responsibility for the owner's exclusion where they specifically relied on the ordinance or not because here was a state policy which compelled them to exclude these people from the counter. 
    And we say that for this reason, the Fourteenth Amendment is clearly violated here and the State certainly cannot escape responsibility until such time as it takes affirmative action to change that policy such as has been done in other Northern states by the enactment of civil rights laws. 
    I think the influence of the states designed to set up a segregated society as what is controlling here.

    I didn't quite understand your last point. 
    You -- if the State of Alabama and all its municipality should repeal all statutes and ordinances which requires segregation, you'd still be making your arguments. 
    You'd say the State would have to go further and perhaps pass a suit -- pass a legislation requiring integration before you --
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="4833.840" stopTime="4845.636">

    Right.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="4845.989" stopTime="4880.068">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    -- we have a different situation. 
    But as long as the State's policy is there on the books, this is the thing which we say influences discrimination in a public place of this kind whether the statute or ordinance specifically says department store or drugstore or whatever the situation maybe that the State's policy is there. 
    And that's the operative consideration which makes the person exclude you. 
    And until the State chose some affirmative change in that policy, that influence is still there, we'd say.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right. 
    Alabama in this case has not required equal treatment of Negroes in places of public accommodations as this Court in deciding the civil rights cases assumed that the states would. 
    I remember the civil rights cases, they said, we assumed that the states would protect you against this. 
    Well, this isn't true in Alabama and these other states. 
    The States of course has done just the opposite and they have done it in a massive way so that the whole society is set up on a segregated basis. 
    And this influences the determination of businessman in the State. 
    And we say that the State in order to get away from or escape responsibility for this enforced segregation would have to do something more affirmative than it has now up to this point. 
    It does not protect us against the policy which it has set up.
