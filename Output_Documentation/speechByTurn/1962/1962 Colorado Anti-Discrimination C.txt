    Mr. Westfeldt, you may continue your argument.

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Immediately before the recess, you asked me to address myself to some comments of Mrs. Siegel. 
    Mrs. Siegel pointed out that the New York Commission had dealt, first of all, with many railroads and that is involving railroad employee. 
    On this particular point, it is pointed out on page 21 of our brief that there is a vast difference in the intensity of regulation of railroad employees and persons like flight crew personnel on interstate airlines. 
    And the Federal Government doesn't even provide a license for a railroad engineer or truck or bus driver, but obviously there's a vast degree of licensing, certification, checking, re-examining, things of that nature in regard to pilots. 
    Next, she --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="85.652" stopTime="98.739">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But you don't have -- for stewardess, you don't have to have a federal license, yet you say that you can't -- this Commission doesn't have jurisdiction over them?
speaker="patrick_m_westfeldt" startTime="98.739" stopTime="248.238">
    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    Mr. Chief Justice, on that point, when we get to the quest -- in the question of preemption, there is not only the subject of federal law coverage, but the next step bridged the gap whether it has to be exclusive. 
    I do believe that between different classes of employees, there may be different degrees of federal regulation and the hostess and the pilot do present an example of that. 
    Hostesses for example are not subject as pilots are under Section 609 of the Civil Aeronautics Act, to constant examination and reexamination and proficiency checks and qualification judgments by federal agencies. 
    And there, for example, might be a difference in an expression of a congressional intent and for that reason, I really -- I say this. 
    I say that the substantive coverage of federal law as embodied in 404 (b) of the Civil Aeronautics Act is sweeping and broad. 
    I think with respect to flight crew members and pilots particularly, and the hostess is not a flight crew member. 
    She rides on an airplane, but a flight crew member is defined in the Civil Aeronautics Regulation as including pilots and flight engineers. 
    This is a particular -- a particular group, but the evidence of an intent of Congress to establish in exclusivity, exclusive regulation with respect to pilots, I believe is much clear than with respect to any other position on an aircraft. 
    Next, Mrs. Siegel also pointed out that there had been conciliation and persuasion in the relationship between the New York Commission and various airlines, and pointed particularly to the hostess on mobile. 
    But I think it's also true that she indicated to this Court that these airlines had not gone to the court and I don't believe that she or I or anyone else knows of any court case which has upheld an order of a state anti-discrimination requiring affirmatively an airline to hire a pilot. 
    I don't believe that such a decision exists.

    No, Mr. Justice Clark, there is a mail pay subsidy but that is different from just a straight fee for compensation for mail. 
    And --

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    It depends on airlines?
speaker="patrick_m_westfeldt" startTime="433.826" stopTime="607.759">
    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    It depends on the airline. 
    I think the smaller feeders may still have mail pay subsidies. 
    Continental is a small trunk. 
    It doesn't have a mail pay subsidy but it is compensated for carrying mail. 
    I think that -- I want to touch briefly also on the subject of the Railway Labor Act. 
    And I particularly want to touch on that because I believe the decisions of this Court and the Courts of Appeals that have followed it also provide federal substantive law coverage. 
    The subjects covered in the Railway Labor Act, they're not only collective bargaining, normal labor relations problems, but the general area is described as rates to pay rules in working conditions, that must be kept in mind because we all know the broad inclusive character of that phrase. 
    Now, the very -- the Colorado Act that we're dealing with here doesn't go just to the subject of hiring. 
    It goes beyond hiring and it goes throughout the whole ambit of the employer-employee relationship. 
    And that it covers hiring, promotion, demotion, discharge, compensation, all of which fall, I submit, within the clear meaning of rates, payrolls and working conditions. 
    Now, in Howard, this Court on remand to the District Court ordered that the employer, the railroad as well as the union be enjoined for -- from participating with the union in racial discrimination against Negro employees who were represented by still a second union. 
    Then, there are two Fifth Circuit cases that follow Howard, one of which is the Central Georgia Railroad, decided 1956 in 229 F.2d and cert was denied by this Court in 352 U.S. 
    There again, the Court of Appeals barred an employer from discriminating in concert with a union and it held the employer liable. 
    Now that case -- the District Court's order which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and which was discussed at great length in the dissenting opinion in the Fifth Circuit opinion held the employer liable in damages to the Negro employees against whom this discriminated -- discrimination have been exercised. 
    And also ordered an affirmative injunction to open up the jobs to the employees against whom the discrimination had been practiced.

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    No, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    I have absolutely none. 
    And I say that in principle and I don't think it can really seriously be argued here, one cannot say that a Railway Laborer Act employer can't discriminate against employees in concert with the union, but can discriminate against such employees unilaterally. 
    That doesn't -- that doesn't fit the logic of the Howard rule, the logic of it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="655.968" stopTime="669.490">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It doesn't fit the logic of anything, I agree with you, but the point is that in the second case, when there's just unilateral discrimination, perhaps the Railway Labor Act is not in -- is not applicable?
speaker="patrick_m_westfeldt" startTime="669.490" stopTime="796.179">
    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    Well, I would like to address myself to that point and in a case immediately following the Central of Georgia by the same Circuit; it's Richardson against the Texas and New Orleans Railroad in 242 F.2d. 
    In that particular case, the Court analyzed the reason for the rule. 
    They said that you have to read the contract as if the illegal clause isn't in it. 
    And it says then, the employer is the one who is discriminating. 
    And then it went a little bit further and said that it would be absolutely impossible to enforce the Howard rule unless a commensurate duty were placed upon the employer and I think that's correct. 
    The rationale behind it is that a Railway Labor Act employer, an airline or a railroad or whoever it may be is a federally sponsored industry and it exists by virtue of its certification. 
    It exists and operates under a multitude of detailed federal regulation and of -- an employer in that sense acts as an instrumentality of the Government and can't engage in such discrimination. 
    However, that's my view of it and I think that even the Railway Labor Act -- there are more examples. 
    Railway Labor Act provides for settlement of grievances by binding arbitration, by a system board of adjustments in the case of airlines. 
    All the questions relating to promotion or demotion or discharge or any implementation, their application of collective bargaining agreement for example are covered under the grievance procedure. 
    Now these are the very same Acts -- incidents of the employment relationship that purports to be covered by the Colorado law.

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    Well, I would think, Mr. Justice Goldberg, that that particular thing, this Court would require such an action to be brought under the Railway Labor Act, because of the specific relationship to unions and union organization in collective bargaining in the Railway Labor Act. 
    And I think that that would be the appropriate -- the appropriate Act to apply in that case, but I'll contend further and I believe it's true that the Railway Labor Act does not only start becoming operative after a man has been employed. 
    It actually has some specific pre-employment provisions. 
    One is the prohibition on the yellow-dog contract. 
    The other is the situation that you just alluded to and that would be any union discrimination in employment. 
    Then labor contracts can require an employer to hire more employees rather than contract out work. 
    In other words, my theory is that the impact of the Railway Labor Act, developing substantive federal law coverage of the type of discrimination complained of in this case, that we have large bodies of federal law that actually cover the subject.

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    Mr. Justice White, I will agree that under the Fourteenth Amendment case of Brown against Board of Education, so no state could enact a legal segregation law today whether relating to schools or employment or anything of that nature. 
    And if the Colorado Act were that way, I'm quite sure that the petitioner would be asserting this pervasive federal regulation and preemption. 
    However, the Colorado Law is not that way and we can assume that the policies and purposes of the federal laws and all of the state laws are the same. 
    They're anti-discrimination laws and the policy is anti-discrimination, but identity of policy and identity of purpose doesn't mean that the same results are going to be reached. 
    If you have an anti-discrimination case, you have a case where a Commission or a court is going to have to weigh the facts and make the decision, use its judgment, use its discretion in areas of that kind with all of the different tribunals that would be available, different results would occur. 
    And it's for that reason that I think we bridge the gap between substantive federal law coverage and preemption.

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    The comparable situation -- I think if you follow the Lucas Flour case and the Dowd case and -- and Dowd, what that would mean is that an employee claiming discrimination could sue in the state court for violation of 404 (b) or the Railway Labor Act. 
    He couldn't sue in the state court for violation of the State Anti-Discrimination Act. 
    This is the way I understand the Evening News and those cases because those cases specifically provide that even though the suit's brought in state court you're talking about a body of federal labor law and we say that the federal law on this subject must occur if it's not different. 
    Airlines will be treated differently just depending on where they happen to have their employment office or one airline might be treated differently from state to state. 
    We think that the federal regulation is so pervasive that it indicates the congressional intent to have uniform application in relation to discrimination against pilots and this is the way we bridge the gap. 
    The examples are many fold. 
    This Court has found that in the Campbell against Husky case, the Tobacco case, this Court has found that in the Pennsylvania Nelson case that Mr. Justice Harlan mentioned. 
    Now there, there was a particular national interest and compatible state and federal policy. 
    We say the same thing is true here. 
    The congressional legislation, the pervasiveness -- the pervasiveness of the regulation, and particularly regulation of pilots which goes right down to checking and reexamination and everything of that nature spelled out in the statute and the regulation. 
    We have compatible policies against discrimination and if it is permitted here, if 20 or 25 states are permitted to rule on this subject by all 50 can and with that number of tribunals and an equal number of diverse procedures, I think it's the rule of -- the intent or court order, the decisions of this Court. 
    That the same kind of inconsistent and conflicting results can be reached as if there were an actual substantive conflict in the laws.

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    Then in the Zook case there were just two comparable local laws and I believe that the opinion of the Court there indicates that the decision of this Court might have been different if there had been a multitude of state laws. 
    And so, I do believe that the multitude of state laws and the diversity of state laws is the kind of thing that would prevent, prevent uniform application of federal law, either presumed intent of Congress or actual intent of Congress, I think that when you compare the Civil Aeronautics Act and the Railway Labor Act, the Civil Aeronautics Act there is much more specific and sweeping on a -- as an anti-discrimination provision. 
    But I think the Railway Labor Act has been construed and properly construed that an employer sponsored by the Federal Government cannot participate in racial discrimination. 
    And it is true that the pervasiveness of the regulation, what I say is the need for uniformity which is accented by the multitude of tribunals gives rise to my argument that there is preemption here. 
    I think the same thing is -- it follows on the burden argument that we make.

    I forgot -- forgotten the style of it right now, but in Garmin the prohibition bringing an unfair labor practice case in a state court and all of those laws were compatible. 
    The New York law was called the Little Wagner Act and there's just preemption there because you got to have -- and I think it also should be -- I should emphasize that there -- the congressional regulation indicates a tremendous, intensive national interest, federal interest in aviation, in aviation operations, not only as respective crew members but all of the other safety questions, the use of airways, traffic control, you can't operate the aircraft without federally certificated personnel according to federal commands and directions.

    Furthermore, the ICC has been aware since 1887 that that clause did apply to this race relation question that is desegregation of white and Negro passengers.

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    I have no idea, Mr. Justice Goldberg. 
    I have no idea whatsoever. 
    I'm sure that we at Continental Air Lines were faced with the new field when this case came up and we've been working on it rather steadily for several years now, and this is our conclusion as to what the law is. 
    I would like to go one step further with the point that you're making, Your Honor. 
    There have been many cases where agency's activities and powers have remained dormant. 
    I think an interesting case in this field is Boynton. 
    That was the one where the bus terminal was an integral part of the bus transportation system. 
    The restaurant in the terminal was operated by a lessee, an independent contractor not operated by the Trailways Bus Company. 
    And the Interstate Commerce Commission took the view that that they didn't think they had the authority. 
    They disclaimed authority to regulate these lessee restaurant operators. 
    But this Court held that that was a violation of the Act and within a year after this Court's decision, the ICC then adopted a new set of regulations specifically to cover it. 
    So here was an area of dormancy for many years. 
    The administrative agency was told by this Court that by gosh! 
    This is within the scope of your authority and they passed the -- adopted the regulation and implemented it. 
    In the very recent case decided by this Court, the Pan American-Grace case. 
    I believe there the CAB disclaimed authority on the particular issue before the Court. 
    But if the Court -- where the Court concluded that this was specifically within the authority of the CAB, the dormant exercise of that authority was of no moment. 
    So, I don't really think that the question of dormancy should change the issue when this changed the result of this case.

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    Perhaps, it maybe some other issue like that -- I don't know but the breadth of it is the scope of the language is very great and I argue that this is the way it should be. 
    We are regulated by the Federal Government from top to bottom and we deal with the agencies regularly, their control or familiar with their procedures. 
    They would establish uniform rules there and uniform practices just like they have on all of the other matters. 
    These, the agencies that are familiar with airlines, with pilot qualifications, with issues such as could come up in a case before them. 
    The likelihood of uniform result is so much more great in the case of preemption than use of the federal agencies than it is by use of multiple state agencies that I think it's very significant. 
    The only other area that I really haven't touched on in any detail is the question of burden. 
    This is another part of their argument. 
    The Colorado Supreme Court relied on the Morgan case and the old Hall case, Hall against DeCuir. 
    I think that those cases stand for the proposition that where uniformity is necessary as we contend it is, the state laws cannot move in to that field of commerce because of -- this isn't the area that permits the diverse regulation. 
    Now, everything I've said about the need for uniformity in connection with my argument on preemption goes right to the same need for uniformity and the argument on burden. 
    I don't think that Hall can just be dismissed because Brown avoided it against Board of Education. 
    Hall still expresses the same rule if that happened to be the reconstruction act in Louisiana that required comingling of passengers on riverboats in that state. 
    Morgan was the later -- the Virginia segregation statute, both of them have been held by this Court to be an -- as an unconstitutional burdens on commerce. 
    The point has been made that this evidence is -- the evidence in this case, the record does not show the type of burden that was spent on, say in Southern Pacific against Arizona and Bibb against Navajo Freight Lines and an actual impediment involving a great deal of cost. 
    I think the Court should also recall the Morgan decision, that isn't the kind of burden that was found there. 
    The Court pointed out that the passengers had to order their movements on interstate travel. 
    There is no great impediment to the flow of travel there. 
    The discrimination certainly was unlawful but it was a burden on Commerce. 
    It wasn't another Fourteenth Amendment case. 
    I also want to point out that I don't think that there's any need for any more evidence on burden. 
    Earlier in my argument this morning, I did allude -- I did start discussing the fact that the Colorado Commission did make a determination of Green's qualification. 
    It made that determination that he was qualified, therefore the only discrimination is on account of race, but that is inherent in the Colorado Act. 
    A decision by the Commission on qualifications has to be made. 
    I think that really is all that need be said about. 
    I do not think it is possible to permit 28-30 Commissions around the state with persons unskilled in matters of aviation to determine qualifications of pilots. 
    Just for the sake of argument suppose the facts in this case were a little bit different, suppose Mr. Green instead of having 3000 hours had had 1000 hours. 
    Could they then still determine qualification? 
    All of the things that go into determination of qualification of pilots we think --

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    Mr. Chief Justice, they did in part and then they dismissed our conflicting judgment which arose at the time of the publicity that occurred. 
    At that time Continental had first decided that Green was qualified. 
    At the later date when the wide publicity occurred was when Continental took the position that he was therefore not qualified. 
    Now, so they made the decision in conflict with our judgment, the judgment is the judgment that was exercised in early August of 1957.

    Well, at that particular time, Mr. Justice Goldberg, he already had been admitted to the first trade of course, he was told that he was eligible and his name was held with the other eligible pilots for subject on employment. 
    And this appears in the record and this is in telephone conversation between Mr. Green and Mr. Bell. 
    My view on the burden argument is that the diverse state regulation involving these issues that can only be decided by an exercise of judgment in discretion of course is the burden.

    Mr. Justice Goldberg, that's determined, but that's determined under an Act.

    It doesn't -- isn't a blanket anti-discrimination. 
    It only prohibits an employer from discriminating persons otherwise qualified.

    Of course it's possible I suppose in legal theory for the person to be unqualified for a reason which might indirectly stem from his race but not because of his race. 
    So assuming that somebody who was a -- followed the tenants of the Black Muslims, who hated white people so badly that he was likely to get so infuriated that he might shoot one.

    Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt 
    My feeling on that is this that the initial -- that the judgment on -- whether to hire or not to hire, qualifications things of that kind must first reside with the carrier. 
    There's where the responsibility is. 
    That's the organization that performs the interstate transportation, it is the one that runs the risks, makes the games, things of that nature. 
    But if its judgment is going to be limited, it must be limited according to the intent of Congress and by one single federal agency, a single authority prescribing uniform regulations.

    This is true but we -- but then we're dealing with this high speed transportation industry with Commissions all over, and officials all over, 90 more Commissions, some of them are Board of Education Commissioner, or things of that nature and I do believe that these airlines, so regulated from top to bottom must be regulated in this field also by the Federal Government. 
    I think that a decision by a State Commission in conflict with the carrier's judgment that an employee is qualified is a direct intrusion into something that is very national in character and must be regulated.

   Argument of T. Raber Taylor
speaker="t_raber_taylor" startTime="3626.849" stopTime="3702.301">
    Mr. T. Raber Taylor 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it again please the Court. 
    I open by directing my remarks to the specific language of the Civil Aeronautics Act on the area of preemption. 
    A careful reading of the Act will lead us to the conclusion that the Congress of the United States has not occupied the field of the regulation of air carriers to the exclusions of the -- exclusion of the states. 
    Section 676 of the Act which was the original CAA Act, now 49 United States Code Section 1506, there was the reenactment of the Civil Aeronautics Act in 1958; this provision reads remedy is not exclusive. 
    Nothing contained in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3702.301" stopTime="3714.518">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But that language doesn't fit this case, does it, because the applicable federal statute was enacted in 1938 and at that time this Colorado remedy was not then existed?
speaker="t_raber_taylor" startTime="3714.518" stopTime="3729.503">
    Mr. T. Raber Taylor 
    The -- this was a reenactment in 1958, the Colorado Act or Discrimination Act is of 1957. 
    Now, I would say this, this language, the fact that it is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3729.503" stopTime="3733.885">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case arose prior to 1958, isn't it?

    Mr. T. Raber Taylor 
    This case --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or when did it?
speaker="t_raber_taylor" startTime="3736.732" stopTime="3758.043">
    Mr. T. Raber Taylor 
    The compliant was filed April 30th or no -- the application of Continental was filed on April 30th, 1957 and the hearing was during June of 1957. 
    The order of the Anti-Discrimination Commission was entered in December of 1958.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3758.043" stopTime="3769.454">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's a very small point, but I only suggest that the -- the Colorado remedy when the 1938 statute was enacted was not a then existing remedy.
speaker="t_raber_taylor" startTime="3769.454" stopTime="3814.341">
    Mr. T. Raber Taylor 
    That is correct. 
    I do think, however, that it is significant that when the CAA Act was reenacted into the Federal Aviation Authority in 1958, if there was any whisper that this Act was going to incorporate into the Federal Administration Authority Act, an anti-discrimination provision with regard to race and the employees, and let's say an FEPC law being incorporated into the Civil Aeronautics Act, we would have not had the outstanding approval of the Southern Senators of the United States.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3814.341" stopTime="3834.618">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose that could be said in the Interstate Commerce Act also which has been held to have required -- to have required complete non-discrimination based on races among passengers and that terminal facility, wouldn't the same inference --
speaker="t_raber_taylor" startTime="3834.618" stopTime="3835.098">
    Mr. T. Raber Taylor 
    I would say this --

speaker="t_raber_taylor" startTime="3837.806" stopTime="3859.924">
    Mr. T. Raber Taylor 
    Insofar as one has a desire to protect passengers, one would not have a desire if they have denied of some of our Southern brethren to give equal protection for all job opportunities throughout the airline industry. 
    I think --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3859.924" stopTime="3883.760">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is it fair -- is it fair to surmise Mr. Taylor that if they were no fair employment legislation in Colorado and if Continental Air Lines on its own [Inaudible] -- on its motion had for purely racial reasons turn down a completely qualified applicant for a pilot that you might not be arguing here that the federal law required them not to discriminate?

    Mr. T. Raber Taylor 
    That -- Your Honor, I --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3885.739" stopTime="3892.560">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I'm imagining a case that doesn't exist and maybe that's an unfair question but it occurs to me that you would have a pretty good case if you were here?
speaker="t_raber_taylor" startTime="3892.560" stopTime="4243.633">
    Mr. T. Raber Taylor 
    Well, under the Connelly decision, under the Railway Labor Act, there was -- might be a question of whether or not she'd want to fight all the way up to this Court via the federal courts to establish jurisdiction, but again, I don't think it is clear. 
    I think the prime purpose and thrust of the Railway Labor Act is certainly the collective bargaining is good or bad as it can be negotiated and under the CAB, the primary thrust is in relation to passengers and to traffic and to provide adequate service for that traffic. 
    I think the brief of the United States which has been filed in this Court does the best job in speaking to that point because they point out that federal laws will not likely be held to preempt an area against state legislation. 
    They also point out that it is never been held that the provisions of the CAB, Section 404 (b) and this is on page 39 of the brief of United States that it is never been held that these provisions were or are applicable to discrimination and employment. 
    Then, on page 41 they go into detail as to Section 404 (b) which is primarily concerned with transportation service. 
    Certainly, we do not have any legislative history to guide us, but we do know that the purpose of the Civil Aeronautics Act has been preoccupied with service either of the transporting of property or the transporting of passengers. 
    It is no surprise that it was applied for the protection of Ella Fitzgerald in the case when she was discriminated against and I think it's no surprise that California -- United States District Court in California has applied it when a coach passenger was discriminated against, but I don't think it has any application. 
    We are here concerned with whether or not the Civil Aeronautic Acts should be converted into a Fair Employment Practice Act. 
    I would take one moment to mention the Railway Labor Act and this Court on March 4th of this year passed on the scope of that Act in the case of the Brotherhood of Local Engineers and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, relying upon prior language of this Court in Terminal Association of St. Louis against Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. 
    To me, that language and the principles there enunciated would be determinative of any argument in this case as to the application of the Railway Labor Act. 
    But primarily, we're confronted with concurrence of jurisdiction even if there were jurisdiction under some federal law. 
    We do know that the most recent legislative history from the Congress of the United States and the consideration of a Fair Employment Practice Act is that they want to respect the jurisdiction of the State Commissions. 
    They want to make it clear that it is their intention to cooperate with the state and municipal agencies to eliminate and promote the -- and lessen the discrimination in employment. 
    We have had the question of whether or not flight crew personnel should stand in a favored position. 
    Certainly, the employees of the United States, the U.S. Civil Service employees who were engaged in the business of handling the mail and the postal railcars are much closer to being instrumentalities of the United States. 
    There, this Court made clear that there was jurisdiction in the State of New York and their Anti-Discrimination Commission to bar the union provision which excluded from the Railway Mail Association all colored people. 
    To me, especially after having an opportunity to read the briefs here, I feel that that issue is controlling. 
    Mr. Justice Harlan has inquired about the case of Pennsylvania against Nelson. 
    To me, I do believe that there is a concurrent jurisdiction which was given to the State of Colorado by the Enabling Act of 1875. 
    Certainly, we would all agree that sedition has a higher value in the hierarchy of our values than even race relation and yet in Pennsylvania against Nelson, this Court did find that there was concurrent jurisdiction.
