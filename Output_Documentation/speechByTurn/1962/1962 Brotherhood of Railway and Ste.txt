    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case arises from a number of employees of the Southern Railway, suing that Railway and its non-operating unions to enjoin the enforcement of a union-shop agreement entered into by the railroad and the unions. 
    The unions that was sued, the railroad and the union-shop agreements are the identical unions, railroad and agreement that were involved in Street -- in International Association of Machinists against the Street which this Court decided a year and a half ago.

    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    The AFL-CIO is asking you to reconsider Street, and I think you might well do so. 
    We have not asked the Court to reconsider Street because it is not necessary to do so. 
    The decision below, we say is inconsistent with Street, taking Street as it is. 
    Although, we concur with the AFL-CIO that the Court might well be considerate and state that no cause of action was shown in this case. 
    But taking Street as it is, the plaintiffs in this case have not shown a cause of action under the Street case and even if they had, the relief that was given them is inconsistent with the relief that this Court said could be given when there is a cause of action. 
    In fact, the relief given here is precisely the relief that this Court said could not be given.

speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="130.019" stopTime="134.784">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    Well, it is at least inconsistent. 
    It is in direct violation.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="134.784" stopTime="138.502">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The proviso does say, it's directly to the contrary.
speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="138.502" stopTime="210.378">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    It is directly contrary. 
    The plaintiffs below chose not to comply with the union-shop agreement. 
    Instead, they sued to enjoin its enforcement saying that they were not members of the union, did not pay it any money, did not want to pay it any money, and that to enforce the agreement against them would be unlawful. 
    Now after this Court decided the Hanson case that was a case that came from Nebraska in which this Court upheld the validity of the union-shop agreement and reversed the Supreme Court of Nebraska which had set it aside on the ground that the money might or might not be used in accordance with the individual's view. 
    This Court in this Hanson case said that wasn't enough; might or might not and therefore, reversed. 
    This is exactly the Hanson case. 
    The case was tried before a jury. 
    14 of the plaintiffs testified and their counsel stated that of the others, two were no longer employees, one was in a position exempt from the union-shop agreement, and that the remainder if they testify, would testify the same way that the 14 did.

    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    That is correct Mr. Justice. 
    Now, all the plaintiffs who testified stated that they were not members of the union and were opposed to union-shop. 
    Now, we have some -- their testimony is summarized on pages 7 to 11 of my brief. 
    All that they testify to was that they were opposed to a union-shop and that they were opposed to unions engaging in political activities. 
    Not one of them, although asked, could name a single political cause supported by the unions contrary to their views. 
    None of them testified that he or she had advised the union of his views or indeed had advised the union of anything.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="270.896" stopTime="277.896">

    There was not.

    So how did they know? 
    How could the plaintiffs know?
speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="282.572" stopTime="323.128">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    These plaintiffs aren't even members of the union. 
    Now what the union does is not a secret. 
    They could ask. 
    The union has publications and under the Street case, this Court held that the individual must let the union know what he opposes. 
    In this case, he couldn't even name anything that the union did that it opposed and was asked, name a single candidate that the union supported to whom you're opposed and none of them could do it. 
    Name a single piece of legislation that the union supported to which you are opposed and none of them could do it except that two of them said, “He was opposed to the enactment of Section 2 Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act.”

    Mr. Milton Kramer

speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="330.869" stopTime="348.041">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    They could have asked. 
    Well first, fundamentally under the Street case, these people haven't paid any money to the union. 
    The union wasn't spending their money whatever it was doing. 
    And this Court held that it's the spending of their money for causes they opposed which is unlawful, but they haven't paid anything.

speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="354.310" stopTime="404.274">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    Well that's right. 
    But until they have paid some money, they have no grievance. 
    Until the union does something with their money contrary to their views then under the Street case, they have no act -- cause of action. 
    This Court said specifically that the union-shop is lawful and that the plaintiffs in the Street case said, “The plaintiffs therefore remain obliged to pay the sums hold for by the union-shop agreement,” in practically those words, that they remain obliged to pay and the opinion of the Court that was stated that there was nothing unlawful about the union-shop, there was nothing unlawful about collecting the money. 
    If there is any illegality involved, the illegality would be spending their money contrary to their views. 
    That was explicit in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion. 
    Well, the other one --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="404.274" stopTime="408.454">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Will they have to wait -- they'd -- they have to wait until the money has been spent before they can check?

    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    Well I have to wait until they paid it.

    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    They could say under the Street case -- I'm just arguing this under the Street case, not the way I argued the Street case, but assuming the Street case to pronounce the law as it is today, they could either insist -- they could insist either on the union not spending a portion of their money force up to contribution, or, I think the alternative was that they could be relieved of a portion of the dues -- the Court indicated those two alternatives.

    Oh, very common outside the railroad industry. 
    It is lawful under the Railway Labor Act but the unions just haven't been able to get it. 
    Now the other evidence in this case consists of a showing that the AFL-CIO engages in certain legislative and other activities. 
    There is no evidence that those activities of the AFL-CIO with which these unions are affiliated and to which it makes payments, there is no evidence that anything the AFL-CIO does is contrary to the views of any plaintiff.

    No one has such a cause of action and that's what this Court held in the Street case and in the Hanson case that they must show support of a specific cause, of a specific candidate which they opposed and off which they notified the union they opposed before they have a cause of action. 
    And then when they have a cause of action, they cannot get an injunction against the collection of all money which is exactly the relief given in this case. 
    This union-shop agreement has been in effect with over 10 years now and these people haven't paid a dime under a preliminary injunction and the permanent injunction. 
    Now, when this case was appealed to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, first, that court reversed by a 6 to 1 vote. 
    But after the decision of the trial court and what later became the Street case, they granted a rehearing and our rehearing divided evenly and said the even division does not leave in effect their first opinion but leaves in effect the trial court's opinion.

    Oh, -- certainly, because none of the money that is paid to the AFL -- AFL-CIO by the unions goes to COPE for political expenditures, none of it. 
    The evidence is uncontradicted that every cent of the money that they pay comes from voluntary contributions, because it would be a violation of the Corrupt Practices Act or otherwise, in all probability. 
    COPE and RLPL were established after the Corrupt Practices Act was amended which prevented unions for making contributions to campaigns of candidates for federal office.

    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    That's right and Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Blakeney is going to make an argument similar to what you're suggesting and that is that they notified them by suing them. 
    Well, this isn't a peculiar --

    No, I thought that they --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You just said that you couldn't notify him by -- and then file a lawsuit, enjoin it and if that would --
speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="1483.633" stopTime="1484.482">
    Mr. Milton Kramer

    -- keep it from doing anything.
speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="1485.795" stopTime="1502.696">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    I find it difficult to understand how somebody -- let's say he needs -- he has to notify him to have a cause of action. 
    So somebody who doesn't have a cause of action against somebody else acquires a cause of action against that somebody else by suing him. 
    Now that's a theory for -- a document of jurisprudence I can't grasp.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1502.696" stopTime="1507.965">

speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="1507.965" stopTime="1594.605">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    I have about one minute left, Mr. Justice White. 
    I think -- oh, no, you started five minutes late. 
    I have about six minutes left. 
    The merits of course were fully argued in the Street case and the Court divided five ways. Basically, it is if that all -- well, there were several propositions. 
    First, there is no government action here. 
    All that Congress has done is to repeal its own prohibition against the union-shop, and secondly, to say that state law shall not apply to union-shop agreements in the railroad industry. 
    And that's all its -- that -- that's all the federal action there is. 
    Now there were those who say superseding state law makes it federal action and therefore the unions -- in getting a union-shop agreement are bound by constitutional limitation. 
    I think that's wrong. 
    I think that repealing your own law, repealing your own prohibition is clearly constitutional and superseding state law and what is the most essential of interstate activities, the railroad industry is not unconstitutional. 
    And so therefore, it shouldn't reach any constitutional question but if we do reach the constitutional questions, then I think this act -- this conduct is lawful. 
    There is no right of the plaintiffs that is being in no constitutional right being infringed, I know Mr. Justice Black disagrees with me.

    They are not being ordered or made to say anything except in the very indirect sense to which Mr. Justice Black referred in his opinion that using their money to publicize certain ideas this in effect making them say it.

    Now there is a proviso that if the unions come back and prove what portion of their dues they spend for collective bargaining, plus collective bargaining, then that portion of their dues with respect to all of them, with collection of that portion would not be enjoined. 
    Mr. Blakeney will argue that that means they are not enjoined, but they are today enjoined and have been for 10 years enjoined from collecting anything and if only if they come back and make certain showings that injunction may or may not be modified, and that showing is -- would excuse these people from paying anything for anything other than collective bargaining.

    Another one of the things that you -- that that -- in other words, the grounds of the injunction is that one of these two unions, all unions but two were dismissed from the case because none of the plaintiffs was represented by any of the others. 
    One of these unions had a death benefit fund and they are -- the unions could not collect anything from the plaintiffs, so long as they have this death benefit fund. 
    Now, this death benefit fund is a fund that varies in amount depending on how long a person has been a member. 
    And when he dies, his wife or estate, is given the amount of -- it goes up as high as $250. 
    Now it also -- it isn't just how long you've been a member, it's how long you have continuously been a member and so it serves two functions. 
    First, it serves a function of having some quick money readily available for the family of a railroad employee who dies and secondly, it reduces the expenses of collecting dues because there's an inducement for people to keep their dues current because the longer they are continuously been a member, the more their death benefit will be. 
    Now it is held that this is an improper expenditure of union dues under a union-shop. 
    These are things that unions have done since time immemorial. 
    In fact, some of the unions were organized with a very first as paternal beneficial associations to have death benefits for the families of employees who died. 
    There was a reason that some of the unions were created and they only at later engaged in collective bargaining. 
    This held that this is not a proper union activity for people who don't want to belong to the union. 
    This is something unions have done and since they were established, it is not taking away; it's not depriving anybody of any constitutional right. 
    Nobody said he objected to death benefits. 
    It was put to them in terms of, do you want to be ordered to take insurance with so and so -- that company and they said, “No, I'd like to pick my own company to buy insurance.” 
    That's the only evidence that this is opposed by any of the plaintiffs. 
    None of them said they were opposed to union paying death benefits to the families of deceased members. 
    And if any of them did -- if any of them felt that way, none of them advised the union that he didn't want his money spent that way and he couldn't advice the union that he doesn't want his money spent that way because he hasn't given any -- the union any money to spend.

    Mr. Whiteford S. Blakeney 
    -- may it please the Court. 
    I would first like to summarize briefly, if I may, just what it is that the record in this case establishes. 
    It's clear first that these plaintiff employees have been notified by the defendant unions and by their employer, the Railway Company that they will be discharged from their jobs of long standing unless they pay money to the defendant unions. 
    It's further established that this money will, in part, be used for political purposes unrelated to collective bargaining. 
    The plaintiff employees have gone upon the witness stand and have stated that they are deeply opposed to money being taken away from them by compulsion against their will and used for political purposes as to which they have no opportunity of choice or decision. 
    Now this, we submit to this Court, is a double wrong of major import, the taking of money from people against their will as a condition of working and the using of that money to put men into the offices of Government.

speaker="whiteford_s_blakeney" startTime="2726.098" stopTime="2817.394">
    Mr. Whiteford S. Blakeney 
    I recognize that I must come clearly to that and I will in detail, Your Honor, but at this moment may I simply say there is indeed language in Street that looks in the direction of refusing such injunction as we have here. 
    There is other language in Street that looks in favor of what we have here and most important of all, Your Honor, each and every defect that you pointed to for reversing the Street judgment is corrected in this judgment, each as I will try to show. 
    Now, the jury in this case and has already been noted, this case unlike Street, was not litigated upon stipulations of evidence but upon the presentation of evidence and testimonies subject to examination and cross examination in the ordinary manner. 
    And the issues therefore were decided not by the Court but by a representative jury upon issues submitted to them by ordinary procedure. 
    I've mentioned that merely in passing. 
    The evidence consisted of both testimony and the exhibits. 
    The exhibits for example, Your Honors, included many pages setting forth by date, by name, by amounts, hundreds of thousands of dollars contributed by agencies of the unions to political candidates.

    Mr. Whiteford S. Blakeney 
    The other admits he did pay money to print its publications for political purposes. 
    I mean, direct out of his treasury, direct. 
    But the candidates for political office got it, so the jury found through these other agencies and believe me it was the most difficult matter to trace. 
    And -- but all that is resolved by the trial, if the Court please, he argued to the judge before it went to the jury that the evidence wouldn't sustain such a finding. 
    After the jury -- he argued to the jury they shouldn't find it after the jury verdict he contented it should be set aside. 
    He argued then to the Supreme Court of North Carolina that the evidence didn't sustain it. 
    All those courts went against him on that subject. 
    All those tribunals went against him and that's settled. 
    He cannot herein this Court, I take it, argued that the evidence doesn't sustain the verdict. 
    Rather we've got two questions before us now as I understand. 
    His first point is that our cause of action is defeated any how, no matter the finding, defeated because we have insufficiently advised the unions as to what causes our candidates they espoused and we opposed. 
    Now, the first answer to that, Your Honors is that in Street, the plaintiffs were found to have a valid cause of action and they made known their opposition in no different sense than what these plaintiffs here have. 
    Furthermore, if the Court please as Mr. Justice Stewart mentioned, how can these plaintiffs, how could they have made known their opposition any more specifically because the record is replete that these unions don't even notify their own local officials as to who they support and what causes they support and these local officials testified. 
    Again and again, I don't know what they do with the money, whom they support and whom they oppose, how then could our class, adversary litigants have known? 
    And what must we do about notifying them other than as this Court said in a Street, through this litigation let them know that we oppose and they went on the stand and they said, “We oppose”, we've got their testimony quoted considerably in our brief and I submit it is pointed, positive, repeated and rather eloquent. 
    They say, when we -- when money of ours is used to elect people to government, we think we ought to say, “Do we want our money to go to this man or to that man,” and not somebody else make that decision for us.

speaker="whiteford_s_blakeney" startTime="3399.280" stopTime="3551.487">
    Mr. Whiteford S. Blakeney 
    If this Court should come to the conclusion that that portion of the ca -- of the judgment should be eliminated, I say that it can be eliminated without any effect upon the real thrust of this judgment. 
    Now may I come quickly to the judgment because as Mr. Justice Brennan has suggested, that is what I must meet. 
    I do say first about this business of notifying the unions. 
    We did -- what was done in Street and they had a valid cause of action and our notification couldn't go beyond that as a factual matter, but now on the judgment, what does this judgment do? 
    This judgment does not enjoin the union-shop generally at all. 
    Here are the defects in the judgment that the Court found in Street, the Court said first it's defective because it's a class judgment. 
    Here, there is no element of class judgment. 
    It was rigorously eliminated by the trial court. 
    Nobody purports to benefit from this judgment except people who are active litigants. 
    What else did the Court say was wrong with the Street judgment? 
    And I'm quoting now from Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion, page 18 of my brief, I will read just a sentence, “Restraining the collection of all funds, sweeps too broadly,” that on down, “the prohibition is absolutely against the collection of all funds. 
    The complete shut off of this source of income defeats the congressional plan and so forth.” 
    We also think that a blanket injunction against all expenditures of funds for the disputed purposes and so forth would not be proper. 
    Now, Your Honors, the judgment before you does none of those things. 
    This is not a judgment restraining the collection of all funds from these plaintiffs. 
    It is not a prohibition absolute against the collection of all funds from these plaintiffs. 
    There is no complete shut off of union funds from these plaintiffs and there's no injunction against expenditure of anything. 
    In other words, under this judgment, the unions are left free to collect any and all amounts authorized by the union-shop agreement from voluntary employees and they are left free to collect any and all sums related to collective bargaining from all employees covered by the contract voluntary and dissenting alike.

    Mr. Whiteford S. Blakeney 
    Your Honor, all the phrases that I just quoted you which this -- which Your Honor mentioned as being the vice of the Street judgment, each and everyone is absent in this judgment. 
    Now the dividing -- let me touch this. 
    The dividing of what's related to collective bargaining and what's political, the unions in the first instance must do that. 
    They only -- they alone know what they do with the money, they have the facts and the information as to how they use it, what part they use for political, what part they use for collective bargaining. 
    They should make a showing on that in the first instance. 
    As Mr. Justice Brennan writing in the case of United States-Campbell said, it is a general principle based in fairness that the law does not place upon a party the burden to proving facts which are peculiarly within the knowledge of the his adversary and our North Carolina decisions are positively to the same effect. 
    And this dividing of what is related to bargaining and what isn't, were suggested by this Court in the United States against CIO which as Your Honors will remember was a case involving union publications for political purposes. 
    And there, this Court said, if minority or dissent of protection is intended to be sufficient for securing this to permit the dissenting members to carry the burden of making known their position and to relieve them, relieve them of any duty to pay dues or portions of them to be applied to the forbidden uses. 
    And the United States Government Industry case filed a brief in which it approved the same idea.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    And would you [Inaudible] general characterization, the expenditures are not based under your [Inaudible]?
speaker="whiteford_s_blakeney" startTime="3848.356" stopTime="4131.871">
    Mr. Whiteford S. Blakeney 
    Some of it certainly would, Your Honor. 
    But political purposes and whatever is to be comprehended within that has got to be worked out of course in each case. 
    All I am saying Your Honors is, that money here was used for political purposes undeniably to some degree. 
    Now let the union show to what degree. 
    The burden should be on them. 
    Now, just one more word if the Court please, this Court, of course, has no solicitude or concern for the union-shop agreement insofar as it accomplishes as this Court itself held insofar as it accomplishes an unlawful purpose. 
    That is the taking of money against an employee's will and using it for political purposes. 
    What this Court was concerned about in the Street, as I understand it, and the reason this Court set the Street judgment back as I understand it was this. 
    That in working the unlawful operation of the union-shop agreement, there must not be interference with the union-shop agreement functioning in its collective bargaining area, in its proper spheres. 
    There, in other words, the Court considered that the judgment there perpetually enjoining, sweeping broadly, denying all collection of any nature was an interference with the bargaining function of the union. 
    And therefore, sent that -- reversed that judgment and undid it. 
    And I am saying Your Honor, that the judgment here touches and inhibits the union-shop agreement only in its unlawful sphere, and not at all in its other operations. 
    Now suppo -- our adversaries, Your Honor, would apparently have these plaintiff employees bring suit against these unions, apparently which they term, if the Court please, sometimes, somewhere, someday by protected litigation, any expenditure of a thousand times what's involved, you may restrain the expenditure of some part of this or you make it restitution, but the compulsion, you must now submit to though it'd be unlawful. 
    It's held unlawful, nevertheless submit to it. 
    Pay all, now. 
    This, I submit to the Court, it should not be. 
    If a judgment is worked out so that the unlawful part is separated from the lawful part, then the unlawful part can and should be restrained. 
    And if we have to sue every time Your Honor, that would be perpetual litigation. 
    Each case would resolve nothing except the amount of money involved in that case only. 
    And the employee in order to maintain the right of keeping his money from going for political purpose would have to sue again and again renewed, successively, perpetually to maintain that right. 
    Now, this Court has said that this area is one of the utmost gravity. 
    The issues underlying here are indeed important ones. 
    They are vital, not only to individual liberty, if the Court please, they are crucial to the integrity of the Government itself for if arrangements are established by which collective representatives can require employees to pay money as a condition of working and can then take that money and elect whom they wish to public office and enact laws as they will, then we may be on the road toward distinction of important individual liberty and free government as well. 
    It may -- it serves not, if the Court please, to declare this taking and using for political purposes to be unlawful. 
    It avails not to declare it unlawful, if no meaningful, practical remedy is granted. 
    And its purpose can still be accomplished and it can be still accomplished and will be accomplished unless injunction avails. 
    And the injunction here, we do submit to Your Honors, is one that is shaped to avoid the very difficulties that this Court observed and pointed to in the Street case.
