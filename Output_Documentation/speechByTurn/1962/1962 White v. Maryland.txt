White v. Maryland

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 600, Robert Galloway White, Petitioner, versus Maryland. 
    Mr. Weisgal.
speaker="fred_e_weisgal" startTime="16.232" stopTime="206.847">
    Mr. Fred E. Weisgal 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from a decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals affirming petitioner's conviction for murder by the Criminal Court of Baltimore City theft, death penalty was imposed. 
    A certiorari was granted by this Court and it was limited to the point raised in Hamilton versus Alabama. 
    The pertinent undisputed facts briefly are that on May 27, 1960 the petitioner was arrested and taken to the Central Police Station in Baltimore City. 
    This is approximately 12:40 pm and at approximately 6:30 that evening he was booked, which means the charges were placed against him on the docket. 
    He was brought before a magistrate on May 31, four days later, 3 pm and the state, which usually appears at all of these preliminary hearings, representing this day asked for a postponement at that time. 
    Postponement was granted and the man was remanded to at that to the Baltimore City Jail where he remained until August 9 when he was again brought before the magistrate for a preliminary hearing. 
    At this preliminary hearing, as is the practice in Maryland, even though the magistrate does not have jurisdiction to try this case, he is asked if he wants to plea guilty or not guilty and the man entered the plea of guilty. 
    Now come, of course, to the important point that is before this Court. 
    This man did not have an attorney representing him either at May 27 or at any time up until this hearing of August 19, still did not have an attorney rather and the magistrate after the preliminary hearing just referred to case sent it up ham as we say in Baltimore, to the grand jury. 
    An indictment was brought out, and on September 9 be was brought to the criminal court, or September 8, he was brought to criminal court for arraignment. 
    He still did not have an attorney and at that time a plea of not guilty was entered by him by the court. 
    The court then appointed an attorney. 
    He was re-arraigned on November 25, 1960, at which time through his counsel, he entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. 
    The case came to trial on February 28, 1961. 
    It was practically a year later, and during the course of the trial the following testimony took place on page 5 of our brief where the state asked the lieutenant, the arresting officer, Lieutenant Glover, were you present at the preliminary homicide hearing before magistrate Claudney on August 8, 1960 where White was charged with the -- this offence. 
    I was. 
    Sir, do you recall what plea, if any, that defended White gave upon his arraignment at that time? 
    White gave a plea of guilty. 
    Let me clarify one thing to this court at this time. 
    The use of the arraignment by the State Attorney at that time means -- it does not mean that there was an arraignment as such. 
    This was a preliminary hearing. 
    He uses the word arraignment to mean that he appeared before magistrate and nothing else. 
    Now this --

    Mr. Fred E. Weisgal 
    During the course of the trial at criminal court, no sir, but I think that is answered quite clearly by the Court of Appeals that any objection even if it had been made wouldn't have made any difference, because the Maryland has recognized the rule that if you plead guilty before a magistrate they can introduce this plea in evidence against you. 
    They can use this.

    Judge Harlan, may I return to your question with respect to waver? 
    The point that we are raising here is that had this man had counsel at his preliminary hearing this question -- you would never have been able to ask this question. 
    I think, this is the crux of the entire matter, the fact that at a preliminary hearing this man was allowed to plea to a capital case without benefit of counsel. 
    Now, you say that the Court of Appeals waived it. 
    They just simply state that it wasn't properly before them and was not raised below or decided by the Trial Court, but they do go on to point out, without further content -- discussion that the contention is without merit. 
    Certainly, this doesn't preclude this Court from considering the fact that prejudice that resulted from not being represented --

    Mr. Fred E. Weisgal 
    The rule is quite clear sir. 
    At arraignment, in a capital case or other serious charges our rules provide that a man -- the court should provide a counsel for him. 
    Now I might say this that in all fairness to our courts, at least, in Baltimore City, the practice is now been for the last couple of years, at least, to provide counsel in almost every type of case where an indigent appears before them without counsel, but this raises the big problem. 
    By the time they get their in certain cases -- by the time you get to the Criminal Court in Baltimore City any type of counsel that received at that time will do no good because you had lost so many rights.

    Mr. Fred E. Weisgal 
    At a preliminary hearing the practice is, the man is brought before the magistrate. 
    The magistrate must say to you “do you wish to have your case tried before me, or you wish to have your tried up, or you wish me to send it to the Criminal Court of Baltimore City?

    Mr. Fred E. Weisgal 
    Yes sir. 
    Yes sir, that's exactly what took place in this case. 
    The man said I want to try it before you thinking that he can be tried before a magistrate, the magistrate then says “how do you plead” the man said and it's true he pled guilty, but the magistrate knowing that he did not have jurisdiction over this case just entered a plea of Not Guilty on the docket. 
    He did not even enter this man's plea of guilty down there.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="839.784" stopTime="856.832">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, may I -- may I just pursue that one point Mr. Weisgal. 
    Does the law kind of play that at a preliminary hearing in a capital case the magistrate shall ask him how he pleads, Guilty or Not Guilty?

    That's correct. 
    Now a preliminary hearing is a magistrate's hearing, it's held in the, and we've got something like non-police stations involved in Baltimore City, all homicide cases are tried at Central Police Station. 
    The State represents the state at -- the State is represented, rather at these preliminary hearings by the State's Attorney. 
    If the man does not have counsel, they just go ahead and make out a prima-facie case if they can before the magistrate and then they continue.

    Well, this Court has in fact and that's why I say that our Court of Appeals almost used reverse, a reverse diligent and if I may, in arriving at their decision in this case. 
    They said that in this case that arraignment in Alabama is not like arraignment in Maryland. 
    That's true, it's not, but arraignment in Alabama is somewhat alike to arraignment to preliminary hearing in Maryland. 
    So they say since this was an arraignment and the man doesn't loose any rights at arraignment therefore we do not have to follow the rule in the Alabama case that whatever what happens there may possibly affect the rest of the trial so they consequently just ignored this entire issue. 
    They ignored the thinking of this Court in Powell that we -- that this Court has stated time and time again when you plea to a criminal -- to a capital charge you must have counsel, you must have the guiding hand of counsel, Now the Attorney General comes along and tries to re-interpret the Court of Appeals thinking by saying well a preliminary hearing is not really a judicial hearing.

    In the Crooker case which was decided prior before this Court stated that the Pre-trial proceedings are extremely important proceedings and you should -- and you should have counsel at that time. 
    Also I would just recall to this Court the Mr. Beanie's article on the Right to Counsel, this is not in my brief I am sorry, put it by Minnesota Law Review 771 where Mr. Beanie and Mr. Orfield, incidentally Justice Douglas you wrote the introduction of this article, state that this -- the preliminary hearing, the Pre-trial what we call in Maryland, the Pre-trial proceedings are the most critical in the defense of an indigent or in defense of any man accused of a crime.

    Very well.

    Mr. Chief Justice –-

    Mr. Sweeney?
speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="1272.869" stopTime="1398.300">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    -- members of the Court. 
    Let me say at the outset that the state of Maryland is fully cognizant of the fact that the rights of its most depraved citizen must be just as zealously guarded as those of the most honored member of our society. 
    It is because of this feeling that the institution known as the preliminary hearing exists in the state of Maryland and the primary purpose of the preliminary hearing is for the benefit of the accused, as noted by the Maryland Court of Appeals who are perhaps best qualified to comment on the functions of that particular institution and it might clarify some of the questions raised here today. 
    To quote briefly from a recent case of the Maryland Court of Appeals in which they discussed the preliminary hearing at page 6 of our brief, the case of Williams versus the State in which the court said that this hearing before the magistrate is for the purpose of determining whether there was probable ground to believe the accused guilty. 
    The magistrate therefore can only commit the accused who are the -- for the -- for an appearance before the Grand Jury, subject to bail under certain circumstances or discharge him. 
    The hearing is primarily for the benefit of the accused ensuring him against being committed for action by the Grand Jury on charges which are groundless and this next quotation I believe is of particular interest, “There is no reason, the court said, why the accused should be required to enter a plea at that time, where however, such a plea is voluntarily made by the accused, evidence of the plea is generally held to be admissible in the trial on the indictment.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1398.300" stopTime="1400.972">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was this voluntarily made here?

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Yes and as a matter of fact our court has held regarding preliminary hearings, (a) that they may be waved by the defendant and (b) that the theory around the part of the state to hold a preliminary hearing or postponing it does not vitiate a later conviction because our court recognizes that this is a separate proceeding and not a part of a trial and this is the crux of our argument that whatever the circumstances here at the trial, whatever the unfortunate circumstances regarding accepting the plea of guilty, noting a plea of not guilty and then subsequently entering in to evidence at the trial the oral plea of guilty, that forgetting all of this that the question before the Court is this a denial a due process under the case of Hamilton versus Alabama and we say that it is not, Your Honors.

    Yes he was a justice of the peace, but he was not required to be an attorney although in Baltimore City from 18 Magistrates 17 were attorneys. 
    He was not a full time judicial officer and he could in fact practice as an attorney before other courts in the state accepting only the magistrates in the city or county for which he was appointed. 
    He did not have and this is something that the court must consider, he did not have sufficient authority to appoint counsel. 
    He had no jurisdiction over members of the bar to call counsel to be appointed at a preliminary hearing, nor did he have funds available to him to compensate such counsel as he might volunteer in the event that this should be done.

    This would nut but it is a practical problem that I think that perhaps the State of Maryland might be faced with a problem that our court deals with in its opinion. 
    Under our new system I might add where we have full time judges sitting as municipal court of Baltimore City who are required to be attorneys of at least five years of practice and who are judges in every sense of the word. 
    We still do not have either the authority on the part of those judges nor the funds available to appoint counsel, a question that my brother and I are dealing with all the state judges next Monday night in an attempt to bring about some compliance with the Court's recent decision in the Gideon case.

    Yes but the question in Hamilton versus Alabama was not with preliminary hearing as I understand the preliminary hearing was with an arraignment at which time in Hamilton versus Alabama as the Court pointed out certain pleas must either be made or irrevocably waived. 
    There is no such set of circumstances in Maryland not only at our preliminary hearing, but also no such circumstances at our arraignment because our rules and our law do not require, although they require that a plea be made at arraignment they do not require that it can only be made then nor do they say that if made at arraignment it cannot subsequently be changed and it can in fact be changed and there is no better example than the case at hand where at his original arraignment not preliminary hearing but arraignment.

    Well a defendant at a preliminary hearing cannot testify, he is not permitted to testify. He is permitted to cross examine his witnesses but it is not a trial and because it is not a trial no defense is put on other than such as.

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    Well in my view if I may say so for this Court to say that under Hamilton versus Alabama we are required to appoint counsel on these circumstances, you are stretching the Hamilton doctrine beyond the trial itself, beyond the period between arrest and trial and all the way back until the – within hours of the arrest being made.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2071.337" stopTime="2091.694">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Being stretched to the point, the first point was defendant is brought before a judge or a magistrate who is certainly a judicial officer not a lawyer and he is called on to plead guilty or not guilty is carrying it that far [Inaudible] any further at a place which is important to him as a defendant.
speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="2091.694" stopTime="2098.856">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    It's carrying it further because you are establishing thereby the preliminary hearing as a part of the trial procedure.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2098.856" stopTime="2109.542">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Not as part of -- actual part of it, but as the part of proceedings if the state takes to get him convicted.

speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="2109.542" stopTime="2119.661">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    Then in so saying, your honor, you are disagreeing with the opinion of my court that the primary purpose of this is for the benefit of the accused.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2119.661" stopTime="2192.690">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    No, it might be. 
    I understand that from one standpoint the whole history of it is that there was solicitude; you see that people were not grudged often, put them in jail and shut up there without any chance [Inaudible] might not leave for six months say they got to have a hearing and they got to have a chance, but that does not take away from it the other important part, does it? 
    It's an extremely great moment to the defender that he be advised properly on how to proceed in connection with the serious charges against him. 
    You don't have to disagree with your court on that other point, I don't think. 
    I agree with them. 
    I think that's your basic foundation for the preliminary trial. 
    See if he didn't get bail, see whether he could be held over; see the terms under which he should be held over. 
    Does that answer the question as to whether that's a time at every stage it was the time from the time he is arrested until he is convicted finally that he has to be protected if a state gets him in a position where it's calling on him to the answer to his guilt or innocence?
speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="2192.690" stopTime="2248.977">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    Well, this is not an answer, but the practice that we follow is the practice to my knowledge, to the best of my knowledge is now followed in the Federal System before the Commissioners. 
    And the -- where even at the present time, it is my understanding since the Gideon case that counsel will not be appointed in the Federal System before a Commissioner, that perhaps raising their hopes on the note in Mr. Justice Harlan's concurring opinion wherein the Court perhaps exempted petty offenders from those -- for whom counsel must be appointed. 
    But it is my understanding that in the Federal System, counsel will not be appointed in petty offenses under Federal Law if he is tried before a Commissioner, that the Commissioner will not have a right in those cases where he is conducting a preliminary hearing.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2248.977" stopTime="2251.710">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But this was not a petty offense?
speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="2251.710" stopTime="2315.605">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    No, your honor. 
    But my point is that the Federal Commissioners do not now have the right to appoint counsel, and do not as a fact appoint counsel neither before nor after Gideon and that this is exactly comparable to the practice in Maryland. 
    So although as I say this is not an answer, if the practice that we are following in the State of Maryland is a denial of due process, that's such -- that due process is equally being denied in the Federal System. 
    And that in relying as we do on the prior decisions of the lower Federal Courts, perhaps then if the Court is going to hold that this is a denial of due process, it's going to be done not under Hamilton or under Powell, but it's going to be a new mandate of the Court. 
    But my sole is that we have followed what we believe are the opinions of the Federal Courts. 
    We have followed what we believe are the practices of the Federal Courts. 
    If this is error and I do not submit nor believe that it is, if it is error, we will comply with whatever directions the Court gives in this instance.

    In the Adelman case, Adelman had pleaded guilty before the Commissioner without counsel. 
    He subsequently changed his plea and his original plea was admitted in the evidence against him. 
    Now to be candid with the Court, it's holding exactly to the contrary, is a case on the District Court of Appeals heavily relied on by my brother, a case of Woods where under a similar set of facts the District Court of appeals came to almost an exact opposite conclusion.

    He went to trial that plea was entered against him and the District – the United States Court of Appeals for the district held that it was improper to do so. 
    They cite little authority for that proposition except I think the Kurchable which is easily distinguishable at least in my opinion from this case because in the Kurchable case we were concerned not -- this Court was concerned not with a plea made at preliminary hearing but a plea made a trial and subsequently change with permission of a trial court and then attempted to be or then used in evidence against him and this Court said in Kurchable that when the court permitted the man to change his plea it was an admission that his first plea had been erroneously entered and therefore it was unfair and --

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    I had an idea that the question might be asked. 
    I cannot say that whether I approve of this being done of course has nothing to do with the case, but I think Mr. Justice Harlan, I would like to quote it for the court. 
    In the New York case before this court where Mr. Justice Harlan and running the majority of opinion started out by saying we share the distaste of the lower court as to the – saying of circumstances here. 
    But however distaste what we find them out question is our problem is to find hasn't been a constitutional denial of due process. 
    Perhaps this might apply to the present case however unfortunate this set of circumstances might be we say that it does not amend to an unconstitutional denial of new process. 
    We say that this is not a part of the trial that it does not – Hamilton vs. Alabama cannot apply here because or it has – it must be stretched to make it apply and that in if the court chooses to so stretch the case of Hamilton vs. Alabama it will greatly hamper the activities of law enforcement officials, it will take it back to within hours of the arrest itself at least in Maryland and that it will make it much more difficult to do interrogation, solve crimes which plague the community. 
    I might also point out that despite the language in Hamilton versus Alabama that says where a man is permitted to enter a plea of guilty without counsel, in a capital case we do not stop to enquire as to what the prejudice exists. 
    Now this is a very serious language when applied to circumstances such as these.

    May I just direct my remarks first to Mr. Justice White. 
    I'm sorry I was so dense I didn't understand your question. 
    I don't think and I am not calling Mr. Sweeney dense He didn't understand it either. 
    You are reading the language here saying the accused when brought before me and on being informed by me of his right to a trail by jury, actually how this is used so let us assume we have an assault case before a magistrate and the magistrate has the right try this case, he has concurrent jurisdiction of the criminal court. 
    If the lawyer doesn't like this magistrate and he doesn't want to try the case in front of him, he asks for a jury trial and at that time the magistrate cannot try the case, he must send it uptown the criminal court and that is what the practical purpose of that rule is sir.

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    Also sir if you have your attorney at a preliminary hearing, if you have an attorney you would ask for a transcript and the state in most homicide cases does take down the testimony of prosecuting witnesses inn these hearings. 
    Now Justice Goldberg, just a remark to you sir, a beautiful decision was written by Justice Rutledge in the Woods case where he discusses the Adelman case case and every other case and why he discounts the thinking in the Adelman case and completely reviews the idea of allowing a guilty plea by an unrepresented man could be allowed into evidence and this thinking has been followed in quite a number of jurisdictions and my last point is I would like to say to this Court I don't consider this a, if you rule, overrule our Court of Appeals, a stretching of the Hamilton case. 
    The Hamilton case is just an extension in my opinion of the Powell case, the keywords to me are what happens there may have the affect the whole trial. 
    Our Court of Appeals went upon the words arraignment and they didn't have to? 
    What this Court as far as I'm concerned stated in the Hamilton case was at any time, reiterating Powell, anytime where prejudice, where something will happen to a to an unrepresented indigent or any defendant. 
    Anytime in any proceeding, he would be affected, he must then have counsel. 
    I think this Courts says no more, no less.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Weisgal, to me at least there are two separate questions which you have seem to consider as one. 
    One is whether or not this the constitutional requirement this man to be – have the assistance of counsel at his preliminary hearing, that's one question. 
    The second question is whether the Constitution requires Maryland to exclude his plea of guilty at the preliminary hearing? 
    Are those two separate questions?

    Mr. Fred E. Weisgal 
    Yes sir, but we are only -- you only limited in the cert to this one question, the right the counsel and my argument is if he had counsel he never would have --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3528.560" stopTime="3534.015">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But what if he had? 
    Well that's your argument but what if he had had counsel and he pleaded guilty at the preliminary hearing?
speaker="fred_e_weisgal" startTime="3534.015" stopTime="3546.976">
    Mr. Fred E. Weisgal 
    Well it be that had counsel pleaded guilty at the preliminary hearing, I might be here I don't know but I might be here on the question of competency of counsel because there is no reason to enter a plea at a preliminary hearing, none whatsoever.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3546.976" stopTime="3555.339">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right from the beginning his counsel is going to plead in not guilty by reason of insanity and so then -- so you -- this defense starts right at the preliminary hearing.
speaker="fred_e_weisgal" startTime="3555.339" stopTime="3555.505">
    Mr. Fred E. Weisgal 
    Yes sir --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3555.505" stopTime="3560.805">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    [Inaudible] This is the beginning of his evidence that the man is insane.
speaker="fred_e_weisgal" startTime="3560.805" stopTime="3645.772">
    Mr. Fred E. Weisgal 
    If he had – if he had the competent counsel at a preliminary hearing, the counsel will just stand up there, the judge will say do you plead guilty or not guilty, the counsel will say well we don't have to enter any plea, but for the purposes of this hearing we will enter -- he cannot refuse or enter a plea of not guilty. 
    He would never plead guilty unless he was completely incompetent. 
    And see this is what's wrong with the Maryland law, it imposes upon the defendant the duty to know that he doesn't have the answer to magistrate. 
    It imposes upon him -- that's why I have to laugh when they say it's for the benefit of the accused. 
    Historically a preliminary hearing is for the benefit of the accused, but look what happened to the accused in this case. 
    He is held for four days without a preliminary hearing. 
    Then when brought before the court for the preliminary hearing, they say the state asks for the extension of time so they hold him in the jail for another two months, then they have the preliminary hearing, he pleads guilty. 
    He is held in jail for another month. 
    Meanwhile if he had any witnesses, if he had any one that could have possibly have helped him, they could have died, they could disappeared, every -- all of these ingredients necessary to a proper defense are just going out the window at this time. 
    That's why I am saying that this is not an excuse -- this is not stretching Hamilton. 
    This is the natural, logical extension of the, of the Hamilton case, that we must appoint counsel.
