    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I would like to make one or two full remarks with regard to one or two questions or rather one of two matters that Mr. Murphy touched on. 
    That has referenced to the evolution of the county unit method of nominations insofar as in 1917, it was enacted into law. 
    I think Mr. Murphy made it clear that the -- the basis for that enactment into law was the fact that at that time, under the party rule, there was no provision for a run over primary in the event that one candidate for Governor or Senate failed to receive a majority of the unit vote. 
    And it was this convention juggling and convention nomination that led to the incorporation of the county unit method into law. 
    It was not as an unfounded statement, we say in the appellee's brief would have that it was tied in with any scheme to disfranchise Negroes. 
    It was instilled and stirred or inspired solely as we see it from the desire of the people to prevent convention nomination.

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    That is correct sir. 
    At the outset, I would like to state this that we think, do not contend otherwise that Baker versus Carr has settled all questions of justiciability, standing to sue in jurisdiction. 
    We make no issue of that. 
    At the same time, we do say this, that there is still remains an area, under the Fourteenth Amendment in which the State is accorded a wide latitude of discretion and with respect to which no court should undertake to substitute its judgment. 
    To that extent, there are still areas that are non-justiciable once you get past the initial question. 
    Before getting into the merits of what we think are the applicable Fourteenth Amendment standards in this case, I would like to discuss briefly one question which the appellee raises, which if he is correct of course would dispose of this case and that is that there is -- that it's unconstitutional to have any weighting at all in an electoral system. 
    The appellee says that representation is a shared right and consequently some weighting, some inequality is necessary due to interim shifts in population and that sort of thing. 
    On other hand, he says that voting is not a shared right, and therefore, there can be no weighting. 
    We think that this cannot withstand analysis. 
    The Governor and other executive department officers represent the citizen in the execution of the laws, just as represented -- represent the people in the making of the laws. 
    And, neither the legislative apportionment case or in the case of the judiciary and we elect our judges in Georgia or in the case of the executive, the voter votes individually. 
    No one else participates or shares in the casting of that vote and that's true in the legislative case. 
    Now, what happens after his vote is cast and after it has been tabulated, the influence of the effect that is given to that vote is necessarily weighted because he obviously cannot exist in a vacuum. 
    There are other people to be considered whose votes also have some influence in a way.

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    Now, as to a legislative representative, the total legislative power is shared by the allocation of one or more members of a multi-unit body or collegiate body by the allocating of one of more of those numbers to particular areas. 
    And under the electoral arrangement involving the executive of the judiciary, you don't have a number of people to be shared by allocating one out to each. 
    You only have one individual, the Governor or the particular judge or the other State House office and the sharing necessarily has to take effect in a different manner. 
    So, in that case, as in the case of the election of the President, under the electoral college which the sharing is done by the allocation of units rather than by the allocation of individual representatives.

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    There are differences, that is correct sir, but we say this that if it's constitutionally permissible to have any weighting of votes with regard to legislative representation beyond the de minimis weighting that inevitably flows due to population shifts, that it necessarily should follow, that you can have the same thing with reference to a statewide office as a Governor or a judge, it's -- it's granted, it has to be accomplished, the -- the form as the -- 
    But the basic underlying proposition is that if there can be weighting as to one like what is there to say that you cannot have weighting as to the other.

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    Now, in the court below, as did the two courts in the South and the Turman case did not accept this attempted distinction. 
    They said this, it relied upon MacDougall versus Green, they said, “We do not strike the county unit system as such. 
    We do strike it in its present form and cited references to the permissibility of weighting the votes.” 
    In the Justice Department, I don't think either accepts this attempted distinction. 
    They referred to it and say that there probably are some differences, but they end up saying that we don't have to decide that here and then they go all up on (Inaudible) involving burden of proof and end up postulating two standards that they say should apply in these cases. 
    I will come to those also momentarily. 
    However, the Government does concede that if you had a situation where there was not a direct election of a statewide official such as you had years ago with regard to governors in many states that you probably could have weighting there. 
    We say that that is exactly what this is because the county unit system, as devised, with regard to units, its simply a substitution for this collegiate body that, theretofore had done the electing and that is the convention, to nominate not to elect. 
    Now, that brings me to what we think are these proper standards in this case and I think it would also follow in a legislative apportionment case.

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="e_freeman_leverett" startTime="699.903" stopTime="1051.504">
    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    It is here. 
    I'm not -- frankly, I'm not familiar with the rules and procedure of this Court. 
    Under Georgia law, if a judgment is right for any reason, it should be sustained on appeal regardless of the reason given to in below. 
    And I presume that is the rule here. 
    I have never actually read a case on it. 
    The -- this question might be restated thusly, would a unit system be valid even assuming equality of population within each of the participating units? 
    The court below as well as the court in the Turman case and the South case have said or resolved this question in the affirmative. 
    The appellees though says no. 
    He (Inaudible) -- or relies upon the Mosley case, United States versus Mosley in which the Court held that there was a federal right to have one's vote counted. 
    The appellee says that since in a unit system, the candidate or rather the votes of the unit are cast as a unit that the votes of the people within the unit who voted for the minority candidate are not counted, and therefore, it brings it within the pale of Mosley versus United States. 
    As far as the Mosley case is concerned, we think it's sufficient to distinguish by the fact that it was a criminal case where there has been fraudulent and covert acts that were contrary not only to federal law but to state law, that some votes have just not -- it's been simply -- people tabulating them had refused to count them. 
    And that being a criminal case, we think has no relevancy to this situation where this is legal under State law and there was nothing covert about what is done here. 
    And we say that the idea of casting votes by unit is Constitution that it gives recognition to the organization of the State on a county basis and that has been true as illustrated by the history in this case of the county unit system from the very earliest. 
    Georgia has accorded a high degree of autonomy to its counties. 
    They voted as a unit in electing the Governor in the -- at the outset. 
    As the Court in the case here said below, counties were governmental units in Georgia before the union and had their voice in the councils of government on the State level through representation. 
    In the South case, a judge simply said this, the history of the State and of the political parties within it shows that political power has from the beginning been exerted to a large extent through counties as voting units on similar unit lines. 
    Similar recognition has been given to the identity of interest in a county that brings about the rationality of treating them as a unit. 
    In several, the recent reapportionment cases, the Tawes case from Maryland, the Simon case from New York, Baker versus Carr itself upon remand, and the Scholle case in Florida. 
    Under Georgia law, our counties have always enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. 
    They have it within their power to levy taxes or not levy taxes, to afford certain vital services or not to afford. 
    They elect their own officer. 
    They have their own system of courts and public records. 
    County government is managed by a wide variety of boards of county commissioners, ordinances and county managers. 
    The Georgia Constitution expressed the exempts of county government from -- to uniform its provisions. 
    Lastly, each county has its own school system, determines amount of taxes that it will levy within the certain limits and the extent of enrichment programs that it will impose upon its educational system. 
    And is -- in this context, the unit aspects of this case of course apply equally to all counties, regardless of the population. 
    That brings me to the Fourteenth Amendment standards that we think are applicable to cases of this nature and similar to cases involving apportionment. 
    We think that these standards are inferable from a composite of the majority concurring and dissenting opinion in Baker versus Carr, regardless of the divergences in that opinion with respect to the procedural questions of jurisdictions, justiciability, standards and so forth. 
    In the majority of opinion, it was stated, “Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to determine, if on the particular facts they must that a discrimination reflects no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.” 
    In one of the special concurring opinions, this statement was found. 
    Universal equality is not the test. 
    There's room for weighting. 
    The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination. 
    And another concurrence where emphasis was placed upon the fact of horizontal as well as vertical discrimination, the blending of those two which brought about a situation, where it was impossible to determine if there was a basis. 
    Another concurrence was careful to give assurances that State legislatures need not be “so structured” as to reflect with approximate equality, the voice of every voter. 
    Nor does the Constitution prevent the states acting not irrationally from choosing any electoral, legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interest, temper and customs of its people. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter's dissenting opinion, he very strongly says in a language that I could hardly improve that the idea of equality of voting power is not implicit in the history of American institutions.

speaker="e_freeman_leverett" startTime="1104.905" stopTime="1310.196">
    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    That's correct sir. 
    We think that several propositions necessarily follow is corollary to this or from what has been said in these cases, in the various opinions. 
    First, that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit a state's choice and allocate its electoral power to a single basis, equal population representation, either in the case of legislative representation or in the case of the allocation of electoral strength as the statewide offices. 
    And particularly is that so, in this situation where this is simply the primary and you do have a general election where people are capable of expressing themselves with numerical equality and that has been done. 
    We had a run-off election in Georgia for Lieutenant Governor and a dissent arose as to the candidates who would participate in that. 
    And another candidate who is following them was limited mostly to one of the big cities came within 2000 or 3000 votes of getting enough signatures to get on the nominating petition in a little less than two weeks. 
    We have traced in our brief the history of legislative assemblies and demonstrated that when the founding fathers came to draft the Constitution, they were divided into two factions. 
    One, the French school of thought which inspired by the writings of Rousseau were referred to as the egalitarian democrats, the egalitarians, one man, one vote. 
    On the other hand, in a raid against them was the British school of thought which saw the necessity for imposing limitations upon majority will at its very source, a proposition that had been suggested as early as Aristotle's political, the history of the convention records that the resulting product was more English than French. 
    In fact, the -- one of the affidavits of the appellee that is in the record concedes this fact that the English school of thought predominated in the nominating or rather in the constitutional conventions. 
    It's been shown too I think that while Thomas Jefferson has generally recorded as being on the side of equalitarian democracy. 
    He was basically an agrarian democrat and it just happened that equalitarianism fit in quite fine with his conception of a grand -- agrarian democracy as the people started moving out of the tidewater areas out into the western portions of the country and tilling the land. 
    But we don't have to go to the records of the constitutional convention to determine what the nature of this government is that was founded. 
    We think the plain words of the Constitution itself are highly ambiguous. 
    To begin with, a national legislature was provided for, in one House of which each State has equality of representation regardless of the number of people. 
    And even in the other branch which as George Mason said was to be the grand depository of the democratic principle. 
    Equality is not achieved there either because of the fact that -- of the requirement that each State had at least one representative regardless of the number of people.

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    No, but as this Court said in Beadle versus Scholle -- versus Scholle that it would be unthinkable that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth would impose a high standard upon the States than the Fifth does against Federal Government. 
    The second illustration I think of the Constitution in this regard is with regard to the President who is elected not by the people, but by electoral votes. 
    And there's disproportions in between the States in the casting of those electoral votes. 
    The third illustration is the provision for changing the fundamental law itself. 
    That's voted on by the States in which each State has one vote regardless of the number of people. 
    When Congress elects a President in those situations when it's permissible for Congress to do so, each State votes as a unit, each State has one vote.

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    I will answer that this way, it seems to me that if you say otherwise, you have to say that the Federal Constitution imposes a system that is arbitrary, that is unreasonable, that denies equal protection to the voters and merely because of the fact that there's no Equal Protection Clause applicable to it, is the only thing that saves it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1447.868" stopTime="1479.158">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, that -- as Mr. Justice Goldberg says, the specific provisions of the United States Constitution save it. 
    Some people might think this is arbitrary and discriminatory, but it is certainly -- there's no question about its constitutionality because these are provided and we all know without going into it, the history behind all that. 
    The history here is quite a different history. 
    Georgia wasn't created by several counties getting together and voluntarily giving up some of their sovereignties to create the State of Georgia.
speaker="e_freeman_leverett" startTime="1479.158" stopTime="1948.735">
    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    Those differences I think were pretty well disposed off at least to my thinking in the Tawes case. 
    If this argument about sovereignty is circular, what do you mean when you say one was sovereign, one was not? 
    It's simply this, that there is here an identifiable unit, a group of people who have particular interest that those interests should be given some recognition. 
    Now, I do not think that it is unreasonable for Georgia to take that analogy and apply it in its own internal structure as it has and as it would continue to do so unless this Court intervenes. 
    I -- I can't conceive of the -- under the Equal Protection Clause which is itself a product of history and in determining what is rational, history and tradition and the federal system itself would seem to offer some test at least. 
    Now, the Court may disagree, but that is a way that it -- as I see it. 
    That is the way I would answer the question. 
    The last point I think that we might say that disputes the fact of complete equality and expression of majority will is the example of this Court itself. 
    The founding fathers created this Court composed of nine men, no one of which has ever been voted on by anybody, but yet gave you the power. 
    As Madison pointed out in the federalists, to set aside the Solomon Act, it's enacted by 535 of the people's chosen representatives and the President who was also elected. 
    This opinion in Baker versus Carr, Mr. Justice Frankfurter reviewed the apportionments existing in legislatures and common law and the English procedure and the colonies and the States at the time of adoption, the States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment and today, and concluded that, as he stated, “These figures show more than individual variations from a generally accepted standard of electoral equality.” 
    They show that there is not as there has never been a standard by which the place of equality as effect an apportionment can be measured. 
    We think that that brings up another of subordinate propositions up to the general proposition that equal protect -- equal population is not the only basis of electoral apportionment. 
    And that is that courts should not become involved in drawing mathematical formulas. 
    That is not the type of thing that is generally thought to be a judicial function. 
    To begin with, first, judicially insoluble question that you have is what method of mathematical evaluation are you going to use, aside from the actual fixing of the limits and the formula itself? 
    Would it be the theoretical minimum of persons unable to -- capable of electing a majority of both Houses or one House and what about a unicameral legislature and I think you have a case in Nebraska, I do not know whether it is coming up here or not. 
    How would you apply to the Georgia situation? 
    Would the -- assume that theoretical minimum is the test. 
    The more difficult problem then remains of fixing the limits. 
    Should it be 16.5%, the theoretical minimum of persons who are capable of electing a majority in the United States Senate, or should it be 43.3%, the number of persons residing in 39 States who could cast a majority of the electoral votes for President. 
    Now, the three-judge court in the Georgia legislative apportionment case held that a theoretical minimum of 22% for both Houses was invidiously discriminatory and that one house at least had to be proportionate to population. 
    Upon remand in the Baker case, the District Court invalidated minimums of 26.9 for the Senate and 28.7 for the House. 
    In New York on the other hand, theoretical minimums of 36.9% for the Senate and 38.2% for the House were up held. 
    The Idaho Court in Caesar versus Williams upheld a minimum of 32.7 which by the way is substantially the theoretical minimum under the 1962 revised county unit law. 
    Colorado minimums of 29.8 for the House and 32.1 for the Senate were held invalid. 
    But in none of these cases, as any court undertake it to say just where this line can be drawn and the reading of the opinions leaves you completely helpless in trying to discern from there any ascertainable standard or formula. 
    Or, there's another method that you could use and evaluate. 
    That's the mathematical ratio, the comparison of one political entity to another that can be compared to either the most disproportionate or the least populous unit or it can be compared to an average unit. 
    And applied to the Georgia County unit system, it results that the ratio of Fulton County, the State's largest county, the Echols County, the smallest county is 14.8 to 1. 
    On the other hand, it is the court below held that the comparison should be from the particular county to the average county of their ratio would be approximately 1.93 to 1. 
    Baker versus Carr, the courts validated an apportionment which gave ratios to largest to the smallest of 7 to 1 for the Senate, 23 to 1 for the House. 
    There were some variations in Alabama that got involved there on the problem of the fact that one House could not be completely proportionate to population. 
    Under the Electoral College, the ratio of New York to Alaska runs 8 to 1 as to eligible voters and 5 to 1 with regard to population. 
    The ratio of the average Congressional District to Alaska which is one Congressional District is approximately 2 to 1 not 5 to 1. 
    When compared with Senate representation, the ratio of Alaska to New York is 74 to 1 as to population and a 131 as to eligible voters. 
    Now, there's a third statistical approach and that is suggested by the American Society of Political -- the American Political Science Society and that is comparing the percentage departure from the median or from the average district or unit as involved in this case. 
    The Science Association recommends a maximum departure of 15% for Congressional districts. 
    Representative Celler has recommended 20% in some legislation he has proposed and Senator Clark who apparently was inspired by Mr. Anthony Lewis' article in the Harvard Law Review has proposed a 50% maximum deviation from the average district. 
    Now this is simply a preview, a prelude of things to come. 
    If this Court or any other court gets itself in the position or trying to evaluate, to set formulas, to draw lines that is not the solid stuff that is traditional to the judicial system. 
    They are no judiciable manageable standards by which you can evaluate such a situation. 
    I would certainly hate to think that this Court or any other court should get itself in the position that the Swiss Federal Tribunal did recently, when they undertook to draw lines and they struck down a coram limitation on its proportionate system of apportioning representation by holding that a 6.6% coram limitation was valid, whereas a 12.4% limitation was invalid. 
    They didn't tell us approximately what point it becomes permissible or unconstitutional.

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    I'm coming -- I -- I'm going to touch on that with different methods of apportionment. 
    Even after you take into account the different methods of representation of mathematical computation, you then have a problem of what political scientists referred to as unofficial apportionments where these extra legal forces that rise up to neutralize -- the juror apportionments such as lobbies, and pressure groups, and reapportioning of the State Senate. 
    We came across one aspect of that as originally drawn out of scenic districts, achieved a remarkable degree of equality, they didn't vary more than 10%. 
    But when it got in the legislature, some people in one county said, we don't want to be with this group, we rather go in this other county, even though there's no other adjustments made to -- to alleviate the inequality that results. 
    We have more community of interest with this particular group of counties over here. 
    That -- that in our mind subordinates any considerations of abstract equality. 
    Now, the second proposition that follows from the idea that equal population representation is not the only basis is that this Court cannot pick and choose between conflicting bases of representation. 
    The oldest -- one of the oldest at least is political unit apportionment which is exactly what Georgia has employed here, apportionment according to political units. 
    We have superimposed the population bracket on top of it to give it some aspect of equality, but political unit apportionment is one of the oldest. 
    Another is of course the functional division apportionment, William and Mary College elected its own Representatives as did the English universities. 
    Another type of functional division apportionment has been suggested recently by one commentator who says that we are developing cleavages in the urban areas that transcend urban and rural lives, that the rise of labor unions on one hand and employers on the other might some day make it desirable to apportion Representatives along functional divisions of the population in order to --

    The true test is, it's the Court -- is to tell them whether there's any recognizable basis there. 
    If there's any basis at all, then I think that ends it and there are some of course that obviously are impermissible, race, sex, and that sort of thing. 
    But if a particular system reflects a recognizable, identifiable expression of policy, and it's a policy that is certainly had some recognition in governmental structure, I think the function of the courts should end there. 
    And they should not go into weighting, and as the Government would suggest, determine whether there's only a moderate departure from per capita equality and all of the drawing of lines that that would entail. 
    And we say that the Georgia system does have a recognizable basis and that is as far as the matter should go.

    I want to interrupt the procedure of the argument which I will outline to the Court, so that the Court will know what I intend to argue here today to say that I think at the outset or the threshold of this case, it is very important from the argument we have just heard from the appellants to get firmly in mind the position which the appellee takes with regard to the differences between apportionment and voting. 
    Now, the problem arises through the necessity of giving a minority some voice. 
    To give a minority some voice in the field of representation, you have got to have some classifications, districting is classification. 
    If the drawing of a line in saying this man is in this district, this man is another. 
    That at least is classification. 
    The only other way you can give a minority of voice and representation is either to have a proportional system of representation or to ignore the minority's voice by elections at large. 
    Therefore, using our system which is not a proportional system, the American system hasn't developed that way, if you are going to give a minority a voice, a voice, not control, you must have some classification. 
    Now, in the field of voting, no classification is necessary because one man's vote is his fair voice and no classification is necessary and nor is any classification usual at least in American history and in any of the State practices with the possible exception of the three that have been described here today. 
    The truth is that in franchise exercise, the majority or the plurality control generally under our law, but through a unit system and the only purpose of it could be is to see that a minority prevails because one or the other must. 
    If you try the classification of voters, qualified voters, that to the State is to aside who is a qualified voter, in order to give one man a greater vote there is an opposite side of this coin. 
    You have had to give somebody else a lesser vote, so obvious the classification in the field of voting must in necessity involve discrimination. 
    Now, I should like to point out that --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course, as you've indicated the -- as you've implicitly indicated that a State is not without power to discriminate in what might seem an arbitrary way among voters that -- isn't that correct that Georgia, as I understand you, if you're 18 years old, you can vote.
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="2847.462" stopTime="2848.066">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2848.066" stopTime="2851.390">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But you can't vote if you're 17 years, 364 days old?
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="2851.390" stopTime="2855.442">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    That's a perfectly proper classification, I should think, the age classification.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2855.442" stopTime="2858.042">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, somebody of that latter age might think it's pretty arbitrary?
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="2858.042" stopTime="2865.526">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    But he might very well do so, but I think that I could defend that sir and I would be prepared to do so if that were the issue, but --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2865.526" stopTime="2873.704">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And I suppose a State could say to a person who's lived in a -- in a precinct or in a county only 29 days that you can't vote or somebody (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    I think they're all (Voice Overlap) to this but I think that particular suggestion appeals to me as a reasonable one. 
    I might say this sir, under the law of Georgia in Talbert versus Long, our Supreme Court has said that the qualifications of voters are established in the Constitution, Article II Section 2 and that once that classification has been established in the Constitution, the power to further classify is exhausted and the legislature has no further power.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2901.693" stopTime="2902.836">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's as a matter of your State Constitution?
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="2902.836" stopTime="2976.504">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    A matter of State Constitution. 
    Now sirs, prior to 1962, it shall be my contention here, the county unit system had developed into the irrational, discriminatory practice. 
    And this had been permitted because it was favorable to those who control the political system of Georgia. 
    But the new Act of 1962, I shall try to demonstrate was a deliberately discriminatory device. 
    It didn't just grow. 
    It was created in a few days of the General Assembly session. 
    In answer to my Brother's argument that this is something that the people through their Representatives want, I would point out at the threshold of the argument that the Georgia legislature which passed this unit system which is presently under attack and was held void was a legislature whose Lower House represented 22% of the people. 
    The majority of the House represented 22% of the people and the majority of the Senate, it's now been reapportioned which passed this Act was elected sirs, by 5.5% of the people of Georgia due to the rotation system which I can't go into.

    Oh, yes sir, because we have not had sir, in dealing with history which I presumed is permissible, we have not had a Governor of Georgia elected in the last four decades from a major county. 
    This Governor qualified after the unit system was knocked out, he was not going to run for Governor. 
    He was induced to run. 
    It is generally recognized because the unit system was knocked out. 
    The votes that were cast in the urban counties of Georgia were enormous, the registration just surged forward and the people went to the polls this time. 
    Mayor Hartsfield's affidavit shows that it has not been customary for people in the urban counties to register or vote to anything like it, the proportionate numbers they are to the population because the fact your vote didn't count.

    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    The Court is correct, yes. 
    Now sir, I should like to proceed on a more orderly basis and in order for the Court may know the course I'm going to take, I should like to say that first I'm going to try to examine the unit system. 
    Second, I'm going to mention very briefly the point alluded to by Mr. Justice White, that is the constitutional protection of this primary, but I'm going to deal at little length on the question of whether or not this primary effectively controls the election of the United State Senator because I think the Seventeenth Amendment question could be in this case. 
    And then I'm going to try to measure the county unit statute against the Fourteenth Amendment in practice and principle. 
    And then I'm going to briefly discuss the Seventeenth Amendment question. 
    Now to begin with, I think Mr. Justice White was correct when he asked the question or if there was an implication in the question, what would be the effect of Georgia saying that a man in Echols County shall have seven-and-a-half ballots, a man in Clayton, one ballot, DeKalb, three-fifths of a ballot, a man in Fulton half a ballot, a man just one county removed, three-and-a-half ballots, a man over a county line, one-and-a-fifth ballots. 
    For no matter how you look at the unit system this is precisely its effect and that's what it's designed to achieve. 
    The system is further more compounded in its effect by the fact that a man does not have to get the majority of the votes of the county in order to carry the full county units straight to the county. 
    In a five-man race, a man may get 30% of the votes of a county and carry the full unit vote of the county thus reversing the vote for those who voted against him who were in the majority. 
    It is for this reason that the system contrived to produce some rather absurd results. 
    For example in 1954, the Governor of Georgia was overwhelmingly elected by unit votes though he only received 36% of the popular votes and 72% of the people had in fact voted for somebody else.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="3183.907" stopTime="3186.271">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    That is not possible under the amendment.
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3186.271" stopTime="3188.030">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Oh, yes sir, it is possible under the amendments.

    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    No, sir. 
    He must, but if Your Honor, if there -- one man has the majority of the popular vote and the other man has a majority of the unit vote then they get into a run-off under a unit vote. 
    And then you got the man who won the popular vote tagged, there's a popular vote candidate in a county unit election which of course would be politically disastrous. 
    Now, the system I said a moment ago, prior to 1962 --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3220.349" stopTime="3223.661">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You mean this would be a -- this would be a terrible political liability to be known --

speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3227.073" stopTime="3254.821">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    It would be that sir and Mayor Hartsfield's affidavit in the record shows why there were campaign after campaign of scorn and vilifications directed against the most people of the State who lived in urban centers, day after day from the start. 
    The record shows this, the kind of language that was used against people from cities. 
    And the kind of a program hit upon the cities in election after election by people who presumably were trying to represent it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3254.821" stopTime="3259.761">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I've heard this that about some people that nobody has formed but the people, but I didn't realize that it was such a terrible (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3259.761" stopTime="3326.991">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Well, under the unit system, it doesn't help if the people have (Inaudible), if the units are against you. 
    The record is complete I think on that point sir. 
    Now, when the Governor called the legislature after this suit was filed, he called it and I quote his call, “To preserve, protect and defend the traditional democratic institutions existing in this State,” meaning the unit system. 
    There is on the record an affidavit from a legislator who was present at the briefing sessions about this legislation and I'd like to read to you what he said went on there. 
    “The general tenure of the briefings of the Governor and the Attorney General and the associated counsel present at said meeting of April the 10th, 1962 was to preserve, protect the county unit system, maintaining as far as possible existing discrimination ratios, and to do as little as possible to correct these and at the same time attempting to prevent further intervention by the federal courts.” 
    Now, I might say that there is not one scintilla of evidence in this record to contradict this purpose and intent which was -- which was flagrantly demonstrated in the trial of the case below.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3326.991" stopTime="3329.805">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is there any legislative debates on there?
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3329.805" stopTime="3494.758">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Sir, we don't keep records of legislature debates. 
    We don't have committee reports in general either sir. 
    Now the system as it was devised is a bracket system. From zero to 15,000 population, you get two units, then you get another unit for additional 4999 people, then a unit for 9999, then a unit for 14,999, then a unit for 14,999 and then two units for 29,999. 
    Now, it's rather curious, 30,000 people at the bottom of the scale get four units, 30,000 additional people at the top of the scale get two units. 
    29,999 people at the bottom of the scale get four units, but 29,998 people at the top of the scale get no units. 
    Now, it's mentioned that the history of the unit system supports this. 
    I might point out -- I'm going to argue that no unit system is permissible because the -- of course the decision below was standard, the Court adapted that principle which I think is the correct principle in this case. 
    But in 1970, 50.5% of the people had forty-four and eight-tenths percent of units. 
    The effect of the system as demonstrated in the Hartsfield affidavit has been -- it has been politically profitable for candidates for statewide officers to run races in which direct attacks are made upon the centers having the greatest population. 
    No man from Fulton County has served as Governor for four decades. 
    No Fulton man or United States Senator in the 20th Century. 
    There hasn't been a Fulton County Congressman serving a full term for 25 years until the unit system was voluntarily abandoned and Congressman James Davis who had been twice elected by a minority vote and twice defeated by a majority was sent home and a new man returned to Washington. 
    There was, as Mayor Hartsfield has pointed out, a tremendous lack of interest in elections growing out of this state of affairs. 
    I might point out further that there is not one sentence in this record which shows that any public permissible good or and was achieved by the unit system or prevented by it. 
    The record does show however, and I think by plenty of evidence that there is a connection between the county unit system, a Negro disfranchisement. 
    Now, I shan't go into this at great length but the basic premise of this argument --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3494.758" stopTime="3497.082">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It does not make any – you're not relying on the Fifteenth Amendment?
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3497.082" stopTime="3497.894">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    No, sir. 
    But the (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3497.894" stopTime="3499.440">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well then what's the point of your argument at all?
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3499.440" stopTime="3508.352">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Well, in Nixon versus Herndon, it was said by the Court, Mr. Justice Holmes that the violation of the Fourteenth Amendment was so great he didn't have to rule under the Fifteenth Amendment.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3508.352" stopTime="3509.642">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that's your argument here too.
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3509.642" stopTime="3510.494">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    And that will be my argument here too.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3510.494" stopTime="3511.497">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So why do you --
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3511.497" stopTime="3673.013">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Well, I mentioned it only to show that the purpose of this, this deliberate discrimination and the reason for permitting this -- this secular discrimination over a long period to develop was that it was giving a great deal of benefit to those who wish to depress and to void the Negro franchise. 
    But I think it's only fair to say that I don't want to say anything more about it except the record shows that where the county unit power gave to the inbuilt political apparatus, the greatest advantage there, you had real Negro disfranchisement and in certain counties with large Negro populations, with high unit values, no votes at all from Negroes. 
    On the other hand, in the urban counties where the Negroes were voting and of reasonable proportion of their population, their votes didn't count. 
    It ends up in a statement by Professor Banner which is in the record. 
    These facts had a considerable bearing upon the determination of rural lawmakers to maintain the county unit system. 
    Now, maintain it, they have. 
    In 1952 and in 1950, a constitutional amendment was submitted by the legislature having them passed by two-thirds of both Houses to the people of the State to engraft the system upon the Constitution and each election by popular vote of about 30,000 majority, the attempt was defeated. 
    I don't think it would have been possible that there would have been any change in this had it not been for Baker versus Carr and the intervention of the federal court below. 
    And I might quote Mr. Madison on this principle who says in the debate on Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution, the right of the Congress to control the time, place and manner of elections, he said this. 
    “The inequality of representation in the legislature of a particular State would produce a like and equality in their representation in the national legislature as it was presumable that counties have power in the former would secure it to themselves in the latter and secure it to themselves they did in Georgia.” 
    I should like now to turn to the question whether this primary is protected and I want to read one statement, one sentence here from the Classic case which I think outlines it in its proper form. 
    Where the State law has made the primary an integral part of the procedure of choice or where in fact the primary effectively controls the choice, the right of the elector to have his ballot counted at the primary election includes the rights protected by Article I, Section 2.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3673.013" stopTime="3674.976">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The State law does not require a primary.
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3674.976" stopTime="3680.332">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    It does not, but it does say this, that if a primary be conducted, it shall be conducted by the unit system.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3680.332" stopTime="3697.901">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Has to be done in this way. 
    Is there anything -- forgetting now what the Constitution might or might not require, is there anything in the injunction which would prevent a group of democratic party leaders meeting and nominating the candidates for State office?
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3697.901" stopTime="3715.626">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    No sir, but there is a reason why it will not happen. 
    And that is when a man goes through a primary, he has got a badge of respectability attached to him which makes him a formidable candidate at the polls. 
    And that is one of the reasons, I suggest, why the Republican Party has not developed in Georgia, you can always make the argument they have nominated their man on a telephone.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3715.626" stopTime="3718.539">

speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3718.539" stopTime="3742.643">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Well, no sir, there are great many of them and many of them -- I must say that many of them are people of great substance and ability. 
    But the point is they are still not conducting a primary and I suspect one of the reasons they haven't is because they would have to do it by the unit system and they would be tarred with the same brush that they used in arguing against the Democratic candidates that they have a unit system of election.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3742.643" stopTime="3770.615">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just let me pursue my question once more in a different way. 
    If -- if there were -- if there were a convention, let's say to which the delegates came in kind of a county unit way, for instance in Connecticut, there's a convention of that kind, if I understand it, I don't know the detail, would that be a State action?

    Mr. Morris B. Abram

    That doctrine --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3812.921" stopTime="3814.956">

    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    That's right, on one-party states. 
    Now, on the two-party state I think the thing is less clear, but I should say that the two-party state still couldn't do certain things with respect to convention, they couldn't bar Negroes, I am sure the Fifteenth Amendment would control that.

    I must say I don't know what the Court would do with it if the case got here but my feeling is that that is not before us because in Georgia, the case before us without any doubt the Democratic Party controls the procedure of choice under the Classic doctrine.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3869.030" stopTime="3869.764">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I'm giving a case --
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3869.764" stopTime="3869.778">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Yes, I understand.

speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="3871.048" stopTime="4021.750">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    But I would say this, Terry versus Adams goes very far, because in that case you held it was state action for this Jaybird Party to have a nomination process, excluding Negroes with respect to what, with respect to county and precinct offices in a pre-primary -- primary entirely unregulated by state law. 
    Now under the doctrine of Terry versus Adams it wouldn't take much of an extension to get the kind of a problem that the Court is speaking of. 
    Now, whether or not the Georgia Primary is tantamount to election, I think you have the precedent of the Georgia Supreme Court in Thompson versus Talmadge which said this. 
    Over a period of approximately half a century before the drafting of the 1945 Constitution, throughout that period, there has been only one and one dominant political party in the state. 
    And Professor Banner says in his affidavit that Georgia has been one-party state since removal of federal troops in 1871, none but democrats have held the State Office since the 1890 decade after which period this party has been completely in control of statewide elections. 
    You have before you in the record the kind of voting that takes place in the general election as compared to the primary and non-presidential years and except when some grave constitutional questions are being presented for ratification which further demonstrates that this primary is a procedure of choice. 
    May it please the Court, I would like now to turn to this equal protection problem in this case and I want to start by saying that the Due Process Clause was pleaded in the complaint. 
    We have not stressed it before this Court for the reason that in Beadle versus Scholle, the Chief Justice stated this. 
    “As this Court has recognized discrimination maybe so unjustifiable as -- to be a violation of due process.” 
    And consequently, I think it would be well to address ourselves and myself to the question of the Equal Protection Clause. 
    Now, I start from the premise that voting is a personal right and this Court decided this point in U.S. versus Bathgate, I have already mentioned the fact that I think you've got to have some classification to give a minority some voice in the representation process and need no classification in order to achieve that in the election process, the franchise itself.

    That is without rhyme or reason I think as Mr. Justice Clark said in Baker versus Carr is an improper use of classification in this field if any classification beyond the classification of voter per se is permissible. 
    And I also might point out that irrational could also mean a system of discrimination to achieve what is an impermissible state policy, or one without some kind of reasonable objective in terms of what we generally regard as the end of state power.

    Georgia had a poll tax from (Inaudible).
speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="4516.503" stopTime="4780.672">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Georgia had a poll tax for many years. 
    It abolished the poll tax. 
    Now, in the Georgia system -- I'm sorry -- I'm -- I didn't -- I weren't referring to the question which I left, any classification which produces substantial discrimination and is irrational in a sense of capriciousness, no rhyme or reason, I would say is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. 
    Irrational may also mean that it may have a pattern, but seeks to achieve some kind of an impermissible state policy which is another way of saying that the discrimination is directed in hostility towards certain groups. 
    Now, the Georgia system has a discriminatory object and a capricious impact. 
    There is no pattern that you can discern in this system except that the larger the population, the less the vote of each voter shall be counted. 
    But, the system also can be viewed as discriminating as amongst counties in roughly the same population groupings, and in roughly the same geographical areas. 
    On page 22 of our brief, we point out some mountain counties. 
    Now, these counties are all small counties in the mountains. 
    Dawson, one vote for 1795 population, Towns one for 2269, Lumpkin, one for 3620, Rabun, one for 3728, Pickens, one for 4451, Franklin, one for 6637. 
    Then, you can go down in the Southwest section of the State, the old plantation belt and you will find discrimination ratios as great amongst those counties sirs as 1 to 1200 to 1 to 6500. 
    Then you can take the counties, this one is just on a random, that Board of the State on Florida and the discriminations ratios run from 1 unit assigned to 938 votes to 1 unit assigned for 8211 votes. 
    You can take it within Congressional districts and you will find counties adjoining each other in a Congressional district which has some maybe historical grouping. 
    You will find Crawford County adjoining Bibb and Crawford has one vote for 2900 and Bibb one for 11,000. Echols County adjoins Lowndes in Eighth Congressional District, Echols has 1 for 938 and DeKlab has 1 for 12,850 and so it goes. 
    Now actually, how much rationality is in the system? 
    In the lower court, a counsel was asked by one of the three judges. 
    Now, I am asking you, what was the purpose of making it all the way through, less units for thousand as the counties got large, rather than making it the same unit for a 1000? 
    What was the purpose behind that, the court asked. 
    Counsel replied, “Well, I don't know.” 
    The legislature passed this bill. 
    We have to take it whether or not it's valid and understandable by what it says. 
    The State does not suggest directly any permissible ends or state policy which could justify this classification. 
    And I am perhaps straining at an implication when I suggest that their brief and their argument here today, because it quoted Harrington Mills, suggest that there may be two. 
    They quote Harrington as saying not until the French romanticism was there any serious questioning of the principles of economic basis of politics. 
    Now, if this system has some economic base presumably, it's based upon the distributional of property or income or something like that, but if you will look at the Hammer affidavit on page 157 and 158 and nine of the brief, you will find that those counties that have the least personal income had the most votes. 
    Those counties have at least distribution of wages and farm products have the most votes and those counties that have the least property have the most votes. 
    And in each case, the growth, the progression of affairs is running against the counties that have the most votes.

    Justice Potter Stewart

speaker="morris_b_abram" startTime="4809.243" stopTime="4949.880">
    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    It has not in this. 
    But they do argue the second point very affirmatively. 
    They say that with regard to education, and this is the way they put that, quoting Mill, “However, frequently overlooked as Mills' insistence that vote should be weighted according to competency.” 
    And then they quote Mills directly, “It is not useful but hurtful that the Constitution of a country should declare ignorance to be entitled to as much power as knowledge.” 
    Now they come out on one side of that question. 
    Now, what's the record show? 
    The record shows that in the counties that have the least voting power, you've got the highest median educational levels. 
    In the old six-unit counties, you've got 10.66 being the median educational level and in the two-vote counties, you've got two-and-a-half years less. 
    Truth is that the record only shows one basis, hostility against people, the more people, the less the vote and the more the discrimination. 
    Now, I think this is the kind of a case which was alluded to, though not directly by Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Baker where they said, of Baker, this is not a case in which a state has through a device, however, sophisticated and oblique, denied Negroes or Jews or red-headed persons a vote or given them only a third or sixth of a vote, that was Gomillion versus Lightfoot. 
    This is a case -- leaving aside the racial elements, this case in which as state had deliberately given people on a basis not on their education, not on any basis if they are willing to stand up and tell us a half a vote or seven-and-a-half votes and that feels discrimination. 
    I must admit that there is a presumptive validity to state legislative acts, but once you have demonstrated the kind of discrimination implicit in this case in which a majority -- I'm sorry, in which a man maybe or in which a -- 50% of the people have only 31% of the units and in which it is mathematically possible to find a Governor elected by 50.5% of the votes in a two-man race and 6.1% of the votes in a five-man race. 
    Once you've demonstrated this, I think there was some burden on the State to put something in this record and they put not a word.

    But there was another unit system which I'm going to talk about in just a minute, Houston, Tennessee and stricken by their Supreme Court in 1937, I want to get into that in just a minute. 
    I want to refer the Court to the language of a case which I think has been frequently overlooked at least by me. 
    Mr. Justice Bradley in Missouri versus Lewis at 101 U.S. spoke these words. 
    “It is not impossible that a distinct territorial establishment and jurisdiction might be intended as, or might have the effect of a discrimination against a particular race or class, where such race or class should happen to be the principal occupants, just happen to be the principal occupants of a disfavored district. 
    Should such a case ever arise, it will be time enough then to consider it.” 
    This at least is such a case. 
    I might point out that on the merits, every Justice of this Court and every judge below who has ever considered the county unit system on its merits and thought it to be a justiciable issue has ruled it unconstitutional. 
    That was the opinion of Mr. Justice Andrews in South versus Peters. 
    It was the opinion of Mr. Justices Douglas and Black in South versus Peters. 
    It was the opinion of the three-judge court below in this case and it was also true with regard to Tennessee's Supreme Court in Gates versus Long decided in 1937. 
    Now, I'd like to go into that case in just a minute. 
    Tennessee erected a unit system by statute for a use in its primaries and under this system, every county had the same proportionate number of unit votes as its proportion was to the population as a whole with this exception. 
    No county should have more units than one-eighth of 1% of its population. 
    We have done an analysis of how the county in the system in Tennessee would have assigned units under the county unit system in Georgia? 
    How Georgia will assign units. 
    That appears in our brief. 
    Under the present unit law under attack in Georgia, Echols County has two units and Fulton has 40. 
    Under the Tennessee law, Fulton would have 695 and Echols would have three. 
    Yet applying the Equal Protection Clause, the State Supreme Court of Tennessee declared that system unconstitutional. 
    There has been some allusions and I am sure that the Court's thoughts will naturally turn to MacDougall versus Green and I think I should pay some attention to it. 
    The case did not say as I think my Brothers would agree that there is some room for geographic distribution of voting strength. 
    It stands only for a principle or permissible geographic distribution of voting initiative which is an entirely different thing.

    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    Yes sir, nominating petitions. 
    Now in that case, they rose under the desire of the Progressive Party in 1948 Government ballot and the law in Illinois required that you get 25,000 signatures, but of those 25,000 names, at least 200 had to come from each of 15 counties in the State. 
    Now, there are 102 counties in Illinois at the time and the record demonstrates that you could get 61 -- I'm sorry sir.

    Mr. Morris B. Abram 
    I'm not going to argue that the case was correctly decided, but I do say that under the principle of that case, there is a vast distinction between this case and the MacDougall case, the first distinction being political initiative rather than voting, and the second being the bite of the system. 
    For example, under the Illinois system, Cook County had 52% of the population by the 1940 census and you could get 61% of the signatures under that law from Cook County. 
    There were at that time at least 49 other counties with more than 25,000 population which meant that to get 200 signatures in each of these 49 counties leaving aside the 51 other counties that you could've gone to, you would've been getting only eight-tenths of 1% of the people to sign your nominating petition. 
    And this Court apparently thought it was a reasonable device. 
    Now, I would like to turn for a moment to the Seventeenth Amendment claim. 
    The language of the Seventeenth Amendment on this point is clear. 
    The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State elected by the people thereof and it doesn't stop there. 
    It was very careful to decide and to determine who those people shall be, it said this. 
    The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures. 
    It said, the State can determine who these electors shall be and Georgia has. 
    Georgia has said it in these words of its Constitution. 
    Every citizen of this state who is a citizen of United States, 18 years or upwards not laboring under any disabilities named in this article and possessing the qualifications provided by it shall be a qualified voter. 
    So Georgia has now decided who the elector shall be under the Seventeenth Amendment. 
    Now, having decided who the elector shall be, the state legislature has determined that these electors shall not elect the United States Senator from Georgia. 
    He is in fact and has been in fact since Reconstruction, elected by not living human beings or qualified electors, but by county units and a unit is not a person. 
    There is no way to change a unit into a person and if the legislative history of the Seventeenth Amendment demonstrates a desire to get rid of the indirect election of Senators, this system of course grabs an indirect election upon us. 
    I should like to conclude by saying --

    There had been about five county unit cases that have attempted to reach this Court and every time we tried to reach this Court, we tether between mootness and prematurity. 
    If we file the petition in equity, pertaining to our election before the State Democratic Executive Committee has met to determine whether there shall be a primary, we are met at the threshold by the argument but we don't know whether we're going to have a primary or not and you are premature. 
    But if we wait until at the last minute, they decide to hold a primary which means the unit system then applies, then we are in a great race to get to this Court, because otherwise under the doctrine of U.S. versus Anchor Coal Company, we then -- be moot which is the way we read the disposition of the original county unit cases in this Court. 
    So consequently, we are constantly tethering between prematurity and mootness. 
    This is one of the few cases that in which there was enough speed below to afford a relief and an opportunity to reach this tribunal.

    The practice there Mr. Justice Clark is this. 
    Under the rules of the party whether or not the unit system is employed in a congressional primary depends upon the decision of the democratic executive committee which governs that primary. 
    That committee by the way is always named by the incumbent Congressman provided he is a democrat, incidentally all are Democrats, is named by the incumbent Congressman. 
    So the Congressman does have under this system a way of determining under which system I want to run. 
    Whether I want to get elected by unit votes or whether I can best throw myself on the wishes of the people.

    My judgment is, my view is, that -- and I am the one with the Government on this, the decision below was correct in invalidating the county unit system as amended.

    It's been foreshadowed by some conversation already. 
    The thing I'm going to say and that is that the worse that can happen, if this Court upholds the court below is that everybody in Georgia can have a vote who has been declared a valid qualified voter by the Constitution of the State. 
    And furthermore, I do not think there is any way that you can uphold this system even if you don't say a system is per se unconstitutional, until you can say that two equals four or feel that 50 cents is the proper amount of change for a dollar or that you can give eight ounces per pound.

   Argument of Robert F. Kennedy
speaker="robert_f_kennedy" startTime="5975.976" stopTime="6592.205">
    Mr. Robert F. Kennedy 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would first like to state the interest of the United States in this case. 
    Declaration of independent states a principle which is basic to our American way of life, namely that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the people. 
    In periodic elections here in the United States, we select our leaders. 
    If we become dissatisfied, we select new leaders. 
    So therefore, the free and unencumbered exercise with a franchise is basic to American system. 
    We believe that this free and unencumbered exercise with the franchise is under serious challenge in an arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory fashion in the State of Georgia. 
    But we believe that this evil is not confined to the State of Georgia as the Court heard in the Tennessee cases last term. 
    Districts have been so arranged in certain areas of the United States that an individual in one area has 10, 15, 50 or 100 times the vote strength of an individual in another area. 
    The United States Government has a responsibility to do all in its power to ensure that those who have been disfranchised in whole or in part that that right is restored to them. 
    That in this effort to also restore some confidence in representative government where this kind of practices exists. 
    In Baker versus Carr, this Court has determined that the weighing or dilution of votes through malapportionment was justiciable in the federal courts under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    This is the first case in which the Court has been asked to pass upon the major substantive constitutional issue. 
    Therefore, the principles enunciated in this case will have an effect on millions of Americans who have been deprived in whole or in part of their franchise. 
    The issues involved in this case really are relatively simple. 
    First, as far as the facts are concerned, there has been a gross and arbitrary discrimination against the voters who live in the urban areas in favor of those who live in rural areas. 
    And number two that that gross discrimination is in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Beyond that, we don't feel that it is necessary for the Court to go. 
    We don't think it's necessary for the Court to accept some hypothetical variant to this system which the Georgia legislature may pass in the future. 
    We don't think that the Court should limit its future actions in this field by accepting a standards -- standard which may or may not be applicable to other states under other circumstances in other parts of the union. 
    In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, the discrimination is gross, but before I get into a discussion of that, I would like to discuss just briefly about what we feel the scope of this case is in view with some of the questions that has been raised. 
    First, we are not against a county unit system as such. 
    We are against the Georgia County Unit System because it discriminates against those who live in urban areas in favor of those who live in rural areas. 
    And number two, we're not saying or contending that under all circumstances in every situation, that every vote must be given equal weight. 
    If you have a unit system or if you have a representative form of government with Representatives that elected to the legislature other than statewide election, you're bound to have some departure from exact equality. 
    Further, there are other theories of representation. 
    You might take into consideration geography, you might take into consideration historical background and you might take into consideration economic interests and a number of other matters. 
    These kinds of departures -- perhaps they are harmless or perhaps they are necessary or perhaps are unavoidable. 
    The fact is in the Georgia County Unit System however that the departures are not harmless, are not unavoidable and are not necessary. 
    Further, I think that we should remember that we are considering here a statewide election for statewide offices. 
    We're not -- we don't have to get really involved in various theories of representation. 
    Here is one man, one vote. 
    You can have equality. 
    We feel that, however, if you depart at all from this equality that it should meet the most exacting test, it should be subject to the most exacting test and that we feel at a minimum that test should be -- that the departure should be minimal. 
    And number two that it should be -- to further some part of the elective process. 
    We feel that what has happened in the State of Georgia under the Georgia County Unit System is not a departure that is minimal, is not harmless. 
    Let me just give you some examples. 
    If you live in one of the eleven smallest counties in the State of Georgia, your vote is worth seven-and-a-half times an individual who lives in one of the four larger counties in the State of Georgia. 
    If you live in Savannah, Georgia, your vote is worth four times if -- if the -- you have to get four votes in Savannah, Georgia to offset one vote in Glascock County, Georgia. 
    If you live in Fulton County, Georgia with Atlanta, you have to get 14 votes to offset one vote in Echols County. 
    A third of the populations living in the smallest county in the State of Georgia have a majority of the unit votes. 
    We used to have, and I repeat used to have, a saying in my City of Boston which was vote early, and vote often. 
    If -- if you live in one of the small counties in the State of Georgia, all you have to do is vote early and you accomplish the same result. 
    Conversely, a majority of the population living in the larger counties in the city -- in the State of Georgia have only a third of the unit votes. 
    If you live in one of the large counties in the State of Georgia, you've got one unit vote for every 12,889 people. 
    If you live in one of the smaller counties, one of the eleven smaller counties in the State of Georgia, you have one unit vote for every 17,115 people. 
    If you live in one of the 116 of the smallest counties in the State of Georgia, you have 251 unit votes. 
    But the same population in the four largest counties in the State of Georgia, approximately the same population has only 90 votes, a discrimination of almost three to one. 
    Now, this is -- this kind of discrimination is unfair as giving everybody who lives in the Eastern part of the state 10 votes for every person who lives in the Western part of the state or people who have red hair five times their vote value of those who have blond hair or those who have white skins, 10 times the vote of those who have dark skin. 
    And this voting disparity has had a major result in the State of Georgia. 
    If you're living in Fulton County, you pay -- in 1960 you paid about $80 million in taxes to the State of Georgia. 
    That from the State of Georgia to Fulton County came approximately $22 million. 
    The other $59 million was used elsewhere in the State of Georgia mostly for the smaller counties. 
    If you live in one of the seven largest counties in the State of Georgia, you paid in 1960 a $160 million worth of taxes, $60 million of that was used elsewhere in the State, $60 million, excuse me, was used in those eleven counties. 
    The rest of it, the $100 million was used elsewhere in the State. 
    Now, what happens in Echols County? 
    Echols County paid $82,000 in taxes in 1960, but they received back from the State $280,000. 
    If you live in one of the eleven smallest counties in the State of Georgia, in 1960, you paid $2 million in taxes to the State of Georgia, back from the State however, you received $4,500,000 in taxes. 
    A person living in Fulton County, the State there -- the county there pays $3.66 for every dollar they received back from the State. 
    But if you live in Echols County, you receive back from the State $3.40 for every dollar that you paid in. 
    The per capita tax in one of the largest -- in the largest counties in the State of Georgia in 1960 was $77 per capita. 
    In the smallest counties in the State of Georgia, it was $19 per capita. 
    And yet what you received back from the State of Georgia, if you lived in one of the largest counties in the State of Georgia, you at least received back $22 per capita and if you lived in one of the largest counties, you received back $69 per capita. 
    Well, I'm not contending here that this money that was used by the State of the Georgia in these smallest counties was not for good purposes. 
    I'm not contending that there should not have been perhaps some discrimination between the taxes that were being paid by the larger counties and the smaller counties because the larger counties are better off financially. 
    But I do say that if you're -- if the large counties of the State of Georgia are going to pay the bills for the small counties, certainly their vote should count as much. 
    Certainly when you consider what has happened in Fulton County and Echols County, a vote in Echols County being worth 14 times the amount of the vote in Fulton County. 
    We hear and we talk a great deal about state's rights, but to turn the coin of state's rights over and you get state's responsibilities. 
    There are many things that need to be done in the major metropolitan areas of the United States or problems of the urban renewal, of the purification of water, of transportation, of education, of juvenile delinquency and many of these problems are being ignored. 
    And while you have a system as you have in the State of Georgia or on the Georgia County Unit System where there is the great advantage for those who live in the rural areas in favor of those who live in the urban area. 
    The people in the urban areas are always going to figure and figure correctly that they are second class citizens and those in the rural areas are the ones that are going to reign supreme.

    Mr. Robert F. Kennedy 
    Now, the justification that has been offered for this discriminatory system is that those in the rural areas are not as able -- well-able to organize themselves that they don't -- they are not as articulate as far as politics is concerned and they don't take as active interest in politics. 
    I think that that contention does not bear upon to the facts. 
    I think that anybody that is in public life that has represented a rural area is found that his constituents are articulate, are vocal, are strong and well-able to take care of themselves. 
    I think that the statistics at least of the elections in the last few years have shown that those in rural areas take a very active interest in politics. 
    For instance, in the 1960 election, the -- it was five states which were primary rule in the United States which led all the others as far as vote participation. 
    Idaho with 80.8%, New Hampshire with 80.6%, Utah with 80% and the two North Dakota and South Dakota with approximately 79%. 
    The City of New York, 59% of the eligible voters voted in the election in 1960. 
    Outside the City of New York, however, was 77%. 
    Approximately 50% of the people in Newark, New Jersey voted in the election, but outside the City of Newark, the percentage was far, far higher. 
    In Illinois, the vote in the down state counties of Illinois, the rural county was much higher by and large than the wards of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois. 
    The contention is what they'd -- that they don't vote as much as a block. 
    They don't vote as much as a unit. 
    They don't get together as much. 
    I don't think that that is borne out either. 
    Of the 75 counties in the 1960 election in the United States which voted for more than 80% for one candidate or another, all but one of those 75 counties was a -- had a population of less than 50,000. 
    But even assuming -- even assuming that this contention was correct, Mr. Chief Justice, I still don't think that it bears up. 
    It's a -- we put a great premium in United States on participation in elections, getting together and organizing them. 
    And if we -- if the State of Georgia can penalize those who are well-organized, there is nothing to prohibit a State from penalizing the members of the American Medical Association for being better organized and housewives for instance. 
    Or even members of labor organizations because they happened to be better organized than say, some other group.

    That number two, that if there is any variation of this that it has to be to further the elective process, that idea can be followed by states. 
    The reasonable men in our state legislatures and those who have the responsibilities in our state can follow that.

    And the -- another justification that has been used for this kind of practice in the State of the Georgia is that one area or one county will still dominate the State that -- that would be -- the rest of these voters in the State will be overwhelmed. 
    That -- that's -- really doesn't bear up because the biggest county in the State of Georgia is Fulton County with only 14% of the vote. 
    Well then if they say that's the geographical area, well, the DeKalb County borders which is the next biggest county borders on Fulton County, but the rest of the large counties are spread around the State. 
    For instance, the third biggest, the Chatham County which contains Savannah which is on the East Coast and you have Muscogee County which is the fourth largest county, and that is on the west side of the State. 
    Bibb County is the fifth largest and that's in the central part of the State and the rest of them are all spread around. 
    So it's not any geographical group that could so dominate or control the State which would cause this danger. 
    And it's hardly a justification for penalizing those who live in these major metropolitan areas, penalizing their vote strength by 50% and rewarding those who happen to be, maybe who live just a few miles away in a small rural county who is only comparative virtue appears to be that they live in a area that has a small population.

    Now, it's a -- didn't argued also that this is comparable to the electoral college, Mr. Chief Justice and that you have some variance in the electoral college and so that therefore you should also have it here or can have it here. 
    I don't think that really bears up. 
    I don't think the analogy is correct because there is a far difference, a great difference between the states who gave up their sovereignty and there were concessions made. 
    When they gave up their sovereignty to create the United States, one of the concessions that was made to them was the fact that they would have the equivalent vote in the electoral college, equivalent to the number of Senators had -- they had plus the numbers of Representatives they had. 
    Now this, I -- I'm in disagreement with the brief of the appellants and the argument of the appellants that this was all like problem between the English system and the French system and Thomas Jefferson and Adams and others were involved in determining whether they really believed in democracy or not. 
    There wasn't any question about believing in democracy but the struggle at that time was between the large states and the small states. 
    And there wasn't anybody that contended that there was greater democracy in one state over another state, but there was this problem between large states and the small states. 
    The idea that there was this English-French system, that really wasn't taken up, I don't think it's borne out by a study of the debate of the constitutional convention. 
    The English-French system and the merits of them were taken up after the constitutional convention rather the -- it might be that there's some confusion about Mr. Harrington, Mr. Harrington, who was a quoted, lived in the 18th Century. 
    And I believe that quotes come from Mr. Parrington's book who was a -- wrote about the American Scene in the 20th Century. 
    So, some of the confusion might arise out of that. 
    There is also contended that we don't really have enough cases for the Court to pass on. 
    That there is -- there hasn't been enough litigation in connection with this matter for the Court to make any decision. 
    I don't think that that bears up in -- when the Constitution was written, we didn't have decisions on due process or commerce between the states or freedom of speech, but we made important progress in all of these fields under the general umbrella of the Constitution and under the guidance of the Supreme Court. 
    When George Washington was President, you didn't have railroads, you didn't have automobiles let alone jet aircraft. 
    But the great miracle of the Constitution is that we've been able to deal with the problems of the 20th Century as well as the problems of the 18th Century. 
    These are the great problems that are facing the United States at the present time. 
    And this kind of invidious practice that exists now and has existed before and the Georgia County Unit System is a -- strikes at the very heart of the United States. 
    If we can give equal protection to those who feel that they've been deprived of their economic rights, certainly we can give equal protection to those who have been deprived of the most basic right of all which is the right to vote. 
    If we cannot protect them, then the whole fabric of American the system, then our way of life is irreparably damaged.

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    Please the Court. 
    I think the Seventeenth Amendment in this case proves too much. 
    Because if it is true, if it is a correct position. 
    The result would necessarily follow that in any state where nomination was tantamount to election, you could not nominate by a convention. 
    Reference was made to some State Constitution provisions defining the right to vote. 
    The Georgia Supreme Court held in Cox versus Peters that they related only to the general election and not to the primary, that's binding on this Court as far as with reference to state law. 
    A statement was also made that the winning candidate for Governor was induced to run by virtue of the county unit system being stricken down. 
    That simply is not so. 
    I don't want to involve myself in personalities, but I think I know where of -- I speak in that regard. 
    So also to suggest --

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    Mr. Abram stated in his argument that the successful candidate for Governor in Georgia in -- of a 1962 General Election was encouraged to run because of invalidation of the county unit system in the court case below and I simply said that was not so.

    (Inaudible) not very important one way or the other?

    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    No sir. 
    I hope not. 
    Next, we have not suggested as has been stated by reference to Parrington and by the way I forgot the “H” instead of a “P” there, it should have been Harrington, that the county unit system is based on the economic basis of apportionment. 
    We say that it's based on political unit apportionment, not geographically, but its political unit apportionment.

    Position of the State is that in it -- that these things of those features which tend to give these concentrated areas of population in an inordinate amount of power by virtue of the fact of the concentrated numbers, that that -- the State can take those matters into account. 
    And I think that's always been the basis upon which this type of apportionment has been explained.

    It's not just because you're in the labor union, but if you live in an area of concentrated population density where there are avenues for communication, where the mass media of communication can organize people along much more cohesive groupings than you have in the rural areas. 
    We think that those disparities in power are just as relevant when a state comes to apportion its electrical -- its electoral power, as are the disparities in bargaining when Congress passed a (Inaudible).

    The basic -- the basic issue that we end up with I suppose is whether a state under the Constitution in the election process of statewide officials, statewide officials can absolutely disregard the -- what we think of is the traditional American system of majority rule?

speaker="e_freeman_leverett" startTime="7886.070" stopTime="7955.764">
    Mr. E. Freeman Leverett 
    -- Chief Justice -- the question of the Chief Justice which I think relates to what you have posited now Mr. Justice Stewart, you do not have to go to districting to -- in your legislative area because you can get perfect equality of voting power in a legislative situation simply by doing the same thing that was done with respect to Congress in many states until 1842 when districting came, required by Act of Congress. 
    You could have a state at large election and have perfect equality. 
    But in order to get a diffusion, in order to give recognition to local interest, you district a state and then it's where your inequalities come into. 
    MacDougall, we say as our case, I think it states very eloquently the reasons, the basis that we say this county unit system should be upheld. 
    We put in our answer, our verified answers at page 72 to 73 of the record and it has just as much probative value as the opinionated affidavits that the other party put in. 
    If it please the Court, I think that's -- my time is up so, I appreciate the Court's indulgence.
