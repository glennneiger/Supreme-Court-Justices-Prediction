    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday Your Honor I believe you asked me to check in the [Inaudible] of the number of colored children that are now attending desegregated schools in the City of Memphis and I have that information.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="34.104" stopTime="34.585">

    Thank you.

    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    There are presently 63 colored school children attending desegregated schools in the City of Memphis. 
    The program of desegregation was commenced in the Fall of 1961 with the first grade and in the Fall of 1962 the second and third grades were desegregated. 
    These 63 school children do not include an undetermined number of colored children who were assigned to the desegregated schools, but who asked to be reassigned to all colored schools. 
    I don't have that number, may it please the Court. 
    I might state this with respect to the schools because it does have considerable relevancy here that on May the 22nd next there is scheduled a hearing in the District Court at Memphis. 
    Both the Board of Education and the NAACP have presented proposed plans for further integration of the public schools. 
    Under the NAACP plan, the first six grades would be integrated this Fall and seven, eight, and nine in the Fall of 1964 and the remaining grades in the Fall of 1965. 
    Under the Board of Education plan, the first four grades would be integrated this year and then one grade a year here after until the program is terminated. 
    So that is the situation with respect to schools.

    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    Now with respect to the parochial school and that has some relevance because the Park Commission operates playgrounds on parochial school property. 
    Bishop Adrian of Nashville has recently announced that the parochial schools in Tennessee would commence their program of desegregation this Fall on a gradual basis. 
    Now, up to address myself to the problem at hand, the recreational facilities of the City of Memphis. 
    The undisputed proof shows these facts, may it please the Court that 56 of the 117 supervised playgrounds, which accommodate 100,000 children in supervised play, are on school and Church property. 
    The Park Commission in its thinking and in evolving its plan with respect to complying with the Brown case felt that it would not be wise to desegregate the playgrounds on the Church properties and the school properties until those institutions themselves were desegregated. 
    It was thought that that would not be in the best interest of the people as a whole. 
    Yes sir?

    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    Not all of it, if Your Honor please, some of it. 
    For instance basketball takes place in the school gymnasiums. 
    Of course baseball would take place on the school playgrounds. 
    Most of it would take place after school hours, but much of the supervised play would take place during the school terms. 
    A great portion of it of course takes place in the summer time. 
    And I would judge that the greater percentage of the supervised play does take place in the summer time when the schools are not in session. 
    But with respect to basketball and baseball and other activities the recreational activity does take place during the school time. 
    Now, the proof also shows this, may it please the Court, with respect to all of the 117 playgrounds that if the relief sought here is granted and all of the playgrounds are desegregated at the same time that the supervisory staff that now supervises the play of these 100,000 children will not be adequate and that more supervisors will have to be trained and employed to give proper supervision and proper protection to these children during this transition period, it's contemplated. 
    The necessary result of that, may it please the Court, would be that a large number of children would not receive the benefits of supervised play that they are now receiving and the Park Commission feels that that is tremendously important thing for all of the people of Memphis, especially to keep the children off the streets during the summer vacation period. 
    And I don't believe that I need any citation of authority otherwise to demonstrate how important that is to any city. 
    This playground system of Memphis, we feel, is one of the finest in the country and we feel that it has been developed over a period of years to the point where it is one of the most important facets of our community life. 
    We recognize, may it please the Court that we must comply with the established law that all of the playgrounds must be open to all children colored and white, but we feel that additional time yet is necessary, recognizing that it has been eight years since the Brown decision. 
    But we feel that experience has shown that where this program can be developed on a gradual basis without an injunction hanging over the heads of our people and authority that we can develop it in such a way that it will not create confusion or disarray and will give protection and supervision to all of these children. 
    The Park Commission certainly from the concurrent finding of both Lower Courts has acted in unquestioned good faith in trying to carry out what we felt was the law as announced in the second Brown decision. 
    But we feel that some additional time is necessary, bearing in the mind that the only question before this Court is whether or not the Lower Courts had any discretion save to issue an immediate injunction. 
    The adequacy of the plan that I filed on yesterday, the adequacy of any plan has never been presented to the District Court or to the Court of Appeals. 
    This appeal was taken before we had an opportunity to allow the District Judge to adjudicate with respect to the full plan. 
    And as I stated yesterday, we don't say that this plan that we've got enough is the magic answer or that it will be adequate or that it will be sufficient. 
    It is the best plan that we've been able to devise and we feel that the District Judge should have an opportunity to adjudicate with respect to that plan and if it is inadequate to accelerate it or to take what other steps might be necessary, that's our position. 
    If they --

    Mr. Prewitt may I ask you this. 
    I understood Mrs. Motley to say that practically all or at least a great many of the parts that you have desegregated were merely little squares or little triangles that, where they had a statue and a few -- in a few chair, few seats that people could sit in. 
    Is that the fact then and if so how many general playgrounds have you in these last nine years desegregated for the use of all people?
speaker="thomas_r_prewitt" startTime="592.477" stopTime="720.598">
    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    If Your Honor please in answer to your question, I would take issue with counsel on her statement. 
    I can't tell you how many of the 130 I believe parks and 117 playgrounds have been desegregated. 
    I will try to give you now some of the facilities that have been desegregated. 
    Six of the seven public golf courses, Crump Stadium, which was alluded to, has been desegregated. 
    The public zoo, the fairground, the lake boat dock and several, I'm not prepared to say exactly how many, several playgrounds have already been desegregated. 
    Several were desegregated last year and the program calls for additional desegregation this year. 
    But many, many parks and many, many facilities have been desegregated under the plan that's already been evolved. 
    And the Park Commission is complying with -- yes sir, counsel reminds me that all the tennis courts have been desegregated. 
    And I am safe in making this statement that there is no activity sponsored by the Park Commission which is not now open to both races. 
    There is no as distinguished from a particular playground at a particular place. 
    There are many playgrounds which are still segregated. 
    Most of them are neighborhood playgrounds, but there is no activity now except the Pink Palace Museum and it stands in a different light and I don't believe that it is going to be a significant problem. 
    In fact I think that it is very minor when considered in the light of the whole program.

    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    No sir it's been accelerated, in several different instances. 
    For instance I believe Winchester Park on the program was to be desegregated in 1965 and that has already been desegregated. 
    It was desegregated in 1962. 
    There are other instances of that type where the program has been accelerated and it will be accelerated, but we feel that it is difficult to plan ahead on a program as vast as this. 
    We recognize the problem and as time goes on and the Park Commission we believe will be able to make judgments as situations come up and accelerate the program in the exercise of its discretion.

    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    If Your Honor please, the only answer I can give to that is that the new parks as well as the old parks have to be considered as part of the overall system and the plan for desegregation takes into account all of the system, including new parks as well as the old parks and the program that we are trying to evolve will result of course in desegregation of all the parks. 
    In all candor, may it please the Court, I can add very little or detract from the opinion of the Court of Appeals. 
    I feel that the Court of Appeals has analyzed the evidence presented below, has concurred in the findings of the fact of the Trial Court, and has stated our position far better than I can state it. 
    We feel that since both Lower Courts found that the Park Commission acted in unquestioned good faith and that more time was necessary in order to accomplish an orderly desegregation of this vast recreational system, that the trial Judge was not in error in refusing to issue an injunction, which would order massive desegregation of every recreational facility in the City of Memphis.

    That was the basis, not that the community feeling was against it. 
    Of course I would be naïve even if I stood in front of this Court and said that the white people of Memphis were all for integration, but the opinion of the Court of Appeals did not take into account any hostility in rendering its opinion.

    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    If our plan that has been submitted to the Court, but has not been filed but which has been published is adopted, the playground will desegregated on a staggered basis until 1971 when at which time all of the playgrounds will be desegregated. 
    I cannot answer Your Honor's question that in 1965 our playground number 25 will be desegregated and in that area, the population is 50-50. 
    I just don't know, but it's a gradual program over a period of the next seven or eight years until 1971, taking around six or seven playgrounds a year or whatever is required. 
    We haven't attempted to gerrymander this proposition, but we have -- the Park Commission has attempted to desegregate areas which will be less troublesome first.

    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    Well, as I say, it's a voluntary participation, may it please the Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2069.989" stopTime="2096.217">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I was asking you a while back about voluntary participation in the park is distinguished from attendance of public schools and you said it was because the people of Memphis weren't ready to accept that and use the park in that spirit, that cause them to -- cause your authorities to do what they are doing on this basis.
speaker="thomas_r_prewitt" startTime="2096.217" stopTime="2163.043">
    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    Well, if Your Honor please, my answer – I will try to answer the Court's question in this way. 
    Actually, there is no segregation in housing in Memphis as such. 
    That is, there is no one particular area in Memphis where there are only colored people and other areas where there are only White people. 
    They are intermingled and scattered over the whole city. 
    This plan of desegregation would desegregate these various parks and playgrounds over a six to seven-year period until 1971. 
    And I can't answer Your Honor's question by saying that when the park number 25 is desegregated that only white people or only colored people will appear there.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2163.043" stopTime="2184.400">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well I didn't answer that, you told us that just a little while ago that the reason is Westchester one could be done in a manner that it was, was because it was so predominantly colored that when they desegregated it, the Whites wouldn't go there and therefore, you would have no trouble?
speaker="thomas_r_prewitt" startTime="2184.400" stopTime="2240.183">
    Mr. Thomas R. Prewitt 
    That was not the basic reason. 
    The reason was that the neighborhood around this particular park was almost entirely colored. 
    The White people can participate there if they wish, it's a voluntary situation. 
    That's about all I can say, Your Honor please. 
    Again, I submit to the Court that the question herein involved is whether or not the District Court and the Court of Appeals had any discretion save to issue an immediate injunction that was the only issue there, it's the only issue before this Court and if we are inadequate in our plans then that can be corrected and the Trial Judge will correct it, I'm sure.

    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    As Mr. Prewitt has stated the typewritten transcript of all of the testimony is here in this Court. 
    And on Page 45 of the first volume, it is made clear that those parks, which are already desegregated or which had been desegregated prior to the institution of the suit to 25 of these squares and the --

    25 [Inaudible]
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2276.060" stopTime="2279.769">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Yes sir, the 25 that had been already desegregated.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2279.769" stopTime="2281.773">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Those were all these little neighborhood squares?
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2281.773" stopTime="2350.818">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    That's right. 
    And as it appears on page 45 of the typewritten transcript of the testimony, at that time, the Superintendent of the parks was going over the list of all the facilities and he had in his hand Plaintiff's Exhibit 6 and he has the summary of all these facilities and there is one category on the top marked “General” and the Counsel examining him said, “Doesn't general mean these -- he said alright, in this category called general up there, number one, aren't they what you mean to say these parks with just benches and places like Fort Square, are they?” 
    Answer; “That is correct,” so that the facilities which were desegregated were mainly these squares with statues. 
    In fact, one of them is I think a little strip of land near the river with four or five benches and they call that a park, but actually it's just a little square that's been desegregated.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2350.818" stopTime="2375.670">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mrs. Motley, it's your position or at least your first position that with respect to a park and a playground system, there is no room for any delay of any kind, any place for any reason in delaying the compulsory immediate desegregation. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2375.670" stopTime="2379.976">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Yes, our first position is that with respect to public recreation --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2380.580" stopTime="2418.116">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    -- there is no need for the delay contemplated by this Court in the second Brown case because recreation is not like public schools, it's like desegregation of the buses and those have been desegregated in Memphis and many other communities, immediate in the sense of immediate here of course doesn't mean tomorrow, because no injunction was issued for ten days anyway and there maybe an appeal and a stay, but what we mean is that, that it should not be applied to this area, this gradualism, which is developed with respect to school --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2418.116" stopTime="2420.804">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, any gradualism at all, don't you mean?
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2420.804" stopTime="2423.434">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    That's right. 
    No gradualism at all is our first --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2423.434" stopTime="2429.302">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And this area, you don't mean Memphis, you mean the area of parks and playgrounds anywhere whether it be Memphis or Jackson, Mississippi or --
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2429.302" stopTime="2475.279">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Yes sir, yes that's correct. 
    And what they're attempting to do here really is to apply gradualism to the area of recreation such as now has developed with respect to the school. 
    Now, Mr. Prewitt also said that the District Court has not acted on their plan because that his hands were stayed. 
    Now, that seems to imply that we applied for a stay of the District Court's order or somebody did, but there was no stay here. 
    And of course, an appeal does not automatically stay proceedings in the District Court and it is my understanding that that plan has not been filed with the District Court, the ten-year plan.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2475.279" stopTime="2477.122">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There is no plan before this Court, is there?
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2477.122" stopTime="2489.548">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    That's right. 
    It has not been filed in the District Court, but as I said before, the Sixth Circuit has looked at it and now this Court has it because they say it's a public document, everybody knows what --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2489.548" stopTime="2491.645">

    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    That's right. 
    Yes that's absolutely correct. 
    Now, the point of --

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    [Inaudible]
speaker="constance_b_motley" startTime="2499.076" stopTime="2562.502">
    Ms. Constance B. Motley 
    Yes sir, that's what it is. 
    Now as to the more supervisors -- I think the answer to that was there -- desegregation is that, if 20,000 new white children should move into Memphis as the Sixth Circuit said in the Clemens case, the local authorities would take care of that and they would provide more supervisors or whatever is required to accommodate an additional increase in white children. 
    And the other thing is that there is more confusion now as a result of this gradualism and not less because Negroes are not advised when these parks are desegregated, they don't know which park they can go in and as the record says, you don't know until you go there and the policeman doesn't chase you and you can go. 
    So, this has resulted in more confusion rather than less. 
    Thank you.
