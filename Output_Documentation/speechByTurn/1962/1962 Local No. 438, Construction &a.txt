    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Local Number 438, Construction &amp; General Laborers’ Union, AFL-CIO, Petitioner, versus S.J. Curry et al. 
    Mr. Pearce, I believe you were arguing, you may continue your argument.
speaker="edwin_pearce" startTime="14.937" stopTime="252.594">
    Mr. Edwin Pearce 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The Court yesterday expressed interest in three areas and I think in view of my limited time I'd rather confine myself to those three areas that were mentioned and I will do that. 
    The areas to which I referred to a question of all, Mr. Justice Brennan expressed an interest in discussion of the Ledbetter case and I believe Mr. Justice Harlan expressed an interest in the writ of prohibition as a remedy and I believe Mr. Justice Goldberg expressed an interest in the possible adjudication through a contempt procedure of this area. 
    The Ledbetter case perhaps is best the starting point for that, a case I'm sure is committed to the members of the Court. 
    It arose out of Alabama. 
    An ex parte injunction was granted on application of the plaintiff without any hearing. 
    A motion to dissolve was made by the defendant union. 
    The motion was overruled. 
    The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed and it was brought here by certiorari. 
    And the Court with a dissent, ruled that the case did not present sufficient finality to warrant it being decided by this Court. 
    A thing or two about that case that I would like to mention. 
    It of course came at the time when the courts were just beginning to feel the impact of the Section 7 and other rights guaranteed by the Taft-Hartley Act which I believe was in 1947 and I believe this case finally reached this Court in 1952. 
    I suppose it was a trickle of new cases coming, but even at that time, the lawyers representing the unions realized that the temporary injunctive orders of the state courts were going to be used, at least in many areas, as an effective bar to exercise of these rights and for that reason that case was brought. 
    It was the argument made in that case as well as I can discern it from the opinion is that the case would be moot if it were not decided at that point and therefore, the petition would be without remedy. 
    There was an interesting thing said in that case, but I'm not sure what it means because I'm not familiar with Alabama procedure, but whatever it means, it's clearly furnishes a basis of distinction between that case and this case, the case at bar. 
    After stating that the case would become moot, the petition would be left without remedy, the Court said, “Well, we don't understand that to be a ground for enlarging our jurisdiction with respect to finality.” 
    Then this statement was made, “Furthermore, the interlocutory decree could have been readily converted into a final decree, and the appeal could have proceeded without question as to the jurisdiction just as effectively and expeditiously as the appeal from the interlocutory injunction was pursued in this case.” 
    The statement I'm interested in is, “could have been readily converted into a final judgment.” 
    Now whether that refers to any procedure in Alabama by which the defendant without the consent of the opposite party could request and obtain a conversion of a temporary order into a final judgment or whether it has reference, as I think it does, to the more speedy procedure in Alabama to which I have been to some extent exposed and know that a final trial can be normally reached there within perhaps a few weeks.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Pearce, I recall in my own practice in New Jersey in situations of this kind, it was possible for the defendant to consent the entry of a permanent injunction on the record on which the temporary order had issued and that's the way we used to avoid this.

    I stated that it may refer to that in Alabama. 
    It may also refer to the fact that only a few weeks will intervene in that state between the temporary hearing and the trial here om merits. 
    It could easily refer to either one, but whichever it refers to, let me make it very clear that in Georgia that cannot be done and if I --

    Could not have.

    -- could not have --
speaker="edwin_pearce" startTime="300.145" stopTime="341.181">
    Mr. Edwin Pearce 
    That if I may just make this statement, has been tried a number of times, I believe in these cases, these 45 cases most to which I managed to lose and I have never been able to get one converted into a permanent injunction. 
    The Court will say, “You can consent to a permanent injunction, but you consent then to the injunction, you may not then appeal it. 
    I mean, it's a consent to the injunction. 
    You have no right to say that it shall be considered permanent, although, you could get the consent of the other party and never were able to get it.” 
    Actually, we asked for it in this case and did not get it and I've asked for it in every case I had, and did not get it and the Georgia procedure will not permit you to do it.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="341.181" stopTime="352.903">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, the practice I -- I was familiar with was not of consenting to the permanent injunction only to assenting, if you please, to the entry of a permanent injunction on the record on which the -- that temporary --
speaker="edwin_pearce" startTime="352.903" stopTime="385.498">
    Mr. Edwin Pearce 
    That is impossible in the Georgia procedure. 
    You may not do that. 
    Short of consenting to the injunction itself which falls into further complaint about it or appeal, you may not without consent of the actual party do anything to cause the temporary injunction be treated as a permanent injunction. 
    So, whatever that phrase means in that, I know it means something proper, I mean, something that is true, but whatever it means either speed of court or procedure, we don't have it in Georgia and it is absolutely impossible to accomplish that and we didn't.

    Mr. Edwin Pearce 
    In this case, there was no request by me of the Court to treat it as a permanent injunction because I have made the request before and then denied and no authority in my state in that for doing it. 
    As far as getting it tried, it can't be tried because under this system, we have -- a case is not ripe for trial until it reaches a certain point from the bottom of a long list of active cases and according to the certificate of the clerk that's a minimum of 12 months. 
    We have no right to go in and say, “This case should be taken out of turn,” That I've tried without success, neither of those things that I asked for in this case because I have had a history there of not being able to get either of those remedies.

    Mr. Edwin Pearce 
    I would think so because the way the Courts put it to you, you have to say, “We consent to the above and foregoing judgment.” 
    Now, the minute we do that, we don't have any right to appeal, but they would let us say we consent to the judgment that has been issued being put in permanent form,” if they would let us do that, then of course, I could travel.

    Mr. Edwin Pearce 
    No, sir. 
    It's not limited to labor cases, no sir. 
    The plaintiff has a right. 
    I mean there maybe this substantial right the plaintiff may have in other types of cases he may wish to wait until final trial to put in whatever he wants to put in the Court. 
    In other words, if he's willing to have you go up at this point, he can consent but if he isn't willing there's no way that we can deprive him of his right to wait until calendar time and try his case in due course on the merits. 
    I don't know whether that's peculiar to Georgia or not. 
    I doubt it is although there maybe other places of states where they have a procedure that the defendant can request or consent that the injunction in temporary form being made permanent without losing his right to appeal. 
    That cannot be done in Georgia nor it cannot be expedited in any way, the permanent hearing.

    Mr. Edwin Pearce 
    There would be a trial 12, 15, 18 months later, yes, sir. 
    If it go through the trial docket, it wouldn't [Inaudible] the judge wouldn't make any entry at all on that statement. 
    That, I would be glad, I know this is a point of interest and I would be glad to refer to the brief then but our state to this Court as a matter of law and as a matter of practicality in having them tried, this can't be done. 
    You either -- you can take your temporary order up as we did in this case but you can't ask that it be made permanent unless the other side will agree to it which the case then of course any order that you and the other lawyers agree to the Court will make. 
    And now I'm going to finish so I'm going to hurry a little bit. 
    Now in that case the question of mootness was made but it was at an early time. 
    Now when we -- this was -- this Ledbetter case was before the Garmon case and before the Garner case and Weber against the Anheuser-Busch, and the other cases in which the doctrine of preemption was announced by this Court as a jurisdictional doctrine, that is that the field is preempted. 
    When those cases came along, we thought then this is our remedy. 
    If the Supreme Court has announced that the state court is without jurisdiction in this field, certainly the state courts won't assert you. 
    And certainly if they do, we can have it reviewed by the federal court. 
    It took us 10 years and I've documented those 10 years to find out that two things for sure in Georgia now exist. 
    Number one, that the state court temporary injunction is a specific and effective antidote to the exercise of Section 7 powers and secondly, that the Georgia Supreme Court will not pay any attention to the preemption doctrine. 
    Those are documented by the cases in the brief. 
    Those two things exist. 
    This case came along and it's like the typical case. 
    It infringed on the rights. 
    It had a meant -- a mention in the petition of a right -- a violation of a state right to work law. 
    The evidence showed that there was no substantial evidence introduced from which that could be found. 
    The trial court on the interlocutory injunction exercised here its discretion was persuaded but this case was so weak that he should not grant a temporary injunction. 
    For once, we went in the trial court, he said, “The injunction should not be granted”. 
    This was taken after the Georgia Supreme Court and they said the evidence demanded a finding of the injunction and sent it back and said, “You must enjoin this picket”, which is the strongest case I could ever get. 
    In other words, the man with the discretion said, “No injunction”. 
    The Supreme Court said, “This record demands an injunction”. 
    So now we brought it to this Court with two things that we want to point out that may be differ from the Ledbetter case. 
    Number one is Ledbetter case talked about mootness and talking about finality as a practical matter. 
    I have tried to demonstrate that in this area, in this state, as a practical matter, the interlocutory injunction is found and denies your rights. 
    And I also point out that if in Alabama as this Court has said, the interlocutory injunction could have been readily converted into final judgment. 
    The case at bar from Georgia differs. 
    We cannot do it. 
    We are faced with a minimum of 12 months and the clerk was very conservative, he didn't much like the idea of publishing how slow we were, so he set a minimum of 12 months and we'll go on that. 
    Actually, it's about 18 in the normal case. 
    We have shown that that's how long it takes to get one to the final calendar and we've shown that in every case in the last 10 years not one has ever been tried, not one, 45 cases, I think I had 33 of them. 
    Not one could ever be made to go in a final trial.

    Mr. Edwin Pearce 
    First of all, it strikes all a long wail, your right sir, have gone, that's number one. Number two is and I got this close for once. 
    I got it -- I got me a picket, and he stayed out then we kept it alive, nurtured it, and kept it alive, and incubated it. 
    And when we got it raised, the final [Inaudible] came in and said, “I dismiss”. 
    You can't stop him, United States. 
    He dismissed. 
    Now, I got nothing to appeal, no case at all. 
    You can't do it. 
    It just can't be done. 
    If you -- if we can't get relief in the interlocutory hearing, Section 7 rights are not existing in Georgia. 
    Now, we have made -- what I think it's a very good departure from that rule in Pope against Atlantic Coast Line, that was a case in which a resident of Georgia wanted to bring a demonstrator against the railroad under the Federal Employees Liability Act which gave him the right to bring it as a transit action in Georgia, Alabama. 
    He brought it in Alabama because he was a resident of Georgia and because I -- the Courts had jurisdiction over his person. 
    The Court issued an order -- I mean, didn't issue an order. 
    They -- well, they did issue a temporary order, but rested on a petition to restrain him from prosecuting that case in Alabama which of course was depriving him of his right to bring cause of action under the Federal Employees Liability Act. 
    The case actually came up and this came from Georgia and I'm therefore familiar with the practice. 
    This came up on something that is about as [Inaudible] as anything we held there really on demurrer. 
    The defendant demurred. 
    The trial court sustained it. 
    It was appealed to our Supreme Court and they overruled the order sustaining the demurrer which only said, “This petition states a cause of action and may be tried.” 
    That was appealed by the claimant to this Court as is on certiorari. 
    This Court granted certiorari and to protect the right of bringing the suit under the Federal Employees Liability Act reversed and remanded, and said, that he had the right to bring the suit wherever he wanted to. 
    The important thing there is in the departure. 
    I won't call your attention as that comes up on demurrer here. 
    All the demurrer adjudicated was that the petition with all of its allegations that the claim was being brought in Alabama for fraudulent and vexatious and harassment purposes stated a cause of action. 
    We don't know the extent of the fraud without any evidence. 
    We don't know the extent of the harassment of the vexatious nature, but the Georgia Supreme Court said, “That sets out a cause of action.” 
    This Court said it does not and sent it back. 
    Now we've -- now have a question in that case of handling a review on demurrer which is, as early as you can get in Georgia, proposing now an order of how we try things and demurrer is the first thing you try then the police filed in the case on [Inaudible]. 
    That extension, every reason that came into that would be in our case. 
    Of course it was obviously a bad thing. 
    This man couldn't bring his case for the years it took. 
    He might not have a case. 
    He might not have any witnesses. 
    He might not have the money to last to bringing the case there. 
    Even the statute of limitations might run. 
    I don't know what Alabama would say about a statute running when another court of another state had enjoined them. 
    They might give him relief, they might not. 
    So he was on a bad fix. 
    He didn't have a relief then and not at all, but that's no different from the showing I have made. 
    We have to have relief here or not at all. 
    I ask you to look at the Pope case and I gave this citation yesterday and see if the departure I'm requesting is anymore adequate than the departure in the Pope case or there -- if any reasons in the Pope case that I wouldn't have here. 
    Now, rather quickly because of the time, Mr. Justice Harlan asked me about the use of a writ of prohibition. 
    I think that is settled sir by the case of Amalgamated Clothing Workers against Richman Brothers, 348 U.S. 511, in which a precise situation like this arose. 
    A petition in the state court to enjoin the picketing was filed. 
    The union first tried to remove it to the federal court. 
    That removal was denied and properly so by the federal court on the grounds that District Court didn't have jurisdiction, the Labor Board did. 
    But with that pronouncement that the Labor Board had jurisdiction, they then made a motion to dismiss the case in the state court. 
    The state court overruled the motion. 
    Then the petition was filed in the federal court by the union, the Federal District Court, asking that the state case be prohibited or enjoined and pending that and before hearing, the state court came out and granted the injunction. 
    The District Court refused to enjoin it, I believe. 
    Anyhow it reached this Court and certiorari was granted and this Court said that only the Labor Board, the National Labor Relations Board, could bring a petition in the federal court to enjoin the handling of prosecution of a state case, that a private party could not do it. 
    Now there were three dissents in that case and that case might be [Inaudible] examination that is 348 U.S. 511, but it's still -- it hasn't been touched by this Court since. 
    It's been followed by a number of Circuit Courts but this Court has not, as far as I know, made any further pronouncement on it. 
    So this Court has said that we cannot do -- take that right. 
    Now, getting to the request here, I'm not going too fast and I guess I'm not going fast enough if I [Inaudible], getting into Mr. Justice Goldberg's question, he asked me about the Georgia law I believe it's the [Inaudible] and hit me at the time I could have told you fairly accurately then what it was, I do have it now with citations and it is consistent with the general law. 
    We are very positive down there that you have no right to violate an injunction simply because it's wrong and may later be reversed and they're rather tough in the enforcement of that, if I may add that. 
    If however, the order is based on absolute -- I mean if the order is without jurisdiction over the subject matter, then it's a nullity, it's void and the contempt proceeding will be reversed upon recognition of the voidness of the order. 
    I'm familiar with the case of Amalgamated Railway and Motor Coach Employees and United Gas Corp. and Chemical Workers case against the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, that's 340 U.S. 383 in which both case on the merits and the contempts hit the Court at the same time and they said that the Wisconsin Labor Board had no right to be operating in the field that the National Labor Relations Board had and reversed the whole thing, lock, stock and barrel, I suppose the contempts along with the case in Maine. 
    There is one more case if you let me in my last minute add to that because this case is very close to my heart. 
    It's a new case. 
    It hasn't gotten in the books yet. 
    It's called In Re Green and it was decided in this Court on May the 21st of this year, and it's case Number 312, and it is reported in the Supreme Court Reporters at 82 Supreme Court Reporters 1114. 
    That was a case in which the lawyer advised the union to make a test case out of it was himself committed to jail on contempt. 
    And he tried the rocky road of bail, habeas corpus, and finally reached this Court and got turned loose. 
    But he got turned loose by a majority on the grounds that his constitutional rights to be heard were infringed upon because the judge in committing him wouldn't even let him tell why he did it. 
    There was a strong dissent from -- in the result but in the reason for the result by some members of this Court who would I think have kept his lawyer in jail except for the fact that he claimed, he had -- he advised this contempt after conference with the trial judge and opposing lawyer and all three of them agreed it would be alright to test it by contempt. 
    The judge in committing him wouldn't let him make that statement at all and the minority decision of this Court was to the effect that if you have an agreement with the judge and the other lawyer, certainly the judge ought not to agree that you can make a test case and then puts you in jail for doing it.

    Mr. Pearce, the -- is this the case [Inaudible]?
speaker="edwin_pearce" startTime="1391.842" stopTime="1527.931">
    Mr. Edwin Pearce 
    Let me put it this way, sir. 
    I suppose there are obvious facts. 
    First of all if we would advise our clients to do something that a lawyer maybe -- would be slowed to do particularly in Georgia where the courts have no patience with it, don't' want it done, and will file a pretty heavy penalty if you try to do it. 
    Then assuming you're always faced with a parti -- with a case where you have put a little something about state law in there even though they're not going to prove it. 
    Now, you've got to risk the thing. 
    That's the -- the Court won't decide there's a little bit of state jurisdiction here and therefore he isn't quite without jurisdiction. 
    You've got to expose yourself to a jail sentence and the consequent perhaps it will also -- statute in your community that you achieved by such proceedings. 
    And maybe the lawyer together with his clients get under rather heavy sentences and all come up by certiorari. 
    Now, by way at home were not quite agreed on how to pronounce the word ‘certiorari granted'. 
    We all agree that perhaps the sweetest words in the English language in such a situation by your clients and yourself or have a jail sentence would be those two words but like all sweet things they come with not frequency and without certainty. 
    And I would say this, that the whole policy, the National Labor Relations Act being to adjudicate and stabilize labor relations as much as possible than to suggest that to obtain a review of the law to be done by the torturous, perilous and rocky route of violating and advising a client to violate the order intentionally and hoping that we will get out at this Court. 
    We couldn't get out of Georgia because Georgia has already said they had jurisdictions. 
    We know where we'd be in our state and our sole threat would be come to this Court and say, “Would you grant certiorari?” 
    And that I don't believe would be -- certainly -- and another thing, suppose we did that and we got an adjudication, it wouldn't help the Section 7 rights at all in that case, would the Georgia courts pay any attention to it? 
    They have the Garmon case. 
    They have the Weber case. 
    They don't pay attention to those.

    The Georgia court has already said that the record we have here and we would -- couldn't make a less record is enough to demand the verdict so it wouldn't mean we got a jury issue. 
    The Court would have to direct a verdict because the Supreme Court has said it's demanded. 
    So, we have no defense at all except this. 
    This federal question is raised here. 
    It's been passed upon finally by the highest court of our state. 
    It would be contemptuous under our statute for a lawyer to re-raise this point in the Georgia State Court because the question of jurisdiction has been submitted to the Court and passed upon. 
    We can't raise it again. 
    So this federal question cannot be re-raised. 
    There is no other question in the case and it has that aspect of finality more so by far than the Pope case says.

    This cause came on this day to be heard upon the pleadings in the case, affidavits, all testimony, and argument of counsel from all of which it appeared that the applications for temporary interlocutory injunction should be denied and is so denied. 
    It is from this order that we appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia and this -- it is this order that the Supreme Court of Georgia reversed sending its remittitur back to the trial court which was duly entered on the records. 
    The remittitur is not a part of the record Your Honor. 
    However, if the counsel readily concede that such a remittitur has been issued and if the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia has been placed on the minutes of the trial docket or rather on the minutes of the Court of Fulton Superior Court.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2735.784" stopTime="2740.572">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What is the legal effect of the order that's under review here?
speaker="robert_b_langstaff" startTime="2740.572" stopTime="2924.187">
    Mr. Robert B. Langstaff 
    Your Honor, this is one thing that mystifies me about this case as I was about to argue. 
    The legal effect of the order, it seems to me this Court is being asked to review and notwithstanding what I thought was going to be a week from the Montgomery case, it appears to me that the argument here has made the Montgomery case even sounder than it appears on its own facts. 
    What has appeared here and what this case is -- what this Court is being asked to review is a decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia on an interlocutory order from the trial court of Fulton County, Georgia. 
    And with the Court's confirmation and answer to the Chief Justice's question, let me review the facts just very briefly. 
    This petition was filed in Fulton Superior Court and thereafter under our procedure, an ex parte order was issued directing the parties to appear for the interlocutory order. 
    The ex parte order denied the request for injunction and the matter was set out down 10 or 15 days after that for interlocutory hearing. 
    At the interlocutory hearing, the petition only, the sworn petition and the affidavits of the respondent here that the plaintiff below, when the county affidavits from the defendants were presented to a trial judge without a jury. 
    The matter was heard and fully heard by the trial judge and he issued the order, I read it to the court a moment ago. 
    He denied the interlocutory order. 
    Thereupon the respondent here, appealed this matter to the Supreme Court of Georgia as we can do under our practice since otherwise, we would be left to the same mercy of interlocutory order of the petition announced that he is from our Supreme Court. 
    We appealed to the Supreme Court of Georgia and the court of course is familiar with their decision. 
    Now in the interim, the petitioner has filed, the other defensive pleadings which raised the very same questions that it's now asking this Court to review before the matter has been completed under the practice -- under the practice of the State of Georgia. 
    For instance, the petitioner has filed a plea in abatement which is the method that we used in the state practice in Georgia in attacking questions of jurisdiction. 
    The constitutional question involving a preemption of the Section 7 and 8 of the National Act, the plea in abatement remains un-disposed off in the trial court. 
    It's on the motion docket and maybe called at anytime by the petitioner for any. 
    And if the trial judge should rule that the plea is good then the case goes out. 
    Of course, the fact remains that the Supreme Court of Georgia has decided the question on the merits as presented. 
    But the question of jurisdiction has never been submitted to the Supreme Court of Georgia other than on argument of counsel. 
    The question of jurisdiction was not even in attained in the trial court because it was not properly raised under the pleading. 
    I'd like to point out to the Court if I again may transgress a little bit that the -- there are no allegations in this petition involving interstate commerce. 
    There is nothing in this record as there was in the Farnsworth case out of Tennessee which this Court reversed to which -- in which this Court reverses the Supreme Court of Tennessee. 
    There's nothing in this record showing an involvement of interstate commerce other than the stipulation of counsel at the time of the interlocutory hearing which was done as an accommodation to counsel that we had purchased in excess of $50,000 worth of commodities out of the State of Georgia and had them shipped to the plant site or the construction site of this sewage disposal plant in Atlanta, Georgia. 
    Now counsel doesn't tend to be tongue-in-cheek and denied that this is not interstate commerce, but the fact remains is Your Honor that the central question of commerce has never been adjudicated by any court.

    [Inaudible]
speaker="robert_b_langstaff" startTime="2926.956" stopTime="2954.867">
    Mr. Robert B. Langstaff 
    Well, it certainly not as strong as a stipulation in the Farnsworth court -- case, Mr. Justice Goldberg in which counsel stipulated that they were involved in interstate commerce in which they stipulated that there was an involvement of the National Labor Relations Act. 
    The only stipulation in this case is that, we stipulate that we purchased more than $50,000 worth of goods out of the State of Georgia. 
    I'm inclined to believe to directly answer your question that this stipulation was intended by counsel for petition to show that this is involvement of interstate commerce.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="2954.867" stopTime="2956.229">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Isn't that the standard to which [Inaudible] --
speaker="robert_b_langstaff" startTime="2956.229" stopTime="3074.563">
    Mr. Robert B. Langstaff 
    This is a standard of the labor relations -- that the National Labor Relations Board has adopted for determining this jurisdiction. 
    And at the time of stipulation was entered to by counsel, I had no idea of its ramification, I must admit. 
    But if there is a stipulation, I -- it's certainly not as strong as a stipulation in the Farnsworth case in which the whole issue before the Supreme Court of Tennessee was jurisdiction and in which the parties in that case readily agreed that interstate commerce was involved. 
    But I point this out to rebutt the Montgomery for this reason. 
    There are many things that remain to be done in the Supreme Court -- in the trial court of Georgia. 
    I think I ought to intend to stand and deny to this Court that there are any additional facts regarding labor controversy. 
    I think the facts have solidified. 
    I think the facts have gelled and I think from the final hearing comes up that the only additional element that will be introduced to the trial court as far as this respondent here is concerned, is the question of a violation of the contract from the City of Atlanta. 
    We have never taken the position that the question of whether or not we violated our contract with the City of Atlanta is germane to the issues raised in our pleadings in the trial court. 
    We have never argued the question. 
    We have never introduced evidence because it's been our position and it's our position here that whether or not this respondent has violated its contract with the City of Atlanta, it has no bearing on the question of whether or not this petitioner has been engaged in an activity which violates the right to work statutes of the State of Georgia. 
    As a matter of fact that the hearing referred to by the petitioner in its brief before the Alderman of the City of Atlanta, we did at this time substantiate our opposition that we had not violated the contract. 
    We did introduce evidence showing that we were paying a prevailing way or at least attempting to. 
    And this is the only party and this was not affirmed which has really had before it the question of whether or not this contract was violated. 
    This is simply another reason that we point out to the Court while this -- why the Montgomery case should be invoked here. 
    Now, the Montgomery case, oddly enough was argued almost 10 days.

    Mr. Robert B. Langstaff 
    Yes, sir. 
    I think that we are limited to -- we're not limited, but I think certainly one of the most important question is the Ledbetter case. 
    And in the time remaining, I would like to point out to this Court that it's been almost 10 years ago to the date the Ledbetter case was recently argued in this Court in the October term of 1952. 
    Since that decision to my knowledge, the Ledbetter case or the Montgomery case has not been attacked in this Court at least on the ground upon which it was decided. 
    It still stands today as a decision of this Court interpreting the question of finality under Section 1257. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter spoke in the Wilde case as counsel referred to it yesterday, the rule in the Montgomery case goes further than some antiquated rule of procedure. 
    This is not some strangling rule that this Court has applied in the past to defeat the merits of the case as it come up. 
    This is a sale route and as it -- as expressed in the Montgomery case and as expressed in the Wilde case, this is the WOW case. 
    The real reason behind this rule is to prevent this Court's piecemeal interventions with state procedure before state procedure has reset the degree of finality that will give this Court's ruling some meaning and some substance. 
    If the Montgomery case is overturned, the practical effect of it in labor disputes and perhaps in other disputes -- in other types of disputes if this Court goes further is to make an academic blackboard out of this Court or sounding board so that when the case goes back down to final disposition in the trial court the decision of this Court might become entirely moot or unrelated for the eventual issues that come up in the trial court. 
    Now, I think it's important that this Court understand one thing about counsel for petitioner in his able argument and able brief as pointed out that the practice in Fulton County in Georgia requires some 12 to 15 months for a final disposition of a case. 
    This is not so in the remainder state. 
    This Court is undoubtedly aware we do have a populous state in terms of county. 
    We have about 159 of them and in my part of the state, this case would be disposed of in three months when it came back on a final hearing. 
    The procedure differs of course due the complexity of calendars on various courts. 
    But I don't think this Court should reach any decision on whether or not Montgomery should be overruled because of the facts in Fulton County. 
    Let's consider the entire state. 
    In considering the entire state, on our practice and procedure to answer some questions that were posed earlier to counsel, when this case is returned to the trial court and I will readily concede that counsel for petitioner the minute this decree came there, came to me and asked to stipulate that a final order be entered and that the final hearing be waived. 
    But having been spanked once by counsel on the $50,000 stipulation I agree with great caution his request and we did not agree to this and we intended to leave the matter for final disposition at the final hearing. 
    The matter now stands on the trial docket in Fulton Superior Court for final hearing. 
    And I -- as I've said previously, I don't intend to disillusion the Court that the facts involving the labor dispute are gelled. 
    There will be no change in the facts, not that I can readily concede, but there is one important point that remains that I spoke of a moment ago and that is the question of whether or not this contract with the City of Atlanta has been violated because the respondent in this case is actively engaged in a construction work the contentions of the petitioner throughout this case have placed to sought it applied on this reputation and we intend to see at the final hearing that the evidence is introduced which will demonstrate that we weren't in violation of our contract with the City of Atlanta. 
    For this reason, I didn't no (Voice Overlap) --

    Well, of course, this gets in to what I call the second grade area of this case and that is the preemption theory. 
    And if Your Honor will permit me, I would like to state here our feelings about this -- about preemption. 
    Of course, it is a contention of petitioner and I will have to agree with him on the decision of this Court that if there is a violation or put it in other way, if there's either protected activity or if there's a violation on either Section 7 or 8 of the Act, then these people are protected under the National Labor Relations Act and the state courts are deprived a jurisdiction.

speaker="robert_b_langstaff" startTime="3768.607" stopTime="4198.013">
    Mr. Robert B. Langstaff 
    Well, I've seen that language and I've seen it on petitioner's brief that the -- this case and this Court has held that the -- where the -- whenever the fact showed that it's a question for argument then the state courts are preempted. 
    Now, I would like to direct the Court's attention to another provision of the National Act which disturb me, if they are not put there for a purpose and this is principally Section 14 (b) which was placed there by the 1947 Amendments. 
    Certainly that Congress had something in mind when they specifically stated that they will be left to the states a right to regulate working conditions in the area or the right to work statute. 
    Certainly that Congress meant something, when it left to the States specifically an area in which the States was still free to regulate. 
    If this activity or the petitioners in this particular case is not protected or not prohibited, then most assuredly, the Supreme Court of Georgia had jurisdiction under 14 (b), and the right to exercise its protected powers on the right to work statute. 
    Now, I think really that the critical question here is, does the record show or do the facts show that this was either protected or prohibited activity because if it does, then I think the Supreme Court of Georgia has lost its jurisdiction under these cases. 
    Now in the instant case, the petitioner cites to this Court and argued to the Supreme Court of Georgia that the reason for its -- that the reason it was protected activity that this was an effort on its part to disseminate to the public working conditions which were repugnant to the general working conditions in the Atlanta area. 
    And they state that under Section 7 of the Act that this was a mutual aid or protection. 
    This is what they were seeking and that this conduct was protected and it is preempted. 
    Now, these requires an additional review of the facts in this case and let's get back to the report I made a moment ago with the question of whether or not we violated our contract is paramount to determining whether or not the position these people take is correct or not? 
    Because their whole argument and their conduct is based on the fact that we violated our contract and they readily admitted in the Supreme Court of Georgia that if we had not violated our contract, this would not be protected activity. 
    If they would not have the right to picket and to carry signs saying that S. J. Curry &amp; Company had violated its contract with the City of Atlanta. 
    So, I think it's very important that the Court considered critically and carefully the facts as brought up on the record and the same facts that the Supreme Court of Georgia had before it. 
    Now, counsel has in his reply brief have stated that the counsel for the respondent has cited cases in support of its position being with the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Well, this is true. 
    I find no cases of this Court dealing with this specific problem that we're talking about now, the cases cited by the petitioner, the series -- just for a moment, the Anheuser-Busch case and the American Tobacco Company case, the [Inaudible] case, the Garmon case, all of these cases demonstrate on their face that they were involved either with Section 7 or Section 8. 
    Now, this case on its facts, I believe, does not show that there's been a violation or protective conduct under either Section 7 or 8. 
    The petitioner here went to City of Atlanta or first of all and went to this respondent on its jobsite and this is uncontradicted. 
    They went to us on our jobsite in February, this job started in January of 1961. 
    They came to us in a group of some 18 representatives and said, “We'd like for you to hire union people on this job.” 
    This was refused. 
    The statement being made that we operated an open shop. 
    Thereafter, the petitioners begin a very concerted and lengthy activity of trying to persuade the City of Atlanta that we were violating the term of our contract by not paying that prevailing wage. 
    Now at the initial conference on February the 14th, no mention was made of asking us to raise any wage standard at least under the affidavits of the respondent they were not and as I read the affidavits they're not -- this is not contradicted. 
    The statements made at the jobsite were “hire union laborer” which we refused. 
    Thereafter, the petitioners began as I've stated a concerted activity to bring the City of Atlanta to the position of where it would come to the respondent or go to the respondent and say, you are violating a contract rate wage level. 
    This resulted in a meeting before the city alderman. 
    It resulted in meetings with the city attorney and eventually the City of Atlanta and all the petitioners that there was nothing they could legally do to make the respondent raise its wage level. 
    Thereafter and very shortly thereafter, the respondent -- the petitioner placed the picket on our jobsite with picket signs as the record will reveal stating in substance that we jave violated the terms of our contract because we were not complying with the provision that required us to pay the prevailing wage. 
    Thereupon and this is also undisputed, thereupon, the jobsite came to virtually a standstill. 
    We lost all the union employees and as a virtue -- by virtue of that, nonunion employees were also put out of work and it's on these facts that the Supreme Court of Georgia said, “This is a violation of the right to work statute”. 
    Now therein lies the activity of the petitioner that would be protected under the National Act. 
    This -- it must be born in that also, a stranger picketing, there is no relationship of the employee or the employer. 
    There was no labor dispute. 
    This is simply a stranger publicity picketing. 
    While I recognize that this Court has said on many occasions that such picketing is protected if it's done on the mutual aid provision of Section 7. 
    In this case gentlemen, the Supreme Court of Georgia in reviewing a decision finds that this conduct was inconsistent with the right to work statute and as this case said in the Vogue case and in the Graham case out of Virginia, where the Supreme Court of the State finds and makes and draws a conclusion or inference from the record that the conduct was inconsistent with the right to work statutes for that particular state, then it might rightfully -- then it may rightfully enjoin that activity or conduct as being in violation. 
    Now, I submit as it was stated in the -- in the Ballen case out of Virginia that this picketing was something more than dissemination. 
    If the petitioner had really been interested in disseminating to the general public as it states that it was a question of violation of contract, why didn't it pick a medium of expression which would not have resulted in job interruption, the deprivation of work, and the interruption of delivering materials. 
    This job cycle is isolated from Atlanta. 
    They picked a method of picketing which they knew would bring economic pressure to bear upon the respondent and in compliance with the original statement made at the jobsite on February 14th the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded that this was activity calculated to violate the right to work statutes of the State. 
    It is our position here, it was our position to the Supreme Court that the record amply demonstrates that what this petitioner was asking was the enforcement of provisions which would violate the statutes of our state, relative – of our state, relative to the right to work and it to be gainfully employed, and to carry on an occupation (Inaudible) without interference.

    Mr. Robert B. Langstaff 
    There is nothing in the record, Your Honor, to show that the conduct of the petitioners here as cited in the case and they cite it in their brief was any activity that was prohibited under Sections 8 of the Act. 
    That is there was no attempt - there was no attempt to force a union contract here. 
    There was no attempt to make any move or there was no unfair labor practice involved here in the sense of Section 8. 
    The facts clearly show that there was no relationship between the petitioner and the respondent or between the petitioner and the respondent's employee. 
    So, I don't know how, under the facts of this case, there could be any prohibited activity as there was in the Anheuser-Busch case for instance, where the petitioner in that case was seeking the union clause contract in an already existing contract. 
    I don't think that there's any activity here, may it please Mr. Justice Goldberg, which was prohibited in the sense of the Act. 
    I don't think the conduct of the petitioner comes with any -- within any of the prohibitions of the Act. 
    More empathetically, I think that what the conduct of the petitioner does come within is Section 14 (b), that Section which leaves to the State a right to promulgate, and regulate, and administer right to work statutes of their own choosing. 
    And I think that the careful review of the record will show that the Supreme Court of Georgia might post and add that of course this Court is cognizant to the fact that it won't interfere with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia in interpreting its own laws unless it can be shown that there is a violation of some constitutional right of the petitioner such as the Fourteenth Amendment, I think that the fact show that the Supreme Court of Georgia analyzed this record and applied the decisions of that state in arriving at its decision that the injunction should have issued.

    Well, I mean in the sense that the legal determination of whether this contract has been violated has got to be done by a trial court in Georgia. 
    It's the only forum that it will have jurisdiction to determine.

    Mr. Robert B. Langstaff 
    No, sir. 
    I would not. 
    I do sir -- the reason I bring up the -- if you refer back to the question of violation of the contract is because petitioner says that because of the breach of contract they are entitled under the protected ambit of the Act to go out and disseminate to the general public the question or rather the fact that we have not complied with our contract. 
    This is the significance of this -- of the argument. 
    I mean, they say that the language on the picket sign is true. 
    I say this is irrelevant whether the contract has been violated or whether the language on the picket line isn't -- I mean, the picket sign is entirely irrelevant to the issues raised on the petition in the trial court.

    But this is also -- of course this Your Honor brings me to the points of the dilemma that this is also a violation of the right to work statute and as I said previously and maybe I haven't made myself clear or perhaps I have diverged too much from my argument as organized. 
    The question here, granted Your Honor, it is this and the question as I understand it has never been decided by this Court. 
    The Farnsworth case which is cited by counsel was clearly an involvement of interstate commerce. 
    The Supreme Court of Tennessee dealt specifically with jurisdiction. 
    The Georgia Court has not done this. 
    The Virginia court didn't do it in the Graham case.

    Mr. Robert B. Langstaff 
    I'm saying that this is possible Your Honor and also, I hope I'm making clear that Congress must have had some intention in putting the 14 (b) into the Act to clarify this very situation. 
    Now, I'm fully cognizant of the fact as this Court has ruled numerous decisions very recently that if the activity is protected or if it is prohibited, that's it. 
    State court is out even if the State's rights were also violated, but I do not believe this Court has ever said that where the state court finds that there's been a violation of the right to work statute and there has not -- and there is no finding of protected or prohibited activity that then the state court is also preempted.

    Mr. Robert B. Langstaff 
    Yes, sir. 
    It does, its does and if Georgia -- the decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia unfortunately incorporates an earlier decision and it is not too clear in this facet. 
    I would say that Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court in conclusion that our argument here is this whether it's been made very clear that remains to be seen, but our argument here is this. 
    This is not a case ripe for review under the Montgomery decision. 
    The Court is ultimately faced with the decision of either overruling the Montgomery decision or apply it. 
    This is inescapable. 
    The decisions, that is the Montgomery decision and the Curry decision are too closely aligned on their facts. 
    I would only call the Court's attention to the reasoning of this Court's majority opinion in the Montgomery case as the sound application of the rule that went out. 
    I've tried to demonstrate due to the complexities of this case that we're not considering, why this rule should be further enforced to prevent this Court interfering in substantive matter with a state court when their procedural matter is still indisposed off. 
    Secondly, I think this Court is faced with the question of determining whether or not the Supreme Court of Georgia had jurisdiction for that matter to the trial court or whether it was preempted under Section 6 or 7, or as counsel for the respondent is arguing, whether or not under Section 14 (b) of the Act, the State of Georgia was entitled to promulgate its right to work statutes and the Supreme Court of Georgia and the trial court were entitled to enforce it. 
    And finally, I think that if this Court found that there is no preemption, if this Court finds that under 14 (b) the State of Georgia had the right to promulgate and to administer its right to work statutes, then I think it's faced with the decision of determining whether the record clearly shows that the Supreme Court of Georgia had merit in its decision and whether the facts there to substantiate its decision. 
    And it is humbly submitted that the facts are there in the record as shown by the sworn petition and the affidavits. 
    Thank you very much.
