    On yesterday, Mr. Justice Black asked that I respond this morning to the question whether Section 4 of the United States Arbitration Act relating to the enforcement of arbitration where there had been a refusal to arbitrate does not prevent the type of arbitration here attempted, and specifically, whether Section 4 does not prevent arbitration in Georgia or order of arbitration in Georgia to take place in the State of New York.

    I had not thought on yesterday that Section 4 that any problem was presented under Section 4 because I was on the opinion that we had not yet gotten to Section 4. 
    We're still trying to get a stay under Section 3 and I was of the opinion that the two sections were rather unrelated.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="162.362" stopTime="170.329">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But you cannot get a stay under Section 3 if your arbitration is unenforceable under Section 4?
speaker="newell_edenfield" startTime="170.329" stopTime="488.742">
    Mr. Newell Edenfield 
    May it please the Court. 
    I have some authority on that which I'd like to present consisting of a Shanferokee case which I mentioned yesterday. 
    I think that is the only case where this Court in a full bench decision has ever discussed the relationship between Sections 3 and Section 4 of the Arbitration Act and I believe that decision puts the question at rest. 
    Now, the Shanferokee case is cited in our brief but it was not cited on this point because the conflict or possible conflict between 3 and 4 was not mentioned or had not been raised until yesterday. 
    For that reason, I would like to discuss it just a minute and to read what the Court said, what this Court says as to relationship between Sections 3 and Section 4 of the Arbitration Act. 
    Now Shanferokee, if the Court please, involved an interstate sale of coal. 
    The defendant was sued by the plaintiff and upon being sued, he sought to pend -- to stay the action pending arbitration. 
    Now as to what happened in the court below, this Court said and I'm reading from 293 U.S., page 451, this is mere recital of what happened in the District Court. 
    The District Court interpreted the clause that is the Arbitration Clause as making the arbitration enforceable only in the State Courts of New York and on that ground denied the stay. 
    On appeal from the order of denial, the Court of Appeals held that even if the clause should be so interpreted, Section 3 of the United States Arbitration Act authorized the stay. 
    It, therefore, reversed the order and direct to the District Court to grant the stay and would leave and so forth and this Court granted certiorari. 
    So we had a situation there where there was an application for a stay under Section 3, the court felt like that Section 4 would go to be enforced in New York that it couldn't grant. 
    Now, in dealing with relation with that question and relationship between Sections 3 relating to stay and Section 4 relating to enforcement, this Court says, “The plaintiff contends that the District Court was without power to grant the stay because the contract provides that arbitration can be compelled only by proceedings in a State Court of New York.” 
    The provision here is that, “Either party may apply to the Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order compelling specific performance of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the arbitration law of the State of New York.” 
    The contract does not in terms prohibit proceedings in the federal court whether it should be construed so as to exclude the bringing of a suit in the federal court to compel specific performance of the agreement arbitrary. 
    We have no occasion to decide for the District Court was not asked this in the proceeding now under review to compel specific performance. 
    The motion was to stay the action until arbitration shall have been had and the direction of the Court of Appeals was limited to granting a stay. 
    Now, if it please the Court, we've come to what this -- this Court said about relationship between Sections 3 and 4. 
    Section 3 of the United States Arbitration Act provides the broadly that the Court may, “Stay the trial of the action until such arbitration had been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.” 
    We think the Court of Appeals was clearly right in concluding that there is no reason to imply that power to grant a stay is conditioned upon the existence of power to compel arbitration in accordance with Section 4 of the Act. 
    Marine Transit versus Dreyfus if not to the contrary, there is on the other hand strong reason for construing the clause as permitting the federal court to order a stay even when it cannot compel the arbitration. 
    But otherwise, despite congressional approval of arbitration, it would be impossible to secure a stay of an action in the federal courts when the arbitration agreement provides for compulsory proceedings exclusively in the state court. 
    So it seems to me, like what the court is saying, if the Court please, is that under Section 3, you can grant a stay which is what is here involved. 
    Irrespective of whether or not the Court would have jurisdiction to enforce under Section 4, and incidentally in the Circuit Court, Judge Learned Hand in the same case before it got here, made this remark which was confirmed by what I've just read and this appears from page 297 of 70 F.2d. 
    We see no reason for a limited construction, that is of the United States Arbitration Act, and conclude that Section 3 authorizes a stay even though the arbitration must take place beyond the jurisdiction of the court. 
    So it seems to me that a right to a stay under Section 3 is unrelated to and fully independent of Section 4.

    Ultimate judgment in my opinion can be entered in that court which fully conforms to and complies with the Miller Act. 
    At the same time, it reconciles and conforms to Shanferokee code. 
    My idea about the way the two would be reconciled is this; the suit is brought as the Miller Act provides it shall be brought in a district where part of the work is to be performed. 
    The agreement provides for arbitration in New York. 
    Shanferokee says that's perfectly alright. 
    Consequently, you stay the proceedings in the Middle District of Georgia. 
    Just as they did in Shanferokee, you send it to New York to be arbitrated. 
    When this has been arbitrated in New York, you'd come back in the State of Georgia and enter final judgment, and you reconcile everything.

    Mr. Newell Edenfield 
    Mr. Goldberg I believe -- Mr. Justice Goldberg, I believe, we may have not change the fact just a slight bit. 
    It has been held in the lower courts albeit that in Miller Act proceeding you can waive venue.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="766.200" stopTime="768.525">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    By general provision you can do this?

    No sir.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="768.907" stopTime="770.083">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    By specific?
speaker="newell_edenfield" startTime="770.083" stopTime="946.003">
    Mr. Newell Edenfield 
    Yes, sir. 
    In one instance for example, they held it was automatically waived because the work was to be done in Newfoundland. 
    And if you had to bring it in a district where the work was being performed and there's no district in Newfoundland obviously, there had to be some other district in which it could be brought. 
    The main opinion in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals incidentally cites other instances and the Lower Federal Courts, I'll admit, flatly holding that the venue provisions of the Miller Act can be waived. 
    Not a word is there said in the Miller Act prohibiting arbitration then you can be waived and incidentally, that is the next point which I wanted to address myself is what is this provision in the Miller Act? 
    Is it simply a venue provision which can be waived or is it as Mr. Grant says on any group part of a new federal right which prescribes not only the right but the remedy by which is to be invoked. 
    Now, that is the thrust of his argument and his main argument, I may add. 
    He says and his contention is relying on this provision in the Miller Act that suit shall be brought here and not elsewhere. 
    And that it may be prosecuted there to final judgment. 
    And that that is a mandate first that you can't do it anywhere else, and second that means you cannot arbitrate. 
    Now I agree with the principle of law which he cites that where Congress creates a new right unknown to the common law and as an integral part of that right, Congress prescribes a remedy. 
    The right becomes -- the remedy becomes a part of the right and the right can only be enforced in a manner prescribed. 
    Mr. Grant cites and I agree with those cases, the case of Wilko versus Swan. 
    In that case, there was a suit under -- for a violation of the marginal of the provisions of the Securities Act. 
    Now there was no such suit in common law, the Securities Act created the suit. 
    It not only prescribed a venue provision but it provided for a non-waiver provision. 
    And I think clearly having -- Congress having provided a new right and having prescribed the venue provision and having gone further and put in a non-waiver provision, you had to follow it as this Court held in the Wilko case and exactly the same way in the Griffith Saving Bank case which Mr. Grant cites. 
    That was a Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    There was no such cause of action as the Fair Labor Standards suit at common law. 
    Congress created the right. 
    In creating the right, they made as a part of it as an integral part of it a venue statute. 
    That also contained a non-waiver provision. 
    Consequently, the remedy became a part of the right itself and had to be enforced exactly as the statute provided.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1072.391" stopTime="1080.187">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. Newell Edenfield 
    Your Honor it was not --

speaker="newell_edenfield" startTime="1083.229" stopTime="1175.408">
    Mr. Newell Edenfield 
    Yes. 
    It was passed for that purpose. 
    Now, as to the venue provision, however if the Court please, the legislative history does not indicate entirely that that was the purpose of it. 
    If I may trace the history of the Miller, I mean of the Heard Act from which this provision was derived, Your Honor will recall that the Heard Act provided for one suit for everybody to be brought by the government in which contractors and subcontractors could intervene and if there was anything left after the government got its money, they could adjudicate their claims to final judgment. 
    And since there was to be but one suit on behalf of everybody, of course, there had to be someplace specified where was it to be brought and therefore, the Heard Act first contained this language that it should be brought in a district where part of the work was performed and that it should be -- could -- could be prosecuted to final judgment right. 
    Now, that provision would have been unnecessary when the Miller Act was passed because the Miller Act came along and instead of creating one bond for everybody as the Heard Act had done, it created two bonds; one for the performance bond for the government and one of payment bond for contractors. 
    So really, there was no need, you might say, to any longer have this provision about bringing the suit in that place and for prosecution at the final judgment.

    The congressional hearing recite that the bonding companies wanted it preserved because, otherwise, they would be subject to numerous suits in various districts which might ultimately exceed the amounts of their bond limits, and according to the hearings, and the congressional hearings, it was the bondsman, not the contractors, not the subcontractors, but the bondsman who asked that this venue provision be kept in that. 
    So, I submit that it is nothing more than a venue statute; that Miller Act is just like any other act; that just like any other venues section it can be waived; and that where the parties have agreed to arbitration as they have in this case, it has been waived.

    I don't see that there's anything wrong with waiving in advance if the waiver concerns a right going out of the contract. 
    Now, if it was a right that arose in some other way, obviously an agreement in advance to waive venue in a tort case might be one thing. 
    If it were an action brought by statute, but it -- right in this case arises it out of a contract which the parties made with each other, and that there's some -- certainly an area in which they had the right to contract. 
    And where the waiver is contained in a contract giving rise to the cause of action, I have seen nothing in the decisions of this Court which would indicate that it could not be waived in advance.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, Shanferokee involved a stay. 
    Now, what you're saying is the policy as to the location of arbitration is different under Section 3 than it is under Section 4 and if you just get a stay, the court stays this action that you felt would agree to arbitrate. 
    Now, you go ahead and arbitrate, where is that going to go into this lawsuit until you've arbitrated.

    Mr. Justice Brennan, I overstated my position. 
    Let me go back and read what the Circuit Court said again and it didn't actually order that, but it certainly is broad enough in scope to encompass it. 
    We see no reason for a limited construction of the Arbitration Act and conclude that Section 3 authorizes the stay even though the arbitration must take place beyond the jurisdiction of the court.

speaker="newell_edenfield" startTime="2376.213" stopTime="2524.228">
    Mr. Newell Edenfield 
    Yes, sir. 
    We're aware of that Your Honor, but these people did agree in a contract that they would arbitrate in New York just -- and they did it in Shanferokee and they stated until they did it. 
    Now, what happened thereafter, we don't know. 
    And I would say one thing, if the interpretation of Mr. Grant and I'm trying to get back now to where I was awhile ago, if the interpretation argued by Mr. Grant is sustained, the effect of it will be, if the Court please, to imply the repeal to the Arbitration Act to the extent of Miller Act cases. 
    In fact, that itself is what Mr. Grant argues in his brief. 
    He said that arbitration act was passed first, now the Miller Act was passed second with these unusual provisions about why you bring a suit and prosecute under final judgment. 
    And to that extent, the Arbitration Act, you go then to say to a repeal pro tanto, but in substance, he said that, that takes the Miller Act cases out of it. 
    Well, of course, that argument in the first place implied repeals are not favored. 
    If my theory is correct, they can be harmonized. 
    And furthermore, while it's true that the Arbitration Act was passed before the Miller Act, and therefore, there might be an implied repeal by the later Act, the Arbitration Act was subsequently enacted as substantive law in 1947, 12 years after the passage of the Miller Act and not a syllable in it was changed. 
    So, Congress had not only said that that was their policy as far as the Arbitration Act is concerned, they've never said there was any exception in Miller Act cases, and after the Miller Act, they have repeated it in exactly the same language. 
    So that I say that what he is seeking to do, would be to work an implied repeal and that in spite of the fact that Congress had reenacted. 
    Now, if the Court please, I don't know what my time is but I want to move on to this business of fraud just a minute, if I may, which was argued by Mr. Grant. 
    I am sure the Court would be aware, how easy it would be to destroy any policy of arbitration. 
    If it could be furthered the way in every case by having the unwilling party come forward and say it was obtained by deceptive fraud, however ground this or however frivolous.

    Mr. Newell Edenfield 
    Well, now either this question so far as I know had not been discussed by this Court. 
    But there was a very interesting case, Devonshire Fabrics which is cited in our brief, where that question did come up and was considered by Judge Medina in New York and incidentally, this Court granted certiorari and as our judge, the case must have been settled because it never, I mean, it was declared moot or something or so. 
    But in any rate, in that case, Judge Medina flatly holds that in order to -- for fraud to prevent arbitration, the arbitration provision must itself have been obtained by fraud. 
    Now, in this case, the only allegation of fraud in the whole petition, as far as that's concerned, is something that was written into the contract and which he presumably read before he signed. 
    And the only allegation which concerns in any manner whether the arbitration agreement excerpt was procured by fraud was a statement that it was maliciously inserted in the contract.

    It's specifically alleged in the complaint and set out on page 64 of the record, Moseley had no knowledge of the fraudulent and illegal scheme plan and design as herein alleged and is specified in subparagraphs A, B, C, D, E, F and G hereof until after he had completed his performance under the contract and then begin to receive from the defendant contractor a flood of bills for alleged back charges and denials for the first time of plaintiff's claims for compensation for work done by him which was not covered by the term of the contract.

    Yes, sir. 
    I definitely argue that, Your Honor. 
    I argue it because we allege that this contract -- in preparing this contract and then entering into it, set out with a fraudulent scheme to obtain money and materials without paying for it all with -- if he had to pay -- to pay a such a reduced price as he can get the subcontractors to take because of threats to take them off to other places and so forth. 
    And that he can see -- this whole contract, 13 pages of fine print, hadn't got but one single thing in it that the main contractor promises to do, every other paragraph as an agreement that the subcontractor shall not, but his one obligation was to pay and to pay promptly under that provision. 
    And we say he conceived this scheme to avoid that payment and that one means by which he intended to avoid it was by use, by insertion of and use of this arbitration provision that when a claim arose and the man says, “I'm entitled of $90,000 you haven't paid”, that he would say, “Well, I'm not going to pay you. 
    I'm going to take you to New York and we'll go arbitrate it up there” and we specifically allege in our complaint that our man would not be able to take the witnesses to New York.

speaker="george_c_grant" startTime="3435.759" stopTime="3460.312">
    Mr. George C. Grant 
    I think there is a very definite distinction in the law applicable as to whether you can waive something in advance or where after your rights has arisen, you can agree to waive certain rights. 
    There's definitely policy of law as I understand against waiving rights granted to you, where the man blanks, signed a blank check, giving them away as what this amounts to, but after you have a full realization of what it is you've given up, it is easier for the Court to say that you ought to be bound by an agreement to give it up.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You are saying that what's been held many times, I think, is a different between a general contract made long before any controversy arises to waive your right to go into Court, and an agreement after dispute is arisen, and that the dispute as to how much is owed -- or whether they could go in, you're saying there's a difference between those and you are saying that under the Miller Act, they're entitled to have that trial although you wouldn't say I assume that if it had a controversy and been argued over and they then agree to submit it to arbitration that particular thing couldn't be arbitrated.
speaker="george_c_grant" startTime="3501.274" stopTime="3529.578">
    Mr. George C. Grant 
    Well, I -- (Voice Overlap) I wouldn't concede that it would be enforceable if it were signed after the dispute arose, because in the Brooklyn Savings Bank versus O'Neil case where there was no specific prohibition. 
    That's one thing I want to point out, unless it had to be an argued that in that case, there was a provision against waiver, there was not. 
    That's the very thing the Court decided that even the absence of a prohibition against waiver, there can be no waiver of rights granted by an Act where waive them would (Voice Overlap).

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You're going there out on the basis that the Act prevents it at all?
speaker="george_c_grant" startTime="3534.002" stopTime="3534.229">
    Mr. George C. Grant 
    Yes.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Before or afterwards?
speaker="george_c_grant" startTime="3535.610" stopTime="3555.910">
    Mr. George C. Grant 
    Yes sir and in that case, the rights had arisen, this is what I'm getting at. 
    At the time the waiver was signed, the rights had already arisen. 
    And there was in the Act nothing prohibiting a waiver and yet this Court said that the congressional purpose is so clear that there shall not be a waiver. 
    We won't permit it even though the waiver was signed after the rights have all approved.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3555.910" stopTime="3574.037">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    We had that same question of very much the same of FELA case in Duncan against Thompson where the Act was construed as not allowing the man to sign the paper that would give up his rights even after the accident had occurred.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Isn't your basic position that the Arbitration Act doesn't apply to Miller Act cases?

    Mr. George C. Grant 
    That is not true.

    Mr. George C. Grant 
    It comes down to that Your Honor, that the Miller Act has such a clear policy to prosecute the action to final execution.

    Mr. George C. Grant 
    Well, if I'm wrong in that, the only other position I have is that we are not engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Arbitration Act.

    Oh, I certainly take that position.

    Mr. George C. Grant 
    Well, Your Honor, I'd say there's a definite distinction in the facts there and I was about to try to point out that Mr. Edenfield said yesterday this was additions to the existing AFA's -- the record shows clearly on page 73, 74, 77 and 97 that this was pure woods ground. 
    Nothing there before based on in this construction and that the nearest airbase was 15 miles away and the intervening property was private property, had no connection with, it has no facility to perform at this airbase. 
    It's operated by the army while the Warner Robins Air Base as operated by the Air Force. 
    It's not a part of an existing thing. 
    It's brand new construction and under that theory, it's not something added too and it was different in the case Your Honor brought. 
    Thank you.

    It's not only to say your [Inaudible] not to be applied in this case but that an arbitration provision in the contract is not enforceable in Miller Act case.

    In the Miller Act case --

    That's a considerably different proposition.

    Mr. George C. Grant 
    Well, I think it's two-pronged proposition and that I should have point out that this proceeding they brought in New York was not just notice of arbitration. 
    It's a suit to compel arbitration and the statute disclosed in the record in New York as almost word per word Section 4 of the United States Arbitration Act. 
    They have the joint --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3757.926" stopTime="3782.124">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What you're saying is that an agreement to arbitrate in government construction situation is not enforceable even in the absence of any agreements to arbitrate outside the district in the absence of fraud or anything else. 
    That your position is simply is that the contract to arbitrate is not enforceable in Miller Act cases.
