School District of Abington Township, Pennsylvania v. Schempp

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    School District of Abington Township, Pennsylvania, et al., Appellants, versus Edward Lewis Schempp, et al.hfa 
    Mr. Ward, you may continue your argument.
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="12.855" stopTime="203.130">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    May it please the Court. 
    At the close yesterday, I was dealing with the problem what are the Schempp's complaining about? 
    First, they're not complaining that we're using the Bible in the school. 
    They have said in their brief that they're not complaining that the fact that the Bible is being used, they say what they complain about is the way it's being used. 
    This is consistent with the two decrees of the Court, never has the Court said that we cannot use the Bible in the school. 
    Consequently, the problem here is how do we use the Bible in the school? 
    We say and the statute says to bring lessons of morality to the children. 
    The Schempps say, “No, you can't be doing this. 
    How can you teach anything? 
    How can you bring lessons of morality to the children? 
    How is it a proper way to teach if you only use one source,” we only use one book, “if you don't allow any comment to be made on what, what is being read? 
    If you don't select particular passages that are unusually good,” they say, “this can't be teaching morality.” 
    They say, “You're not teaching morality. 
    What in fact you're doing,” they say, “is you are teaching some kind of a public school creed, it doesn't have religion that's cut adrift from theology.” 
    On page 29 of their brief, in the second paragraph they say, and they're talking about the Bible reading practice, they say, “The result is to foster a kind of colorless national or public school creed, a religiosity without religion, a sanctimonious eclecticism cut adrift from theology.” 
    And gentlemen, that is precisely what we're doing. 
    We are teaching morality without religion cut adrift from theology, and that is proper for the people of Pennsylvania. 
    We can bring to our children the lessons of morality in their school days as long as we're not bringing religion, not bringing theology. 
    The people of Pennsylvania have wanted to do this. 
    They have -- since the beginning, wanted to bring these lessons of morality to the children. 
    So what did they do? 
    They picked a common source of morality, the Bible. 
    They could have picked two sources, ten sources, a hundred sources, but they didn't. 
    In their wisdom, they picked the Bible. 
    In order that only the morals would be taught. 
    In order to keep out any possibility of theology, of doctrines sneaking in, they say it shall be read without comment. 
    They say we shall not pick certain particular passages. 
    They didn't want any possibility of any sectarian or religious instruction. 
    Now, perhaps the result is as the Schempp say, it's colorless. 
    I don't know what a colorless creed is or what a colorful creed is.

    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    I -- I think it is consistent in this respect, sir. 
    The provision for teaching morality, I believe the requirement for the excuse is not absolutely necessary to the constitutionality of this -- this particular practice. 
    I think the fact that we teach it in this way, maybe it's not the best way, maybe we shouldn't excuse the children, but it's the way that people of Pennsylvania picked out and as long --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="281.692" stopTime="288.726">

    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    Well, no. 
    In Pennsylvania, we also excuse children if they want to be from a physical and dental examination if they have any religious compunction about taking that. 
    I think, here is a situation we want to teach morality. 
    We think it's a good thing. 
    We do it in a different way than we teach other subjects perhaps --

    The whole school can excuse itself.

    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    We have other electives. 
    It's not in the record but like the children who take the television and radio workshop that are the ones that read this, I know can take it or cannot. 
    But my point is this, Pennsylvania has decided this is the way it wants to teach morality. 
    I agree with the Schempps that it is without religion, it has cut adrift from theology.

speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="401.497" stopTime="410.050">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    That's a very careful argument, I understand it. 
    The Bible (Inaudible)
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="410.050" stopTime="413.924">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    It is a great religious document and it has other values.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="420.424" stopTime="519.144">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    I don't -- sir, when I read the Bible, I may get one feeling when you read it another, or the third person. 
    What I say is the Bible is of value to the atheist who doesn't believe, or to the agnostic. 
    The morality, the lessons, the history, the beauty of the Bible can mean something wholly apart from religion. 
    That's -- that is why the Bible is such a monumental work that it has this ability and that is what we're using. 
    And again, the Schempps say that this case, the establishment of religion is exactly the same as we find in Engle and Vitale. 
    They say that this case is like Engle and Vitale, but the difference between a suggestion of the State, the children say a prayer, a solemn of avowal of faith, and the suggestion that children listen to ten verses of the Bible is a complete difference in kind. 
    Suggesting that the children say a prayer is suggesting they engage in a purely religious act. 
    A prayer has no secular value. 
    The prayer assumes that the child believes in an almighty, that the almighty can hear him and may help him. 
    That is when you suggest to a child to say a prayer. 
    What are we suggesting? 
    We are suggesting that children listen to ten verses of a monumental work which as Mr. Justice Goldberg says is a great religious work, but in addition, it is a source of moral values.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="519.144" stopTime="544.364">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And are you saying -- are you saying, Mr. Ward, that the State of Pennsylvania contends that all of those children whose parents are amoral and who don't want their children to be product in moral teaching have the right to be excused --
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="544.364" stopTime="544.668">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    No, I'm not --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="544.668" stopTime="548.477">

    From -- from -- from that training which you were giving them.
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="548.477" stopTime="549.173">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    No, I'm saying that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="549.173" stopTime="550.901">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then what -- isn't that the effect of it?
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="550.901" stopTime="592.084">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    No, sir. 
    I respectfully suggest it's not. 
    A person could be excused from listening to the Bible. 
    Maybe that person believes so profoundly in the Bible that they only want their children to hear it read liturgically, that person might want the child excused. 
    The second person might be an atheist who thinks it's all a bunch of myths and doesn't want their child confused. 
    That person might want their child excused. 
    A third person might be neutral about religion but might say, “I don't want my child to hear certain of the gory passages in the Bible.” 
    That child might be excused. 
    Consequently --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="592.084" stopTime="597.883">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The fourth -- the fourth category of course would be parents who are amoral.
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="597.883" stopTime="597.967">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    Certainly.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="597.967" stopTime="610.543">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That they don't want their children raised in that kind of an atmosphere. 
    And you say as to those, it is important as the State of Pennsylvania thinks this moral training is, those children may be excused.
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="610.543" stopTime="743.693">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    They may be excused just like Pennsylvania believes it's proper to salute the flag but those who don't want to, don't have to. 
    Now, maybe the family doesn't want their child to be patriotic, they have the right. 
    But what I am saying is the act of the excuse, the act of the excuse signifies nothing. 
    It doesn't signify whether you're a religious person, a nonreligious person, it doesn't signify any belief. 
    That is what the Schempps argue that the provision for excuse in fact makes them make a public profession of belief. 
    It says, this is telling all the world, this is a public profession of belief. 
    That isn't in this case, all the parent has to do is say, “I don't want my child to be present when the Bible is being read.” 
    For the reasons, I've just given the Chief Justice their many reasons why the child should not or may be excused. 
    I think what the Schempps are objecting to is they have to do something. 
    I think they're saying, “Why should I have to do something to get my child out of it?” 
    Well gentlemen, the Jehovah's Witness parent has to do something to have their child excused from the flag salute. 
    The Catholic parent has to do something to send their children to parochial schools. 
    The man who takes the Fifth Amendment has to do something. 
    I don't think it's unconstitutional to require them to do something. 
    Then again, the Schempps say, “What this does is this separates the children. 
    It's divisive. 
    It separates our children from the others. 
    They will be different. 
    They will be unbold.” 
    They will be different because this separates the children from those who want to be present when the Bible is being read from those who don't want to be present. 
    It doesn't separate them as Catholic and Protestant or Jew and atheist. 
    An atheist may well want to hear the Bible. 
    They may well get moral lessons out of the Bible. 
    A developed Christian may well not want to hear the Bible. 
    It separates them and they are different, but not different according to their religion.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="743.693" stopTime="745.426">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean they're separate, but equal?
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="745.426" stopTime="794.820">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    No, I don't mean that sir. 
    I don't mean that. 
    I mean, they're separate in this way. 
    They're separate as the child that's been excused from the flag salute is separate. 
    They're separate as the conscientious objectors separate from those who serve. 
    They are separate as the child who goes to parochial school is separate from the child who doesn't. 
    That's the glory of the country they can be separated. 
    They have the right to be separate. 
    There are only two places where they would all be the same. 
    One of course would be a totalitarian state where we couldn't be different; and two would be some sort of big togetherness state where we never did anything unless everybody wanted to do that very same thing. 
    And of course, they're not many things that everybody wants to do. 
    Then the Schempp's say --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="794.820" stopTime="799.202">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Ward, are you asking us to overrule Vitale?
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="799.202" stopTime="800.798">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    No, sir. 
    This is not the Vitale.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="800.798" stopTime="802.131">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why isn't it Vitale?
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="802.131" stopTime="825.870">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    Vitale was suggesting that the children do a purely religious act. 
    Vitale was suggesting that the children each morning say in fact, “I believe in God. 
    I want him to bless my teachers and the school.” 
    There's no meaning to a prayer unless there is a reli -- it's a purely religious doctrine, a purely religious act.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="825.870" stopTime="830.999">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you mean there is no religious meaning to the Lord's Prayer?
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="830.999" stopTime="840.851">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    Sir, we are not, in this case, I am arguing for the Bible reading statute. 
    The Lord's Prayer is a custom at Abington but it's not a subject --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="840.851" stopTime="844.254">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It's permitted under the same -- permitted under the same law?
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="844.254" stopTime="845.049">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    No, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="845.049" stopTime="846.444">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And it's done, isn't it?
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="846.444" stopTime="884.076">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    It is done but it is not part of the statute of Pennsylvania. 
    In other words, the statute of Pennsylvania requires only the ten verses of the Bible be read every morning. 
    It is a custom at Abington to follow that by a recitation of the Lord's Prayer. 
    The injunction against us says that if we just do the statutory method, just the Bible, we are unconstitutional. 
    If we do it, the Bible and the prayer were unconstitutional. 
    Consequently, this Court must concern itself with the Bible because if that is unconstitutional, you don't have to bother with Lord's Prayer.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="884.076" stopTime="887.264">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose they read them, that part of the Bible, it is the Lord's Prayer.
speaker="phillip_h_ward" startTime="887.264" stopTime="937.434">
    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    There's a distinct difference, sir, I suggest. 
    In other words, the Lord's Prayer appears in Luke and in Matthew. 
    When it's read to them from the Bible, it is an explanation and historical account of how Jesus taught us to pray. 
    I think that is different than suggesting to the children say this prayer, and as an analogy to point out the difference, suppose I lived in Baghdad and my son Phil went to a school there, some Muhammad nation. 
    And he gets to school every morning, they read ten verses from the Qur'an. 
    And one morning, he gets there and they read, and then Muhammad gathered his tribes and warriors around him and said, “This is the way you shall pray. 
    There is no God, but God and Allah is his prophet.”

    Now, in addition, the Schempps say in this case and as did the court below fall squarely within McCollum. 
    Here again, you have an entirely different situation because in McCollum, you were dealing with the purely religious act, pure sectarian instruction, there's no doubt about that. 
    The school is making possible and in the sense suggesting to the children that they either go to one of the three religious teaching classes, that's not here. 
    McCollum, Zorach, all of these cases deal with a purely religious act. 
    Here, comparing one child reading over the public address system of the other children, ten verses of the Bible cannot compare with the admitted religious instruction in McCollum. 
    Again in Tudor, the Schempps mentioned the Tudor case might have an effect. 
    In Tudor, we were dealing with the Gideon Bible. 
    The Gideon Bible is the New Testament, the Psalms and the Proverbs from the Old Testament. 
    The Gideon Bible is a distributed by the Gideon Society which is an admitted Christian evangelical organization.They are trying to bring men to Christ. 
    This would be helping a religious group to distribute their pamphlets.

    I think undoubtedly there is this difference.

    I mean, you can't say that morals only spring from religion. 
    The atheist can be a moral man. 
    The agnostic is a moral man. 
    Morals are so -- the morals in the Bible are not so deeply based on the Christian-Judaic concept that they can't be separated. 
    Certainly we can't claim -- the Christians and the Jews can't claim that the morals that are in the Bible as our own particular document that they're only ours.

    So that it will keep the children of all the school children in Pennsylvania can hear it. 
    Although we will excuse those who do not want to but we do it because it's a religious book, what would you say then?

    They loved it. 
    They loved its principles and they want to have it taught in their schools, because it's a religious book.

    It deals with the document that is of obvious religious origin and to many people an obviously religious book. 
    Can you use the great values that are in the Bible or is -- does the Constitution mean, which I respectfully say, it does not mean that despite the fact that nobody is forced to believe or disbelieve anything. 
    Nobody is forced to contribute to support.Nobody is indoctrinated despite the fact that this custom doesn't do any of those things must the Government ripped out that doctrine, that tradition, simply because it involves a religious book. 
    Must the Government any time, any tradition in any way, reflects the fact that we are a religious people? 
    Must say rip out any tradition even, even if that tradition nobody has to abide by? 
    The tradition isn't trying to teach anybody anything. 
    The tradition isn't requiring a person to believe or disbelieve.

    In other words, how do you really find any volume and monumental work for a source of morality such as the Bible, and that's why the Bible is used.

    And that is that this is not -- the statute does not require a religious act.

    Mr. Phillip H. Ward 
    You correctly stated the first part of our argument that we say this is not a religious act, therefore, it's constitutional. 
    If you hold that it is a religious act, I think it falls within that body of tradition that we have that is like “In God we trust” in the coins, like starting this Court with “God save this Honorable Court”, I don't think it is -- it rises to that dignity, that type of religious act. 
    I think the religious act in Engle where it was actually a prayer, where the children were required to make an avowal of faith.

   Argument of Henry W. Sawyer, III
speaker="henry_w_sawyer_iii" startTime="2407.295" stopTime="2600.735">
    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I believe that Mr. Ward has completely stated the procedural history of the case and I'll not repeat that. 
    And for the most part, I believe it's fairly and most fairly covered the facts of the case. 
    Well, I would like to comment in one or two particular along the evidence, and one or the two of the facts of the case which I think needs some comment. 
    First of all, I think it should be quite clearly understood that the particular practice described by one of the witnesses who are the school district who run the radio and the television workshop was characterized by the lower court as an exception. 
    And the record is quite clear that in the other schools of Abington Township where these children went, as a matter of fact, when the first trial was held, the practice is typical of the Commonwealth in general. 
    And if it makes any difference and that is that the teachers generally read the ten verses of -- or in the alternative assign it to some child in rotation, you don't have the public address system. 
    And in fact on cross examination, the teacher who described that practice conceded that it was only his own individual innovation which had prompted him to suggest that since the children might well read better from the radio techniques then point as he put it. 
    If they had a chance to practice, they might use at home their own Bibles and then come in and use them. 
    But it -- if that makes any difference, I think the lower court was quite right in saying that that would only mean that you'd established a number of religions or religion generally. 
    And in fact, we never did find out from that witness what the Jewish children did about the Lord's Prayer because they leave that too, you see over the PA system since the Lord's Prayer isn't in their Bible. 
    Now, the other point that I would make is this question of where does the Lord's Prayer stand in this case? 
    It's quite true it is not mandated by the statute. 
    However, the record shows on page 99, I refer to the testimony, although witness for the school district, and it was introduced into evidence by the school district, a book called ‘The Employees' Handbook and Administrative Guide. 
    And the witnesses' attention was direct to the portion which refers to “Teachers-Professional Obligations”. 
    And it states there that the first professional obligation is to comply with the state regulation in reading at least ten verses of scripture each morning without comment. 
    This is to be followed by the Lord's Prayer. 
    Now, that is a part of the hearing which took place before the amendment of the statute. 
    But there is no evidence in the record that this regulation in any way has been changed. 
    And I don't know why it would be changed, because the amendment of the statute didn't affect this Lord's Prayer practice.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2604.949" stopTime="2606.223">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The statute doesn't say anything about it?
speaker="henry_w_sawyer_iii" startTime="2606.223" stopTime="2852.154">
    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    No, it doesn't. 
    Right. 
    We can contend, of course, that the injunction bars it now. 
    You can't read the Lord's Prayer because it's a part of the -- it's a part of the -- of the New Testament, part of the Bible. 
    But it is apparently according to this, this is a state wide publication, it's mandated at least by that rule. 
    And I also call it that your attention to that passage in deciding whether this is compulsory now that the school district always calls this a voluntary Bible reading statute. 
    There's nothing voluntary about the Bible reading. 
    The Bible reading is mandated by the legislature. 
    The language is it shall be read. 
    And as the lower court found in spite of the repealer of this specific provision in that statute saying a teacher would be dismissed if he declined or neglected. 
    This public school code takes care of that. 
    And as the lower court as Mr. -- as Chief Justice Biggs found, Chief Judge Biggs in his opinion, he stated that under the public school code since there is a clause that says, “A willful violation of the school laws is punishable by dismissal,” it seemed at least quite clear to him and it would seem quite clear to me that a teacher could not refuse. 
    I don't think that that -- the case turns on whether the teacher could refuse. 
    This isn't the teacher, but I -- I wish to set the record state -- straight in that respect. 
    Now, we -- we claim that the practice is not voluntary in any sense which applies at least to the Establishment Clause. 
    It is compulsory. 
    It will come, if we may, in a minute, to that what happens and what the effect is of an excused provision. 
    Let me say to all that it's also quite clear from the evidence that the Schempps do not take the position that was referred to hearing the brief. 
    I really think that the brief was quoted out of context. 
    The Schempps testified, children and father alike, of specific creedal, doctrinal religious beliefs of theirs as taught in their family and in their church that were opposed by, if you will, contrary to specific things that had been read from the King James version of the Bible. 
    Since they are Unitarians, the most obvious one is the concept of the trinity and the concept of unity. 
    This is -- this is the -- the most obvious, but there were others. 
    Mr. Schempp said that he didn't wish his children to get the concept of -- as he put it a God of vengeance. 
    The Old Testament God, the jealous God who demands blood sacrifices, and says, “If you don't correct, do them properly.” 
    And this is Leviticus. 
    If you don't do them properly, then the punishment comes upon you and your children. 
    And I question, we come to this question of the Bible's morality. 
    Of course there are morality teachings in the Bible. 
    And of course those things which I frankly say, I think would offend present day morality. 
    I have no hesitations in saying that, because to an adult or with teaching, they can be explained as a great evolving concept to these people, first towards monotheism then to rid themselves of these practices left over from Pagan times. 
    And finally, it will evolve into a concept of God, certainly the God at the end even of the New Testament is not the God of the beginning of the New Testament, but the children can't separate this. 
    I'm not sure it's morality particularly to tell the children that I'm just -- and I'm only picking things that were in this record. 
    I mean, you could go at random through the Bible, but Mr. Schempp says, “When the Bible says if it -- animal dies within your gaze speed and not to those within your greats but to the strangers outside. 
    Now, this doesn't seem like morality to me. 
    Now, this can be explained.It just so happened that that particular thing was cited and then Dr.Grayzel, a Jewish expert said, well this can be explained. 
    I won't go to the explanation, but there is one. 
    Now, this is a different thing with the explanation, but the young children -- one wonders whether this is necessarily --“

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What do you mean?
speaker="henry_w_sawyer_iii" startTime="2853.021" stopTime="3174.223">
    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    -- such morality without explanation as the reading of the Bible alone will ensure good morals. 
    Mr. Schempp pointed out the right in the Ten Commandments. 
    There's a verse that says that if one of them or perhaps all of them is broken, then the sin be upon the children under the fourth generation. 
    That isn't his morality. 
    And I'm sure that can be explained. 
    But it isn't his morality. 
    And reading that without comment is not the kind of concept even moral. 
    And I really submit you cannot separate the two in this context. 
    You cannot separate the moral levin from the religious levin in the Bible. 
    I think the two go absolutely together. 
    And it teaches -- they say it doesn't cross through the type. 
    It teaches -- the book teaches from the opening chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelations. 
    It teaches -- it teaches the way the world was created. 
    And I think it teaches in the sectarian sense from the opening. 
    From the very open, it says “And lo the Spirit was upon the orders”. 
    And in the King James version and I'm sure the Douay Version, that word is capitalized. 
    It means the Holy Ghost. 
    This is the beginning of a teaching of a concept of Trinity. 
    It teaches -- the New Testament is a teaching message. 
    When Jesus said, “Others have said unto you, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. 
    But I say unto you thou shall resist not evil. 
    If one smites thee upon one cheek”, and so on, this is teaching. 
    And it was a highly controversial teaching. 
    Then and I submit to Your Honors, it's highly controversial teaching. 
    Now, men do not agree about these things. 
    And what I said in my brief was that to dismiss these differences as mere quibbles to say, “Well, it doesn't make any difference.” 
    It's really as the Attorney General of Maryland said a question of theism or nontheism is to find a face of hundreds of years of history in bloodshed, I submit, for the religious history. 
    And I said there that that is -- to do that is to deny the validity to many and the value of specific creedal, religious belief. 
    Not religion in general. 
    Not a kind of generalized theism which is suitable to some, but not to others. 
    And I said that to do that is to lead to a foster of kind of colorless national public school creed. 
    But, I don't say that's what they're doing. 
    It's those who make the argument, there's no one here but us theist. 
    We're just reading some lessons of morality, I submit to tend to do that. 
    And I submit that it isn't the function of Government, school districts. 
    It isn't the function of -- even forces in society to ensure that these religious differences of America shall somehow be sort of blurred and sickle over. 
    And we'll come out with this kind of morality. 
    I don't think that's the business of the public schools particularly, but it's a tenancy behind this kind of practice when it's justified in this way. 
    And of course, it must be because to say otherwise is to admit it for what it is and for what the legislation so clearly intended. 
    They didn't single out another single work in the range of the world's literature. 
    And there are other sources of morality. 
    Not one other book in all the range of the world's religious and secular of the literature is singled out by the legislature of Pennsylvania to be read. 
    How many? 
    Ten verses. 
    It shall be read, how? 
    Without comment. 
    This -- this is -- this is unique to start with. 
    Now to be sure, the legislature said, “Well we do this for secular purpose.” 
    And I think that all establishments are nominally done for a secular purpose. 
    At least since the middle ages, I suggest there's never been an establishment. 
    And I mean real complete establishment such as you have in England, you have in Scandinavian countries where their churches such as you have in, shall we say, Italy or Spain. 
    There has never been an establishment in modern times which purported to be an establishment in order to convert men to the doctrine, but rather to improve their ways, because isn't it true that the majority, and they're the ones who are in the position to have an establishment always say, and they must assume, well it's not only our religion that is so effective, but you know, our particular religion just has a way of making men better than other religions. 
    And therefore, it's to the good of the State to have it established. 
    Then I suggest, in answer to Your Honor, Justice Stewart's question, that leads me very close. 
    I'd like to try to answer them. 
    You haven't put it to me, but you put it to one counsel yesterday. 
    And you said these are not inherited in this situation, a conflict between a Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause. 
    And I think not for this reason. 
    I do not think that the Free Exercise Clause -- well, first of all let me say, of course, it can not prevent people from praying. 
    I mean people could pray and they pray and nobody stops them from praying as such. 
    The question is, is it a constitutional right under the Free Exercise Clause to have the State conduct the prayer or to pray in other words under the ejus of the State? 
    And I think clearly not, even if the overwhelming majority has so feel, I think it probably had nothing to do with the question of majority.

    And -- and the students voted overwhelmingly that they wanted to begin their day by having one of their number perhaps on rotating basis, read ten verses from the Bible which every Bible, the particular student reader shows that morning and to begin the school day. 
    And that they -- and then there was -- this was attack of the Constitution and there was evidence from all of these people who voted that our religious beliefs tell us we want to do this in the free exercise of our religion.What kind of case would you have then?

    If and pursuant to that, the school authority say,” Yes, you may use the PA system. 
    We'll have the children doing not something else at the time in the classrooms.” 
    Now, I say that it's an establishment nonetheless, not so crucial one, but an establishment not the -- but if they say during recess, all children who would like to come and listen to ten verses being read in an empty classroom or somewhere around the school grounds, instead of going in the recess, we're going to read it everyday, fine. 
    The difference is the imprimatur and the -- and the ejus of the State. 
    And I'm not sure that the origin makes that much difference.

    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    Well, they have a right to do it, Your Honor, but they haven't got a right to get the State to help them. 
    It's the same -- I think it comes back to the -- to the same question as -- as confronted Madison and Jefferson in Virginia, the overwhelming majority of Virginians at the time of the Assessment Bill were Christians. 
    And they -- they wanted the State to help them establish teachers, but equally -- absolutely equally. 
    And they had an excused provision because as the Assessment Bill was finally -- in its final form in the Virginia legislature provided that it didn't want to give to any religious group, if it designate for secular educational purposes. 
    Perfectly voluntary in that sense, that's how they were describing. 
    And the overwhelming majority wanted this. 
    And they wanted it interesting enough for the same reasons because they said religion had the tendency to correct the morals of men at least the good citizenship just the same as Pennsylvania now says. 
    But it seemed to me that Madison saw two fallacies in this, Your Honor. 
    One was, he said, “Who does not see that that authority which can establish Christianity?” 
    All of it now, and this is 99% surely of Virginians then, established Christianity, the exclusion of other sects may with the same authority establish one sect of Christianity. 
    Secondly, he saw that it's deeper than that. 
    It's deeper than that. 
    It's -- that the State should not use religion for its ends and that's what the -- the Solicitor General Baltimore tells me they're doing. 
    They want to have discipline and authority that he says at the beginning of the day. 
    To that I say, “Yes, precisely.” 
    That is the State now using religion.

    Massachusetts, if I'm not mistaken, had an established church well into the 19th century, (Voice Overlap) the congregational church. 
    It's a matter of wisdom or unwisdom, and what a state might want to do by its organic law or by its statutory law, is something else.

    That religion is at least religion as a voluntary thing for the people to infer.

    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    I'd like to say another word about the testimony. 
    I don't think that we should gloss over these doctrinal and sectarian differences. 
    I think they're profound and I think you have it here. 
    I'm speaking again now really in terms of free exercise, I suppose, at least in terms of detriment. 
    I refer or to take as my text at least, the testimony of Dr. Grayzel. 
    Now, this isn't -- he's said here yesterday that there are some minor doctrinal, minor differences in these versions of the Bible and the counsel, I believe, even lumped in the Jewish Holy Scriptures were minor differences. 
    The New Testament, the concept of Christ, a man who historically lived as being the son of God is, as Dr. Grayzel testified to Judaism, a blasphemy. 
    This was, in fact, Christ's crime. 
    It is a blasphemy. 
    You can't gloss this over by saying there are some minor differences. 
    He pointed out that there's ridicule of the Jewish hierarchy throughout the New Testament. 
    He pointed out that -- think of it gentlemen, the scene of the trial of Jesus before Pilate. 
    He said this has been where the multitude Christ not for Barabbas, but for Jesus and Pilate washes his hands and the version exculpates the Romans for the death of Christ. 
    And then the Jews say and they've so described they say, “His blood be upon us and our children.” 
    And Dr. Grayzel said that sentence has been responsible for more anti-Semitism and any single sense in history I can't doubt it. 
    And I don't think we'll -- I don't see any reason why it shouldn't -- shouldn't be said and cannot read the New Testament in those eyes, not the way perhaps some of us read it, without this kind of thought of all in our minds or had it read to us without realizing that it is consistently implacably and in some cases, systematically anti-Semitic. 
    Sometimes deliberately, I am sorry to say. 
    And Dr. Grayzel pointed out that that money was cross-examined inadvertently about the story of the Good Samaritan which would appear to everyone, perhaps to be a very nice story. 
    And he pointed out that deliberate anti-Semitic bias of that story and how historically the story had some origin and Jewish roots, but that the Samaritan have been substituted for the Israelite, it originally being a story of the three great nations of Jewish society and their varying responsibilities in terms of the laws regarding cleanliness and disease. 
    And surely, that ought to be enough of it. 
    That would be the end of the matter.

    Well, first he said within Christianity and they gave a great caveat as to the Catholics. 
    Quite a caveat, he said “Well I'm not a Catholic and I'm not qualified to say” and they have footnotes and transcriptions.

    -- Revised Standard Version was highly sectarian that there'd been a public burning of that as late at 1952. 
    I don't think he came out with anything more finally than it was nonsectarian among the Protestant sects and that's what the lower court found. 
    And he also said that as literature and as history, the work was secondary and that he primary --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3868.796" stopTime="3872.209">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That he had to do a version that would also be nonsectarian.
speaker="henry_w_sawyer_iii" startTime="3872.209" stopTime="3988.619">
    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    Well, I think that later on, Your Honor, he -- he had a caveat as to the Catholic in the record. 
    On direct examination, I think, he said that. 
    But let's assume, Your Honor, that it's totally nonsectarian within the Christian church, and I think I can demonstrate from our evidence that that just isn't so that the Catholic and sect goes which we quote, “They very -- the Catholic encyclopedia make it very clear that the Catholics regard the King James version, which had been characterized as the chief arm of the Protestant revoked through his dedication is profoundly anti-Catholic, speaking of the Pope as that man of sin. 
    And the Catholics characterized it as a work full of error, and a work which has deliberately been used for proselytizing. 
    Now, whether that's true or not, makes no difference if Catholics or some Catholics still believe and it's no accident, I believe, that all of the Bible reading cases, and I think there's no exception to this, they were brought during that early period. 
    The 1890s and 1900 were brought by Catholics and in fact, the most shameful page in Philadelphia's religious history throughout of this controversy were a few blocks from the place where this case was tried, in the infamous Nativist Riots in 1844 brought about by the Native American Party who drew out of what version of the Bible should be read in the public schools. 
    Bishop Kendrick had said that do a version ought to be given equal status and the no nothing seized upon that and said “The Catholics are trying to throw the Protestant Bible out of the public schools.” 
    The riots followed and people were killed, churches were burned. 
    In fact, the Catholics finally were given shelter in a Quaker meeting-house at (Inaudible). 
    And this is not a typical page in Philadelphia's religious history, we pride ourselves on religious tolerance but that happened in Philadelphia, and concerned this very thing and here, whether it would be the Douay Version or the King James version that should be read upon establishment.

    Well, no sir. 
    And it wouldn't even on this type of establishment of course when they were but even on the question of sectarian practice in preferring one religion over another. 
    Dr. Grayzel testified that the Old Testament was -- was warded through with Christological references as he put it. 
    In other words, they're going back in translation, and inserted references in things like Isaiah in such a form as to predict the coming of Christ which he, as a Jewish scholar, took strong exception to both from the standpoint of religion and scholarship. 
    And secondly, you'd have the problem of Bible reading as such. 
    You see, you have the problem that some sects don't believe that you should just read the Bible. 
    As Dr. Grayzel says in Judaism, “You don't read the Bible, you study it.” 
    And the Catholics are quite clear that the Bible should be pervade to the members of the Catholic Church by the church and with its explanation and with its -- and under its authority. 
    So I think you have that problem even with the reading of the Old Testament and of course you'd still have the establishment problem.

    It means action. 
    And the question must be then whether in fact it concerns and respects religion and we have that question and that's argued here because they say it concerns morality. 
    And then perhaps whether it's de minimis but it makes no difference. 
    If you had a -- suppose you had an actual established church, but you wouldn't have any of the lesser violations just because people didn't have to go to it, or didn't have to have their taxes devoted to it. 
    In fact, that gentleman that came up yesterday who moved into a community of where the Methodist had established a church and you've asked whether there'd be any detriment to him, I don't think there needs to be any detriment.

    It is a detriment to his rights as a -- as an American under the Constitution. 
    Now, that doesn't mean, Your Honor, that a dwindling modicum of establishment stand at the point of the rubric on the coin which if it's anything is an establishment, I think, necessarily always -- there isn't also a dwindling amount of standing. 
    And I think when you get to that point, then that standing is so miniscule, the incursion is so slight, the amount of the establishment is so slight that the Court dismisses it as de minimis.

    Yes sir. 
    I've discussed it in the sense that here you have and we say you have a measurable -- a religious ceremony which is -- which is of measurable quantum and which has some reasonable impingement upon the individual that secondly the State is doing more than altering the little counters that step out of coin. 
    And there's necessarily some mechanism behind this as first to purchase, distribution of the King James Version of the Bible throughout the school system. 
    There then the rules and regulations that I quoted. 
    There's then the time set aside. 
    There is the mechanism for excusing but this is sufficient participation -- active participation by the State, when it's combined with the fact the ceremony is so clearly religious, to take it out of the de minimis clause whereas the uttering of the single word or the two words under God is certainly -- certainly much more borderline and probably de minimis. 
    I would like to turn, if I may, again just a little bit to the situation in Virginia. 
    And the reason I do so is because I think there's no clause of the First Amendment that his authorship is so obvious and the background is so obvious, and the situation matches are so closely.

    But you see it seem to me Madison saw the problem so clearly there, and it seems to me it highlights the problem and I'm speaking now just the Establishment Clause right now. 
    Because I think we have just the perfect and typical establishment here in so many ways, lesser one in extent. 
    But what did Madison see wrong with this Assessment Bill after it had its excused provision? 
    It assumed both sides of the coin. 
    Of course first of all he said, “This is using religion as an engine of civil policy. 
    And there is to obtain very worthy civil objectives, you will use religion as your instrumentality.”

    And Mr. Burch I think fell in the exact same error as Patrick Henry, when he supported this bill later on when he became governor.

    That case if it ever comes, I think, will bring into square conflict, the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause because it is certainly much of an establishment. 
    You could hardly say that was “de minimis”. 
    On the other hand, when the State, by its own coercive legal power, physically separates a man from his religious activity, his religious sources, then you have also gravely damaged his free exercise, unless you provide him with an alternative. 
    And I don't propose to settle that question here. 
    I would find it more comfortable to argue that the Free Exercise Clause there prevails over establishing.

    I understand Barnette to be a situation in which the Jehovah's Witnesses are not complaining about professions of belief and disbelief but about the idea that to raise your hand towards the flag was violation of the (Voice Overlap). 
    But, I submit that the flag salute and particularly then before it had the ‘54 Clause in an under God. 
    The act of saluting the flag is a secular act to everyone except to Jehovah's Witness or maybe some other few sects. 
    But it's a secular act, and that's the reason that Court there stops short of prohibiting the activity. 
    They simply because it's enough there if you simply say you, if your religion thinks of it as a religious act, you don't have to participate. 
    But it being to everyone else a secular activity, then you have no standing or did they ask by the way and that's another point, they didn't ask for it and then the doctrine of judicial parsimony why should you do it. 
    But even if they had, you have no right to stop a secular act just like the conscientious objector situation; you make a special exception when the religious basis, the war goes on. 
    That is the difference, it seems to me, and Torcaso by the way have somewhat the same situation. 
    In the first place, in Torcaso's case, he just asked for a writ of mandamus and that's where we start and that's what the Court gave him. 
    And I don't think you were asked to do any more than that. 
    He says,” I want the office.” 
    And he bought, he didn't asked for injunction against the oath the way we did or anything about, he just said, “I want the office” and he used the appropriate writ for it and he granted the writ.

    I gather that you suggested in your answer that if there were conflict, or at least be in that context where there is a conflict, if you had engaged for you with the judge you would think the Free Exercise Clause should prevail over the Establishment Clause?
speaker="henry_w_sawyer_iii" startTime="4979.510" stopTime="5087.192">
    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    Chaplains, yes sir I would -- I would. 
    I was saying that it seems to me that the vice that Madison saw in the Assessment Bill of using religion as an engine of civil policy applied here and I've cited some of the arguments were made yesterday. 
    I'm asking solely on the other side of the coin and I think we have that here and that is that there's a kind of a bargain strike because what does religion get out of the -- out of the arrangement, I don't suggest anything venal but this arrangement is typical of an establishment. 
    It gets the State's ejus in providing the measure -- the audience. 
    Now, we're talking establishment now aside from the excuse what the State provides the audience. 
    And I suggest that this kind of double accommodation that it typifies establishment everywhere that it exists. 
    And I think that -- that was in the Assessment Bill and I think it's here. 
    In other words, the State lands it's ejus to in some way, in some way putting an official sanction or in some way accommodating or aiding the religion or a group of religions. 
    And in exchange, the religion is supposed to fulfill a civil end of the State. 
    And there are -- have been certainly in history, examples where that went terribly far indeed where the religion was part of the repressive engine of the State and by the same as token, the religion was quite a state-aided it in its preeminent position. 
    We don't suggest that but I say it's a whole market of establishment and I think that this bill is an example of it and I think the legislature so intended here to use religion as an engine of civil policy for very worthy causes. 
    But I think in violation of the Constitution nonetheless --

    I know but under the Fourteenth Amendment because as we all know, well as we've said earlier, the State used long after the adoption of the First Amendment, many states had actual established religions and the good many historians think that one of the very reasons for the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment was to be sure that the Federal Government didn't establish the church and to leave the States free to establish their churches if they wanted to, or not to if they didn't want to.

    You have Engle.
speaker="henry_w_sawyer_iii" startTime="5227.080" stopTime="5413.813">
    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    I think that'd be it. 
    Now, we think of course in McCollum controls, too. 
    If Engle it seems to me just clearly controls from the standpoint of establishment, I just don't think there'd any question you could possibly, you have to reexamine Engle. 
    It's what the State is doing as I say, the acts of participation mean nothing in terms of establishment. 
    But we think McCollum controls and so that the -- so did the lower court and Chief Judge Biggs' opinion, he so states. 
    And I should think you have too because in McCollum, you really had a couple of preachers that were really less, less of an establishment in one respect and certainly less in the free exercise. 
    And now I'm on both clauses because I'm just saying the case controls. 
    After all in McCollum, at least that the religious material was pervade by private instructors and not by the authority of the teacher and in the sense that's less of an establishment. 
    And then under the Free Exercise Clause, two differences are that in McCollum and this is important I think under free exercise, you had to volunteer to get the instruction which is certainly a lot less, I would think, a lot less of a violation than to have to volunteer out, so to speak, and decide not to have it. 
    And the other would be that you -- at least got your own religion if you volunteered and you didn't get anybody else's. 
    And that the lower court thought McCollum because they decided this case of course before they had the benefit of this Court's decision in the Engle case. 
    Well, we say that there is an establishment. 
    In addition to that it is clear as crystal and just ingenuous to say that this doesn't prefer one religion over another. 
    And how fine you chop it is another thing. 
    But certainly at the grossest of the broadest than any sense of the word it prefers Christian religions over non-Christian religions. 
    I think it goes further than that and that you cannot do and that statute does. 
    It is a religious exercise. 
    It seems to me, it was intended to be a religious exercise. 
    I think it's ingenuous to suggest that the legislature had anything else in mind but that. 
    I don't think that you can use the word morality to encompass all of these pervade to the minds of children by this book. 
    And there will be many, many things read out of the King James Version will rule exclusively -- if you can separate the challenge but it will exclusively concern religious concepts and ideas without any distinguishable moral truth. 
    Certainly, citations could be multiplied endlessly in terms of ritual, in terms of many kinds of beliefs that are religious in nature and haven't any but of most minor degree of morality. 
    And if you're teaching morality again, you would hardly provide for excuses that pointed out, and secondly, why would you have no comment, every other subject the secular subject is taught, is taught with comment, why not this one?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5413.813" stopTime="5421.210">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Sawyer what -- have you said in this word of argument that, well even if it is religion, it's religious tradition.
speaker="henry_w_sawyer_iii" startTime="5421.210" stopTime="5618.240">
    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    Oh, Your Honor, that's just simply saying that if -- if the legislature for Pennsylvania has traditionally had an act that violates the First Amendment, then it's entitled to continue now. 
    Their argument goes a little further than that because it says that the duty of Government and they use the word government as a whole, presumably to include the judiciary and then in the sense, of course it does. 
    The duty of Government is to be neutral about these matters and if you decide to take this practice all out since it is traditional, that is being unneutral. 
    Well, that just seems to me to relegate the role of the judiciary. 
    I don't know what the function would be as to anything that wasn't noble. 
    And the fact that it's old has it seems to me nothing to do with being neutral or unneutral. 
    We're complaining that the legislature of Pennsylvania has been unneutral and under the system we have, I think we've come to the judiciary to set the matter straight if they're minded to agree with us. 
    And this could hardly be said to be unneutral just because in addition to those facts, the unneutrality in our view, it is the unneutrality happens to go back quite a while. 
    I think the tradition is not to be stuck up but let me say this very candidly. 
    I think it is the final arrogance to talk constantly about our religious tradition in this country and acquaint it with this Bible. 
    Sure, religious tradition, whose religious tradition? 
    It isn't any part of the religious tradition of substantial number of Americans of a great many -- a great many things and really some of the salient features of the King James Version or the Douay Version to that matter. 
    And it is just to me a little bit easy and I say arrogant to keep talking about our religious tradition. 
    It suggests that the public schools at least to Pennsylvania or a kind of Protestant institutions to which others are cordially invited. 
    And I think to some extent they have been in our state and nobody and maybe in times gone by, that didn't make very much difference or that those that we're injured were no perhaps legal because of the newness of this doctrine, Your Honor, or psychological or even financial position to complain much about it. 
    But we have here in the schools of Pennsylvania, the conducting mandated by statute day after day as an exercise, the reading of the Sacred Book of Christianity. 
    And I submit to you gentlemen that that is as the lower court found as a fact, finding of fact conducted there as a religious ceremony. 
    I might say the footnote of that that the lower court found as a fact that there was a higher demeanor and standard of the Court that required that during this time. 
    Now, that isn't a bad thing if you're going to read the Bible honorably but it's certainly demonstrates again, if it's higher than other secular subjects, it is regarded differently and can only be regarded, I think, as a religious ceremony.

    Mr. Henry W. Sawyer, III 
    There's nothing. 
    I submit that the circumstances are at record and you can judge. 
    It's not disagreed upon that Bible reading, prayer, spread of religions, school announcements follow seriatim. 
    Without any more than a decent clause and I suggest that -- I just can't see the practical matter and this is what Mr. Schempp said. 
    How could you excuse the child from one and not the other? 
    Unless he stands immediately outside the classroom door, which happens to be typical of punishment, but that's incidental perhaps but he stands immediately outside and when he hears the class finish the recitation of the end of the Lord's Prayer and he hears the almanac, comes first and back in again. 
    Now, whether that would be done that way, or some other way, well, I just submit as a matter of logic. 
    He either misses the pledge of allegiance which greater even more greatly as Mr. Schempp testify would compound the confusion as to what he dissents from and there's enough equation now, it seems to me, or possible when Mr. Schempp reasonably apprehended I think between some time religious dissent perhaps and then you go to atheism that maybe equated with un-Americanism and if you're missing the flag salute and in any way, then misses the school announcements. 
    It's a price you shouldn't have to pay.

    Well, there might be some who are walking 50 miles to avoid it. 
    I'm just saying, if I may, sir in closing, that we rest our case most strongly on the Establishment Clause. 
    We ask, as far as the Schempps are concerned, for nothing more than what I think we would suppose them to be entitled to and that is they do not in complying with the State's compulsory school attendance law and sending their children there that they don't have to at home and in the church contradicts what is taught or pervaded the children in the schools. 
    That seems to me would be their inherent right and that they don't have to pay any price, any price at all no matter how slight to avoid that.

    Both and here, both have sued.

    Interestingly enough Your Honor, the record in the trial of that case, seems to indicate, it assembles situation but as I read it, seems to indicate that one of the troubles was that, Mrs. Vashti McCollum was an atheist and she was concerned because the young McCollum was becoming rather interested in going to this release time ceremonies in the school.

    I don't think if there's any doubt and he might be entertained as a litigant but he wasn't. 
    And the Court there I think recognized that the child has a right and the parent has a right, both as guardian of the child and in the parent's own right. 
    So I think the right, in other words, to answer your question is dual. 
    But you know that McCollum situation suggest another problem here. 
    This might create divisiveness within a single family as we had in instance even mentioned here yesterday and McCollum case apparently was that, although I don't think it's in the opinion itself. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.

   Rebuttal of John D. Killian, III

    Mr. John D. Killian, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I will -- amicus brief as the Court has indicated a bizarre big thing, but what we are concerned with here today is a practice that goes back in Pennsylvania far into the days of its history. 
    This practice as before the Court today is a codified practice. 
    The codification occurred in 1913, but the practice goes back deep into the colonial days of our State. 
    The practice is not as the other as Mr. Sawyer indicates a religious practice; it is an educational practice. 
    It is a practice in the schools which has educational values. 
    We've been talking about the moral values that are provided by this practice. 
    It is not a religious practice. 
    Dr. Boehm, the Superintendent of Public Instruction in his testimony in the lower court was asked whether this practice contained educational value and in his testimony at page 89 of the record states that he thinks that the reading of the Bible, I'll read out a few words “is one of the last vestiges of moral value that we have left in our school system.” 
    This stands out, I quote him, “as a strong contradiction to the materialistic trends of our times.” 
    Certainly, this practice reflects the religious origins and traditional religious levin of our public life. 
    The practice of reading the Bible existed in the colonial days as a reading exercise and for the purpose of moral instruction. 
    But it is fundamentally and has always been in Pennsylvania, educational practice. 
    It would seem to me that when you're studying the arts, you have to study sacred themes, you have to study sacred music if you want to be a musician, and if you want to be a good citizen and you want your schools to educate you that way, you must study morality and what better source of morality is there than this Bible. 
    The legislature of Pennsylvania was codifying a conclusion that the people of Pennsylvania long before reach that the Bible is a source of this morality. 
    Now, the decisions of this Court have made reference to the fact that we are religious people, that there is a religious labeling on our society and we manifest and express this religion in many ways. 
    Many of these have been briefed and discussed then these arguments are need not go into but the Court has also said in some opinions that if we're going to work this levin out of our society, we have to do it by -- through the individual and through groups and not through the Government. 
    The Government should be neutral, it should not be hostile. 
    And we feel that the ripping out of this practice out of the public schools as an educational practice would express hostility to religion.
