Goss v. Board of Education of Knoxville, Tennessee

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- 217, Josephine Goss, et al., Petitioners, versus The Board of Education of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee. 
    Mr. Marshall.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="10.220" stopTime="279.580">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I should like to start by stating briefly the interest of the United States in these cases. 
    These are the first school desegregation cases which the Court has taken for argument since Cooper against Aaron. 
    The United States participated in Cooper against Aaron, and also in the Brown cases both on the merits and on relief. 
    So our participation in these cases reflects a continuing national policy. 
    The cases themselves involved an important question of the constitutionality of transfer provisions in Knoxville in Davidson County, Tennessee which operate explicitly on the grounds of race. 
    Put in their most favorable light, these transfer rules are designed to permit children of both races to avoid the effects of desegregation, although, as I shall develop, in doing so, they also compelled children to go to particular schools because of their race. 
    The transfer rules reflect to some degree, the deep-seeded fears of some parents in these places and elsewhere in the area of desegregation. 
    The legal assumption behind the rules is that the school boards may give effect to these fears in the administration of the school districts by permitting transfer of children depending upon their race and depending upon the majority -- of the race of the majority of the other children in the school. 
    In our view, this legal assumption is wrong, and it derives from presumptions about race which undermine the Brown case. 
    The presumptions being that it is harmful for children of both races to go to school together and it is a proper aim of Government to take steps that design to permit them to go to school separately. 
    The United States is also interested in these cases because the situations which are presented in them are not unique. 
    The States of Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida, all have statutes which are -- which say in effect that no child of either race may against his wishes be compelled to go to a school where he will be in the minority racially. 
    In addition, transfer plans of this sort have been introduced in other cities. 
    They are now in effect in Nashville, in Memphis, and Humphrey County in Tennessee, and were included but turned down by the courts in Chattanooga and Obion County. 
    In Virginia, they are now a part of the plans in Lynchburg, Arlington, Alexandria, and Warren County. 
    And in Virginia, they were also included but turned down by the Fourth Circuit in the Charlotte's Bill Plan. 
    So there is presented the possibility that if these rules are proved in these cases that they will spread and become a part of the pattern of desegregation throughout the entire area of desegregation under the Brown case. 
    These rules start with an unquestioned use of racial criteria. 
    They treat children differently, depending solely upon their race. 
    White children may transfer when Negroes may not. 
    And Negroes may transfer when whites may not. 
    The other side of that coin --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Marshall, can you tell me where that rule, (Inaudible)

    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    That's -- that's correct too, Mr. Justice White. 
    The other side of that is that the white child may transfer out of the school, but the Negro must stay there. 
    The school board not only moves the white child out, it makes the Negro child stay in the school and the same way with the -- when the Negro child moves out and the whites have come.

    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    On the face of the rule, Mr. Justice Black as I understand it, and on the face of the plan, a Negro child and a white child are both assigned to a school in a school district. 
    The Negro child must go to that district, because he's assigned there. 
    The white child may move automatically before he ever attends the school, if he's in the minority or if the school was previously an all Negro school, either way. 
    And of course the rule does not depend on how much of a minority he's in. 
    It might be 49%, 51% or something like that.

    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    That's right, Mr. Justice White. 
    But it does not treat Negro children and white children alike. 
    When you look at any particular school district, if you take a school district where the majority is Negro, the Negro children in that school district must go to the school in that district. 
    The white children do not have to go to the school on that district.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="478.790" stopTime="484.493">

    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    But that does not -- that does not in my judgment, Mr. Justice Stewart, cure the discrimination against the Negro children in the school district which I chose. 
    Those Negro children, each has a constitutional right not to be treated unequally because of his race. 
    And he's being made to go to a school because of his race, where white children who are exactly in the same circumstance are not made to go to that school. 
    That is the discrimination. 
    It is not an answer to that discrimination. 
    Under the cases and decisions of this Court to say that in another school district, Negro children may decide not to go to a school that white children have to go to.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I'd suppose you'd say, Mr. Marshall, that those white children and their parents could equally maintain an action, if they cared to, challenging these transfer provisions on the same constitutional ground of discrimination. 
    What happened in the case you have is on behalf of Negro children, who complained of the discrimination as against them, isn't that it?
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="607.064" stopTime="608.487">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    That's correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="608.487" stopTime="636.861">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And you say, do you say that what's happened in another school is no answer in the district which you choose to talk about. 
    Also, I take it that you agree with Mr. Greenberg that there's no answer that they desired to the parents of the children are to transfer, that the State has -- it's constitutionally prohibited from recognizing the private choices of the parents and the children to transfer. 
    And it's just as simple as that.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="636.861" stopTime="774.898">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    That's right, Mr. Justice White. 
    We have a series of cases -- have had a series of some voting cases in Louisiana, one of which came to this Court. 
    In tho -- under Louisiana law, private citizens may go in and purge voters from the record if they haven't -- if they're not qualified in the judgment of the private citizens. 
    There was about a -- six years ago, a series of purges in the number of parishes in Louisiana, all initiated under Louisiana law by the private citizens. 
    But the courts have ordered the Negroes that were purged from the roles under those circumstances restored to their roles because the purge was discriminatory in the sense that whites were not purged at the same time as Negroes, even though the impetus came from the decision of a private individual. 
    I think the Burton case, which this Court decided two years ago is another analogy. 
    In the Burton case, a private restaurant man was given the use of state property in Wilmington and he discriminated. 
    It was his private decision but he did it through state property, public property, property that was supposed to be used for the public, and this Court struck that down. 
    I think another analogy is the Girard College case where the -- Mr. Girard wanted to set up a college for whites only but he did it using the machinery of the state and this Court struck that down because the state machinery itself was the instrument of discrimination. 
    And so here, I do not think that the school board can avoid the fact that it is what is assigning these children to school, not the parents. 
    The school board is assigning children to school and even it's assigning children to school differently depending upon their -- whether they're white children or Negro children.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="774.898" stopTime="779.479">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, depending upon the wishes of the other children and their parents. 
    Ultimately --
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="779.479" stopTime="787.895">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, whatever the reason for the school board doing it, whatever its reason, it is the school board that's doing it, not the parent.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="787.895" stopTime="830.927">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well not that I understand you in answer to Mr. Justice White to say that if a color -- Negro mother and father came to a school and send -- call us prejudiced if you will, but we simply don't like our child to be in school with a -- where there's a -- where there are majority of white boys and girls. 
    We're old-fashioned, we're prejudiced, we're whatever you want to call us, but we don't want it, we don't like it, and we think it's doing our child harm and our child thinks so too. 
    And we therefore want to transfer her to a school where there are majority of equal of our own race. 
    You say that the Constitution requires the school board to deny that request?
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="830.927" stopTime="842.621">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    I say, Mr. Justice Stewart, that the school board cannot, whatever the wishes of the parents, cannot assign children differently to different schools depending on the race.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="842.621" stopTime="851.899">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This is not an assignment, this is a request by the mother and father and the child, a voluntary wish, their affirmative of desire.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="851.899" stopTime="857.670">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Nevertheless, Mr. Justice Stewart, the school board is running the school system.

    Of course.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="858.089" stopTime="869.599">
    Mr. Burke Marshall

    Whether or not to grant that request --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, you still -- you haven't answered my question at all, so far as I'm concerned. 
    We're not talking about any child having to go anywhere. 
    We're talking about the school board's -- what its constitutional duty is when faced with a request such as what was included in my question.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="907.286" stopTime="923.639">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, the -- that same school board is assigning a number of Negro children. 
    We will take the school district which is say 40% white and 60% Negro.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Alright.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="924.482" stopTime="932.938">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Now, the school board, under this plan, assigns all those children to the school in the school district without regard to their race.

    Yes.

    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    The Negro children in that school district are compelled to go to that school. 
    Now, that's a compulsion by the State to make them go to that school.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="945.089" stopTime="949.615">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I suppose all the children in these school districts are compelled to go to school under the truancy laws --
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="949.615" stopTime="950.787">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="950.787" stopTime="952.666">

    Whether that's not an issue here, isn't it?
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="952.666" stopTime="997.391">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    No, but the school board has to decide where the Negro children go to school and where the white children go to school. 
    It decides the Negro children have to go to that school in that district and that the white children do not have to go to school in that district. 
    Now, that is a decision made by the State, solely on the basis of race and I do not think the school board can avoid its constitutional responsibility for having made that decision by saying that it derives from the wishes of the parents anymore than the City of Philadelphia could avoid what it did in the Girard College case by saying it all derived from the wishes of Mr. Girard.

    Well, that sounds that rule was, that parent transfer his child, I mean any parent, white or colored, by going to the school board and so requesting it. 
    Would it then be the constitutional duty of the school board to refuse the transfer?
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1060.261" stopTime="1062.665">
    Mr. Burke Marshall

    If Mr. Justice Stewart, everyone in the school district could transfer out, that would be a different case.

    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    That's right -- well, whatever is -- whatever the motivation of the parent in both Moore and Louisville now, whatever the motivation of the parent, any child can transfer to another school. 
    The limits on that that controls on it and the administration of the school district have to do with how big the school is, how many teachers it has, how big these classrooms are, and the priorities who applied first. 
    Now, that kind of control has nothing to do with race. 
    And if that kind of transfer plan we're working here, there's no contention that the school board would have the duty to inquire in to the motives of the parents.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I follow this, Mr. Marshall. 
    I was discussing this with Mr. Greenberg yesterday as we close last evening. 
    Do I understand this now at least it's the Government's position that in Baltimore, where as I understand it, the transfer provisions have nothing whatever to do with race? 
    There are other considerations which may prevent the transfer or not. 
    But assuming that those transfer provisions could be satisfied in the transfer, otherwise we permit it. 
    Negro parents who come to the school principal and say, “Our child is not happy here. 
    We don't think the child is doing well here. 
    We think the child will do better if he transfers to this other school where the children are largely Negro. 
    And it's because of this, because they're largely Negro, we want to transfer the child.” 
    I gather your position would be that the principal could not say to the parents, “Well, even though you satisfy all the other requirements of the transfer and the transfer is permissible because you tell me you're putting on a racial ground, I can't allow the transfer.” 
    You would not go to that far?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but Mr. Marshall, let's get it really straight. 
    You -- you would say that the school board could not allow that transfer unless the white child in the school could also be able to get the same transfer.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1217.870" stopTime="1222.858">

    Justice Byron R. White 
    If the -- if the school board -- if where a Negro is in a minority, the Negro parent comes in and says, “I would like my child transferred,” that's why they stick on purely racial ground. 
    The school board could allow that transfer if the white person who came in and wanted to transfer out, would allow to transfer on purely racial ground.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1258.098" stopTime="1262.730">

    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    I think that if the school board has a free transfer system, so that anyone can transfer whatever his reasons then he -- then both those transfers would be permitted and that isn't the school board would not have to inquire behind into the motives and that the parents volunteered the motive I think that would --

    No, Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    And of course the -- every school system as I was discussing with Mr. Justice Stewart has to have rules, it can't escape the responsibility for telling where children they should go. 
    Now, if the rules permit free transfer and the limits of the rules are on how many school they have and how many classrooms, and who applied first and that kind of nonracial criteria then the motives of the parents don't seem to me enter into it at all.

    Beyond that though because a Negro child under these rules who is assigned in a school district, where the school was formerly all Negro has to stay there whether he believes in segregated schools or not, he has no right to transfer no matter how much he believes in integrated school.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    General, under the provisions that are set -- set forth, this would mean that the school board adopted this additional rule (Inaudible)
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1588.608" stopTime="1721.426">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Well, I think it would, Mr. Justice Goldberg. 
    I wanted to make this caveat when we're talking about other kinds of plans that the school board might devise. 
    We -- it's a very difficult to discuss these plans in a vacuum and when the plan of that sort of comes up, it will come up on a record and in a school district which is resisting desegregation it may be that the circumstances would show that the purpose in effect of that, despite its equality of treatment on its face was discriminatory. 
    After all, this case and all of these cases come up from a court order and the court order requires the school board to give the plaintiffs their right which is a right under the Brown cases and Cooper against Aaron to attend desegregated school system. 
    And when the school board acts in a way that doesn't accomplish that which they are ordered to do by the Court, I think it goes beyond the constitutional questions on phases, it's whether -- it's compliance with the court order. 
    Because as I understand the Brown case, the second Brown decision, it is -- that is what the school boards are ordered to do to create a desegregated school system operated and in accordance with the Constitution. 
    And the steps that go away from that are not permitted under the Brown decision. 
    In fact there -- I think that if you look at this as a transitional plan, I think that what we have been discussing are terms of its prominent constitutionality but if you look at it there's a transitional plan, I think that the Brown case absolutely controls it. 
    Because the Brown case required school boards to move towards a desegregated school system. 
    It put that as an affirmative duty on them and it listed the kinds of things which would permit delays in that process.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1721.426" stopTime="1744.123">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the desegregated school system knows, a system in which the school does not keep anybody out because of his race whether he'd be white or Negro or any other race. 
    But it doesn't say anything about compelling any given school to have -- to have a biracial student body, doesn't it?
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1744.123" stopTime="1755.039">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    But that is not what I'm talking about either, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    I don't think there's any question in this case about compulsory integration. 
    That's not involved at all.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1755.039" stopTime="1766.506">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But there's certainly isn't that -- any, any child assigned to a school, can stay in the school as the school isn't keeping anybody out on account of his race and under the system, is it?
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1766.506" stopTime="1771.327">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    It is keeping people in particular segregated schools because of their race. 
    Yes, it is.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1771.327" stopTime="1774.733">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Voice Overlap) people out. 
    That's what the Brown case had to deal with, didn't it?
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1774.733" stopTime="1798.193">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    I -- as I read the Brown Case, Mr. Justice Stewart, it talked about school systems that are upgraded in a fashion in which children are not treated differently because of their race. 
    And this plan treats children differently throughout the system because of their race. 
    Sometimes that operates to keep white children in schools, sometimes it operates --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1798.193" stopTime="1808.697">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It only as I -- it operates all only upon the affirmative, private wish of personal human beings, not by government actions.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1808.697" stopTime="1821.284">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    But it is government action, Mr. Justice Stewart, in constitutional terms. 
    The school board, the school board under these transfer rules, it is the school board that decides what school a child can go to.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1821.284" stopTime="1831.698">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, and they assigned the children to schools and then any transfer is triggered and actuated only by the personal and private desire of the student or his parents
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1831.698" stopTime="1855.210">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    But Mr. Justice Stewart, what triggers the action of the school board doesn't make it -- it doesn't mean that the school board's action isn't still stayed action under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    As I said, it is like the Burton case and the Girard College case, and these purge cases where the school board is still an instrumentality of the State which is treating children throughout the school --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1855.210" stopTime="1857.711">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    By granting a transfer, by granting a transfer.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1857.711" stopTime="1900.363">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    And denying transfer is also though, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    Because every time they grant a transfer to a member of the minority race, they are saying at the same time that all the children of the other race in that same school, who are under exactly the same circumstances in every respect except for the race cannot transfer. 
    They are keeping children in school as well as permitting them to move from school to school. 
    They are assigning them. 
    This compulsion of the State is on a Negro to make him stay in a school, when the white does not have to stay in the same school and the only difference is that one is white and one is Negro.

    May I ask you if the Court made any finding with reference to the questions to which Mr. Greenberg called our attention yesterday and answers one on page 104, 105, one on page 219, where the official in answer to a question said, “The plan did tend to perpetuate segregation and that on page 219, under this provision, setting forth these racial conditions based on the minority race transfer, the effect of it is to permit a child, to choose segregation out of his zone, outside of his zone but not to choose integration outside of his zone.

    Do you refer to them in your brief? 
    I'm asking you for this reason, I understood you to say and I think that at least some possibility for the statement that what the Brown decision here was that there must be moved much tall integration. 
    That meaning, I presume, that there would be an end to all deliberate speed, that that wasn't ad infinitum? 
    And I -- from what I understand you are arguing, you are arguing that where it does not move on in that direction, though sometimes, the reason in that this Court had in the Japanese cases in the west, that they are violating the ground, order and decree.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you have any argument to the effect that if this does perpetuate, undoubtedly perpetuate integration and that if it does what it said on page 219, that it shows that the purpose of the Brown case in the decree rendered under it namely not in 2,056 but within some reasonable time, bring an end to this situation which the Court had held was unconstitutional.

    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Black. 
    That is argued in our brief and that's our position. 
    The District Courts -- I think that it would be fair to say that there is no evidence that was introduced in either of these cases which supports this transfer provision as a step towards desegregation under the Brown cases. 
    And as far as the courts are concerned, neither of the District Courts really discussed the transfer provision in those terms at all. 
    The court in the Knoxville case didn't discuss it at all. 
    It -- and the Davidson County case thought it was found by the previous decisions of the Sixth Circuit.

    Mr. K. Harlan Dodson, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Nominally, I am appearing here today on behalf of the School Board of Davidson County, Tennessee. 
    I say nominally because actually today there is no school board at Davidson County, Tennessee. 
    In the latter part of 1962 and subsequent to the time that this petition was acted upon, we had what is defined in Tennessee as a metropolitan government election. 
    And we are now operating a unified government between the City of Nashville and Davidson County with the result that as of now, we have a combined school board. 
    I make that observation because actually some of the figures that would appear in this record would not be exactly applicable today. 
    We would have to consider this more a combination of the Maxwell case and the Kelley case in order to get it in its proper perspective.

    Mr. K. Harlan Dodson, Jr. 
    Yes, and we're confronted with the larger difficulty than we would have been have we made Davidson County. 
    Now, may it please the Court, I would like to submit three preliminary propositions before going to the immediate question that we have, I think these bear upon it. 
    In the first place, when we were instructed by the District Court to formulate zones, school zones, neighborhood zones, whatever they'd be called, without regard to race they were so formulated. 
    There was no gerrymandering in them. 
    There has been no charge of any gerrymandering in them. 
    Those are fair zones we submit, they are zones based upon population and school facility and nothing else. 
    Secondly, may it please the Court, in these cases, on the question that has been brought up by this Court, I respectfully submit that we are required to discuss it in that. 
    And I say that because there is no individual before this Court, or no one in a class before this Court as an individual, who has asked other relief is being sought here. 
    There has been no Negro child who has asked to be transferred out of a school and had been denied. 
    There has been no white child ask to be transferred out of or into a school and then denied. 
    And so I submit that we must consider this case in a vacuum because there is no party before the Court. 
    No justiciable controversy or issue as to any person.

    Now, frankness requires me to admit that administratively up to this point, yes it has been considered by the school board as good cause.

    No, may it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    It says that under number five, other things may be considered as good cause. 
    But under number six, that these things which are defined may be considered as valid reasons by the board and they are about a board and they are spelled out but it does not say that there are not others which may be considered. 
    And we have not had the application or the request yet. 
    And I do not know what the school board would do with such an application or request. 
    And the superintendent in the Davidson system so stated that he didn't know what would happen. 
    We were not dealing with that. 
    We have had no request. 
    If the Court please, I think these all points to what I submit is a basic fallacy in the position taken by the petitioners and by the mixture of the Government and that is this. 
    An assignment is made by the school board. 
    A child is assigned to a school by the school board with total disregard to race, it's based strictly upon zones which have not been challenged and which are not based upon race. 
    There is a difference between an assignment by a school board of a child to a particular school and the permission by the school board of that child to transfer upon the request of the parent who is first charged with the educational welfare of that child. 
    Now, may it please the Court, we submit that the decisions of this Court go to the proposition of the assignment of children and not to the proposition of what parents may request in the school board on me.

    Mr. K. Harlan Dodson, Jr. 
    As the second and the theoretical reason, and this is the theoretical reason that was originally included was because we felt that no parent should be required to wait, to see whether there was an emotional or psychological impact which was affecting adversely the educational advancement of the child before being permitted to remove it from one school to another school, we felt that it was the sort of thing that we should permit in advance as a preventative if the parent was concerned about it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3049.807" stopTime="3059.810">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the parent -- the parent had asked that the way it actually operates was nobody had to transfer. 
    They just came in and got different assignments, isn't it?
speaker="k_harlan_dodson_jr" startTime="3059.810" stopTime="3176.337">
    Mr. K. Harlan Dodson, Jr. 
    Now, if the Court please, now here, I wanted to comment on that, here's exactly what happened about that. 
    The notice was sent out and I'm looking at page 249 and 250 of the record. 
    The notice was actually set out to every county by their child where they were in a situation that the new zoning required them to transfer, required them be assigned on another school. 
    And it starts off in the notice, in the transfer request and it says school zone in which you lived, in other words this is where you are now zoned, in accordance with the notice which is on 249. 
    This is the one in which you are now zoned. 
    Here is the school which you are now attending. 
    Now unless that child brought this notice back saying, I do not want to be moved over and then moved back, I do not want to be moved over then you would stay in that location. 
    Now the practical, the administrative reason for that that is that you didn't actually physically take the child from the school that he was now attending, to the school to which it was assigned and then let the child transfer back into school to which he was assigned, to the school that he had formally been attending if that's the school he wanted to go to, was that you would have the paperwork of: number one, the child turning in the books; Number two, the child's transfer papers with the State going over to the assigned school then the transfer papers again being made out about what the state rules and all of these appears in the record to bring that child back to the other school and books reassigned. 
    It just created administrative problems there that accomplished the same result.

    Mr. K. Harlan Dodson, Jr. 
    None, not until now. 
    May it please the Court, we have felt that the -- the reasoning that was adopted by Mr. Justice McAllister in the Kelley case was clear reasoning and cautious reasoning. 
    Now, I must confess that I think most members of the bar would admit that when they agree with reasoning they then think it's very clear and very cautious. 
    But we do submit that the grounds upon which he based the decision of the Sixth Circuit as respects this plan which was adopted, which was our guidepost that we have followed, that they are basic reasons and they are sound reasons. 
    First, that this Court had not decided and has not yet decided that the states must deprive persons of the right to choose what schools they attend but rather all they have decided is that a state may not deny to a person on account of race, the right to attend any school it maintains. 
    And that two, if those schools which it maintains are open to the children of all races, with the zone limitation of course which is a practical limitation that was recognized in the Brown cases, that if the schools which it maintains are open to the children of all races then there's no violation of the Constitution. 
    Although the children of different races may in fact attend different schools. 
    And finally, that there was no evidence there in the Sixth Circuit as there is no evidence in this record in either the Maxwell or Goss cases that the transfer plan is any evasive scheme concocted in order to bring about or continue segregation. 
    If the child was free to attend an integrated school which by integrated, I mean integrated in fact and if the parents voluntarily chose to move that child from that school to another school, that then the child was not being deprived of its constitutional rights or to put it in another way. 
    And I'm now leaving the reasoning of Mr. Justice McAllister. 
    If this plan excluding the transfer provision, excluding number six, if this plan is signed then we submit that number six takes nothing from it because it is the individual acting either as an individual or through its parents, and not the State which makes the election. 
    And insofar as the State or the school board here is concerned, no child is prevented from attending a particular school because of his or her race.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3403.769" stopTime="3429.779">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, if a child is of a race either white or Negro, which happens to be in the majority in a particular school and if he affirmatively desires to attend an integrated school, and if all the minority under this plan number six, transfer out then he's frustrated in that desire, isn't that true?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He -- he cannot -- if he and his parents want him to have the experience, affirmatively want him to have the experience of attending a school where there are children of both races, if he happens to be in a majority in that school then he's not allowed to transfer under this?
speaker="k_harlan_dodson_jr" startTime="3449.705" stopTime="3471.854">
    Mr. K. Harlan Dodson, Jr. 
    But he's prevented because he is moving out of a zone which was determined without regard to race and he is not granted a transfer request. 
    But no school is denied to him because of his race, because he was put here, he was placed in this school because of the zone.

   Argument of S. Frank Fowler
speaker="s_frank_fowler" startTime="4043.096" stopTime="4184.825">
    Mr. S. Frank Fowler 
    May it please the Court. 
    I'm not sure that the latter statute was correct, Mr. Justice Black. 
    The Knoxville plan has been interpreted by those who administered in Knoxville as according to members of the Negro majority. 
    Free transfers wherever they want to go or call. 
    I do not know whether Knoxville has indulged that liberality of treatment or not. 
    If that is clearly established by the Knoxville record on page 94, where Mr. -- Doctor Burkhart has testified and also by the man who was actually in-charge of transfers, Mr. (Inaudible) at pages 117 and 118. 
    That does not go to the question which Mr. Justice Goldberg asked. 
    Namely, whether a member of the Negro majority could transfer in order to get into a desegregated school to which Dr. Burkhart replied that he didn't think so that it had not been the administrative practice. 
    One must recall that these items of testimony appearing in this record were taken in 1960, which was early in the testing of the ability of the Knoxville system to receive this disregard of the color line which it is now become accustomed to. 
    I think that in the light of Mr. (Inaudible) testimony that it can be safely said that if no particular disturbance in the school to which such a Negro would be transferred is to be anticipated by reason of that, there is no reason why his request should not be granted, particularly if there is any metal -- mental stress or unhappiness on the part of the child's parents as being denied, desegregation in the school of his own.

    Mr. S. Frank Fowler 
    Your Honor, if there has been one quietly conductive process of desegregation it has been Knoxville. 
    And we are rather proud of the fact that we have achieved very considerable progress without publicity. 
    I will say this that wherever that there was any necessity of communicating particular notices to the public, the newspaper has been freely used and I don't think there's ever been any announcement of that but there have been tests of all kinds, attempt to probe into the system to see whether this could be done and that could be done. 
    But I know -- don't know yet of any attempt along that line. 
    Perhaps we'll have one but as soon as we get home and I take that the test will be. 
    I mean on the question that the Court do not suggest that's actual. 
    But I think the actual be as I've indicated that if there -- upon a balancing of the desire or the need of these students for that transfer, I guess it had may affect the school to which he's transferred. 
    The decision of the Board will be made. 
    It maybe already a desegregated school and no question at all. 
    The transfer grounds are granted and have been for years and years and years as a matter of convenience for reasons which perhaps comparatively trivial. 
    Employment of a parent closed by and I see no reason if there's room in the transferee school, and if there are going to be no disturbance there why the request should not be granted.

    About 42 or 300 somewhere in that. 
    Well, that sounds insignificantly, may it please the Court, but when you consider the residential concentration, this means that one-third of those who could stay, that is those in the minority groups, the Negroes in predominant white schools. 
    Those are the only ones who are desegregated at present, could have been only three times greater than that. 
    That is to say the Negro minorities in white schools, predominant white schools are managed about 250 students, a third haven't stayed there, two-thirds rejected the opportunity or as it maybe put, waived their constitutional right to desegregation.

    What possible service can Rule 6 know?
speaker="s_frank_fowler" startTime="4569.487" stopTime="4647.692">
    Mr. S. Frank Fowler 
    The possible service is this, and this is something that's a bond petitioner has been or even among counsel. 
    Rule 6 entitled school board to transfer on the fairer ground of race, regardless of the lack of unhappiness, prejudice, or disadvantage. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals said that the plan is valid, but may not be used to perpetuate desegregation. 
    Upon analysis, that might mean that you cannot grant transfers from the fairer ground of race. 
    Now, Knoxville with considerable additional administrative expense can accommodate itself. 
    I don't think Memphis can or Nashville or Chattanooga can accommodate itself to striking out that ground. 
    And we can proceed on good cause which compels us to investigate each case individually. 
    I think which seems to be wholly impracticable elsewhere.

    And decided --
speaker="s_frank_fowler" startTime="4663.364" stopTime="4959.628">
    Mr. S. Frank Fowler 
    We find it of -- we find it of value as an administrative matter. 
    We would have to put on additional personnel. 
    It would complicate the handling of this problem. 
    And in that connection, I would like to proceed to a point that is relevant here. 
    And that is what was said in argument yesterday about the position of the Knoxville School Board, our position being represented as that even if this transfer ground is struck out of the plan and we're going to do it anyhow. 
    Now, the brief filed on behalf of the school board in the City of Knoxville asserted that if the grounds are knocked out of this plan, that nevertheless Knoxville did not feel that it should blind itself to the educational disadvantages of any pupil in the public school. 
    And if it should find cases of pupils who are under pressure, under persecution or under handicapped by a reason even if it stems from racial origins or racial facts. 
    The school board felt that it would be its duty to transfer that child upon appropriate application when it appeared to be in the interest of the child's education. 
    Now, this statement which comes from me that we intended to go ahead anyhow as if in violation of the Supreme Court's holding or treatment of this plan indicates how far their application to the story of this plan goes. 
    It goes to this point of compelling and coercing these minority pupils to stay in schools where they don't belong, where they're unhappy. 
    If they're Negroes where they may be subjected to the customary epithets and names and if they're white they may be called poor white trash and all that business, thereby, destroying that opportunity which is the duty of the school board to provide. 
    Now, we think that in the consideration of the constitutionality of this matter that the fact that you're building into or engrafting into the school system a core of improperly treated pupils against the wish of the parents and the welfare, the pupils themselves is to create something which may lead to the ultimate collapse of the whole thing. 
    But one thing, there are economic consequences which may follow as exodus of whites by selling their residences and that has occurred. 
    And it's a reasonable thing for a white person to do in our community and particularly in other communities of Tennessee. 
    The white people can transfer their children to private schools, so that one becomes aware of the fact that there are consequences going beyond the mere distribution of the case of a particular pupil. 
    And on top of that, the impact of this business is not going to be on the white minorities, because by reason of a little bit better affluence, they can avoid it. 
    The impact is going to be upon the Negro minorities, who can't move at and can't send their children to private schools. 
    So they will be the ones whose -- who are in effect confined to places that they would rather be at out. 
    So, on that score we feel that such consideration is irrelevant on the part -- on the point of consideration of constitutionality which to my mind being almost completely uninformed on the gradations and the new answers of these questions that have been put and pays back and forth largely consists not in determining whether this is a matter of state action entirely. 
    But whether do you get down to the wis -- the point of is it a wise action? 
    Is it wise to leave an educational system with a sickness? 
    Is it wise to do these things which may appear to carry harm in the directions in which it's not intended?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4959.628" stopTime="5020.613">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well Mr. Fowler, excuse me please. 
    Assume for the moment the only thing wrong with Rule 6, the thing that it is wrong or that would be the only thing wrong except for this wrong? 
    But just assuming the only thing that's wrong is that the person who wants to go to an integrated school that isn't permitted to do so if unless he -- when he is in his own zone and he's in the majority. 
    Now, I take it that you say now that it would be a good enough reason to transfer if some Negro or a white was in the majority and in his own wants to transfer out solely for the reason to go to an integrated school. 
    I take it that you would now apply a Rule 5 to permit that transfer, if there were room and if there was not going to be a disturbance.

    He lived way over similar else in town. 
    Now, I wouldn't be surprised of what a disturbance there. 
    It might consist of physical abuse, fights, his presence in the school room would tend to disrupt things because he might be -- a paper was thrown at him or being stuck in him or something like that and then the same thing might've well occur a white child who seeks out from his permitted attendance to the Negro school.

    Now, that can be grievously disturbed by two eager, a breaking down of these things and that's an aspect of this plan as a transition matter as an expedient during the period of transition and it is a transition matter because it's set forth in a transition plan maybe -- namely the desegregation plan itself, the step plan of 12 grades. 
    This plan operates as does the step plan to limit the volume of the desegregation each year of the 250 Negro minority pupils who could now be in a desegregated system only about 84 of that. 
    The same restricting influence on a number of pupils who disintegrate or desegregate is applied by the step plan itself.

    That's right, Your Honor. 
    But let me add this comment upon that statement there, and I have to say that I didn't stop thinking when I completed the brief is this. 
    That this is being tried completely and virtually completely without a reference and one reason it is being less tried one reason why he left out of this record here is a considerable portion of the testimony which sustain the adoption of the step of the one grade a year plan. 
    That is we sustain a reasonableness of slowing down the process of desegregation is that the petition for writ of certiorari in this case raise only the point of constitutionality. 
    There was no denial of proof of the existence of adequate proof to sustain a reasonable slowing down of the transition to desegregation as had been suggested by the Supreme Court as wise measures in the places where it was violated tradition and so on. 
    And consequently, the Knoxville Board did act as a transition matter in adopting this whole plan which is composed of various consistently fitting together pieces including the step bar -- the grade by year plan coupled with the transfer plan all of them operating these limitations, adopted after deliberation as reasonable procedures to assure the undisturbed and efficient and effective success of the compliance to the Supreme Court's order. 
    So we've ended up here without our own record, the Nashville situation ends up without the record that's really pertinent in this case because there's not one syllable here from the record in the Nashville case, the Kelley case, this is all Davidson County case and this apparently population figured, they're completely different.

    Mr. S. Frank Fowler 
    Well, I say this Your Honor that I think the considered conclusion should be that the termination of this plan in Knoxville should await a full detail study and decision by the school board, and a full trial at the local level in the local schools. 
    Now frankly, I've been accused of being too candid here in formulating the answer that was put in and also in writing this little brief. 
    But when this petition came up and the question was represented, I advice the client at home it would be far wiser for you to make this case moot and add to your payroll and encounter some administrative burdens and so on to then subject yourself to the peril of the Supreme Court specifying local rules of operation. 
    Though the Supreme Court is somewhat remote from our home and we think that maybe within from local experience might be helpful in determinations of what this -- what should be done there. 
    And as a -- rather as a legal matter in response to that suggestion on my part instead of as a conclusion of their own, coming as to a factual in investigation of the facts if this brief was formulated in -- at the outset, as a matter of fact, it might be true. 
    I wasn't thinking about the constitutional validity of this plan at that State to begin, but it may well be true that the racial ground alone without any particular prejudice but the naked ground of race is an adequate ground for transfer on the theory that it -- a good thing to have in the balancing of interest and the encouragement of individual thinking even if it amounts to individual discrimination. 
    This denial of the right to choose companions may create a handicap to the development of the Negro race itself.

    Mr. S. Frank Fowler 
    Your Honor that's pure speculation in the world. 
    Now, the question that we've talked about, what is the period of transition? 
    And for the first time I heard the phrase affirmative mixing or integrations, social acceptance and everything else. 
    When that comes about, certainly, we are through with the theory of transition. 
    It may be that the 12-year period or now a seven-year period of the completed of -- getting through all the grades in the Knoxville public school will complete the period of transition. 
    And in one sense it's an awful long time to await complete integration. 
    Your Honor, the answer is that you can get us in a plan like this and throw it away when you don't need it anymore, when you got to -- it's a sense of security that the people are going to be reconciled to each in the classroom. 
    That you're going to be a free interplay of whites and blacks without the difference and color making any particular difference. 
    And I think we're making great strides towards that. 
    We've shattered a color line that used to be a complete block. 
    And in other respects transportation and all activities in town, the Negroes are progressing, restaurants are open, the coliseum that's recently built is open to them, parks, playgrounds and so on. 
    And considerable progress is being made and we're trying to do the best we can to help but there is a far underlying that community has proven in the Clinton case which burned out federal district judge down there and he's on ease as exhibited in his opinion.

   Argument of Jack Petree

    Mr. Jack Petree 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First, I would like to state to the Court my gratitude for the privilege of participating in this argument. 
    I'm also grateful to my brothers on my right who have yielded to me a few minutes of their precious time. 
    If the Court please, I would say that there are as many differences in the day-to-day operation of school systems as there are school systems. 
    A great deal of time and discussion has been devoted yesterday afternoon and this morning to that Negro majority who is denied the right granted to the Negro minority to transfer. 
    This case is important to Memphis because in our school system, approximately 50% of some 47 different units of our school's grades one through nine or what we termed open schools and a person can transfer to an open school regardless of reason. 
    There is no need for reason. 
    Now, it is true that operating under our plan that transfer will be granted to a Negro student only if he is in one of the grades covered by the plan. 
    I should hasten to point out, however, that under the Memphis plan, which is an appendix in the brief, the Board will grant a transfer and intends to grant transfers in the future where there is a reasonable educational need to a Negro child even though that child's grade is not covered by the plan.

    Now, of those open schools, they are the schools which have been desegregated because those are the schools that Negro children made application, they were predominantly -- they opened schools or either -- maybe either white or Negro, they are about evenly divided between white and Negro schools. 
    But it was these open schools that were desegregated when we were trying to operate under our pupil assignment Law. 
    We have only filed, this Court denied certiorari in our pupil assignment case in June 28, 1962. 
    We attempted to file this plan to have it in operation by September of 1962, however, we only got it prepared and filed in August of 31st, so we have not operated really successfully under a plan of desegregation. 
    We have desegregated by permitting Negro students who wanted to attend a desegregated school to apply and receive transfers to the so-called open schools.

    Mr. Jack Petree 
    First grade, sir. 
    Yes, sir. 
    If the Court please, I would like to take the time that remains to me to try to put this case on a little different perspective from that which we have been devoting most of the discussion. 
    Mr. Fowler touched on it very briefly. 
    The state action has created a problem. 
    It has assigned a child, who is in the minority to a given school. 
    Now, there's no question that the problem exist with respect to that minority child. 
    The petitioners acknowledged the existence of the problem in some instances. 
    In some instances there is no problem but we are only concerned with those problem cases. 
    The Solicitor General recognizes that a problem exists and they offer a certain solutions for the problem. 
    I there -- I suggest that the solutions which they offer do not meet the problem. 
    They would have you believe that this is a plan which is solely designed to retard the desegregation of the school system. 
    That it will retard it by permitting the white minority child to escape from the Negro school. 
    I respectfully suggest, if the Court please, that the direct converse is true. 
    Let us assume the situation where we have no provision such as this. 
    And let us assume that a white parent is assigned or a white student is assigned as a minority in a predominantly Negro school. 
    The parent goes to the school board and asked for a transfer, and now he is not sophisticated enough to give us the magic word, he says, “I want to transfer because of race.” 
    We say, “No, you've given us that reason, we can't grant the transfer.” 
    It then becomes a race between the truant officer and the real estate agent. 
    I suggest to the Court that the most casual glimpse of most urban communities reflects that those white parents, who are economically affluent, will simply move to the suburban areas. 
    So the Board of Education has no real problem with a white parent, with a white minority. 
    They simply flee to suburbia and there we are. 
    The Board is not going to be bothered with this white minority child. 
    Where the difficulty is going to come is in this less economically affluent group. 
    In most instances, the Negro child, who is caught in an educational environment that his parents recognize was -- is not best suited for him. 
    So this parent comes to the school board and says, “I want to transfer,” and that parent is not sophisticated either. 
    It doesn't know the magic words, it says race. 
    And we are caught, we can't do it. 
    I suggest to the Court that it's this group; it's the economic unaffluent group who are going to be punished by the absence of this provision. 
    It's this group that perhaps the people on this side of the table should represent more than I. 
    But it's this group who are going to be hurt by a provision or the absence of such a provision. 
    I suggest to the Court that these minorities, the Negro or the poor white minority are going to be made to swallow their constitutional right. 
    That's -- it's going to be pushed down their throat by state action. 
    State action first created this problem -- excuse me, if the Court please, it seems my time is up. 
    I'm grateful --

    It's these children, the less economically affluent which will be compelled to accept their constitutional rights.

    Mr. Jack Petree 
    No, sir. 
    There is nothing whatsoever wrong with an integrated school. 
    Let me say this, if the Court please. 
    There are children who may be emotionally involved as a result of being in the minority. 
    There may be children who will have an educational problem by being cast as a minority. 
    Now, shall we create this problem? 
    Shall we have this emotional attack? 
    And then after the harm has been done then grant the transfer? 
    Shall we create the educational problem? 
    Now, education in a parent-child relationship is an intimate one. 
    I think a Negro parent has the same ability to say before this harm comes that I don't want my child there yet. 
    That a Board of Education has to say after the harm comes, you may avoid the situation. 
    I think that you are trying to balance two substantial constitutional problems. 
    Is this state action? 
    Is this state action that discriminates against one because of race or is this state action which is in aid of minority races? 
    I suggest that even if it be the -- if it's discrimination which is unconstitutional, this Court should balance that discrimination against, against the freedom of a parent. 
    And these parents that I've talked about to choose in the first place, the school which they want their child to go to. 
    Much of this choice is not going to be based on discriminatory reasons. 
    It's going to be based on pure educational reasons that that parent feels. 
    Thank you, if the Court please.

   Argument of Jack Greenberg
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6980.090" stopTime="7015.231">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    May it please the Court. 
    In these few minutes, I would like to address myself to a question by Mr. Justice Stewart concerning our view of the scope of the Brown decision. 
    In our view, the Brown decision means that there shall be no racial distinctions whatsoever in a school system. 
    The right of the child is the right to attend a system without race in assignment, transfer, employment of personnel and so forth, a system free of race. 
    Now, this is an issue --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="7015.231" stopTime="7038.375">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What if this is based on the voluntary wishes of the students. 
    Let's say at the lunch room at lunch time that there might be some level of students of the -- who are Negroes there, who don't want to eat lunch with the white students who -- is the school compelled by the Constitution to make them, to make them intermixed?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="7038.375" stopTime="7133.560">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    No, no, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    The -- the school is -- the school system is merely compelled not to impose any racial distinction. 
    Now, if in the unique case of Baltimore for example, which other systems for obvious reasons find difficult to adopt, where people go to school completely as a matter of their own choice, that's one thing but everywhere else where there are standards for attending school and assigning the teachers and so forth, this must be done without regard to race. 
    Now, this has been a subject of a great deal of litigation in the Courts of Appeals in pupil assignment cases. 
    Pupil assignment cases arise out of children being assigned to school on the basis of race and then given an opportunity to transfer presumably without regard to race. 
    After a great deal of litigation, the Courts of Appeals are all in unanimous agreement, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits, appear to agree that the right of the child is the right to attend a system without regard to race and therefore as in the Holland Case in Florida in the Fifth Circuit, a Negro child who lives close to a Negro school which if it were to be desegregated, the system were to be desegregated would still be a school entirely composed of Negro students. 
    And would be the school he would attend because it's near him, has a right to bring a suit to desegregate the system because his right is not to attend a particular structure or to be in company with any particular students but to go to school in a system that has no racial considerations or distinctions attached to any of the various phases of its operation. 
    And I could cite the cases in our -- in our brief but --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="7133.560" stopTime="7144.211">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But your board isn't or is it in your view constitutionally compelled to gerrymander its -- its -- its school system in order to assure integrated school?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="7144.211" stopTime="7337.888">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    No, that is not what we're urging and that is not our view. 
    Our view is that in no racial distinctions in the system and as I say it has come up in pupil assignment cases which you are sort of the adverse of this, but all of the Circuits in the cases of the Wheeler and Jeffer's case in the Fourth Circuit, most recently an unreported case in the Fifth, Potts versus Flax. 
    In the Sixth Circuit, the North Worth's case and in the Eighth Circuit the Little Rock in Delaware School cases, all unanimously agree with this view. 
    And consequently a transfer system which had a racial standard as a part of it is a violation of that teaching of Brown. 
    Now, there was -- I perhaps didn't make myself clear yesterday, though I think our view on the right of the individual child who may be disturbed but whose education may be affected by attending a particular school. 
    The question that Mr. Justice Brennan among others ask, I believe, our view on that is clearly expressed in our reply brief, where we discussed that situation. 
    And our view on that is that no child should be permitted to transfer because of a racial desire, because of a desire not to go to school with members of another race. 
    The school board cannot recognize that under a matter of practice or under explicit terms of the plan. 
    And -- but however, if a child had clinical problems or educational problems because of such a situation we would be punitive about it and insist that that particular disturbed child must stay in that situation, whether it's good for him or not, that of course is not this case. 
    We don't face that problem here at this time but in recognizing that such exceptional circumstances might be proper grounds for a transfer, we respectfully submit that such a rule if it were to be discussed in opinion, should not open the door to evasion with such a rule possibly might do. 
    Because as -- as the Knoxville -- Knoxville brief has indicated and his argument here today has indicated, it is quite easy as a matter of course to merely assume that this situation exists. 
    And to freely allow transfers on what purports to be an individual clinical evaluation than what is merely a racial standard. 
    And we would submit that all other reasonable avenues of exhausting the situation of solving the problem, first, should be exhausted. 
    And that the burden of proof in such a case should be a heavy one, but nevertheless, certainly in the last analysis no one would insist that a child be compelled to attend the school if it were to be quite clear detriment of his education.
