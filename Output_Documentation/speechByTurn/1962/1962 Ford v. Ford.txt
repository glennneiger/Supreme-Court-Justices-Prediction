    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, Mr. Marion, you may proceed with your case.
speaker="w_francis_marion" startTime="116.037" stopTime="176.745">
    Mr. W. Francis Marion 
    May it please the Court. 
    This matter comes before the Court upon a writ of certiorari from the South Carolina Supreme Court. 
    The question involved is whether in an order of dismissal in a Virginia Court on a custody matter, full faith and credit should have been given. 
    Our State Supreme Court gave full faith and credit to an order of dismissal that recited in effect that upon representation of counsel the farthest have reached an agreement and that the case is therefore dismissed. 
    So briefly and factually, the petitioner and Herman Ford or husband and wife got into marital difficulties in 1959. 
    They resided in Sanford, North Carolina at the time. 
    Both of their homes were in Richmond, Virginia. 
    They went to Richmond, Virginia for purposes of seeing a marriage counsel or psychiatrist.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="176.745" stopTime="180.168">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is Richmond the marriage domicile?
speaker="w_francis_marion" startTime="180.168" stopTime="557.954">
    Mr. W. Francis Marion 
    No sir. 
    Actually, North Carolina was -- I believe they were originally married perhaps in Virginia, Your Honor, in 1952 but they had moved to Sanford, North Carolina after living in various places around the world actually. 
    But when they came to Richmond, Virginia for the purposes of seeing the marriage counselor, the respondent, Ford, announced that his wife that he was not going to take her back. 
    He left three small children at that time, age three, five and seven in Sanford, North Carolina. 
    As a result of it, she went back by herself to North Carolina and tried to locate the children and did locate the children and they go to court in the companionship of a German nurse who lived there. 
    She brought them back to Richmond, Virginia to the home of her mother in Richmond, Virginia and Ford thereupon instituted a habeas corpus proceeding in the City and County Civil Court of Richmond. 
    An exchange between counsel followed -- Richmond counsel followed, and as a result of exchange of correspondence, a -- this order of dismissal that was not displayed to the Court, there was no hearing upon the order whatsoever. 
    Just merely that counsel had said to the Court that an agreement had been reached; therefore, the matter is dismissed. 
    It was thereupon dismissed. 
    Barbara Ford that was in August of 1959, she subsequently came to Greenville, South Carolina, went to business school, obtained a job in Greenville and in January of 1960, her youngest child was brought to live with her. 
    The two older children in the meantime were living in Sanford, North Carolina with the father and the mother-in-law, her mother-in-law. 
    That continued until the summer of 1960 at which time, Mrs. Ford, the petitioner, brought in action in the Juvenile Court, Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court in Greenville, South Carolina to obtain custody of the children. 
    Herman Ford, the respondent was served when he came to Greenville to get the children. 
    He was served at that point and a hearing was held in Greenville. 
    Now, this was the first time there was a hearing on the merits of this case. 
    At the time, 11 witnesses testified including the minister, the -- all the parties involved, and as a result of that, an order was issued by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court which incidentally has exclusive jurisdiction in this malice under our procedure. 
    An order was issued to determine that custody should lie with the mother with reasonable visitation to the father during the holiday period and that is if they could work that part out, but the three smaller children should live with the mother. 
    In that -- in the proceeding, the respondent setup before the Domestic Relation judge in his pleadings that this order in Virginia, this order of dismissal was res judicata and that full faith and credit should be given. 
    The Juvenile and Domestic Relations judge in his order went into broader detail as to why he did not feel that full faith -- why it was not res judicata, that it wasn't the hearing on the merits, that it was -- no testimony was taken, and that the best interest of the children were not being served. 
    He based his order from the best interest of the three minor children, three, five and seven. 
    Though it subsequently appealed to the State Circuit Court which is the intermediate appeal court from this which affirmed the order of the Juvenile Court in every particular -- all of them saying that setting up a specified time the Domestic Relations Court had said that they shall agree as to a time when he could visit. 
    He setup certain specified time during the summer and Christmas holidays but otherwise affirmed it and again went into detail. 
    And his order -- the circuit judge, in his order, why this case in Virginia should not be res judicata to the action in South Carolina because the children's interest were not being served in Virginia action, it has never been demonstrated to the Virginia Court what the children -- the rights of the children. 
    They were simply -- as the circuit judge said were raised. 
    Not even before the court in Virginia on a habeas corpus proceeding was not before the Court. 
    The judge never saw him, never took in the testimony of the best interest. 
    And that, in his opinion, the South Carolina order was correct in giving custody to the -- primary custody to the mother, was secondary, in effect, custody to the father because the father would have them in the summertime. 
    That was subsequently appealed to our State Supreme Court which held that the order in Virginia should be given full faith and credit that it was a -- it was a proceeding, a judicial proceeding within the meaning of Article IV, Section 1 of the United States Constitution and Section 20, Title 28 that defines -- that full faith and credit should be given and that the orders of the Circuit and the Domestic Relations Court were reversed. 
    We filed a writ of certiorari and it was granted upon that basis that full faith and credit should not be given. 
    Basically, we have three -- setup three reasons where why any of which, we submit --

    And in that North Carolina action, the lower court, the court having jurisdiction awarded custody to the father with secondary custody to the mother, and why doesn't that moot the case now?
speaker="w_francis_marion" startTime="592.754" stopTime="648.075">
    Mr. W. Francis Marion 
    Your Honor, I think that it does not moot the case. 
    I think that the United -- the North Carolina Court was without jurisdiction at that time to do so and we specifically objected to the jurisdiction of the North Carolina Court. 
    Now after there was a divorce action brought by Herman Ford, after the rendition of the order of the Juvenile Court in South Carolina, in other words, that he was there in personam in South Carolina, fought the case -- litigated the case and lost it. 
    He then, under the North Carolina statute, brought a divorce action which he had a right to do because they were at the time domiciled in North Carolina on the grounds of adultery. 
    That was a suit was filed denying that. 
    There was a denial, a general denial put in only.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="648.075" stopTime="655.162">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    But wasn't there a jurisdiction in North Carolina to adjudicate the divorce? 
    And didn't your client appear in that case?
speaker="w_francis_marion" startTime="655.162" stopTime="778.955">
    Mr. W. Francis Marion 
    They appeared -- yes sir. 
    Your Honor, she appeared on the -- well, if I may, on their adultery trial, that was never brought up. 
    Certainly, they have a section in North Carolina that has the two-year separation which after the end of two years, that was -- she did not contest to that. 
    In other words, filed an appearance through counsel not contested the divorce, all of which were subsequent to this action. 
    The counsel for respondent in their brief commented this was forced by the defendant or the respondent -- the petitioner in this case. 
    He forced that action into trial, the only action that was forced to trial was it was apparent on that action -- divorce action in North Carolina. 
    And that action was pushed to trial at the end of two years to get it off the docket one way or the other. 
    We did not consent to any custody matters. 
    They were subsequently a week after the divorce matter was heard. 
    They were heard -- set and heard a custody matter of which the counsel in North Carolina, Mrs. McDermott appeared solely for the purpose -- especially for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of that court to hear the custody matter at all because the custody matter had been decided by the South Carolina Supreme Court, and at that time, was under an order of this Court issued by Justice Frankfurter, stating all matters from South Carolina Supreme Court and in effect reinstating the order of the Circuit Court awarding custody to mother. 
    Judge Frankfurter did that when the certiorari was pending up here. 
    We objected to the jurisdiction. 
    The state judge in North Carolina disregarded that and issued an order not on any change of circumstances but simply that the Virginia order was found.

    And then an order, may it please the Court, an order revoking in effect there by the Supreme -- the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina which actually reinstates the order of the South Carolina Court, of the lower court in South Carolina and ordered the children back to South Carolina. 
    In other words, as soon as that all -- we appeared specially, we objected to it in the lower court then when the lower court issued its order, we thought that the proper procedure was to go to the North Carolina Supreme Court and if they refuse it, then we come to this Court. 
    But they didn't refuse it, they grant it, and reinstated the order. 
    So, we submit that that is moot as far as that case is down there concerned because it's awaiting the decision of this Court as to what court does have jurisdiction of the matter.

    I see.
speaker="w_francis_marion" startTime="1008.811" stopTime="1198.061">
    Mr. W. Francis Marion 
    Now basically, our position is that -- well, there are three positions. 
    Either that the Court is in the position, the South Carolina Court is in the position of parens patriae which is our third question. 
    And that there's only committee in divorce actions, no full faith and credit in divorce actions, that is in line with Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion in May against Anderson, all in the alternative, we -- that the South Carolina Court didn't have to give -- they can give full faith and credit only to the extent that the Court in Virginia has to recognize the order in Virginia. 
    In other words, if the Court can amend in Virginia, if Virginia Court can amend its order, then the South Carolina Court can amend its order. 
    That is the Virginia order to award custody under Halvey against Halvey. 
    The third ground and I think in this instance is the most important ground and I'll put them in the inverse is that the Virginia order was not a judicial proceeding within the meaning of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, because there was no hearing, no testimony, it was simply an order of dismissal, voluntary dismissal, we submit. 
    And that as a result of that, the South Carolina Court would not have to give full faith and credit because in Virginia, the Virginia Court itself would not find that the original action was res judicata. 
    Now, all of these that the law relating to this custody matter in full faith and credit is, frankly, somewhat up in the air under the decision of May against Anderson and the Kovacs against Brewer and State against Halvey. 
    We submit though, that basically, the order in Virginia was an order of dismissal whether it was a 'dismissed agreed' as counsel for respondent claim and a 'dismissed agreed' by way of regression of the minute under Virginia law is what I would call a non-suit with prejudice, that you are non-suiting yourself with prejudice. 
    We submit that whether it was a simple order of dismissal or ‘dismissed agreed' order that the Virginia Court would have the right to review that order for the best interest of the children. 
    What was the best interest? 
    There was no hearing held on that in Virginia. 
    Therefore, that matter had never come before the Virginia Court. 
    It came before the Court for the first time in South Carolina. 
    That is, what is the best interest of the children?

    Mr. W. Francis Marion 
    Yes, sir. 
    We are asking you to do that. 
    The Virginia law has clearly, we submit, a 'dismissed agreed' section. 
    There are four cases that we found in this in the Virginia courts that had a ‘dismissed agreed' order which is an order with prejudice, all involving contractual relationships, none of which involved domestic relationships. 
    That is custody matters at all. 
    There are a number of cases and we have cited them in our brief, particularly at page 12 of our brief, the Martin against Martin and (Inaudible) several cases relating to custody matters where the Court reviewed its own order and opened up an order for trial for prior adjudication of the matter even if it was in adjudication. 
    Now, basically, I'll go back to the point and I can't stress it too much in my own mind that this original habeas corpus action was -- there was no hearing on the merits, no -- nobody appear. 
    So there's some question of whether that was actually adjudication of the matter, but assuming, for the sake of argument that it was an adjudication, then under Virginia law, we submit, under the Semmes case, the Semmes and a wrap of cases, the Court could review its own order and a man in any way it's all fair under change of condition or change of circumstances.

    Well, I got the question in my mind. 
    If you look at page 68 of the respondent's brief, the Court does refer to the Virginia order in terms such as you have fairly described it I think. 
    But then it goes on and says, after saying so, it then says which terms of the agreement meet with the approval of this Court and this Court finds that such custodial arrangement is in the best interest of said infant children. 
    Isn't that a finding on the merits there?

    Mr. W. Francis Marion

    Mr. W. Francis Marion 
    Well, Your Honor, we submit not and we submit that North Carolina Supreme Court will agree on us in that respect because we appeared especially to object to the jurisdiction and to -- did not put -- there was no testimony taken. 
    Now, I think there were two grounds whether this wouldn't affect us. 
    One is that the -- their finding is such that there had been no change which we submit can ease the record.It shows that there have been plenty of changes. 
    And secondly, there was no testimony taken upon this from the respondent whatsoever. 
    The only testimony was relating really to this order in Virginia and the testimony of one counsel and there is not as pertaining to that but there was no testimony from the petitioner -- I said respondents, excuse me, the petitioner in this case, but no testimony up at the time because this Court had issued its order restraining in effect and reinstating the South Carolina order and we didn't think it was proper at that time. 
    We thought we would waive our rights, so to speak, if we took that into consideration. 
    But I do feel very strongly that in the broad question, that we don't have to get to it if the Court doesn't want to pass upon the broad question at this time which they did not in the Kovacs case or in May against Anderson or in the Halvey case. 
    The broad question has not been passed upon by the Court and it does not have to be passed upon by the Court in this case if, number one, our first question that the order in Virginia really was not a judicial proceeding then we have to go no further than that. 
    Number two, if it was a judicial proceeding that the Virginia Court could amend its own order, therefore, the South Carolina Court err in not amending, allowing to be amended.

    Yet our Supreme Court ignored the facts of the case and put it on the question of law that it just was a judicial proceeding, but the law of both decided in our brief particularly in question two of our brief, we go into the law of Virginia on what is the final order and what is not a final order. 
    And we submit that the order that simply said without taking any testimony that it wouldn't define the law, couldn't be.

   Argument of Wesley M. Walker
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2159.397" stopTime="2161.132">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Walker.
speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="2161.132" stopTime="2357.999">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and members of the Court. 
    There is and has been much disagreement throughout the proceedings as to facts. 
    I submit that there is an extensive recitation of the facts in the opinion of the South Carolina Supreme Court and I will not belabor that particular point. 
    The facts in the record, there had been substantial or extensive statements made by petitioner in her brief, also by respondent in his brief. 
    I say that at the beginning, there was a custody proceeding in Virginia. 
    It was a habeas corpus proceeding that was instituted for the custody of these minor children and that is the proper proceedings in Virginia to obtain and to determine the custody of the children. 
    Following the custody proceeding in Virginia and the order ‘dismissed agreed', under which agreement and order, the children or the primary custody of the children was given to the respondent. 
    It was some time following that that the petitioner moved to Greenville, South Carolina, and at that point, because of the question of Mr. Justice Black with respect to the length of time, these children had been in Greenville, I wish to state what the record will show and what is the fact. 
    It was sometime in late February of 1960 when the respondent here, the father, agreed for the three-year-old child to stay for a period of time with the mother in Greenville, South Carolina. 
    However, that child, the youngest child, returned to the custody of the father as provided under the order ‘dismissed agreed' and the agreement in Virginia to the father at the end of May, and the three children did not come to Greenville, South Carolina to see their mother. 
    Under the terms of this agreement which the father, respondent, scrupulously obeyed until the latter part of June, 1960, and it was within approximately six weeks following that that the mother instituted this action in Greenville for the custody of these children. 
    And as the record will show, it happened upon an occasion when the father had come to Greenville to see his children and to tell them of the death of his mother. 
    And at that time, he was served with process and this action was instituted in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Greenville County. 
    Following upon the order of that court, the matter was appealed to the Court of Common Pleas.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2357.999" stopTime="2360.509">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What did that Court hold?
speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="2360.509" stopTime="2669.598">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court gave custody to the mother. 
    There was an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas. 
    I disagree with my able friend that the jurisdiction of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court is exclusive. 
    The Court of Common Pleas is a Court of general jurisdiction in South Carolina. 
    Its powers are vested by the Constitution and that power cannot be and has not been cut down or diminished by the legislature. 
    The Court of Common Pleas then gave according to the words of its decree joint custody and expressly put custody in both towns. 
    However, the Court of Common Pleas did not recognize or accept the defense that the respondent had then opposed as to the Virginia decree being a valid decree and being res judicata to the issues that were in the South Carolina Court. 
    Following upon that decree of the Court of Common Pleas, there was the appeal to the Supreme Court of South Carolina and that Court issued its opinion and following upon that we are here pursuant to the petitioners and this Court's order of certiorari to the South Carolina Supreme Court. 
    At that point, if I may, I wished to make certain of the correctness of what transpired in North Carolina and particularly Queen. 
    The action in North Carolina which was undisputedly the marital domicile of the parties and of these children, the action in North Carolina was instituted by the respondent here in December of 1959. 
    That was an action in the Superior Court of Lee County, North Carolina for divorce and custody of the children. 
    That action was instituted at a time when the order of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court had just been issued but when the children were in North Carolina with their father, the respondent, pursuant to and under the terms of the agreed order of dismissal and the agreement in the Virginia Court. 
    Now, that action in North Carolina did not come on to trial until this past August of 1962. 
    The action, as I have stated, was instituted prior to the appeal to the Court of Common Pleas in South Carolina. 
    But there was only one action instituted in the Superior Court of North Carolina at the marital domicile and that action was for divorce and custody. 
    There has never been any separation of the actions and a separation of the counts if they might be termed that and that action, we submit, was brought to trial upon the motion of petitioner's counsel in North Carolina. 
    And that motion is printed at page 64 that is the order of the Court. 
    And the Superior Court of Lee County, North Carolina, the order of the Court pursuant to petitioner's motion is printed on page 64 of the appendix to respondent's briefs. 
    And I particularly call this Court's attention to that order because that order was issued. 
    First, I say, the motion was made by petitioner's North Carolina counsel in the Superior Court of North Carolina after the stay had been issued in this course by Mr. Justice Frankfurter stating the order -- the enforcement of the order of the South Carolina Supreme Court. 
    Petitioner's North Carolina counsel made this motion and as we'll be seeing, the Court says, this cause is coming on to be heard on motion of (Inaudible) Harrington, counsel for the defendant who is the petitioner here. 
    And it was said upon her motion peremptorily, it did proceed to trial in August and there the issues were met. 
    First, the divorce was granted by the jury. 
    Two days later in the same setting, the judge heard the custody issued. 
    He made his award the order being likewise printed in the appendix to this brief.

    And the case went on to trial. 
    And at the trial, there was a testimony given by the respondent. 
    The petitioner here, although she was in a jurisdiction of the Court, she failed to personally come in and testify and her counsel stated at the trial that there was no claim by them of any change of circumstances subsequent to the Virginia decree. 
    And to complete the answer, the issue that is the question of the validity of the ‘dismissed agreed' order of the Virginia Court was injected into the trial before the judge of Lee County of the Superior Court. 
    It was argued by us, that is the counsel for the plaintiff there, the respondent here that the North Carolina Court was required to give to the order of the Virginia Court the same faith and credit that it would receive in Virginia.

    I would go back to the original statement made by the judge of the -- made by the judge of the Juvenile Domestic Relations Court. 
    I would refer to page 33 of the transcript, and right at that point, I'm pointing to the respondents, respondent here is exceptions to the Court of Common Pleas. 
    And I refer there in those exceptions and quoted what the judge of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court said during the presentation of the plaintiff's case who is the petitioner here. 
    Toward the bottom, I believe, 40123 that during the presentation of defendant's case, there is the respondent here. 
    The judge stated on the record, “Mr. Walker, I understand you are gong to undertake to prove the fitness of the father of the children.” 
    They have not attacked yet. 
    I think that that --

    How does -- how would the -- how would the judge of the lower court in north -- in South Carolina know that there were no change of conditions because there was no -- no evidence of any kind in the Virginia Court. 
    There was no -- there were no findings of any kind by any court. 
    It was just dismissed by the party.

    Exactly.

    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    I think that there would be no way that he could know unless the parties -- the petitioner here offered proof of change of circumstances, unless he made some allegation of it and offered proof of the pleadings that make the issues in the case of course, and unless the petitioner offered some proof of a change of circumstances, then of course the judge could not know. 
    And here, the South Carolina Supreme Court found that there was neither allegation nor proof of a change of circumstance. 
    And that must be conclusive in a court of law -- in a court of record. 
    If they don't attempt to prove it, if they don't even allege it, then certainly, no trial court in a matter of this kind or any other matter would go beyond the pleadings and the proof of the case to determine whether or not there had been a change of circumstances. 
    No claim of it. 
    It was conclusive upon the Court.

    You will find that on page 206 and beginning with the first paragraph there, the first indentation at the top of the page on 206. 
    And we emphasize that entire paragraph to this Court because of the -- there the South Carolina Court was applying the South Carolina law. 
    And the South Carolina Court after applying the South Carolina law, citing its own authority and saying a judicial award of the custody of a child is never found. 
    And then saying, applying this rule to the instant case and after examining the pleadings and the entire record, we find neither allegation nor proof of any change of circumstances, authorizing a change of custody of the minor children of the parties of this action.

    Well, I notice in the -- on page 6 of the transcript at paragraph 4 of the amended complaint, I think if that's a complaint of a -- of the petitioner in this case, he says that this plaintiff was informed and believes that for the benefit of the minor children of the parties that she is the proper person to have the control of custody of said children, 5, that the plaintiff is informed and believed that the defendant has been miss -- the guilty of misconduct and there's an unfit person to have custody of the minor children of the parties.

    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    I think that is not an allegation of change of circumstance and that would be the very reason I would point to the statement that I did a few moments ago of the judge of the trial court, that is the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court who said to me in the trial they have not attacked the respondent's fitness. 
    Now, he wouldn't go --

    But apparently, wasn't that the end of the case, you say here -- or it says in the record on page 33 that the judge of the Court stated on the record during presentation of plaintiff's case, “Before going on to the next witness, both parties are good people, good family, good parents, I am going to exclude any further testimony as to their faithfulness as parents.

    If they had --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But they said -- my point is simply this. 
    What does he mean by saying, “I am going to exclude any further testimony as to their faithfulness as parents” when the -- when there was an allegation in the complaint that said that the plaintiff has informed and believes that the defendant has been guilty of misconduct and he's an unfit person to have custody of the minor children.
speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="3340.385" stopTime="3346.292">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    The answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that though they alleged it, they did not account to prove it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3346.292" stopTime="3349.862">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How can they prove it if he won't let them prove it by presenting witnesses?

    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    Oh but he did. 
    He said, “I am not going to take any further evidence. 
    He didn't say that “I'm going at the outset of the trial. 
    I will exclude evidence.” 
    There was a testimony in that record as to the fitness of the respective parents. 
    The testimony was presented sir but he said, “I'm not going to take any further.” 
    There were numerous people who would testify as to the fitness and good character of each. 
    And he said, “It's obvious that they are both good parents”. 
    He found that and he said immediately, I think it was following upon that, to me, when I propose to put witnesses up as to the fitness of the respondent here. 
    That was where he said, “I understand you're going to undertake to prove it.” 
    He said, “They have not attacked it.” 
    And I answer you, Mr. Chief Justice by saying that in the trial of this case, true they did allege in the complaint, that is the complaint in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, that the defendant, respondent here was an unfit person.

    -- I would have been through.
speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="3462.711" stopTime="3465.102">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    It was the extent to which they had conceded.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3465.102" stopTime="3465.762">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="3465.762" stopTime="3511.306">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    Well, I understood you too inquire if they had made a concession into the record, I think that there is no issue, no controversy about it, but if you had then asked me where would you find that in the record and I think you did, I cannot point to a place in the record where counsel for petitioner says expressly, we make no question of change of circumstances other than in the trial of the North Carolina case. 
    Now, if they did make that statement to the Court, now again, the judge of the Superior Court of Lee County stated that in his order that there was no contention of change of circumstances by either party. 
    We think that the --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3511.306" stopTime="3515.996">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean the change of circumstances with regards to the defendant and the plaintiff.
speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="3515.996" stopTime="3858.448">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    Or as to the minor children, any change of circumstances with respect to this course. 
    There was no contention of that and it was so stated into the record in the trial of the North Carolina case. 
    And the South Carolina Supreme Court, as I have heretofore stated, held that there was neither allegation nor proof of a change of circumstances. 
    We think that to view this matter, we think that the question as set forth on page 1 in the question presented in the brief of respondent is a proper statement of the question before this Court. 
    And to view from there, we say that we must look and see what was held by the South Carolina Supreme Court. 
    If I may point that up quickly we say first, that the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the Virginia order was ‘dismissed agreed', a ‘dismissed agreed' order under the Virginia practice. 
    Second, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the judgment was res judicata in Virginia of the issues before the Virginia Court. 
    Third, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that Virginia courts would recognize and be bound by the decree in the absence of changed circumstances. 
    Fourth, the South Carolina Supreme Court determined the South Carolina law and held that upon a proper showing, the Court could make a further disposition of the child if new facts and circumstances made it desirable or proper for the best interest of the child and expressly held that a judicial award of custody of a child is never final. 
    Then the South Carolina Supreme Court applied the South Carolina rule to that holding and held that the entire record contained neither allegations nor proof of a change of circumstances. 
    The South Carolina Court further held that the ‘dismissed agreed' order of the Virginia Court was a bar to this action between the same parties for the same cause in the absence of any change of circumstances. 
    We think that the South Carolina Supreme Court reached the same result in its opinion that would have been reached by application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause or by rules of committee. 
    Therefore, the petitioner alleges here a constitutional question on the premise that the South Carolina Supreme Court held that it was precluded from inquiring into the best interest of the welfare of the minor children. 
    They contend that the South Carolina Court held that it was precluded by the Virginia decree and we submit that that is not the finding of the South Carolina Supreme Court. 
    The South Carolina Court held that the South Carolina law would be properly applied here, it did apply. 
    Now, we say that what they would attempt to do is to say that it was not res judicata and he said, not res judicata even if it was ‘dismissed agreed' and the Virginia cases to which they would point and one I believe that would come the closest to it would be the Buchanan case which is cited in their brief. 
    And I particularly call the Court's attention there that those cases which they cited referred to a contract made in Virginia prior to the institution of the litigation. 
    That is not the case here as to what happened in Virginia. 
    Here, the agreement was made. 
    It was negotiated. 
    It was part and parcel of the order ‘dismissed agreed' of the Virginia Court. 
    Now, with respect to parens patriae, we submit to this Court that parens patriae has no place when -- no standing, when in direct conflict with a mandate of the Constitution, we further say that here, the South Carolina Supreme Court carefully examined the record and supplied the very thing that the Kovacs case in the opinion by Mr. Justice Black was sent back to North Carolina to determine. 
    Here, the South Carolina went into that. 
    It founded according to its own law. 
    It applied. 
    And that very deficiency or the reason that this Court sent back the Kovacs case here -- is applied in the case here. 
    We contend in conclusion that under the mandate of the -- of the Constitution, the mandate of Article IV Section 1 that it is equally as strong with respect to a child custody case as to other cases because a custody decree is a judicial decree and it cannot be stated otherwise and there is no exception in the mandate of the Constitution with respect to a custody decree.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you this, sir. 
    As understand that you are in full faith and credit, you are saying as the Court said in the next to the last page of its opinion, it was bound by the full faith and credit to give full credit to this judgment. 
    Suppose that he go back now and it's shown that the children had been living with their parents for three years, this parent, is it your contention that that's settled? 
    And if they couldn't show that by reason of what's happened during these three years while the case was pending, the best interest of the child and not the parents, the best interest of the child wouldn't be served by keeping it with the parents, is that it?
speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="3900.276" stopTime="3930.327">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    We contend that if they wish that anytime under the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision to bring a new action contending a change of circumstances, they could do so and the South Carolina Court or the court that would have jurisdiction of the parties under the rule that is prevalent or the same in Virginia and in South Carolina, and in North Carolina, they could bring that action. 
    But the plaintiff would have the burden to show it.
