    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    Mr. Chief Justice and honorable Justices of this Court. 
    May it please the Court, for a moment I would just like to review the factual situation concerned with this case? 
    This case involves an infraction of Title 26 of the U.S. Code, which requires any person in the business of accepting wagers to have a federal tax stamp, further to register as a so-called acceptor of such wagers with the local Internal Revenue Bureau. 
    David Namet was accused of failing to have done this. 
    The treasury agents for sometime conducted a surveillance of Mr. Namet, during which period they followed him about. 
    They saw him visiting on a couple of times a week various variety stores, which had a reputation for accepting wagers. 
    At no time in their entire surveillance, which consumed over a month, did they ever see the defendant, the petitioner here, accept one bet, one wager for himself or anybody else or did they find any -- during that period of surveillance, any kind of evidence upon his person. 
    The evidence offered by the government's eyewitnesses was to the effect that the surveillance was conducted in the month of March during one of the fabled New England winters of course where an automobile could be used and when it couldn't, the petitioner would go on foot. 
    This time he wore a three-quarter length coat, which paired with patch pockets. 
    Witnesses testified to the effect that as he went into the different stores, his pockets were perceptibly filled when he came out while there were perceptibly empty when he went in. 
    A raid was eventually conducted in the city of Chelsea, Massachusetts to the North of Boston, at which time the Treasury Agents went into the house of Namet. 
    There they found an envelope containing -- three envelopes containing a total of $700, $75 and $50 and $186 in cash on defendant Namet's peron. 
    They found miscellaneous items of pieces of paper with numbers on them. 
    Political cards, pencils, paper, unused pads, three slips in his wallet the size of 3x5 pad containing some numbers there on, none of which was dated in anyway except for three items, two of which were mere information items called half slips; they were dated 1948 and 1949 I believe.

    What's a half slip?
speaker="john_h_fitzgerald" startTime="208.743" stopTime="264.598">
    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    A half slip Your Honor is a card where the better puts in a number to a person engaged in a business of taking wagers. 
    Should numbers they play come up so frequently, they are only paid half of the odds, which another number would pay the full extent of the odds. 
    These are merely for information purposes and I suppose they found as has been testified by experts in these various cases and through the course of the year or so as the numbers come out repeatedly in the newspapers, they are taken from newspapers by the way, should numbers repeat themselves with such a frequency, that it's unfair to the so-called man who accepts a wager to have him pay the full amount of the bet, so therefore he only pays half, they are just information.

    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    Something to that effect Your Honor. 
    But these are not for sale, they are given away and there was some other -- and there was one other envelope in the defendant Namet's house, which had a date February with no specific day Your Honor but 1949. 
    About this evidence which was taken in his house, his son appeared and testified on behalf of his father and parenthetically and coincidentally his son happens to be a practicing lawyer in Massachusetts, Office of the Court. 
    He testified to the effect of this material, this pile of pencils and papers have been around the house for years to his knowledge. 
    The money and the envelopes was the proceeds of an insurance policy left over after they had buried his mother with -- recently before this so-called raid. 
    At the trial, it was during the same raid in another part of the city, same agents picked up a husband and a wife Irving and Annette Kahn. 
    Present Counsel appeared for all three. 
    For reasons best known to Counsel, he suggested that the Kahns change their plea of guilty to not guilty, which they did. 
    While changing their plea to guilty and at the same time, the Namet trial was to proceed on a not guilty basis for a jury. 
    The United States Attorney had the United States Marshall present serve the two Kahns with a summons.

    Then the case is marked for trial and the day came for trial, all three were called at the same time.

    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    For a probationary report and so forth. 
    So, at that particular moment upon their plea of guilty, they were served with a summons to be Government witnesses. 
    While it isn't a matter of any record this took place down the back of the courtroom during a recess. 
    Counsel advised the United States Attorney that he would instruct the Kahns about their rights to further incrimination and that he believed that they would avail themselves of the privilege under the Fifth Amendment of the constitution. 
    The trial then started the case of Namet and jury was impaneled and Namet -- the government made their opening. 
    Of course, the Counsel believed that he had to wait until the opening was made to be sure of what was going to be said. 
    In the opening, the Government Attorney stated to the jury that he would produce two witnesses, a husband and wife who he believed would testify against the defendant Namet. 
    Once he finished his opening, Counsel, the Government and Defense Counsel approached the bench. 
    There ensued one of many bench conferences, which is replayed in the transcript and which isn't in the transcript many, many lobby conferences ensued beside that, over a period of two days. 
    The principle issue was whether the government could use the Kahns as witnesses, which raises the salient issue that the Counsel brings before this Court. 
    So, whether the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts erred in permitting two witnesses, the husband and wife, namely the Kahns, who had pleaded guilty in a separate, similar but separate case involving the same crime to take the stand over not only to Petitioner's objection, but over their own Counsel's objection when both the Court and the prosecution knew in advance that such witnesses would invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against further self-incrimination. 
    From the beginning, in reliance upon this, the Counsel has cited throughout his brief, the United States versus Maloney in 1959 where Mr. Justice Hand, Learned Hand of New York in the Second Circuit held that in a similar instance, it wasn't quite as similar as this, because the witness on the stand was not -- had never been a defendant in the case, the particular witness involved. 
    But the attorney for one of the defendants there also represented the witness testifying and he requested the Court to advice the witness of his constitutional privileges, which the Court did. 
    Despite that, the witness was compelled to testify. 
    Justice Hand in reviewing the doings of that Court stated that it was reversible error to force a witness to take the stand under those circumstances. 
    And as in this case here, the government knew in advance as did the Court below that the Kahns who undoubtedly were essential to the government's case, but whether they are a necessity in the government's case should overshadow the danger and would say were headed to further incriminate themselves and subject themselves to further indictment is one of the issues before this Court. 
    Counsel advised the Court immediately following the government's opening to the jury and the bench conferences to which I had alluded. 
    While the Kahns had admittedly confessed their guilt to failure to fulfill the requirements of the 26th United States Code, I believe it was Sections 44/11 and 44/12, they had only pleaded guilty to a conceivable conspiracy, which could arise out of any testimonial in their part. 
    They had only pleaded guilty to conceivable bribery of a Federal Official to income tax evasion, Federal income tax evasion and they were compelled to take the stand. 
    It was felt by Counsel, who not withstanding the government's brief, was not trying to engineer a case, but was looking out for the best interest of the Kahns and they coincidentally represented during this trial to not further subject themselves to future incrimination.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="741.284" stopTime="748.365">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Particularly for me, Mr. Fitzgerald with that argument is that the Kahns aren't here. 
    They are not the Petitioner's here. 
    You have a --
speaker="john_h_fitzgerald" startTime="748.365" stopTime="750.401">
    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    They are not Petitioner's here, admittedly sorry Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="750.401" stopTime="753.208">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You are not talking about the Kahns rights under the Fifth Amendment?
speaker="john_h_fitzgerald" startTime="753.208" stopTime="753.900">
    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="753.900" stopTime="769.191">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But the Petitioner here is a third party and how can avail himself to their rights or complain if their rights are violated anymore that he can complain if they hadn't waived the protection of the Fifth Amendment and testified against him?
speaker="john_h_fitzgerald" startTime="769.191" stopTime="814.331">
    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    If the Kahn's were testifying concerning a further crime, these crimes might also involve the Petitioner. 
    That was the same case, which was before Mr. Justice Hand in the United States versus Maloney, neither was a witness there a defendant. 
    The witness was not a -- while an acknowledged part of a conspiracy, he had never been indicted, but he was represented by the same Counsel, who represented one of the defendants in the Maloney case. 
    And thus was the reasoning of Mr. Justice Hand that the witnesses in that case. 
    And again, it was the -- for the Trial Court to force the witness to take the stand.

    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    That is a further part of my argument, Your Honor in the so-called popular term guilt by association. 
    And that I would attempt to develop as I proceed, but that is the salient but in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, the same set of facts confronted Mr. Justice Hand in New York. 
    And then, in the Maloney case, Mr. Justice Hand in arriving at his position stated, which partially will answer your question Mr. Justice Goldberg, by virtue of the commonwealth knowing in advance -- the government knowing in advance that these witnesses will avail themselves in the Fifth Amendment, an inference would be created by their failure to answer the questions put to them, which inference would they almost like an unseen cloud pulled over to the jury. 
    And the jury would treat that as evidentiary and the jury would be conjuring up what the answer might have been had the witness answered, whether it was the Kahns or somebody else.

speaker="john_h_fitzgerald" startTime="897.996" stopTime="975.846">
    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    There was a same transaction – well, for instance the Kahns would be asked the question which they were asked, did you have any business relations with the defendant? 
    There was an objection, there was an invocation. 
    The Fifth Amendment, it was sustained, that is in the transcript. 
    Now the jury would conceivably sit there and try to conjure up what the answer would have been. 
    In other words, what did the Kahns have to hide, why didn't they say yes or no? 
    Well, knowing fine technical distinctions of the law, now as this approach or inference would roll across the courtroom, the Counsel had no, the Defense Counsel for Namet had no opportunity to cross examine that inference, which was the evidenced being put into the jury's mind indirectly. 
    The inference further under Mr. Justice Hand's rulings was to avoid of the sanctity of a note. 
    And Counsel feels this apparently Mr. Justice Hand felt to strip any Defense Counsel in this way of the Excalibur of cross-examination is to erase the search for the truth, which cross-examination is supposed to be and is designed to produce.

    For instance, there it is conceivable whether it could be government witnesses that were called to the stand and they might be custodian of public documents. 
    They would have no conceivable danger in invoking the Fifth Amendment. 
    It might be a witness who saw at a distance a crime occurring, an eyewitness might be a [Inaudible] or a witness who was present when statements were made in the presence of the defendant who was in an outer circle from the arresting officers so to speak. 
    There are many instances where you conceive that a government witness could not possibly incriminate himself and would have no need to invoke the Fifth Amendment.

    Mr. John H. Fitzgerald 
    Well, when we had these various conferences, the Judge was -- let's say on my side one time and the Government side the other time, and it was never completely clear just what his feeling was. 
    In other words, in the testimony of the -- in the conversations of the bench conferences its replete what the Judge's own statements to the Government, what would you have done if the Kahns had not pleaded guilty? 
    Do you have enough evidence without them? 
    And the Government answered we have -- admittedly, we don't have a strong case without the Kahn's. 
    Then after a few more questions by the Kahns, another recess was had. 
    The trial Judge stated to the government, “I don't see how I can let you proceed with the Kahns, you are going to put them in jeopardy of further indictment.” 
    And then there was a suggestion that the Kahns be released from the Court, be sent home. 
    And the Judge himself told and then further instructed the U.S Attorney, “You better keep the witnesses here, you might be criticized downstairs.” 
    And it went back and forth on seesaw effect like that. 
    There was no clear-cut idea as to just what was the conviction of the judge in this case.

   Argument of Stephen J. Pollak
speaker="stephen_j_pollak" startTime="1846.992" stopTime="1966.492">
    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on direct review of the Petitioner's criminal conviction. 
    As opposing counsel has stated he was found guilty of violation of the Internal Revenue code by failing to register and pay the taxes as to one engaged in the business of accepting wagers. 
    At this trial, the government called Mr. and Mrs. Kahn, proprietors of a variety store in Chelsea and people who had admitted to revenue agents that they had acted as agents in their store for petitioner in the wagering operations. 
    They had, as stated here, also pleaded guilty to separate information, making charges based upon their actions involving the petitioner. 
    There are two issues; the first issue raised and the only issue raised by the Petitioner is, whether the government was properly permitted to call Mr. and Mrs. Kahn, where the Petitioner's lawyer had informed the court and the government that he had advised them to plead their privilege. 
    Essentially, we believe this issue is whether the Defense Counsel may block material witnesses and material and relevant evidence by informing the Court before trial that he has advised those witnesses to claim their privilege. 
    We believe that nothing in the history of the Fifth Amendment would warrant giving this control over an opposing party's case to the opposing Counsel. 
    The parties must be free to call and question witnesses known to be able to give relevant evidence so that each party may present his case. 
    There is a second issue --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1966.492" stopTime="1975.714">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Before you get the second issue, did the Kahns tell the prosecutor themselves that they would not testify or did it just come from the counsel?
speaker="stephen_j_pollak" startTime="1975.714" stopTime="2018.248">
    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    It only came from Counsel, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The second issue, which I will just state, was called to the attention of the Court by the government in our memorandum response to the petition for certiorari. 
    And it concerns the cautionary instruction, which the Court gave on the inferences which could or could not be drawn from the claim of the privilege. 
    The question here is, whether that instruction, which we concede to have been defective, was so prejudicial as to require a new trial where there was no objection prior to the retirement of the jury and where the issue was not raised at any appellate level or in the petition for certiorari.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Well, I mean to spend as petitioner's counsel addressed himself most primarily to the first issue on the propriety of the calling Kahns. 
    I mean to spend most of my time on that, but let me state that we raised this issue for the Court's consideration. 
    The Court took this case we took that to mean that this Court wished us to make the review, which we initially suggested be made at an appellate court level. 
    So we endeavored to address ourselves to that issue and provide the Court with a briefing and an argument position and I'm prepared to argue that point. 
    It may be helpful to state briefly the facts on which we think the issue is raised, the issues. 
    The information as stated were brought against the petitioner and the two Kahns charging that each of them all three had engaged in wagering operations with failure to register and pay the tax. 
    My opposing counsel has detailed the evidence. 
    The Kahns were the proprietors of one of the stores that the petitioner was observed to visit each day. 
    They retained at same counsel and plead guilty, on the morning of the trial as stated the Kahns withdrew their plea of -- did I say guilty -- they withdrew their plea of not guilty and plead guilty. 
    In the opening, the government stated that it would believe that it would offer a husband and wife, who would testify that they had acted as agents in petitioner's wagering operation and would testify to the procedures of that operation. 
    At a bench conference immediately following this opening, petitioner's lawyer stated to the Court, that the Court should keep in mind that the Kahns and I'm quoting “were defendants, entitled not to testify in their own case.” 
    The Court stated that they had pled guilty and the defense counsel, petitioner's defense counsel, stated that he had not intended to wave any constitutional privileges in pleading them guilty. 
    The Court then stated that he hadn't seen them on the stand. 
    If they took the stand, if they made a claim it would ruled. 
    Thereafter as the second witness, the government called Mrs. Khan. 
    She answered a number questions voluntarily stating that she and her husband were proprietors of Harvey's variety shop in Chelsea, that they knew the petitioner, that they had known him by sight for a couple of years. 
    Thereafter she was asked if she had a business relationship with the petitioner and she stated “Our attorney has advised us not to answer on a plea of the Fifth Amendment,” her attorney of course was also the defense counsel. 
    Thereafter at proceedings outside the hearing of jury, bench conference, the Court ruled that because of her plea of guilty, Mrs. Khan could be questioned. 
    She could be asked what she did and she had seen in relation to the defendant, but that she could not be asked questions which might tend to incriminate her of other crimes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2242.694" stopTime="2244.497">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That was outside the presence of the jury.
speaker="stephen_j_pollak" startTime="2244.497" stopTime="2323.982">
    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    That was outside the presence of the jury Mr. Justice Black, yes sir. 
    The government described in stating why it was calling Mrs. Khan, had described the statements that she had given to the revenue agents, stating -- laying out the direct evidence against the petitioner which she was aware of. 
    She had been the petitioner's agent in his wagering operation, she and her husband. 
    The Court noted the spot, the defense counsel was in representing the various parties and defense counsel stated and I'm quoting “In pleading her guilty he had not intended that she would cooperate with the government.” 
    Then the Court as it was pointed out I believe in the questioning by Mr. Justice White, sustained the objection on the ground that the question called for a legal conclusion. 
    Immediately thereafter on page 8 I believe of the record, the Court ruled that the witness could be asked if she had a relationship with the petitioner. 
    However, the Government did not put that question to Mrs. Kahn, the Government asked several other questions to which she gave answers and then when there was an objection on grounds of materiality of a line of questioning, Mrs. Kahn was excused without claiming the privilege again.

    I think that would make a difference, and I intend to address myself to that directly. 
    I just have one more statement of facts on which this issue is raised that I think is important. 
    Later in the trial, the Government called Mr. Kahn. 
    He was asked 18 questions. 
    He answered ten questions voluntarily. 
    He claimed the privilege as to eight. 
    The Court sustained the claim of the privilege as to four questions and ordered him to answer the other four. 
    When the privilege was sustained as to two questions in a row, the Government excused the witness. 
    Now, Mr. Kahn testified voluntarily and under orders of the Court, Court ruling that he had no valid claim of the privilege, that he ran a store in Chelsea, that he knew the petitioner, that he had dealings with him during the period of the information; that he had accepted wagers in his store, that the petitioner came to his store not everyday and not twice a day, but came to his store several times a week.

    May I ask have you viewed the record as I have read it, but as you view the record, did the prosecuting attorney ask any questions of the Kahns which the Court had told him in advance in his chamber, he would not compel them to answer. 
    So I'm free to say that that has [Inaudible] to do with the case. 
    I do not agree in other words that at this time, that the statement that you could never put a witness on the stand if he says, I claim the privilege. 
    I do not agree with the idea that a prosecutor can run rough shot over the government of what the judges told him he couldn't do it inside the Court and get it for the purpose of having him claim the privilege in the Court.

    We do not mean to say that it would not be improper under some circumstances for the government to put a witness on the stand with knowledge that the witness is going to claim the privilege. 
    If the witness is placed on the stand in bad faith for purposes of forcing the claim of the privilege, we would think that, that would be improper.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    We do not believe that this record shows that. 
    The petitioner has cited the Johnson case, Texas case, and we have cited a case called Tucker in the Third Circuit. 
    I might just mention the Tucker case. 
    In that case that it was coming on to the third trial. 
    There had been a first trial; the government had called a witness. 
    The witness had pled the privilege to several, a string of questions. 
    The trial then was -- conviction was obtained, there was a reversal on appeal, there was a second trial. 
    At the second trail, the same witness was called, the same questions were asked, the same privilege was pled. 
    The Third Circuit said upon review of that second trial, said since there must be a third trial and reversed the second conviction, since there must be a third trial, we state that the government should not call this witness unless it has knowledge that he will now no longer claim the privilege or that it has -- well the Court really didn't expatiate on that.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Mr. Justice Goldberg, we do not think that those questions were -- require a reversal here. 
    We think that there are several points that are important. 
    Prior to the asking of those questions, the witness had answered five questions voluntarily. 
    The six previous questions he had been ordered to answer. 
    So he had proceeded to answer six questions. 
    We believe that in light of the Court's ruling in the case that the witnesses could be asked, what they had done and what they had seen in relation to the petitioner that these questions were within the parameters laid down by the Court. 
    And that counsel, again I might stress that defense counsel had never asked here for proceedings out of the hearing of the jury. 
    We think on the top of 23 that the Court perhaps even invited such proceedings. 
    No question was -- no request was made for that. 
    The government lawyer here, we think the record really -- you can smell it if you read the record that the government lawyer was trying to be careful, not trying to overreach, he was trying to represent the public in placing the case before the jury. 
    And that these questions, these two questions as you pointed out the witness was then released after the two questions were asked, came within those parameters. 
    Now the -- I don't think that the government attorney can be taxed with being certain under the circumstances here that the witness would make the claim. 
    I might address myself to that for a minute, because this petitioner has not argued here for a broad rule in the oral argument, we think the facts of the case are also important. 
    Here the Court stated that the government -- that the defense lawyer was in the spot, in representing witnesses and the defendant at the same time. 
    I think it's particularly appropriate here for the government to have determined whether these witnesses intended to plead the privilege themselves and it really didn't become clear. 
    They continued to give voluntary testimony, so that where there is an advice, the only advice that the government had from the Defense Counsel was that he had advised these witnesses to claim their privilege. 
    He did not inform the government that they would claim their privilege or so far as the record shows. 
    He perhaps candidly said, he had advised them to claim their privilege. 
    In the background was the plea of guilty to the charges involving the very transactions and the government went into the case relying on the decisions as it read them believing that there was no basis for a claim of a privilege at all. 
    There is some suggestion in the Reina --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2817.749" stopTime="2826.321">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But there was -- the government did have knowledge of something when the judge told them out of the presence of the jury there were certain things they would not let him ask.

    We don't -- we of course cannot state that the government proceeded without knowledge, that there were -- that there might possibly be objections to certain questions or a claim of the privilege would be sustained as to certain questions, but it never had knowledge that the privilege would actually begin to pose.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Well, no. 
    As we read the Court's ruling, he stated that they could be asked what they did and what they saw in relation to Namet and what they did in relation to Namet is taking wagers in relation to Namet. 
    I might say Your Honor that there has not been an objection made as to the Court's ruling as to what questions would be allowed and what questions would not.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I understand it, I understand it. 
    The reason I am asking is this, I do think it would be wrong and lawless, as the Judge looked into and they've came up with the claim, and said now we are going to claim this. 
    It precisely is, the Judge said, I would agree you, and you claim that that you got it right. 
    Then, I would say if the prosecutor takes them in and the Jury has to make that claim in the presence of the Jury, it would be hard for me to think he did it for any reason on earth except to get the advantage whatever it is from having that Constitutional privilege claimed by the witnesses and I wouldn't think that was correct on the part of prosecutor.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Well, we may -- the government may differ Mr. Justice Black in this respect, the -- we feel that there is some burden upon the Lawyer for witnesses or a Lawyer for a defendant to see that the witness make it certain that the witness will claim the privilege. 
    I pose this situation, this is what -- this is the rule.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Well, in the circumstances of this case, we do not believe that it was certain that these witnesses would continue to claim their privilege.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You think you are [Inaudible] with that been said the layer said they were going to do and nobody objected on the ground and hadn't asked them. 
    The only way that could be proven that the lawyer meant what he said and the witnesses wouldn't testify without the question asked in open Court or the Jury.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Well, we think that under the circumstances of the questioning of the witness where he had proceeded to answer several questions, where it was still unclear as to the intention of the witness to claim the privilege, as to question-by-question that the government in these circumstances was entitled to -- it was entitled, we claim in good faith to test the parameters of what the witness was willing to answer and that there is at least a basis in an ongoing trial here for the government to believe that these question were within the Court's prior ruling. 
    There may have been some conflict in the position that the Court was taking as to what would and would not permitted. 
    Of course the case comes up in a situation where there was considerable doubt as to whether the witnesses had any claim of the privilege available to them at all since they had pled guilty and since these questions we are asking them about the very transactions out of which their information arose. 
    I don't mean to override the point that the name of Namet wasn't on the information, but that was the only basis on which the information was brought.

    Well we think there are -- that there is Justice Learned Hand said in the Mahoney case, there are -- there is no general rule here to keep witnesses from the state. 
    We think that the circumstances -- the circumstances will show and overreach by the Federal Government, which we don't believe is present here or an overreach by a prosecutor. 
    There are State cases which have charted these courses and we think that Johnson case cited by the petitioner, the Washburn case, both Texas cases show over reaching, but we don't find an over reaching by the prosecutor here in the circumstances. 
    We think --

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    Well, in Judge -- in the Mahoney case, Judge Hand at the conclusion of his opinion rested it solely on the fact that the Judge had not given a cautionary instruction. 
    He did not rest it and he did not as I read it, rule, that the calling of the witness was a reversible error. 
    So that there are several other cases in the New York Second Circuit they seem to have risen most there that hold where the witnesses entered a plea, there is no objection to calling him at all, but we recognize it in those cases, the practice in New York at least with those indictments have been the charge both conspiracy and the substantive crime, a situation we didn't have here.

    Mr. Stephen J. Pollak 
    I don't think we would make that -- just draw that line, because we recognize that there are some circumstances where a witness knowing he will plead the Fifth Amendment, knowing that the Court will sustain the plea and knowing for example that he has almost no material evidence to give that he wouldn't claim the privilege to or none, I make that flat none, then the governments would be calling him in bad faith. 
    But here, we review the record and we find there are three things to review, whether the witness is in a position to give material and relevant evidence. 
    This witness was. 
    This witness did give material and relevant evidence whether there is a reasonable basis for belief that he wouldn't claim the privilege. 
    There was such a reasonable basis here as to both Mr. and Mrs. Kahn. 
    One, they had pled guilty; they had shown a willingness and pled guilty. 
    Two, they had given statements to the revenue agents, we had no reason to believe they wouldn't continue to give bad account, and three, a reasonable basis for believing that the Court would not sustain the claim of the privilege and that the time we call them we thought that the privilege would not be sustained on the background of this case.
