    Ms. Jewel Lafontant 
    May it please the Court. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    The petitioner herein was tried and convicted for the unlawful sale and possession of narcotics. 
    And her convictions affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court. 
    She sought certiorari on the ground that the confession obtained from her by threats and promises was used against her in her trial in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
    This Court granted certiorari upon receipt from the Illinois Supreme Court of a certificate that decision of the federal claim refer to in the order of the United States Supreme Court was necessary, was necessary to the judgment rendered by the Illinois Supreme Court. 
    The people's testimony reveals that on January 17th, 1959, an informer, one Zeno, who had been previously convicted of the unlawful sale of narcotics, was again in the custody of Illinois officials for again violating the narcotic laws. 
    He agreed with his arresting officers upon promises of leniency by the said officers to set up an undisclosed third party for the crime of the sale of narcotics, wanting to keep from going to the penitentiary if he possibly could, as will appear on page 21 of the record, this informer took the arresting police officers Bryson's, Sims and Kobar to the apartment building where petitioner resided. 
    Alone, he gained admittance to the apartment. 
    Inside that apartment, there were three people present, namely the petitioner, the informer Zeno, and a visitor. 
    Zeno was out of the presence or sight of the police officers from 10 to 15 minutes. 
    He later emerged from the doorway leading to the apartment, rejoined the arresting officers and handed them a package which contained marijuana. 
    He told them that the petitioner had given it to him, had sold it to him. 
    It is uncontroverted that the arresting officers were not present at the time of the alleged sale, and that they relied upon the word of Zeno that the petitioner sold the narcotics to him. 
    Followed by the police officers, Zeno returned to the petitioner's apartment and then she opened the door, she was arrested. 
    She was grabbed by both her hands and she was told by Officer Sims that she had unlawfully sold narcotics to Zeno. 
    She was then taken back into her apartment, to the bedroom, if you please, flanked by two police officers. 
    In her own behalf, she protested for innocence. 
    Now, while in that bedroom, Officer Sims had adroitly inquired whether petitioner had any children, noticing ad bringing up the fact that there was children's clothing in the bedroom. 
    He also inquired quite adroitly about her subsistence. 
    And he found out that she had two little children ages 3 and 4 that she was receiving state funds in order to help support those children, state funds from what is called Aid to Dependent Children in Illinois or ADC. 
    And then he said at page 35 of the record, “If we take you into the station and charge you with the offense, the ADC would be probably be cut off and you will probably lose custody of your children.” 
    He also said that during that same conversation, he promised to recommend leniency to the state if the petitioner would cooperate. 
    Then and only then, the petitioners said “Yes, I did sell it to him”. 
    This confession of a guilt of the petitioner brought out by Illinois on direct examination of his own witness, we submit was timely objected to on the basis of having -- the confession having been induced by promises of immunity at the trial level. 
    And the objection was preserved by a later motion to strike. 
    And the statement was also made at that time that the objection was made because the confession was made under promises of leniency.

    Well, in my interpretation, I would say that it was in that -- the general statement was made that the petitioner had been denied her rights since I understand it because she -- this confession was coerced, in view of the fact that she was threatened with having children taken away from her, that was brought out, but it was not specifically spelled out, that the particular provision of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was being violated.

    I would say not, Your Honor. 
    I believe that the Supreme Court certificate -- I would say first that even without the Supreme Court's certificate, by looking at the evidence as a whole that -- it would not beyond -- be beyond the realm of reasonableness to say that the question was actually brought up. 
    But in view of the fact that it was raised very specifically in the Supreme Court's brief, and in view of the fact, the certificate from the Illinois Supreme Court states that it did consider the constitutional question, that he did consider it, and then it was necessary for its decision, I think would render the question moot in the view of all of these.

    It says, of the federal claim referred to in the order of this Court. 
    What --
speaker="jewel_lafontant" startTime="472.498" stopTime="473.272">
    Ms. Jewel Lafontant 
    Yes, well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="473.272" stopTime="476.491">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How is that federal claim verbalized in this Court's order, do you remember them?
speaker="jewel_lafontant" startTime="476.491" stopTime="839.619">
    Ms. Jewel Lafontant 
    The order the Supreme Court of the United States was directed to the Illinois Supreme Court to answer the question whether or not the Illinois Supreme Court had considered pages 66 of petitioner's brief in the Supreme Court and it was quoted that it was unfair to make a promise -- mimic on a promise, coerce a confession and then use that confession as evidence, that's what was substantially. 
    And the Illinois Supreme Court answered and said that it did consider that question, the federal question. 
    I believe I do have a copy of that order in my notes. 
    Now, I -- we submit that the in -- inadmissibility of this confession was presented in the appeal brief just referred to before the Supreme Court of Illinois and again raised with particularity in the petitioner's -- petition for a rehearing. 
    The Attorney General of Illinois argues that the constitutional question was not aptly asserted in accordance with Illinois principles. 
    He ignores the nature of the right claimed by petitioner to have been violated. 
    You well know that a similar question was raised and passed upon by this Court in Brown versus Mississippi, 297 U.S. 276. 
    And it said on the following words, “That contention rest upon the failure of counsel for the accused, who had objected to the admissibility of the confessions to move for their exclusion after they had been introduced and the fact of coercion had been proved. 
    It is a contention which proceeds upon a misconception of the nature of petitioner's complaint. 
    That complaint is not of the commission of mere error but of a wrong so fundamental, that it made the whole proceeding a mere pretense of the trial, and rendered the conviction and sentence wholly void. 
    We're not concerned with a mere question of state practice, or where the counsel assigned the petitioners were competent or mistakenly assumed that their first objections were sufficient.” 
    If the Attorney General of Illinois contends the principles of trials and appellate judicature of a state would be sufficient to withdraw from the consideration of this Court, violation of such substitute rights as here presented, it would be tantamount to giving a state the right to nullify the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. 
    Such preemptive rights, we submit, are inconceivable. 
    This Court has long held that the confession obtained by promises of leniency, duress, or coercion when admitted over the objection of the defendant vitiates the whole proceeding and is a denial of the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It is true that in this case we didn't have the gross brutality that we have in the Brown versus Mississippi one. 
    But this Court has also recognized the coercion of the mind is of the same nature and sometimes greater than physical violence. 
    In Spano versus New York, 360 U.S. 315, the investigators extracts the confession from the defendant by having his close friend Bruno urged the defendant to confess. 
    Because Bruno, who was a fledging police officer, stated to Spano, that if he didn't confess, that he would be in a bad spot, and because of a prior phone call in an admission that it had been made to Bruno. 
    And in that case, it was held that the confession was really involuntary. 
    And I know, Chief Justice Warren remembers it and knows in much more thoroughly than I could ever hope to. 
    In Brown versus United States at 168 U.S. 532, there's another instance of a similar case. 
    In this case and when I say a similar case, a case where actual brutality wasn't used. 
    The defendant Brown was induced into incriminating himself after the police officer told him, “Brown said he saw you do the murder. 
    I'm satisfied you do murder. 
    You must have had an accomplice. 
    If so, you should say so and not have the blame of this horrible crime on your shoulders.” 
    And the incriminating statements that were made by Brown in that case were held to be involuntary. 
    And in Rogers versus Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, the confession that the defendant gave was held to be involuntarily merely because the police had threatened to bring his arthritic wife in for interrogation. 
    And there, the Court said, “The attention of the trial judge should have been focused on the question whether the behavior of state law enforcement officials was such as to overbear the petitioner's will to resist and bring about confession not freely self-determined.” 
    I submit that in this case the threat was to what is -- what is dearest for a mother, the custody and the care of her two little children. 
    And I also submit that she had a further inducement and that -- that further inducement was a promise of leniency. 
    Petitioner confessed her guilt, it's true but such a confession should -- could hardly be considered a voluntary one.

    Ms. Jewel Lafontant 
    Well, I would say, it would make no difference because these facts would definitely disprove that statement. 
    And I would say this that when any promise is made, no matter how slight, that we cannot possibly weigh what influence such a promise would have upon the mind of a person. 
    Now, that's why I had presented these other cases where it was shown, I thought the weakest one possibly was in this Spano case versus New York, where -- not Spano in the -- yes, in the Spano case versus New York where was just the word of a friend say -- by him saying, “I'll get into trouble if you don't confess.” 
    And they say, well that's involuntary. 
    Well certainly, if a person is not close to you, any closer than a friend, if what would come to him, what harm might come to him would make you confess and the Court would hold that that's involuntary, I certainly would say that even if the Supreme Court of Illinois would say, “Well, in spite of the fact that they've said they're going to take her children away from her, and she wouldn't have any funds,” I would say -- they couldn't possibly say that in view of these cases, in view of this Court's prior ruling.

    No, but I believe that, from his own word, from the wording of the Illinois Supreme Court, however, that you might read between the lines and see that after an arrest and prior to the admission that promises were made, they don't go into what they were, but if they do say, strong promises of leniency.

    Ms. Jewel Lafontant 
    The Court didn't. 
    The second contention of respondent is that the petitioner's conviction does not rest in whole or in part upon petitioners confession and I believe in the discussion that we've had already that that has been covered, but that was the next part of my argument that I was going to -- go into. 
    But the line of cases, with the Spano versus New York case, Malinski versus New York 324 U.S. 401, and Blackburn versus Alabama 361 U.S. 199, this Court has held that a conviction obtained by use of coerced confessions will be set aside even though the evidence apart from the confession might have been sufficient to sustain the verdict. 
    The respondent further advances the theory that involuntary confessions admitted over the objection of the defendant, do not violate the constitutional provision of the Fourteenth Amendment when the personality of the trier of facts have changed from that of the jury to the judge. 
    We submit that the waiver of a jury by the defendant cannot be claimed to be a waiver of the basic constitutional guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    In its opinion, the Supreme Court as you've heard stated that strong suggestions of leniency were made. 
    But that after looking at a review of the entire record, the Supreme Court said, “We are convinced that the evidence fully supports the judgment of the trial court.” 
    In the light of Spano line of cases heretofore referred to, we submit that this was error, that the admission of the involuntary confession of petitioner over her objections vitiated the whole proceeding that the finding of the Supreme Court of Illinois that there was evidence in the record to support the conviction does not add sanctity to conduct long adjudication by this Court as reprehensible and a violation of the Due Process Clause. 
    We, therefore, respectfully pray that this Court set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois and remand the case to the state court.

   Argument of William C. Wines

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I begin the argument for Illinois by the unqualified concession that the conversations between the petitioner and the police officer ultimating in her confession were coercive and did deny her due process of law within so far as I know not only every decision of this Court but within the purview of every opinion of any justice in this field with which I am familiar.

    No, by no means, Your Honor. 
    And after I have expatiated a little longer submission, I'm going to state and then earnestly press the thesis on which Illinois asks this Court --

speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="1781.166" stopTime="1792.175">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, yes, that it was obtained by violation of the petitioner's constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.

speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="1793.478" stopTime="1890.975">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    No, Your Honor, because it's my earnest contention that I shall press that counsel for the petitioner, not counsel appointed by the Court, but counsel -- not counsel who represents her here, but counsel in the trial court chose at least compatibly and perhaps in the signal exemplification of the best strategy of advocacy trying this case without a jury instead of effectively trying to have this confession excluded, chose to exploit it in petitioner's behalf. 
    And also that in this case, well -- also that in this case, it affirmatively appears in the record not by inference or innuendo that this petitioner's confession did not re -- I mean this petitioner's conviction on the sentence, did not rest in whole or in part upon this confession. 
    A situation that can't be present in a case that has tried by a jury which has been permitted to hear a confession obtained under circumstances and that, as is the case here, clearly constituted denial of due process of law.

    Your Honor, the motion to exclude because no notice was given was not in any way an invocation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And the motion to exclude, suppress wasn't, but even if it had been the Illinois rule is quite clear, very clear that it isn't enough in any case, civil or criminal to make an objection if the Court declines to rule. 
    The Illinois practice is that the point is waived unless counsel explicitly requests a ruling.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What's the significance of your standpoint of the Supreme Court certificate that it passed on the question -- in the federal question and necessarily did so?
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="1997.746" stopTime="2097.451">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Well it did pass on. 
    It did pass on it. 
    And I can assure Your Honors from reading this opinion and from my intimate acquaintance with that Court that they passed on it in this way. 
    They say so, in almost so many words, that they considered the federal question whether this confession was extorted or obtained by du -- duress within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment held that it was, and held that it played no part in the trial courts or their Court's conviction. 
    That's the meaning of that certificate, not that it approved this method of getting a confession. 
    Maybe if I can talk in terms of the effect -- and by the way, the counsel is quite correct when in answer to a question from Mr. Justice Brennan she said, “There's no dispute about the objective facts of this confession.” 
    There is as to Zeno's testimony that -- the informer's testimony that she sold him the narcotics which is unqualified accusation in her testimony that she didn't which is an unqualified denial. 
    But the version -- by the way, Mrs. Lafonant's statement to the Court here was exceptionally fair and lucid and accurate and relieves me of the burden of restating the facts, but casts on me a considerable burden of discussing it.

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    No, (Voice Overlap) no, Your Honor. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I would like to answer all of these questions in terms of the undisputed facts of this case, and I am not passing the question. 
    I'm trying to lay the factual basis for my argument. 
    These are the undisputed facts, who is the petitioner? 
    Is she a sophisticated, wealthy, gangster or gangstress of the Chicago underworld, equipped with long experience with the Fifth Amendment? 
    Not at all. 
    She is a woman on relief with children three and four years old in a neighborhood that's impoverished that appears almost as a matter of judicial notice from anybody who knows anything about addresses in Chicago. 
    She's accused not of parking violation, but she's undoubtedly, she didn't know what the penalty was, but of a severe crime, the unlawful sale of narcotics which Illinois punishes when she was sentenced in this case, 10 to11 years.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What's her sentence here?
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="2372.609" stopTime="2377.560">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Not less than 10 or more than 11 years in the penitentiary. 
    Now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2377.560" stopTime="2380.963">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So there's no -- there's no suggestion that she -- that the promise was kept of leniency.
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="2380.963" stopTime="2589.266">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Oh, no, not by any terms. 
    Now, two police officers came. 
    There's an accusation that she sold narcotics to a confessed peddler who's trying to make a deal for himself as far as I know, he did. 
    Because Illinois is better by keeping its deals with informers and it is with those who confessed. 
    Now, here's this one who's told not just that if she doesn't confess and she is convicted, she'll get as more severe sentence than if she is convicted in spite a denial, or on standing mute. 
    The police didn't stop there with extortion. 
    They indicated to her, the diction is in text -- just intimation, but in texture, its intimidation. 
    They told her in just so many words weren't very new today, that if she didn't confess whether she was convicted or not, she was the one to lose custody to her two children in any way, they did more than that. 
    And her counsel neglected to mention this which is a very serious threat in Chicago. 
    They threatened to take her off what we call ADC which means her Aid to Dependent Children stops, and she gets no checks. 
    And how she feeds them, I wouldn't know, unless of course she then begins some other criminal career than that with which she was accused here. 
    Now, the reason I deal later on and expatiate on the actual circumstances which are a good deal of words than petitioner's counsel, narration would lead is to show that in order to think that this confession rested in any -- that this conviction rested in -- how could this rested in any part or not confession, you would have to say that an experienced judge of a court of general jurisdiction, the Criminal Court of Cook County, not a Justice of the Peace or magistrate. 
    And the unanimous Supreme Court of Illinois including as I think its then the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Schaefer whose contributions to the law of evidence, he's a distinguished professor of that subject to Northwestern, you can ask Mr. Justice Goldberg about it. 
    You would have to say that men like Mr. Justice Schaefer, Mr. Justice Solfisburg, Mr. Justice Dailey who's been on that Court for very nearly 20 years were oblivious of all Your Honor's decisions on this point, on their own decisions. 
    They've always held that a confession induced by promises of lenity is inadmissible. 
    As far as the Illinois law is concerned, you don't even need the Illinois' Due Process Clause, the common law of rule of evidence that excludes confessions on that.

    If there were any difference between cases tried by judges, I mean as far as the effect of coerced confessions are concerned and cases tried by jury, this rule would make no more -- no sense at all because either jurors would know as much as the members of this Court in which case they'd pay no attention to extorted confessions, or the members of this Court would no know more than jurors in which case they wouldn't exclude them, so the rule has to be different for cases.

    That don't actually -- the pros of the certificate then, that they were given a certificate that they had passed, necessarily passed on the decision, and they would have said, “No, we didn't pass on that question because neither the trial court nor ourselves paid any attention to the admission.”
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="2905.838" stopTime="2972.094">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    That would not be a correct certification of my real understanding of this opinion. 
    I think that Court did this, they read petitioner's briefs. 
    They saw this confession extorted by promises versus threats, intimations or promises versus intimations of threats. 
    If they didn't know about this Court's rule before, they certainly knew it when petitioners cited Brown against Mississippi, if they had not previously heard of the rule, of course they passed on it. 
    Here it was in no record. 
    Here is a contention by a counsel that the confession was ex -- was extorted or wasn't. 
    Well, if it wasn't extorted, it would be substantive evidence of guilt. 
    So they had to determine whether it was extorted. 
    They must have determined that it was extorted because you can't read these facts --

    So, the motion is practically denied. 
    These -- I don't know why he -- if he was so sure that he went through this mental process of saying, “Yes, we have a confession but it was simply, I can't rely on it.” 
    He would have nailed that there and gone through the normal process of -- of grating the motion to strike.

    Your Honor, the Illinois rule is that where a case is tried without a jury, the judge is presumed or considered only competent inadmissible evidence, and the more clearly the evidence is inadmissible, the clearer is the application of that rule.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3106.423" stopTime="3108.243">

    Oh, no, no.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3109.162" stopTime="3123.383">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Because on page 40 that presumption is rebutted. 
    There was a motion to strike the testimony and upon the grounds among others that the evidence was inadmissible and was given under promises of leniency. 
    And the record says the motion to strike was denied.
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="3123.383" stopTime="3191.999">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    But in the Illinois, the mere fact that an objection to competent evidence is overruled when it should be sustained, it doesn't destroy the presumption, never has. 
    Now, it does in the federal courts but not in Illinois. 
    Now, but in the last few minutes, I would like -- I would like to make this point an answer to this question, suppose Your Honors reverse and remand this case, presumably Your Honors won't reverse it outright and set the petitioner free because there is other evidence of guilt. 
    So suppose Your Honors conclude that there ought to be a new trial. 
    Now, if this were a case tried by jury, we'd get a new jury to presumably would've heard nothing about this confession at all and would be free from infection or contamination (Voice Overlap), but what will be the consequence if you reverse this?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Oh yes, but you don't -- if this -- if this judge hasn't sustained the objection after an offer of proof of what the officer is going to say, had sustained the objection of that point or had granted the motion to strike, I doubt that this case would be here.

    This case ought to be reversed and remanded and that I'm authorized after now in my 21st year of practice before this Court for Illinois and I'll make that statement for Illinois.
