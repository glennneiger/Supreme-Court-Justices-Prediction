Griffin v. Maryland

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    William L. Griffin et al., Petitioners, versus Maryland. 
    Mr. Rauh, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="24.744" stopTime="93.456">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is here on re-argument. 
    Though the legal issues are of moment and importance, the facts are simple and largely undisputed. 
    On January 30, 1960, a number of persons, Negro and White, including the five petitioners here, gathered outside of Glen Echo Amusement Park, the major amusement park serving the District of Columbia. 
    It is in Maryland. 
    A picket line protesting the assumed position of the park of segregation was setup, and shortly thereafter, about 8:15 in the evening, the five petitioners, young Negroes, went into the park. 
    There was no obstruction as there are no tickets or other entry required for gaining admission to the park.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="93.456" stopTime="95.608">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    And they have previously parked the picket line?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="95.608" stopTime="104.367">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    They went on to the carousel and took their places on the horses and other animals there.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="104.367" stopTime="105.766">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They needed tickets for that, didn't they?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="105.766" stopTime="106.614">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor and they --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="106.614" stopTime="107.103">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They had them.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="107.103" stopTime="209.068">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    -- had tickets purchased by a White friend and it is not contested that the tickets were freely transferable. 
    So, on the carousel, the five Negroes had the tickets that were required and waited to ride but they didn't ride. 
    The carousel didn't move and a man named Francis J. Collins walked up to them. 
    He had on the uniform of the National Detective Agency, a private detective agency, and he was employed by the park through a contract with the National Detective Agency. 
    He had on the badge of Deputy Sheriff of the State of Maryland, and he said to these five petitioners "We do not permit Negroes on the property here or on the rides. 
    I will give you five minutes to leave the property." 
    In an orderly fashion, there is no question about this, they sat quietly on the carousel. 
    Approximately five minutes thereafter, he arrested them. 
    He took them to the Bethesda police station and, there, he swore out a warrant. 
    He filed an application for a warrant and the Justice of the Peace issued the warrant and charged them under 27 Maryland Code, Section 577, for wanton trespass.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="209.068" stopTime="215.388">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Wasn't there an intervening episode? Before he arrested them, he consulted with the park owners --
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="215.388" stopTime="216.133">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="216.133" stopTime="217.331">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- on the warrant of arrest?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="217.331" stopTime="272.673">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. 
    Now, at -- and I was just exactly at that point. 
    At the trial, there was testimony of all three, of Lieutenant Collins that he had instructions from the first to arrest if Negroes came on for trespass, that he had instructions, that those instructions came from the owner, Mr. Baker, that he also had the same instructions from the manager, but it is correct that he went to the manager and said “these five Negroes are on there. 
    What shall I do?” 
    And, he said “arrest them.” 
    That is correct, but all three - Collins, Baker, and Warren Hoff, the manager, testified it was the policy to keep them off solely because they were Negroes and the arrest was to be made by Lieutenant Collins solely where it -- because they were Negroes and Lieutenant Collins made the arrest solely because --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="272.673" stopTime="275.630">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You call him Lieutenant Collins. 
    What was he a lieutenant in?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="275.630" stopTime="288.742">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    He was -- that was the title assigned to him as head of the police force of the Glen Echo Park. 
    I think it's someone like a Kentucky Colonel, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="288.742" stopTime="297.026">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Rauh, do you consider any significance that when he swore to the complaint, he swore to it as a deputy sheriff or --
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="297.026" stopTime="323.825">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    I think it evidences the whole picture. 
    He wore the badge of the deputy sheriff. 
    He went to the police station and made an application as a deputy sheriff. 
    And then the warrant itself says that it was sworn out by the deputy sheriff. 
    In other words, there was a continuous -- as I will come to in my argument, there is a continuous confluence of private and public authority in this case. 
    The --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="323.825" stopTime="329.842">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    You concede though that he was acting out instructions of the management.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="329.842" stopTime="407.859">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, at the trial, as I say, the -- it was very simple and the federal points were all raised. 
    There's no question about that. 
    The five young Negroes were convicted and fined of trespass. 
    The Court of Appeals of Maryland upheld the convictions on the ground that the discrimination by the state, if such there was, was one step removed, that the action here was one step removed from state enforcement of a policy of segregation. 
    Now, if Your Honors please, we have two separate arguments which we make in support of our position that these convictions must be reversed under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    First, there was active state support of private discrimination forbidden by this Court. 
    And, second, and the other half, the first argument assumes a private right to discriminate but we say, under the first argument, private right to discriminate, though there maybe, the state may not give its active support to that private right to discriminate. 
    And, secondly --
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="407.859" stopTime="412.407">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Mr. Rauh, though there maybe or though there is.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="412.407" stopTime="471.202">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    My secondly was going to answer that, if Your Honor please. 
    And, secondly, though there is no private right to discriminate, in other words, we contend, Your Honor, so that obviously my first answer is “though there maybe” would have been a better way to say the first point. 
    We say that though there may be a private right to discriminate, there is no right in the state to give active support to that discrimination. 
    But, second, we challenge under the rule of law in this country, under the Fourteenth Amendment, that a state can create or recognize a private right of discrimination. 
    It will not be necessary, in my judgment, for the Court to reach the second point, because I believe and submit that the first point, which I'd like to develop now, is so complete and total and clear under the precedents of this Court. 
    Nevertheless --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="471.202" stopTime="477.333">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just so I can get your second point. 
    When you talk about discrimination, are you limiting it to racial discrimination?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="477.333" stopTime="481.270">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I should have made that clear. 
    I --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="481.270" stopTime="483.948">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're not talking about a person's right to be discriminating.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="483.948" stopTime="497.706">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    No, I am saying that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, no state may create or recognize, this is the second point we -- I -- as I say again I want to be clear that I don't think this Court will ever reach this point --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="497.706" stopTime="498.061">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I understand.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="498.061" stopTime="512.974">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    -- in this case, but that I believe, and I think it illuminates the first point and shows its simplicity that no state may create or recognize a private right of racial discrimination.

speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="524.716" stopTime="550.006">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    It seems to me that the Solicitor General has argued the vagueness point in great depth. 
    I think it would be correct except for one thing. 
    It was not raised by us below and I feel the most I could do is refer to it as background in a footnote, which we do on page 27 of our brief, that I do, in all canter, have to report to the Court this matter was not raised below.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="550.006" stopTime="558.141">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    The part of your argument, part of your brief, the second page of your argument in which it overrules the rights maybe.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="558.141" stopTime="587.144">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    I don't believe that will be necessary, if Your Honor please, but if that -- if the Court determined that were necessary, I think the Court made an assumption in the civil rights cases, which I'll come to, which require -- which do not require its overruling but, as I say, I don't think we're going to get there because I think I can persuade Your Honors, if I maybe so immodest, Mr. Justice that the first point is clear and, as I might say, rather an a fortiori case under the previous decision. 
    Now, look at this situation --
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="587.144" stopTime="601.507">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Hold on. 
    Before you do that, on either point that were mentioned, you refer both on reporting to them. 
    Are we, therefore, to distinguish a fortiori in the Thirteenth Amendment of the indictment?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="601.507" stopTime="741.737">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    I could have, Your Honor, but it seemed to me that the same considerations that the Fifteenth Amendment would bring are fully encompassed. 
    The badge of humiliation, discrimination in a public accommodation is a badge of humiliation and inferiority. 
    Clearly, as such, it's a leftover part of slavery and clearly, as such, I could have raised it under the Thirteenth Amendment. 
    I think that badge of inferiority and humiliation, which this discrimination refers, is also invalidated by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now, if Your Honors please, this is a simple case under the decided precedents of this Court. 
    No more, we say, may the State of Maryland bring a judicial trespass action against one who seeks service at a public accommodation than the State of Missouri in Shelley and Kraemer could bring a judicial ejectment action to remove the Negro from the land. 
    We suggest that this is a far stronger case than Shelley against Kraemer, for here, the criminal law of the state is being brought down upon a man seeking service and, here, it is not as in Shelley and Kraemer where the court simply were open to the man. 
    Furthermore, the right in Shelley and Kraemer was a higher right than the right here. 
    The right in Shelley and Kraemer, which this Court overruled, which this Court refused to honor, was the right -- the contract right of a man to choose his neighbors. 
    And, I most respectfully suggest that the overwriting of that contractual property right to choose one's neighbor in Shelley and Kraemer makes it easy and simple and less far-out-too-over to say that an owner of a store may not refuse a sandwich to a person. 
    I suggest to Your Honors that there is a great deal or higher right in the covenant that was overruled and invalidated in Shelley and Kraemer that could not be enforced in Shelley and Kraemer than the right we have here.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="741.737" stopTime="767.555">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Rauh, isn't it accurate to say that what was vindicated in Shelley against Kraemer was the right of the owner of property to alienate it, deal with it as he wished in defiance of a racially restrictive covenant and what is involved here on the part of your opponent, as it is asserted, is the right of the owner of property to deal with it if he wishes?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="767.555" stopTime="834.101">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    I think that is a correct statement, Your Honor, but it just needs to go one step further and look at the right of the man who had a contract right not to have a Negro next to him. 
    That contract right not to have the neighbor was said by this Court to be unenforceable, and I certainly would suggest to Your Honor that it is a greater right to have your neighbors those you want and to have your customers those you want, because they're saying to the public "thousands of you people come to Glen Echo and ri-- and take part in our rides but no Negroes." 
    And, I would respectfully suggest that Mr. Baker, the owner who makes this decision, to him, I can't believe who rides on his merry-go-round to be as high a right as to Mr. Baker's neighbors. 
    And as Your Honor said you could not enforce Mr. Baker's property right to his neighbors and I suggest you -- that the same point, and only more so, as you cannot enforce a property right, if there is one because this is my first half of the argument and I'm assuming that you're right, if there is one, it cannot be enforced here.

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Well, the ejector was the neighbor who had a contractual covenant with the man who sold the property to the Negro that the man wouldn't sell it. 
    He had a perfectly good covenant wer -- writing with the land, a perfectly good contract property interest, which this Court said may not be enforced because the Fourteenth Amendment won't allow the courts to do this and, by the same token, the Fourteenth Amendment will no more allow the criminal trespass action than a criminal ejectment action.

    Against the buyer.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="885.960" stopTime="948.974">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Now, that would be clear just from the conviction. 
    But, here, you have more. 
    Here, you have, from the minute this thing starts to the end, a-- just a confluence of public and private authority. 
    This sheriff was the day-to-day discriminator. 
    The sheriff was on the land. 
    He had the job of controlling the discrimination. 
    There never would have been a crime if it wasn't for this sheriff. 
    This sheriff said "get off the land." 
    It was only a crime after the sheriff had told them to get off the land. 
    It wasn't a crime before. 
    There is no suggestion it was a crime walking on. 
    The suggestion and the ruling of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is it's a crime not to get off and, when they don't-- and who made that crime? 
    The orders came from a sheriff of the State of Maryland. 
    Then, he goes, as I was questioned on this, then he goes to the police station. 
    He applies as a police officer, then, the warrant comes on application of a police officer.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="948.974" stopTime="954.124">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    But it was amended. 
    The warrant was subsequently amended.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="954.124" stopTime="969.731">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Oh, it was amended on the question of whether he was the agent of the owner. 
    They didn't have a crime the way they did it first because they said that he was sworn out by the deputy sheriff and then they had to say he was sworn out by the agent.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="969.731" stopTime="971.643">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Nothing could show, if Your Honor please, the mixture. 
    They had mixture of public and private authority better than they had to fix up their warrant to show he was the-- that the sheriff was an agent of the private authority here to do it.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="985.211" stopTime="986.874">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    He were -- if I may, if you'll excuse the expression, I think M-- Lieutenant Collins was a double agent. 
    He was an agent of the state as a sheriff and he was an agent of the private person to handle their discrimination. 
    It just seems to me that this case is clear on Shelley but it's clear on two other cases of this Court. 
    It's clear on Burton. 
    I don't think the State of Maryland can lease its badge anymore than the State of Delaware could lease its property for discriminatory purposes.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Do you have a right under Maryland law that you have to carry the badge, the sheriff badge, to make this arrest.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="1029.335" stopTime="1033.901">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    The Court of Appeals of Maryland said so and --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1033.901" stopTime="1035.334">

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    I would think so, Your Honor. 
    But it's not only Burton. 
    It's Lombard, even as late as this very year. 
    Lombard, the police said "we promise to deal with the sit-iners." 
    Well, here, there wasn't even a promise. 
    There was actual police dealing with the sit-iners. 
    So, just to conclude this point, it does seem to me that it's, as Justice Douglas put it that you couldn't license a man to serve Whites only. 
    Well, that's what the State of Maryland, in effect, is doing. 
    They're licensing and then they're making it possible through convictions, through sheriffs, to serve Whites only. 
    The obvious fact that you couldn't license a man to serve Whites only is really applicable here when, in fact, you license the man to serve the public and then you make it possible for him to serve Whites only. 
    Well, I-- as I say, I don't think we'd come to the second point but I do think it illuminates the problem and it is because of its illumination that I would so much like to dwell on it before--

speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="1134.945" stopTime="1239.627">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    There is a difference, Your Honor, but I respectfully suggest the difference is in my favor, because, as you put it, you overlook or -- I don't mean you overlooked, and in that sense, I meant that it excludes the important fact in Shelley and Kraemer of the property right, which has always been enforced. 
    There's no question that if this property right were in any other fashion, it would be enforced. 
    I don't see what the willing buyer and the willing seller make any difference when you got an unwilling man with a property right that would always be enforced in our country that's never been challenged. 
    It can only be challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment and you overruled that property right not to have your neighbor. 
    And I respectfully suggest that it's a lot less to override the property right not to have customers than to override the property right not to have neighbors. 
    Now, if you want to say to me it's different, I would concede it was different. 
    Only, I would only contest that it's different in my favor, and I would respectfully suggest that there has been a lot of talk in the articles and so forth that there's something-- that there is some question about Shelley and Kraemer. 
    Well, as far as I know, and I think I have read all the relevant decisions of this Court, every time Shelley and Kraemer has been mentioned, it has been mentioned with a probation in the decisions of this Court, and there is no way to reach a result different than a reversal here without, in fact, questioning the result in Shelley and Kraemer. 
    Now, if Your Honors please, I would like to come to the second point. I do most seriously challenge that there is any private right to discriminate at a place of public accommodation.

    That's the reason I asked you upon what specific constitutional provision--

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    The Fourteenth--
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1385.821" stopTime="1390.749">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- you rested for those distinctions. 
    Only, they did not come from the heavens but from the constitution.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="1390.749" stopTime="1513.776">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    The Fourteenth Amendment, but the law of the state cannot, under the Fourteenth Amendment, create or recognize a right of discrimination -- of racial discrimination, because it is the state then that is setting up this property right. 
    That's the state action as the state, whether it's by common law or statutory law, the state is creating and recognizing a right of discrimination and it's-- if the-- it seems to me that the words “may not deny protection, equal protection,” that the states may not deny it, by such, they may not create a property right to discriminate against Negroes. 
    Now, if I would-- I want to bring this back to Shelley and Kraemer. 
    If Shelley and Kraemer is correct both on its reasoning and its result, our case must be reversed on both. 
    In other words, if Shelley and Kraemer-- where that was an assumed private right to discriminate which could not be enforced in the courts, then you can assume a private right to discriminate here which cannot be enforced in the court. 
    But, I respectfully suggest there's a better view of Shelley and Kraemer. 
    There is a view of Shelley and Kraemer that there was no private right to discriminate, that the state had no right to create or recognize a restrictive covenant against allowing Negroes into the neighborhood. 
    In other words, that some of the criticism of Shelley and Kraemer, namely that that created a right, that there was a private right which couldn't be enforced, I most respectfully suggest that a better rationalization of Shelley and Kraemer might now be that the state couldn't create or recognize a restrictive covenant.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1513.776" stopTime="1517.075">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, it didn't-- the state didn't create the covenant. 
    The parties did.
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="1517.075" stopTime="1581.372">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    But the state created the substantive-- the common or statutory law which made that a right, and I'm respectfully suggesting that state action-- that it is state action when the state, either by its common law or its statutory law, either creates or recognizes the validity of that restrictive covenant. 
    And I am suggesting that whichever way you now look at Shelley and Kraemer, unless you're prepared to overrule Shelley and Kraemer, today, you want to look at it that its reasoning was correct that there was a right of discrimination but it couldn't be enforced, this applies here. 
    But, I am suggesting that there is a better part, that there is another and likely better view of Shelley and Kraemer that there wasn't any right in the first place, because the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the state in its action to create or recognize that restrictive covenant as valid even between the parties.

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. I suggest that the right there that the state cannot recognize is the right to refuse to deal with people solely because of their color. 
    And I'm suggesting that the state may not either create or recognize that right and that, basically, Shelley and Kraemer makes more logic under such an interpretation than it does under the more customary interpretation.

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    You have some of these points, but I don't have the church today. 
    I don't have the home. 
    I have the biggest place of public accommodation probably in this whole big metropolitan area where thousands of people are attracted daily and, of course, that supports the size and the place and the licensing and the regulation and the support of this place by the Government all adds to it and, as Mr. Justice Douglas made clear his position on a restaurant in a concurring opinion, that are licensed restaurant, here, you have 1,000 times licensed place. 
    It's licensed in every respect, regulated in every respect, supported in many respects. 
    In other words, their state involvement here, in addition to recognizing and creating this right-- this alleged right of discrimination, I see my light is on.

    Again, I'm fortunate that I haven't brought-- I'm not here with that case, but the logic, I would say-- I would say that there is no necessary reason for saying that that is the same case as raised, because the point I would like to make clear is this Court's nontolerance of any racial classification. 
    This Court has upheld classification after classification, but there has just been one classification that's been inept to this Court and, as the Strauder case has said it more eloquently than I can, there, the situation simply was we will not recognize classifications based on color.

    As this Court made clear in Erie and-- against Tompkins, law doesn't come out of the air.

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    If Your Honor-- I most respectfully suggest, I find state action in creating law which recognizes discrimination as much as any other type of state action. 
    I didn't-- I was not trying to make a roundabout way of saying state action isn't required because this -- the Fourteenth Amendment does say “no state shall” and I wouldn't want to be put in a position of say-- of trying to say those words were in there. 
    What I do say is that state action can be found in the creation or recognition of a private right of discrimin-- of racial discrimination because that right would not exist but for the action of the state in the adoption of its common law or statutory law.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1957.348" stopTime="1973.998">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Rauh, just please sit down and, confining ourselves to your-- this-- your second argument. 
    I am correct, am I not, in my understanding that great many states have statutes forbidding racial discrimination in places such as Glen Echo?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="1973.998" stopTime="1974.838">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    30, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1974.838" stopTime="1979.680">

    30. 
    Now, under your second argument, all those statutes are entirely redundant, aren't they?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="1979.680" stopTime="2039.675">
    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    That-- it wouldn't quite be true. 
    Statutes do more than recognized rights. 
    They carry-- they have methods of implementation. 
    For example, most of these statutes you can get damages under, they're in-- provide for injunctions by the attorney general of the state. 
    You might've asked me whether I thought the same. 
    It was unnecessary to pass upon the accommodation statute in Congress today because the same question would arise. 
    My answer is it wouldn't be necessary to declare the right because the right would be there but, certainly, the administration of that right, it would be well to have it spelled out, how you administer it, who's going to bring the suits, whether it's for damages, whether it's criminal, all of these other things can be spelled out by statute. 
    I'd say those statutes are all quite necessary even if this Court were to adopt the second climb of argument which, I have tried to make it clear, is not necessary because there is so much state action in the first line.

    May I ask you one question about Maryland law. 
    May I ask you one question about Maryland law? 
    Most of the states provide that when a trespasser is on a man's property, the owner of the property can use such force as maybe necessary to eject him. 
    Is that the law of Maryland?
speaker="joseph_l_rauh_jr" startTime="2119.481" stopTime="2120.969">

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And suppose that the owner had ordered these people off and he had said if -- he assaulted them and maybe done something pretty bad. 
    In many cases, most of us are familiar with, assault has been pretty serious. 
    The defense has been “well, he was on my property and wouldn't get off.” 
    Could that Maryland law be unconstitutional in this case, if the owner had assaulted him and been tried for the assault or could the court have charged the jury, he had a right to use such force as necessary even to put him up-- putting him off by taking his life, if necessary to protect his property? 
    Would that be unconstitutional under your argument?

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor, and I think, even under the first argument, the courts may not recognize the right of -- the private right of discrimination, as in Shelley and Kraemer, the Court was not allowed to recognize the private right of discrimination. 
    And, under Barrows, your case is really closer, if I may suggest, to Barrows than it is to Shelley against Kramer because, in Barrows, they said that -- this Court said that the courts of the state could not give damages, couldn't recognize this right to discriminate for damages that I am suggesting, they couldn't recognize it as a defense to a suit for assault and battery. 
    But, I would like to make this one other point about the self-help, if I might, Mr. Justice Black, and that's that there hasn't been self-help. 
    What has kept segregation alive in America today has been the state enforcement of private discrimination.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you if you see no difference between a-- you've said several times, about Shelley and Kraemer, that this-- I don't think this point has been discussed. 
    Do you see no difference between allowing a man to make a contract which, in perpetuity, ties up the property of everybody so that those who buy it and pay for it cannot sell it and the right of a man to exercise ownership over his home or his property at an exact time when he's claiming to a right that's being invaded?

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    I see-- make two suggestions to Your Honor. 
    In first place, Shelley and Kraemer is not a perpetuity right. 
    I think it's a very limited number of years--

    For which they-- they limit the property, but secondly, I would say that the law has always recognized that property right of the man to join with his neighbors, not to allow people to come in he didn't like, and that right was only thrown out for one reason, the Fourteenth Amendment said that the states cannot enforce that right. 
    And, I'm suggesting here in the second point that not-- that a better way to say it than that the states can't enforce an existing right is that the states can't create or recognize that right. 
    But, whichever way you put it, it seems to me, to distinguish Shelley and Kraemer from the sit-in cases is, in effect, to say that Shelley and Kraemer no longer exists beyond the--

   Argument of Robert C. Murphy

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Murphy.
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="2682.968" stopTime="2789.594">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    May it please the Court. 
    The trespass convictions in this case are firmly anchored to the proposition of a private business which operates in a facility which is purely private, such as the amusement park we have in this case, may, notwithstanding the fact that it requires a license from the state in order to operate, may nevertheless exclude arbitrarily from the premises such-- its customers or invitees, that-- and they do so, if it chooses, on no more rational or concrete basis than race, which was done in this case. 
    We certainly concede that the petitioners in this case were excluded from Glen Echo Park at that time because they were Negroes. 
    We believe, Your Honors, that the cases in both the state and the lower federal courts uniformly, without exception, support the proposition to which I have just referred here. 
    And we would submit that this Court has recognized and perhaps implicitly, if not expressly, recognized the validity of the proposition in such cases as Terminal Taxicab, Boynton versus Virginia, and Wilmington Parking Authority, all, of course cited in the State's brief. 
    And, to argue, as petitioners do hear this morning, that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the state affirmatively to prevent such discrimination, as was present in this case, is really to ignore approximately 100 years of consistent constitutional interpretation of the amendment as being solely prohibitive in character upon the states.

    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    In Marsh against Alabama, the state action, there, you-- as Your Honor knows, having been the author of the opinion, they were dealing with a municipality and the state action in that case was in totally circumscribing First Amendment rights, not attempting to control them but just saying “no one can speak on my property under the guides of it being personal or private property,” of course, it was not. 
    It was a wholly-owned town of a -- of a private corporation but, because of its features of course, was treated as any other municipality.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean that the state had permitted a group there to run the state as part of the common public affairs of the state.

    We would emphasize Your Honors that this Court has always interpreted the amendment, I say “always” now somewhat qualified, as being a limitation upon the exercise of power by a state at the risk of being somewhat trite. 
    I'd like to repeat very briefly some of the Court's own statements construing the amendment as “directing no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful. 
    The amendment is not a guarantee against the commission of individual offenses. 
    It does not add anything to the rights of one citizen as against another. 
    That individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject matter of the amendment.” 
    In short, this Court has said, and I think very recently, in either Peterson or Greenville, restated the fact that the action inhibited by the amendment was only such action as made fairly be said to be that of the states.

    We've attempted to distinguish Shelley versus Kraemer on the ground that, in Shelley, we're dealing with constitutionally protected rights, and in the present case, you're not. 
    There is no constitutionally protected right to enter property of-- a private property of another contrary to the will of that owner. 
    Now, that perhaps is the most basic distinction we can find. 
    I believe there are others. 
    Alienation on the-- on a fee would be one, as been mentioned here by the Court. 
    There are others, but in the factual situation that we have, this appears to me to be most direct and a basis upon which Shelley could be distinguished from the factual situation in the present case. 
    I might also add that in for-- in enforcing the-- a non-discriminatory type of trespass statute as was done in the instant case, that the state is simply recognizing the need in an ordered society that private choice, if it's to exist, depends upon the support of sovereign sanctions. 
    This is a neutral enforcement. 
    It doesn't induce others to discriminate. 
    It also I would feel affords the possibility. 
    And, I say possibility rather than likely fact of force and violence initiated by the owner.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Are you going to answer the argument to the effect that your statute neither made crime nor did you charge the crime to be that this person stayed on the premises of another after he was ordered to get away?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="3537.407" stopTime="3645.863">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Mr. Justice Black, we've reserved 15 minutes to answer the Solicitor General on that point. 
    Getting to the crux of the problem, as it has been pointed out, is simply to ascertain whether there has been state action of a particular character which is-- involves the state with the discriminatory policy of the park. 
    In this connection, we would point out that the-- I don't think it's seriously contended or argued that the discrimination in the park or by the park was either caused or induced or dictated or in any way mandated by any state law, any local law, any local policy, any custom, or any executive proclamation, such as we had in Lombard. 
    There is no state property and there is no state funds involved in the operation of the amusement park. 
    It had no interest in, absolutely no control over the park management, no interest or no control over the management of the private detective agency, by which Officer Collins was employed. 
    I think the only possible state involvement in the discriminatory policy of the court is to be found in the engagement of Collins. 
    He was somewhat of a unique individual occupying two roles. 
    Certainly, we must concede that he was a special deputy sheriff appointed under the statute that is peculiar to Montgomery County, cited in our brief. 
    We also must concede that he was wearing his special deputy sheriff's badge at the time of the-- of the taking into custody of the petitioners in this case, and that he also completed an application for a warrant which indicated that he was supplying, therefore, in an official capacity.

    He was par-- he was paid by the detective agency which, of course, is an independent contractor. 
    There might be a point of distinction here also of some significance in the usual situation such as you have before the Court in the National Labor Relations Board versus Jones and Laughlin Steel Company. 
    When a large corporation has police officers on its payroll, it generally gets a commission directly from the state. 
    Private detective agencies, being independent contractors, under our law, cannot enjoy a commission directed from the state. 
    These people, particularly Collins in this case, did enjoy his special deputy sheriff's commission by virtue of the statute.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Pardon me. 
    I thought you suggested earlier this arrest was not authorized except by virtue of his being a deputy sheriff, Collins with the state power to arrest.
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4141.895" stopTime="4163.705">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    No, I think, as an agent, Mr. Justice Brennan, of the owner in this situation, he could've arrested, not in a capacity as a police officer but as an agent of the private owner. 
    In other words, the private owner himself could've arrested in this situation. 
    And, as the agent of the owner, acting in non-state capacity, he could've done the same thing.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Murphy, you said also that the reason the man was deputized was to give him some police power?

    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    I suggest that, Your Honor. 
    I do not know but I think, undoubtedly, and as much as we represent--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4178.697" stopTime="4186.109">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What powers-- what powers did they want the man to have as a-- as a deputy that the owner didn't have himself?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4186.109" stopTime="4186.406">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Well, I would think--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4186.406" stopTime="4194.807">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You say, the owner could've arrested in any event. 
    So, what powers did they want the man to have that the owner wouldn't have had?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4194.807" stopTime="4223.339">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    I would think all the powers of a conservatory of the peace which include the power of arrest on and off the premises. 
    Actually, his authority was limited to the premises of Glen Echo Amusement Park but I think, basically, the-- it's assumed by all, including the Government and the petitioners, that Mr. Collins was deputized at the instance of the park. 
    There is nothing in the record to show in whose instance he was deputized at.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4223.339" stopTime="4235.538">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I assume then from what you say that there was something that they wanted him to deputize for. 
    You have, on the property, some man with some powers that the owner wouldn't have himself.
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4235.538" stopTime="4236.686">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Probably. 
    It may have --

    Probably.
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4237.591" stopTime="4238.308">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    It may well have been--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4238.308" stopTime="4242.174">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the state was willing to put that sort of a person on the property?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4242.174" stopTime="4249.243">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Well, that, I don't think is a proper characterization. 
    Until we know at whose instance he was deputized, he could have been deputized for the--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4249.243" stopTime="4252.386">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but the fact remains that he was deputized.
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4252.386" stopTime="4253.027">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    He was deputized.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4253.027" stopTime="4261.399">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And, he wa-- and, if a police officer has some powers that an owner wouldn't have himself, he had it. 
    He has those powers.
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4261.399" stopTime="4262.571">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    He had all the powers.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4262.571" stopTime="4265.240">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And he had them by virtue of the state having deputized him?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4265.240" stopTime="4330.735">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Yes. 
    We would say, additionally, even if he was acting as a state officer, that he did really nothing any different in any other state officer would've done when called at the scene. 
    He simply arrested under these circumstances. 
    There are many cases upholding convictions on this basis, but I think he had a duty if he was acting in a state capacity at the time that he accosted the petitioners on the carousel, and they were violating a law. 
    As a state officer, a misdemeanor being committed in his presence, he may have had a duty to arrest. 
    The Government seems to suggest that a police officer should be some sort of a mediator, but I would submit that that's basically something for the magistrate and not for a police officer. 
    And, there's as-- and there is certainly nothing in the record to suggest that Officer Collins, if he was acting in a state capacity, did not himself stop and think “should I or should I not arrest these people” and then decide on the-- on the affirmative course of arresting.

    Does he clearly know (Inaudible) making the arrest in seeing the action here?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4337.895" stopTime="4347.128">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Our courts-- our courts have held, Mr. Justice Douglas, that when a police officer sees a misdemeanor committed in his presence, he has a duty to arrest.

    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    No, sir, only when he knows that a misdemeanor is committed and he sees it.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4370.724" stopTime="4372.770">

    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Yes, sir. 
    He was employed in April initially. 
    This incident occurred in June.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4377.683" stopTime="4385.444">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Before he discussed it with the owner, he told the people to leave in five minutes, is that right? 
    Is that the chronology?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4385.444" stopTime="4390.648">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    The owner told the officer that if they didn't leave in five minutes, he was to arrest them.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4390.648" stopTime="4393.755">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    When did the officer approach the owner?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4393.755" stopTime="4426.842">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Well, at the time they were on the carousel for the first time, the officer went to the owner again, as it's suggested in the record, that everyone knew that this was going to happen all day long that there had been a rumor-- persistent rumor that there was going to be some difficulty at the park that night. 
    So, they anticipated that these petitioners would arrive. 
    But to answer specifically your question, the affirmative evidence in the record shows that when they were on the carousel, seated there, Officer Collins then went to the park management and asked them what he should do.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4426.842" stopTime="4431.251">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    That's before the officer approached to these petitioners?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4431.251" stopTime="4446.008">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    My recollection is he approached them initially and then when they declined to leave, he went to the park manager, park management and asked them what his instruction should be, which was-- perhaps suggest that he acted precisely in doing what he did.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4446.008" stopTime="4448.781">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    And then he returned and told them to leave in five minutes?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4448.781" stopTime="4449.980">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4449.980" stopTime="4451.823">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Which was the instruction of the owner.
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4451.823" stopTime="4475.111">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Instruction of the owner. 
    Of course the State of Maryland does not seek here to justify the private discrimination, nor do we appear here to approve it. 
    But, under the existing law, as we see it, these crimes-- these convictions were not unconstitutionally secured and we would, therefore, respectfully submit that they should be affirmed.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4475.111" stopTime="4487.631">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But, do you believe, Mr. Murphy, that the state has the right to put its police officers in every or any place of business for the purpose of enforcing segregation?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4487.631" stopTime="4488.664">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    No, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4488.664" stopTime="4490.277">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, then, aren't you faced with that problem here?
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4490.277" stopTime="4538.074">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    I think I am. 
    I can't, in this-- under this record, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, I can't draw up a picture of this individual. 
    Any collusion between the sheriff, the appointing authority, and the Park to place this individual-- to deputize him and place him in the gate to prevent these individuals from coming in. 
    The fact that he was a special deputy sheriff in this case, I think, is a happenstance. 
    I don't think he was placed there to enforce or to better effectuate the park's discriminatory policy. 
    So, I don't think that there's any collusive action. 
    Certainly, Officer Collins, himself, his presence at the park did not coerce the park management into discriminating. 
    Because he was there, he's not responsible for the park's discriminatory policy.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4538.074" stopTime="4555.975">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Certainly, the sheriff knew of these difficulties that were going on at the park for a long time. 
    Everybody else knew it. 
    It was in the press, wasn't it, so far as to this? 
    So, he must have known that this deputy sheriff was in there enforcing a power.
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="4555.975" stopTime="4558.549">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    He's a special deputy sheriff. 
    He's not a deputy sheriff.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I know, but he's--

    He's a special deputy sheriff.

    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Well, this particular Act under which he was commissioned, Your Honor, went to effect in 1939. 
    It wasn't something that was placed into effect at or about the time of these demonstrations with the sole purpose of employing someone in the Collins' capacity.

    Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. 
    I believe my colleagues pointed out that Mr. Justice Harlan asked me whether my second point would require the overruling of the civil rights cases. 
    The answer in our judgment is that it does not require the overruling of the civil right cases because the assumption was made at that time that the states would deal with this problem. 
    This is briefed at page 29 of the brief.
