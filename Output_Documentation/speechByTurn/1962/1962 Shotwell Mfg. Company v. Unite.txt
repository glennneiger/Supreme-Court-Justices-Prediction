Shotwell Mfg. Company v. United States
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="8.276">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Shotwell Manufacturing Company, et al., Petitioners, versus United States. 
    Mr. Oberdorfer.
speaker="louis_f_oberdorfer" startTime="8.276" stopTime="356.404">
    Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I want to discuss in the remaining time available to the Government the defendant's contention that the individual defendants have been compelled to be witnesses against themselves in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. 
    And that the so-called voluntary disclosure that was made in this -- at the administrative stage in this case should not have been admitted in evidence during the trial. 
    The voluntary disclosure policy of the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasure Department prevailed for a period in the 1940s until 1952. 
    That policy was a corollary of our self-assessment federal tax system. 
    That system assumes that when -- that the individuals assess themselves that they -- when they make out of tax return, they write down on the return the true facts of their liability, their income, and their deductions, and they file it. 
    And it is from this that their civil liability is established. 
    The voluntary disclosure policy in the period that we're discussing developed, as I say, is a corollary of that self-assessment system. 
    It was understood by the then tax authorities that during World War II because manpower -- enforcement manpower were short because of the temptations of war time business and a lot of other things, that people may not and many people may not have met their tax -- their civil tax obligations on the return date. 
    And the voluntary disclosure policy was adopted not to empty the jails and not to forgive people for crime, but to collect the taxes that might have been missed in those circumstances. 
    And the policy was essentially very simple. 
    A person who had omitted income or understated his taxable income was told in a general statement that if before an investigation had been begun of his tax return, particular year, he came in and made a voluntary disclosure which presumed in its context and I -- we say in its text, that the taxpayer told all the facts were necessary to establish his civil liability and cooperated in the settlement of it that he would, having paid the civil liability and his civil penalties that mightily do, other government would not prosecute him for the crime of tax evasion. 
    In this case, we have -- so far as this voluntary disclosure is concerned, the question A of whether the disclosure was timely, that is whether it was made before an investigation had begun. 
    And secondly, whether the other terms of the policy were met namely that the taxpayer cooperated with the authorities in achieving what was the basic objective of the policy namely; the establishment and payment of a civil liability. 
    In the posture of the case now, we do not contend that the so-called statement was untimely. 
    We acquiesce in Judge Norbye's finding that the disclosure occurred before an investigation had begun. 
    We do contend, and this is one of the areas, it's already been discussed on the facts that not only did these defendants fail to cooperate in the determination of their civil liability. 
    They didn't just sit silent and wait to be pursued which might be a questionable case. 
    They affirmatively and overtly attempted to deceive the authorities as to their civil liability acting under the smoke screen of their so-called voluntary disclosure. 
    The courts have had, the lower courts have already had cases involving the question of whether a so-called voluntary disclosure made after an investigation had begun, was admissible in evidence. 
    And the Second Circuit among others has held that an untimely disclosure that is one begun after an investigation, one made after an investigation has begun is not admissible. 
    And as a matter of fact, the -- these cases include cases where the taxpayer was ignorant of the fact that the investigation had begun. 
    (Inaudible) and the lower courts have nevertheless held that such disclosures are admissible in evidence because the terms of the voluntary disclosure policy which are fairly clear were not met. 
    And as --

    Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer 
    Mr. Justice Goldberg, there are some additional remarks in that particular speech which I'll just quote. 
    “In excusing the man from criminal prosecution, we are merely taking a sensible step to produce the revenue called for by law with the minimum cost of investigation. 
    The man who makes a voluntary disclosure saves us a lot of money in investigating. 
    In return, we can spare him a turn in jail. 
    This is your business from his standpoint and it is good business from the Government's standpoint. 
    That's as far as once your statement itself is concerned. 
    In addition, this statement of Secretary Schneider on May 25, 1947, which was subsequent to Mr. Wancho's statement which was before the so-called voluntary disclosure in this case and which is perhaps more authoritative than Mr. Wancho said having described the voluntary disclosure policy, “This presumes of course, that the recipient taxpayer cooperates with agents of the Bureau in determining the true tax liability”.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="483.394" stopTime="498.386">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Are there any series involving the (Inaudible)?
speaker="louis_f_oberdorfer" startTime="498.386" stopTime="716.439">
    Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer 
    We have to concede, Mr. Justice, that there was never a ruling or a regulation having the formality and the precision of the (Inaudible) state, that certainly true. 
    But the whole context of the policy, we believe, puts -- put any taxpayer on notice that even if he -- if he, in this case for example, had come to the Treasury and said, “I know I've received some unreported income. 
    I'm not sure of what I did with it. 
    Or even, I don't care to tell you what I did with it.” 
    That would be one thing. 
    This is a case where the taxpayer said that he'd received some unreported income. 
    But then came in affirmatively and attempted to mislead by a series of actions, a series of statements, and by the finding of documents, a filing which almost has the dignity of the filing of an amended return. 
    And this series of representations, oral representations to Mr. Sauber, the filing of documents to Mr. Lima, and the evidence we have of an attempt to fix the case by a settlement which presumed that the fictitious expenditures had in fact been made. 
    All those things are not mere passive acquiescence. 
    Actually, they are acts. 
    They are steps in the commission of the crime that's charged here, namely the evasion of taxes from 1945 and 1946. 
    Mr. Justice Goldberg, you asked the other day about whether the filing of those statements was a crime and the answer that we gave at that time may have suggested merely that it was a separate crime punishable by a separate indictment. 
    But the fact is, under this -- particularly under this Court's decision in the Beacon Brass case of which is cited in our brief, this particular act or this series of acts are, as I say, steps in the commission of the crime that was tried here. 
    And you recall that taxpayer's counsel suggested that this indictment was brought on the eve of the exploration of the statute of limitations. 
    Under the Beacon Brass case, the statute of limitations began to run all over again when these taxpayers made these fraudulent representations which I say almost have the dignity of an amended return. 
    There is a question lurking here as to whether or not assuming as we do in this Judge Norbye found that these representations were fraudulent. 
    You recall it, Judge Norbye found in -- I quote his statement on page 1766 of the appendix. 
    The defendants made a dishonest, faults and fraudulent disclosure because such a disclosure did not conform to the true facts. 
    The so-called voluntary disclosure was concocted for the expressed purpose of misleading the tax official.

    The -- as I recall it, the defendants requested in their original motions to suppress that the matter be tried to the judge.

    Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer 
    Well, I will -- I'll address myself to that. 
    The -- in an income tax -- criminal income tax case, the Government does not have the burden of proving the exact amount of the gross income or deductions or taxable income that has been erroneously and fraudulently reported. 
    It's enough and if -- and this Court has held that, it's enough to have proof that there was a substantial amount relatively speaking. 
    Now Judge Norbye's finding about exaggeration on the part of the witness Lubben is followed by this if I may quote it and then I'll come back directly to your question, sir. 
    But the evidence is overwhelmingly clear and I'm quoting from page 1758 of the appendix.

    But also that the greater part of this so-called black money -- market money was appropriated by Cain, Huebner, and Sullivan for their own personal use. 
    So that what Judge Norbye found -- still, even though he suggested that perhaps this witness may have exaggerated and he didn't challenge his good faith in this respect. 
    He still found a substantial, a very gross amount of omitted income more than enough to have supported the original verdict of the jury if the evidence had been $300,000 or $400,000 rather than whatever it was at the trial.

    And your affidavits that were here, as I remember them, showed that you have the testimony that would prove that the defendants had committed perjury in asserting that they had started and had informed the Government on January 18th. 
    And as I understood it, Judge Norbye found that the affidavits that you submitted to us were not true, and that in all probability, the defendants were right in their testimony that they had brought this thing to the attention of the Government before the 21st of June. 
    And in all probability, it was on the 18th of January, as they said in the course of a train ride from Chicago to some other place.

    Graflund denying that the train ride had occurred. 
    Judge Norbye traces Graflund's thinking process on this.

    The thing that caused the Court to do what it did was the fact that you -- the Government made certain representations here that the result below on the suppression was arrived at because the defendants had engaged in perjury and fraud in connection with the testimony. 
    And you filed affidavits in support of that. 
    And the case went back. 
    And as I – as I have read the record, I haven't read it all, but as I've read it, Judge Norbye did not support you insofar as those affidavits were concerned. 
    He took the whole testimony that he had taken before at the motion on suppression, thrust these things and then he rationalized all of them and said as a package, it showed convincingly that fraud had been performed. 
    But what I want to know from you is what testimony you brought to this case as a result of those affidavits that were presented to this Court that caused him to change his mind or that caused him to find that conclusively that this was untimely --

    Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer 
    The particular things that I would point to are first of all the testimony of Huebner who was an employee who did not testify at the original trial. 
    And who, in the supplemental hearing, testified with precision that had not been available before as to the disbursement of this money to the individual defendants. 
    We also brought in as it was -- as we'd advised the Court at the time the case was here before, the testimony relating to the report that had been prepared by revenue Agent Lima which would have settled the case on the assumption that the fictitious expenditures had in fact been incurred.

    In the face of the evidence, number one, that it was procured by a promise of immunity, and number two, that all of the evidence said, "This is what we make out from Lubben's records, go ahead and assess on any basis you want." 
    Now they -- there has been some talk this morning of these workpapers and here they are, all stretched up. 
    Here's a reproduction of them.

    May I ask you, Mr. Christensen. 
    Do I understand all of four sheets were in evidence, is that it?

    Yes.
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3089.580" stopTime="3101.595">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    If you look them over carefully, you will see that the big sheets are the supporting sheets from which the so-called recapitulation, a little sheet is made up.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3101.595" stopTime="3103.056">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    On the first (Voice Overlap), yes.
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3103.056" stopTime="3285.669">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    Then you will see also that right across the top of it, they show what this accountant was doing, memo taken from Lubben record as compared with our records. 
    And they're turned over to the agent, make out of it what you can. 
    Here is what it shows. 
    Now, with respect to the cash account at the bottom, the disbursement section, there was some question about that the other day. 
    And in our brief, we say that Mr. Sauber never told us to render an account of the disbursements and I was taken a task of them. 
    And Mr. Howard and I do not read the record alike. 
    Mr. Howard says that Busby testified to that and that Cain testified to that and that Sullivan did. 
    I've had the benefit of the weekend. 
    I have reviewed that char -- testimony as carefully as I can. 
    Busby testified at Record 181 that the payouts for raw materials were not deductible, they were immaterial. 
    Mr. Cain testified to that general effect at 229, 232, 244, 252, 257, 262, 268, 274, and he testified that on the original 1952 suppression hearing before the Government puts Sauber on the stand. 
    Sauber never testi -- never contradicted that, but he said, “Well, get together, you people can't file an amended return. 
    You don't know what's going on. 
    Reconstruct an account as best as you can.” 
    He said, “Well, talk with everybody that knows about the over-ceiling receipts and disbursement. 
    And that and this I think is important. 
    I think Sauber was being perfectly alright, a little cute with our people. 
    He wanted to get these payouts, I assume if he could to lead on to people who might have received them the old informer trying to pull us along. 
    He said reconstruct the figures for an accurate tax return. 
    Now that, if it please the Court, gets us into one of the difficulties that clouds everyone's thinking and it's so easy to do it. 
    Mr. Sauber was speaking as of 1948. 
    And at that time, these payouts were utterly immaterial. 
    We could not take a deduction for him whether we paid them as constructive dividends for raw materials or anything else. 
    By the time of trial -- by the time of trial in 1952, the law had trade and if we could show we paid out what we took in we had no net income. 
    Now, there'd been talk about how much this exaggeration was. 
    Permit me to take the worst figures I can for my clients, the figures which I can backup from Judge Norbye's findings erroneous though we think some of them are.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="3285.669" stopTime="3298.850">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Mr. Christensen, may I ask you what do you (Inaudible)?
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3298.850" stopTime="3300.480">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    No difference. 
    No difference because --
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="3300.480" stopTime="3301.499">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    What?
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3301.499" stopTime="3373.469">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    -- you are talking -- you were talking solely of the return to corporation, the Shotwell Manufacturing Company. 
    It had to account for all of these as income, as gross income. 
    And until we claim a deduction for it which we couldn't claim in 1948 either as constructive dividends, couldn't take that as a deduction of course, nor as a payout for raw materials. 
    And what Judge Norbye has been saying for years and years and years when you disclose on behalf of a corporation, you've also got to tell if the corporation officers personally have been up to any hanky-panky. 
    He thinks they have. 
    We say it isn't so. 
    But it would not be material to Shotwell's tax return on the law as of the time of the 1948 disclosure. 
    Now as to the amount of the exaggeration, it was -- the Government claimed, it proved $454,000 by Lubben and his book which Government proof, not our proof, Government proof upon the remanded hearing showed had been doctored.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3373.469" stopTime="3403.484">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But tell me Mr. Christensen, wasn't the issue of Lubben's credibility before the jury in face of his testimony, whether from the books or (Inaudible) or both of $450,000, these papers constructing, reconstructing $368,000 and as I understand it, the testimony the defendants themselves that know -- was only a $150,000. 
    Now, did that confront the jury with an issue of Lubben's credibility.
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3403.484" stopTime="3467.325">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    Yes. 
    What it confronted it, it confronted it, Mr. Justice Brennan in this posture with the United State attorney standing up, not merely on the theoretical endorsement of the witness they're vouching for but striving in front of that jury saying, “I'll tell you, David Lubben is an honest citizen. 
    This is so. 
    And his books are correct.” 
    Now the Government proof on the remanded hearing shows that Lubben is a confirmed perjurer both Graflund and Huebner testified the instances, $145,000 payment, another sum, $50,000 of where Lubben lied. 
    This is Government evidence brought out by the Government. 
    And Government evidence out of the mouth of Huebner, that a Treasury employee, a fellow by the name of Tobias and one time worked for Lubben said, “Yes, I worked with Lubben doctoring up his books and charging items up to Shotwell they never had.”
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3467.325" stopTime="3471.081">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Was that evidence have been admissible to impeach Lubben's credibility --
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3471.081" stopTime="3471.350">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    It would sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3471.350" stopTime="3472.553">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- before the petit jury?
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3472.553" stopTime="3696.474">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    It would certainly would, and you were then faced with precisely what you are putting your finger on Mr. Justice Black, when you have admittedly false evidence, exaggerated evidence, not mistaken evidence. 
    Before a jury, can a judge say, “Well, I think the exaggeration wasn't enough that jury would have come in and found them guilty anyway.” 
    And we say there's nothing in the history of this Court that indicates that our right to jury trial can be violated that much. 
    In the Mesarosh case and the Communist Party case I think it was a contention was made. 
    Well, there's enough valid evidence in the record to support the finding of the Subversive Control Board. 
    This Court said, “That isn't -- they answered it. 
    Get that out of the record. 
    Get detained off and let the tribunal take a fresh look at it.” 
    Now, the -- there was a question in this process of the Graflund conversion to this new story in which the chronology was quite involved the other day. 
    If I might take a moment to give you that, Graflund testified as a Government witness on the original trial, he was asked, nothing particularly relevant to the disclosure although he had been thoroughly interviewed. 
    And the notes that were brought out in the remanded hearing showed that. 
    When the reinvestigation started, he was interviewed by the Treasury on November 8, 1955. 
    He didn't tell the story about this of being true. 
    On May 10, 1956, the prosecutors who had a grand jury working interviewed him at great length. 
    On August 28, 29, and 30, 1956, he was before the grand jury and he said, “I revealed all of these to Busby on a train in January. 
    I told them all about it. 
    That's the starting place of the disclosure.” 
    He was very graphic about it. 
    He put in details that no one had ever heard of. 
    Now the proceeding is going on here. 
    The motion to remand was filed in this Court on October 15, 1956 in an amendment form a month later. 
    And on the 24th of November 1956, we filed our answer to the motion to remand in which we tried to be as vigorous as we could and we were unconvincing to the Court. 
    We said this is hearsay, all you've got is a hearsay affidavit from a Treasury detective and a Government lawyer. 
    Where are the witnesses? 
    What are they talking about? 
    The prosecutors then went back to Mr. Lubben on February 3rd, 1957. 
    And they made no record of what happened upon that interrogation. 
    So I assume he didn't change his testimony. 
    They went back at him and got him in for another session on February 17, 1957. 
    And again, they made no notes or record of that one. 
    So, we must assume that was unsuccessful. 
    But on February 20, 1957 for the first time, Mr. Lubben said, “Oh” -- or Mr. Graflund said, “Oh, it's a mistake. 
    I've never told this to Busby on the train. 
    Nothing like that happened. 
    I went out to see him in July and he was startled to hear there'd been any black market transactions." 
    And then several months later on August 17, 1957, his affidavit to that effect was filed here. 
    That is the chronology of Graflund, its set forth in a chronology attached to our brief.

    I've only haven't touch upon the argument that you don't let confessional material in because it's false. 
    According to Dean Wigmore, that's why you keep it out material obtained by a promise of immunity. 
    And there is in this case and we think of tremendous importance to the entire country and not peculiar to the facts of this, a question of jury selection procedures. 
    This record establishes indisputably that the court commissioners elected not a one of the grand jurors, not a one of the petit jurors in this case. 
    We have challenged the Department time after time show any evidence in this record that Mr. Crux picked out a juror. 
    Show any evidence that volunteers were lawful at this time. 
    The jury question is one that cuts under everything here and we think there's a tremendous importance to the Court.

    We didn't find out about these facts until the case was pending in this Court that after this Court had set aside the judgments and you will -- Mr. Justice Harlan will recall, in your opinion you used the phrase, “Justice is not a one way street”. 
    With the case reopened to go back to a pretrial suppression of evidence hearing, we said reopen this to let us move to dismiss this indictment on the ground of a new legal grand jury and the verdict on the ground of an illegal petit jury and they say, “We aren't timely." 
    Then we say justice is not a one way street. 
    In the unusual twist and turn, this case is taken as quickly as we found out that contrary to the presumption that public officials are doing their duty, that crux just wasn't doing anything except exercise in ceremonial functions, we proved this matter. 
    And there was a hearing. 
    It's in the briefs. 
    I haven't the time. 
    I'm beyond my time as you can see. 
    But we think the issue is of vital importance to the entire jury system.
