Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="14.172">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 67, F. L. Shuttlesworth et al. 
    Petitioners, versus City of Birmingham. 
    Ms. Motley, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="14.172" stopTime="323.111">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    In this case, the petitioners are two Negro ministers here on the grant of certiorari by this Court to review their convictions by the Alabama State Courts on a charge of inciting, aiding or abetting for violation of the trespass after warning ordinance which we have just discussed as a basis of the convictions of these students in the preceding case. 
    Now, the ordinance in this case also appears on page 2 of our brief. 
    It is a very strong ordinance which reads, “it shall be unlawful for any person to incite or aid or abet in the violation of any law or city ordinance or any provision of state law, the violation of which is a misdemeanor.” 
    Now, the records on which the state seeks to sustain these convictions, contained only the testimony of a Birmingham City detective, and this detective did not himself personally witness any of the facts to which he testified on this trial. 
    He was present in the Recorder's Court when these petitioners in this case were on trial and he testified in the Circuit Court on the new trial as to what he heard other witnesses say in the lower court. 
    Now, the entire testimony in the record in this case is very brief. 
    The first petitioner is Reverend Shuttlesworth. 
    Now, the testimony as to what Reverend Shuttlesworth did, the detective said, was that Gober and Davis, petitioners of the preceding case, testified that they took part in the sit-in demonstrations on March 31st, 1960. 
    And that they went to Reverend Shuttlesworth's house the preceding evening and discussed sit-in demonstrations. 
    Reverend Shuttlesworth was present, his wife was present, and several others students were present and the second petitioner in this case, Reverend Billups was present. 
    At this discussion, somebody prepared a list. 
    Now, who prepared it or what the list was, the record does not show. 
    The only other thing the record shows is that Reverend Shuttlesworth asked for volunteers and at one point said or announced, that he would get them out of jail. 
    Now, on that testimony, Reverend Shuttlesworth has been sentenced to 180 days at hard labor and a fine of $100. 
    Now, the testimony as to Reverend Billups, the other defendant -- or the other petitioner in this case, Davis one of the students in the preceding case reportedly testified that Reverend Billups picked him up on the campus of Daniel Payne College which Davis attends and drove him to Reverend Shuttlesworth's house and that Reverend Billups was present during the discussion. 
    What Reverend Billups said does not appear in the record at all. 
    From the record, it appears and he said, absolutely nothing and on that evidence, Reverend Billups has been sentenced to 30 days at hard labor plus a $25 fine. 
    Now we say first, that these convictions must be reversed because the record is devoid of any evidence to support a conviction that these petitioners urge the violation of any valid law of the City of Birmingham. 
    What they were urging was a sit-in demonstration. 
    Now, in order for this Court to find that what they were urging was a violation of some valid law of the City of Birmingham, it seems to me that this Court would have to find that a sit-in per se, as the court below finds, is a violation of law. 
    Now, as the prior decisions of this Court show, a sit-in per se is not an unlawful activity. 
    In the Garner case and in many state court cases, these convictions have been reversed or the petitioners have not been convicted and their cases have been dismissed, so that to urge somebody to participate in a sit-in demonstration is not itself a violation of any valid law.

    The -- there was no evidence that Shuttlesworth urged them to stay there until they had been arrested and until they had been ordered to leave.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, would it have been a violation of this ordinance not the one that conceded to be invalid, but the one which is the basis of the other prosecution, would there have been any violation of that ordinance to go in there and stay before they were invited, told to get out by the owner? 
    Would they have violated any law by going in there and staying until the owner told them to get out? 
    Would they have violated this city ordinance?

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    I think that's different. 
    I think that they were going in there in this manner to protest, that's true. 
    But there is no evidence in this case that Reverend Shuttlesworth said to them, stay there until such time as your ordered to get out or stay there until the police come along and arrest you. 
    There just isn't any evidence in this record to that effect.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="470.321" stopTime="481.537">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    In other words, you say that taking all their evidence as proof, they did not prove any evidence from which it could be found that he urged them to go and then break this law by staying after they were ordered to leave?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="481.537" stopTime="483.654">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right. 
    That's right, exactly.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    [Inaudible] considers state court could permissively draw from the evidence that Shuttlesworth told them, I will get you out of jail, get them out of jail?

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes, the state --

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="497.654" stopTime="566.035">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right. 
    The state court drew the inference from that that Shuttlesworth had said to stay there until you're arrested and even the Court had difficulty with that because if you read their opinion, they were quite aware of the fact that there was no evidence that Suttlesworth told them to stay there until the police came. 
    What they actually said -- it's at the bottom of page 44, the second paragraph in the bottom. 
    There is no question of the restriction of any right of free speech or other simulated right derived from the Fourteenth Amendment since the appellant counseled the college students not merely to ask service in a restaurant but urged, convinced and arranged for them to remain on the premises presumably for an indefinite period of time. 
    And they used that word because there was no evidence in this record that Shuttlesworth said to stay there until you're asked to leave, stay there until the police came.

    He could have been convicted of this section in this case, but we say that his conviction is invalid because there is no evidence that he urged a violation of any valid law. 
    All it shows is that they discussed a sit-in. 
    Now, a sit-in means the cause that you go in but it doesn't necessarily mean you stay there until you're asked to leave. 
    And it doesn't necessarily say, you stay there until the police are called because these sit-ins have taken various forms as the history of the sit-in show, some of them have gone in and some have left when they were asked to leave and they were not arrested.

    And then they -- as I say, they went on to hold a sit-in per se an illegal activity. 
    And this is a basis on which these people were convicted just by finding that if you go and sit in a place and even if you leave, in other words, before you're asked or you don't intend to go in there to stay until the police, nevertheless that's a form of trespass, they say after warning just to go in a place and sit down.

    Assuming and I'm not suggesting, so assuming however that one concluded that the evidence was sufficient as to Shuttlesworth, could Billups be held on the evidence of -- is being having taken students over to Shuttlesworth's premises plus his presence there as an aider and abetter of Shuttlesworth's incitement either under the provisions of the abetting provisions of this statute or under some general accessory of law that maybe in your state?

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    I would say no, because there's nothing in this record to show that Billups did anything at all except take this man there and sit there. 
    I don't see how a man could be convicted for a crime and if you read Gober's or Davis' testimony, his testimony in the preceding case was that he asked Reverend Billups to drive them over there when he saw Reverend Billups on their campus. 
    Of course, that's not in this record, it's in the preceding record. 
    But I don't think that this man Billups could be held guilty of a crime because he sat in on this discussion where the record shows that he said absolutely nothing.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    May it please the Court. 
    I believe one of your justices just asked the question of whether or not without the use of the word “incite,” the petitioners would have still been involved under the aiding and abetting language and I have cited in my brief, the case of Davis versus State, 36 Alabama, well of course its cited, which -- and this is on page 11 if you have my brief. 
    The words, aid and abet comprehend all the systems rendered by actual words of encouragement or support and then went on to say, nor is it necessary to show prearrangement to do the specific wrong complained of and I also cite the case [Inaudible] versus State stating aiding and abetting and comprehend all the assistance rendered by acts or words of encouragement. 
    And then also, the participation in a crime in the community of purposes -- that perpetrators need not be proved by direct or positive testimony but may be inferred from circumstantial evidence and that's Parsons versus State all of which are set out on page 12 of respondent's brief. 
    But actually, I don't think there's any special significance in the use of the word “incite” except it might clarify to some extent, but the state courts in construing its own statute have said that the actual word of encouragement are sufficient under aiding and abetting alone without even referring to the use of the language incite was [Inaudible] --

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    There -- that brief which you don't have and I have read what the great -- let's say, well they never proved that these students went out anywhere and committed any crime. 
    Now, how can you aid and abet somebody when you haven't established they committed a crime? 
    I pointed out in my brief that they were overlooking and used the word incite and -- because they used the word incite is convenient in this case because -- and you don't need the Court decisions to read the -- that end, that word encouragement, are aiding and abetting. 
    So our ordinance simply spells out that inciting is one of the alternate modes of offending the ordinance.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Oh, yes sir.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    And they'd made it more of convenient well on offense. 
    And it made it more convenient to say well, let's use the word incite, that's a clear word and you'll overlook it and I pointed out that they were overlooking the inciting part. 
    Because I think incite give the flavor of the thing. 
    At least it warrants you that you don't have to have a combination of this thing result in some actual offense later on. 
    If I get out here and hold a meeting and I said, I don't want you people, get out here and I want you to go about this plan of robbery or intimidation and incite the other. 
    And I may do my best to influence them, but my powers in persuasion are not always very successful and they may change their mind, but the point is I -- I am inciting and the court in its decision under the state statute said that I'm also aiding and abetting, but they tried to go on the theory that to aid and abet should had to have the actual commission of the crime. 
    As I pointed out in brief, many cases called it even the common law, that's what in the facts and our position is simply that we have codified one in effect was common law.

    Mr. Davis, where in this record or was there any evidence, any evidence that Reverend Shuttlesworth incited or aided and abetted anybody to do anything [Inaudible] sit-in? I don't take it your contention here, that a sit-in as such is illegal under the law of Birmingham.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, I say this that the Appellate Court in Alabama said that they sit down, they used the word sit down as contrast to sit-in. 
    It was comparable to sit down strikes and that evidently the connotation that we used here, you see these things were discussed in a meeting, they would just -- sit down was used all through the trial and no one ever objected to it. 
    Everyone understood the use of the word, the Court reasoned that it was comparable to the Fansteel case wherein you had your sit down strikes.

    All I'm saying -- asking is that whether this is crime or a quasi crime, it has to be proved in the Court, but the charge is that they incited them to violate this section.

    And they'd have to incite them to violate the whole thing which was to go in, not merely to go in but stay there after they were invited to leave. 
    Now, I have grave doubts myself in finding in the evidence that was given anything on which as Mr. Justice Harlan said, of course they could draw an inference. 
    It was to incite to violation of the law, that would be one thing, but I find it difficult to say because they had merely invited them to go there and stay even for a long time.

    I must say that I understood that to mean, I had little to do with it, I understood that means that they must have some evidence from which it can be inferred, the man is guilty of each essential element of the crime. 
    Here, an essential element of the crime is to stay there as it conceded after they warned to leave. He didn't tell them to do that. 
    I would find it difficult myself to draw an inference from this evidence but that's what he told them to do, that's a basic conviction of a crime (Inaudible).

    Well, I -- you would too of course. 
    I say -- what I mean is that I agree with you that we should limit consideration of whether there's enough evidence here to the actual evidence as given in the case.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Yes sir. 
    But I think there are reasonable inferences we may draw and one is this if they were not going to breach the peach, what were they're going to jail for. 
    If the operator of the restaurant was the one involved in not putting up the separate doors and the petitions and so forth, certainly they weren't going to jail for his people. 
    Then what did -- what did Reverend Shuttlesworth have in mind when he assure them he would get them out of jail. 
    They discussed --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, we've had -- we've had some case is here, the Garner case and the Louisville case and other cases where they did put him in jail whether there wasn't any evidence of any kind against them.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Well, I have to say this --

    I didn't say that under those circumstances something to that kind could happen.

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    I agree with His Honor in this. 
    This may not have been the only conclusion reachable under the facts, but the question is whether the Court acting as a jury had any evidence before it, could it -- could it act upon any thing it had to find that he was inciting them to go or remain on the premises of another.

    Oh, [Inaudible] the rule and that is that we think that judge the constitutional permissibility of the inferences. 
    This isn't a question for us, it should -- as it might be if we were sitting under the state appellate court and reviewing the evidence.

    Mr. Davis, [Inaudible] that the total evidence in your case, is why Reverend Shuttlesworth asked for volunteers to just stay and sit down [Inaudible].

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    Of course -- of course, we started out with the statements made by Gober and made by Davis on another occasion. 
    It describes the fact that Reverend Billups came out to school and then he rode with him and with several other people there to Shuttlesworth (Inaudible).

    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    If I may take the liberty, counsel for petitioners, they didn't refer to the other record, some record in -- evidence to the carried six over the meeting, this one, he carried one. 
    One or six, I don't think it makes any difference. 
    But nevertheless, he was out to school and carried a student to the meeting. 
    He sat there. 
    He did not take a stand to negative his position. 
    But at least there were some evidence there that he was part and parcel of the scheme, they were both fraternities of the same -- of the minister [Inaudible]
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2206.028" stopTime="2215.028">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is it permissible under Alabama law for a court to draw an inference in the failure that if the defendant take a stand -- take a stand in a criminal case?
speaker="watts_e_davis" startTime="2215.028" stopTime="2270.750">
    Mr. Watts E. Davis 
    If -- it must not be commented upon to the jury but whether he commented or not, there is no evidence to negative. 
    That's the only point I make, not that he did negative that there is nothing to make. 
    And the Court in the Appellate Court opinion said, there's nothing -- have no choice but assume he was part and partial but he didn't get up leave. 
    There was no evidence of that. 
    There was no evidence that he recuse himself in any way from any responsibility. 
    But he did take someone there, he did remain there and these things were discussed in his presence. 
    I don't know whether it's a fact-finding of group of people gathering one person maybe standing over here just to count his own money, but I think they generally assumed he is part of the operation unless he takes the stand that it was of some strong defense. 
    Thank you.
