    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The petitioner is serving a 20-year sentence imposed upon him by the State of Florida. 
    At present, he has 17 more years to serve. 
    The underlying issue in this case is whether --

    17.
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="38.496" stopTime="242.513">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    The underlying issue in this case is whether the State of Florida denied him due process of law when it tried, convicted and sentenced him while he was admittedly unrepresented by counsel. 
    At the outset, I would like to summarize the petitioner's position. 
    First, it is our contention that under the decisions of this Court, due process requires the State to offer or furnish counsel to a prisoner in a noncapital case whenever there are special circumstances which show that without representation by counsel, the petitioner or the prisoner cannot have a fair and adequate defense. 
    In turning to the special circumstances which we contend exists in the present record, we say that there are six. 
    They are these, first, ignorance, second, mental illness, third, complicated substantive issues involved in the trial, fourth, difficult evidentiary problems, fifth, the use of inadmissible testimony, entirely prejudicial testimony to convict and sixth, the fact that the unrepresented petitioner received no aid from the trial judge in guiding him pass the errors which make trial without counsel unfair. 
    The issue comes to this Court in the following manner. 
    In 1959, the petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    He contended in this petition that he was denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America. 
    In support of his contention, he alleged the following, that he was tried in the Criminal Court of Record in Polk County, Florida on an indictment charging him with "Assault to Murder in the First Degree". 
    He alleged that he was a 29-year-old Negro, that he had never been in court before, that he did not understand court procedure and that he did not know how to defend himself and establish his innocence. 
    He further allege in his petition before the Florida Supreme Court that he requested the Court to appoint him a lawyer and that in response to that request, the Court told him, "You are not entitled to a lawyer as this is not a capital case and further, you won't need a lawyer in this case." 
    The petition also alleges that a request was made for a copy of the information and the Court denied the request. 
    It goes on to allege that the State picked the jury in the case, that the information was read and that the trial had commenced. 
    When the trial was over, petitioner was convicted of "Assault to Murder in the Second Degree" and a 20-year-sentence was imposed upon him.

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    There were two questions asked of the first witness who was a Negro as was petitioner. 
    The third question that the petitioner tried to ask, the Court stopped him saying that was testifying and it isn't time to testify. 
    The three witnesses who followed were law enforcement officials, two policemen and a sheriff. 
    After the first law enforcement official testified, the Court asked the petitioner if he had any questions and he said, "No, sir. 
    No, sir." 
    He asked no questions of the remaining two enforcement officials either.

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    The answer to that, Your Honor, is that it contains a partial transcript of the trial proceedings. 
    The State filed a return in the Florida Supreme Court. 
    In that return, it denied the allegations of the petition. 
    I use the word "denied" loosely because it said, "We deny that the petitioner was denied his constitutional rights by the alleged refusal to furnish counsel," and then went on to argue that it was noncapital, that he did a very fine job of representing himself and that the trial judge protected it.

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    We have to take the allegations of the petition as to what took place as to the period of time before the first witness testified. 
    The allegations were in the petition concerning the failure to appoint counsel, the failure to furnish the information and the failure to furnish the list of the witnesses, also, the allegation that the State picked the jury. 
    Then the trial transcript comes into play and the first word of the transcript is the first word of the testimony of the prosecuting witness. 
    The transcript closes after the petitioner has been asked to argue his case in final argument and the judge told him, "You may plead your case," and he answered, "Well, sir, I don't quite understand the meaning of that." 
    Then there's a notation that the State argued. 
    The Court then asked the petitioner if he wanted to reply to the State and he said, "No, sir." 
    That's the end of it. 
    We do not know what the judge charged the jury and there's no formal recitation of anything --

    Well, it started out he looked at the judge or he asked the judge, "Is he going to ask me questions?"

    And the Court told him that the statement would not be admissible that he could call the doctor as a witness. 
    The document there never got into evidence. 
    He -- the gist of his testimony was that he had head injuries in the Army in 1952 but in 1956, he was locked in a psychotic ward in the Bay Pines Veteran's Administration Hospital for four months under lock and key that finally, his mother came over to the hospital, signed guardianship papers to get him released from the psycho ward and that he then returned to the world at large.

    -- of the -- of the charge -- of the -- of the occurrence on -- on the basis of which the charge is made?
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="564.297" stopTime="629.939">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    I want to give a careful answer to Your Honor's question as I realize its significance. 
    I would say two things. 
    The testimony of the petitioner is that he doesn't remember any of the events that took place from the time that he had an argument in this juke joint with the prosecuting witness until he is found barricaded, so to speak, in a building with a shotgun. 
    He does not know what happened.He testified that his mind is a complete blank. 
    Now, he uses some language talking about these events but while he is in custody under arrest, the testimony is that the officers told him and their language is, "What had happened and what he had did." 
    The case is one that's susceptible of several interpretations and some very real and substantial issues for the jury. 
    One, would be the defense of insanity which, due to his ineptness, he couldn't raise, two, the question of whether he --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="629.939" stopTime="636.135">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Whether he could've -- ineptness, meaning, personal or legal ineptness?
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="636.135" stopTime="743.720">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    Both, I would say, Your Honor. 
    The second possibility is that he never committed anything at all that was a violation of state law. 
    There was a great deal of mystery and intrigue in this record even -- although it's a one-sided recorded and I think better described as a shambles than a trial in an American court. 
    The -- there are many things unexplained. 
    Three or at least two officials looked for the shell that was supposedly fired on the night of this occurrence. 
    The shell was never found. 
    There are a number of things. 
    The people who supposedly were hit never testified at the trial. 
    No one was killed. 
    The gist of the State's case was that the petitioner took a blast with a shotgun at 14 feet at the prosecuting witness and missed him. 
    His testimony for that was that wasn't probable or possible, that he was an expert marksman in the Army and that if he'd meant to kill anybody at 14 feet with a shotgun, he could not possibly have missed. 
    The second type of defense goes to the amount of the sentence imposed. 
    When we talk of the substantive issues at the trial, we will find that there's a 20-year sentence as the maximum in Florida for any type of assault. 
    And that that takes a felonious intent to kill coupled with the assault. 
    Absent that intent to kill, the maximum sentence is five years. 
    So there is a 15-year difference in punishment and petitioner, without any credit for good time, would be about ready for release if he could've established the proposition of no intent to kill.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="743.720" stopTime="748.305">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did he -- did he address the jury after -- after he left the witness stand?
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="748.305" stopTime="795.210">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    No, sir, Your Honor. 
    The judge made an explanatory statement to him and said "pleadous" he was called. 
    If you had a lawyer at this time, he would make the opening address to the jury. 
    The State would reply, and then you would have a closing argument. 
    If you wish to argue then plead your case. 
    His answer to that was, "Well, sir, I don't quite understand the meaning of that." 
    The judge then said, "Alright, suppose you sit here and listen to the State, pay careful attention then get up and say anything you want to in reply." 
    The record notes that the State argued and after that, the petitioner was asked if he wished to reply and he said, "No, sir." 
    On that note, the trial ends.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="795.210" stopTime="798.276">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, we don't know what issues the judge left to the jury.
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="798.276" stopTime="819.289">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    No, sir, Your Honor. 
    We do not know what was charged. 
    We can speculate that since he was charged with "Assault to Murder in the First Degree" and convicted of "Assault to Murder in the Second Degree" that there was a charge which did go into the question of degrees and possible offenses. 
    But the --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="823.341" stopTime="838.722">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    It carried a 20-year penalty, as did the offense for which he was convicted. 
    The opinion below notes that he effectively defended himself to the event that he secured a conviction for a crime in lesser degree.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="838.722" stopTime="843.475">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I thought -- as I understood you a minute ago, you -- the punishment is the same.
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="843.475" stopTime="845.398">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    It is identical --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="845.398" stopTime="845.561">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So he had to --
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="845.561" stopTime="846.892">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    -- and he got the maximum.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="846.892" stopTime="850.975">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So he achieved getting a different name for the same 20 years, is that it?
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="850.975" stopTime="1064.443">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    I'm sure that as he sits there facing another 17 years, the difference between first and second degree does not interest him in the slightest. 
    The return which was filed contained this documentary evidence that we are discussing, namely this partial transcript of the trial testimony. 
    In addition to the testimony of the prosecuting witness, three law enforcement officials testified at the trial. 
    These officials testified, number one, two of them to finding the petitioner at a building across the street from this juke joint in the circumstances under which they found him and they also testified as to admissions made by the petitioner while he was under arrest. 
    One of the arresting officers stated that the petitioner confessed regret and said that he was sorry that he had hit the boy, that he had ended up getting, that he meant to kill Scurry. 
    Now, there were two Scurry brothers involved in this case and the prosecutor asked him, "Which Scurry?" 
    And he testified, "Both Scurrys". 
    The second arresting officer testified that he -- admitted that he intended to kill Scurry but there's no elaboration as to which Scurry was involved. 
    The plaintiff's testimony, as I have indicated, took the position that he did not know what had happened. 
    Secondly, that he couldn't -- could not have intended to kill anyone and it also went into the question of his mental background. 
    I would say that there is no contradiction in this record as to the fact that the petitioner was locked in a psycho ward, that's the language used in the record, for a period of four months. 
    Based on this record, the Florida Supreme Court rendered its opinion in July 1 of last year holding that the writ should be denied and that the petitioner had not made a sufficient showing to warrant any further inquiry into the process which culminated in his conviction. 
    The opinion stated, first, that as to the request for an information, there was no showing that such a request was made, that there was a waiver of any right to get a copy of the charges against him by failure to make timely request and third, that the error, if any, was harmless. 
    As to the right to counsel, the Florida Supreme Court said, first, there's nothing in the record of the trial to show that there was a request made for counsel, that there is no duty upon the trial judge to make inquiry as to the defendant's desires. 
    It then went on to say that the charge was simple, so was the evidence to support it and that this petitioner was fully able to defend himself. 
    And it concluded with language to the effect that it cannot be said that the issues are so complex or the petitioner is so young and inexperienced, as to bring into play the exception to the rule requiring appointment only in capital cases where there are these special circumstances. 
    That --

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    In testing the decision of the Florida Supreme Court, if we follow existing law, we go to the line of cases inaugurated with Betts versus Brady in 1942. 
    In the Betts case, the Court set out the rule which has been applied in full force and with bigger since 1942. 
    By 1952, Your Honors could remark in Palmer versus Ashe that you had repeatedly held that the due process clause requires the assistance of counsel whenever there are special circumstances that made trial without counsel unfair. 
    The same rule was applied in Cash versus Culver in the last term and Hudson versus North Carolina of this term. 
    Turning to the special circumstances involved in this record, we do not have in the record a great deal of evidence on which to discuss the question of ignorance. 
    We have the allegation which is not disproven that he had never been in court before, that he did not understand court procedure and that he did not know how to defend himself and establish his innocence.

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    That is correct. 
    If we go back to their exact language on the matter, they said, "So it cannot accurately be said that the issues were so complex or the petitioner is so young, ignorant and inexperienced as to bring into play the exception to the rule requiring appointment of counsel only in capital cases and to require further inquiry into the process culminating in his conviction."

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    What it means is this complaint didn't state a cause of action and it's dismissed with prejudice. 
    The allegations of ignorance and a lack of understanding, we submit, are conclusively shown by the shambles that the petitioner made of his defense and there is no contradiction about what happened. 
    It is there. 
    The only question is the inferences to be drawn from it. 
    The first thing that the petitioner did, he let the State pick the jury. 
    I submit that that would be reversible error in any case or any --

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    That is correct. 
    Now, turning to the things that aren't allegations but are uncontroverted facts, the petitioner did not possess sufficient intelligence to cross-examine witnesses. 
    He asked two questions of the Negro who was the prosecuting witness. 
    His third question was a testimony question and that was the last question that he ever asked at the trial. 
    I submit that a southern Negro would not likely cross-examine law enforcement officials in Bartow, Florida even if he could but the fact is that he did not. 
    Secondly, he never made a single objection to anything that happened during his entire trial. 
    We will come to some of the things that he could have objected to but basically, he was convicted by a barrage of unresponsive answers, conclusions of the witnesses and leading questions -- questions rephrased by the prosecution to suit their theory rather than the witness' own testimony.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Where is Bartow, Florida?
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="1403.929" stopTime="1650.862">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    Bartow, Florida is in the center of the State, Your Honor. 
    The only attempt that the petitioner made to get any kind of documentary evidence in failed and that was a doctor's statement as to his mental illness in the fact of his psychotic confinement. 
    He did not know the rules of evidence and he was unable to get the document in evidence. 
    Finally, he didn't know what it meant to plead his case. 
    The great force and final argument, the great event, the climax of a jury trial and here is your petitioner who has to tell the judge, "Well, sir, I don't quite understand the meaning of that." 
    That was the extent of his intelligence. 
    When we add to what is shown as to what he could not do and what went over his head and buy him because he did not know what happened, the fact of his psychotic confinement, we respectfully submit, that the trial of this unrepresented petitioner without more in any kind of a case would be a shocking denial of the Due Process Clause. 
    The Uveges case, Palmer versus Ashe and Massey versus Moore, all emphasize the question of ignorance and mental deficiency and even insanity. 
    This is not just any case. 
    And it is our second line of attack that no layman could defend himself against the issues that were involved in this case. 
    Florida law is a maze of nightmare. 
    These distinctions when we get to the law of assault. 
    To understand what the petitioner's substantive issues were, we have to consider the interplay between first, the law of assault, second, the law of intent and third, the law of homicide. 
    And it's all jumbled up into degrees and distinctions. 
    Now, these are not academic distinctions. 
    These are distinctions that mean a difference in 15 years in the penitentiary. 
    All that the petitioner had to show at his trial was that he had no intent to kill whoever was charged -- he was charged with killing any information. 
    We don't know because the information is not in the record. 
    But if he could have proved that, he would have had a maximum of a five-year sentence. 
    We have quoted the Florida cases in language in our brief but the specific charge is assault with intent to commit felony. 
    That's the statutory crime. 
    I intend -- let me say at this time that the positive proof of the complexity of the substantive issues in this trial is the dramatic fact that the petitioner stands convicted today of an offense which does not exist under Florida law. 
    The jury verdict which came in stated that he was guilty of "Assault to murder in the Second Degree". 
    The statutory offense is "assault with intent to". 
    The jury verdict left out the "with intent" finding and there never has been a finding in this case that the petitioner had the intent which got him over the five-year hurdle into the 15-year hurdle. 
    The Supreme Court and the State knows that the offense is assault with intent because in the Florida Supreme Court's opinion, that's what it calls it, "assault with intent". 
    In respondent's return they used language "assault with intent". 
    The jury did not find it. 
    If counsel had been present and had asked for a reconsideration with instruction that the jury had not found a lawful verdict, we don't know whether they would have come in with five years or 15 years but all of this passed unnoticed. 
    The judge gave him the maximum --

    The jury verdict is quoted, Your Honor, in the exhibit which is attached to the return, which is the judgment of conviction. 
    It's on page 22 of the record. 
    It says "The above cause, having come on to be heard," and so on, "and the jury having returned a verdict of guilty on February 26, 1958 to the offense of Assault to Murder in the Second Degree." 
    There is no "with the intent to murder in the second degree" in there and I would add -- I believe this is true in all States but when a judge makes a statement of fact in his order in Florida, that is the record.

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    The practice is not uniform under -- I -- I say that only because of French versus State which I have cited. 
    It says that the law is that if they return a general verdict of guilty, then you don't have any problem about something having been left out. 
    But if they return a specific finding and if one of the elements required for the crime, such as intent, is left out, then it's said that the verdict may be insufficient to support a conviction. 
    I concede that the French case is dicta but we can only look to what there is in the Florida law and what it says. 
    And it's the only expression on it is that if the verdict leaves out the requisite of intent, that it may be invalid.

    Well, we do, I respectfully submit, Your Honor, because the judge used that language, the language "Assault to Murder in the Second Degree". 
    And the judge's finding of fact, as stated in his order, is a proper part of the record in the State of Florida. 
    If the judge says that "so-and-so appeared before me," that's a fact and the record shows that he appeared.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1891.892" stopTime="1940.032">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I, in light of all that you've said, ask this. 
    Suppose the Court agreed with you as to the disparity between the conclusion reached by this -- by your Supreme Court and the relevant criteria by which a conclusion should have been reached. 
    What -- what do you suggest as the proper relief to be given by this Court, a new trial or to send it back to the state court for them to explore these various -- all these puzzles that you have whenever we have doubling, the Court, through the appointment of one of the judges, point out to the facts here.
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="1940.032" stopTime="2031.786">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    Your Honors have two possible sources of relief, if anything is done for the petitioner. 
    One is to remand it to Florida with direction to hold a hearing. 
    The other is to remand it to Florida with directions to award petitioner a new trial. 
    The answer as to the latter depends on whether a reading of the trial record which his furnished by the State convinces that the man was utterly incapable of defending himself. 
    We certainly submit that on the record in this case which shows what happened at his trial, that a hearing in the Supreme Court of Florida is a waste of time. 
    We know that he couldn't question. 
    We know that he didn't know what it meant to argue. 
    We know that he sat by and got convicted on inadmissible and extremely prejudicial testimony and under the Hudson case, I think that that is clearly enough. 
    I think the Hudson case is specifically written to single shot the proposition that a problem of trial strategy, such as being left after one codefendant pleads guilty, is beyond the kin of the layman. 
    In this case, I think that the admissions of the arresting officers which were admitted is on exactly the same par. 
    Now, under Florida law, the admissions of an accused made to arresting officers cannot be admitted in evidence unless there is an affirmative showing that they were freely and voluntarily made.

    Your Honor, I think there's an interesting history behind that. 
    The petition that was filed in the State Supreme Court shows some signs of brilliance. 
    In tracing down the origin of it, which I have done in a footnote, there are paragraphs of identical language in both the habeas petition below and in Mr. Langbein's brief here in Cash versus Culvert. 
    The exact language is used. 
    As a matter of fact, you can look and you can see the quotation marks are in the typing where the prison stenographer even left a little quote marks in -- in quoting from Mr. Langbein's brief. 
    I don't think there's any question but (Inaudible) has a referred bar. 
    They also have a library when each one of their inmates has some sort of proceeding. 
    There's no doubt in my mind that Mr. McNeal did not grab this petition. 
    We say, in our brief, that it was prison plagiarist and the State, in rephrasing our contention, says that it was eight prison plagiarists.

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    Cash, I can tell Your Honors two things that I know. 
    One is that, on a hearing, they held that he was capable of defending himself. 
    Secondly, they held on a second hearing that he had been denied the right to get counsel of his own choosing and remanded his case for trial. 
    What has happened since then, I don't know. 
    But Mr. Cash has gotten a new trial. 
    The Florida law regarding the fact that there must be an affirmative showing that the admissions were freely and voluntarily made is so strong that the Florida law places an affirmative duty on the trial judge to go into the question even if counsel does not. 
    And in the Steiner case, they have a discussion of the fact that something this serious ought not to depend on skill of counsel, that courts should be a form for the administration of justice and not a place for playing chess by skilled counsel. 
    So, we have this evidence --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2249.234" stopTime="2252.688">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Where is -- where is the case in Florida where that was done?
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="2252.688" stopTime="2341.952">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    That is the Steiner case. 
    That's Steiner versus State. 
    The citation to it is 78 Florida 647, 83 Southern 565. 
    The language which I have quoted is quoted on pages 22 and 23 of my brief. 
    The interesting thing about the Steiner case is that it did not even involve admissions to police officers. 
    It just involved admissions and they have in the Louette case the statement that special care and scrutiny must be made when it's the arresting officers that testified. 
    The issue arose in the Steiner case because it was unobjected to at the trial and the question was whether they could consider it on appeal absent such objection. 
    They held that the trial judge had an affirmative duty to make inquiry that they could consider it and they did consider it but found that it was free and -- freely and voluntarily made. 
    The Louette case, which is much more recent, states that there must be an affirmative showing in the record regarding the questions of threat, force, inducements and intimidation. 
    If all that's shown is that the circumstances where those questions are not asked, then there's an affirmative duty to reverse.

    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    No, sir, Your Honor. 
    I would submit that there are some inferences that can be drawn from this record. 
    At page 31 of the record, we have some discussion of the circumstances of the arrest. 
    "He and Scurry got into another argument," and so on. 
    "Who was, McNeal?" 
    Answer, "McNeal, and I caught him by the arm and said, "You'll have to learn better than that." 
    He said, "Turn me loose. 
    I'm not scared of your damn pistol." 
    And I said, "McNeal, you're going with me." 
    I said, "You're still under arrest" and I said, "Let's go." 
    And I gave the other boy the shotgun to keep. 
    I didn't know what was in McNeal's mind but I wanted to be ready." 
    Now, drop down a line or two. 
    "On the way to the station, we told McNeal what had happened and what he had did." 
    I submit that the prosecution may have been planning siege in the mind of this petitioner and if we draw any inferences about the free and voluntary nature of his admissions, there's some evidence in this case that he was dirt brown pretty good. 
    There's no evidence concerning an absence of threats or force or intimidation. 
    The -- Your Honors' decision in Williams versus Kaiser discusses the problems that a layman has when an offense involves degrees. 
    Now, not only do we have all the degrees of homicide and all the types of assaults in this case but we also have the law of intent. 
    And of course, we have the possible question of insanity. 
    It is our position that there's been a gross violation of the special circumstances rule in this case and we respectfully submit that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida should be reversed.

    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    It's now my honor and privilege to extend to this Honorable Court the greetings and compliments of the Attorney General of the State of Florida. 
    In approaching the case at bar, I wish to reiterate some of the matters that counsel has already covered in order that my presentation might assume a somewhat orderly form. 
    This petition was first filed in the Supreme Court of Florida on or about March 24, 1959. 
    The petition contained only two points of law and two issues were involved. 
    One issue had to do with whether or not his fundamental rights had been abridged by reason of his allegation that he was not furnished a copy of the information in this cause. 
    His original petition emphasized that point. 
    It almost stated, almost as an afterthought, that he had also been denied right to counsel. 
    In our original response in the Supreme Court of Florida, we dedicated practically all of our response to his first position taken relative to the absence of the information. 
    The court -- that also -- another reason why we did that is that particular question had never been passed upon by a Florida appellate court. 
    As to -- we have in our Constitution in -- in Article 11 of the Declaration of Rights saying that that must be done. 
    And so, our Supreme Court took the same position that they did in the Supreme Court of Alabama on an identical question and ruled that the record showed evident waiver of this right, also ruling that it's a ministerial function and unless the record affirmatively shows that it was not done, it will be assumed that the judge or the court did their duty. 
    So --

    If the -- if the petition shows merit, if it shows a question of fact which cannot be answered in a -- in a legal manner or on points of law, the court -- the Supreme Court then appoints a circuit judge. 
    A commission -- commissioner is called. 
    Then the Petitioner -- the Circuit Judge is -- is commissioned to take testimony and to determine questions of fact and law and submit a written report back to the Supreme Court and the decision is made by the Supreme Court. 
    On such hearings, the petitioner is present while he is not entitled, as a matter of law, to an attorney during those hearings, we have always asked the court to appoint one for him. 
    These attorneys serve without compensation and I can -- I can promise that they always do a good job as is evident by this court-appointed attorney that has appeared here today for the petitioner.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Alright.
speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="2886.925" stopTime="3285.908">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    This -- the question I just mentioned relative to -- to the information has been abandoned in these proceedings and we're now here on a single -- the single issue of whether or not Elijah McNeal was arbitrarily denied his right to counsel in the court below and if so, was such denial a violation of his constitutional rights under our federal and state constitutions. 
    Now, the history of this case is significant and I believe it will become increasingly so to the Court as we go along. 
    The dates involved here are particularly significant. 
    On February the 24th, 1959, this Court reversed our Florida Supreme Court in the case of Ray Cash versus Culver, a similar case in some respects. 
    The petition, in this case, was filed subsequent to that reversal. 
    The briefs were filed subsequent to that reversal. 
    The opinion of our Florida Supreme Court in the instant case was filed after having received your reversal in Cash. 
    And thus, it is that we have continued in our brief and we do here that when our Supreme Court denied the relief requested by this man, it did so with the tones of reversal bringing clearly in those judicial ears, as you signified in the Cash case. 
    In that Cash case, you laid down a yardstick for our Supreme Court to be guided by in such cases as this and we feel like that they have attempted to do so and we think that when we come to a comparison, a fair and honest logical comparison of the facts in this case, as applied to the yardstick which you supplied us in the Cash case, that we think that we have complied with your mandate and we believe that we can make that increasingly fair to you. 
    First, we realize that any obligation that we hope to furnish counsel in noncapital cases to indigent defendants is by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment and the -- and the previous opinions of this Court wherein, stated generally, the defendant, by reason of age, physical or mental incapacity, is not able to present any type of defense in his own behalf. 
    Now, this Court examined the Cash file and determined that he came within that rule. 
    Taking that opinion and -- and comparing it to McNeal, we have this. 
    First, we want to compare the records before the Court and this is significant. 
    In Cash, that record came up here on a bare petition and a bare benial -- denial. 
    It's a practice in our court down there that if, in the opinion of the court, the petition does not contain sufficient allegations which would merit the writ -- the issuance of the writ, then they -- they simply enter a blank denial of the relief requested. 
    That is all that -- and at that time, our practice was, down there, was every Monday morning, we would load up our baskets full of the petitions and go over there to the court and as they would be called out, we would reply orally. 
    And if in our opinion we could not answer the allegations contained there, we would so advise the court. 
    The court would then issue the writ and further proceedings would be held. 
    If -- we took the position that if all these allegations, even if admitted, were not yet sufficient to -- to be awarded relief. 
    We ask the court to deny the issuance of the writ and that's what happened in that particular case. 
    So, the only record that you had up here in Cash was his petition wherein he set out all of these standard things that our jailhouse lawyer down there tells him to put in there. 
    You had a blanket denial of the writ. 
    Therefore, under your previous ruling in Hawk, as I believe it is, Hawk versus Olson, every allegation in that petition had to be taken as true. 
    And certainly, a review of that petition would -- would show you that -- that there was some merit to the petition if the allegations were taken as true. 
    The record in this case, that's before you, is much more complete. 
    I hasten to agree with counsel that it should be more complete than it is but it is far more complete than was the record in the Cash case. 
    You have --

    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    The burden in Florida, as I assume it is in most jurisdictions, is for the person making the allegations to -- to furnish the proof of such allegations. 
    Now, we were never furnished anything but a bare petition. 
    It's our practice then to go over to the prison division. 
    We have a consolidated office for all prisons in Tallahassee and we have these man's records. 
    And we take from that record the necessary papers and documents to put in our response and since he raised no question of trial irregularities --

    I beg your pardon?
speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="3360.538" stopTime="3414.073">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    He raised no question of trial irregularities in his petition, his only question, as I've said, the -- another reason why the record isn't any more complete than it is, if Your Honor please, is, again, I go back to our previous statement, that it was the impression of everyone concerned that his primary complaint had to do with the information not being given to him. 
    And we -- we attempted to answer that as a matter of law and we didn't need very much record and of course, once the record was formulated there in Florida, we couldn't add to it to bring it up here.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3414.073" stopTime="3447.149">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I -- I don't quite understand how you say that because the very first item in number one in his petition for habeas corpus reads "The trial court deprived him in his rights to representation by counsel as required by decisional rules and established law of Florida." 
    Now, that isn't just incidental. 
    That's the very first and primary complaint that he makes.
speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="3447.149" stopTime="3500.055">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    I had reference to the argument contained in the petition wherein he's apparently concentrated on the other question. 
    We didn't ignore -- we didn't ignore this question in the Supreme Court but we merely passed on it in our response. 
    I believe we had one paragraph to it under which we relied on the established rules of this Court and of Florida wherein we alleged that it was not a capital offense, that the record showed it was a simple charge and simple evidence to support it, that there is no showing that this man was incapacitated to the extent that he could not defend himself and as a matter of fact, there's an affirmative showing that he did. 
    And that's --

speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="4392.243" stopTime="4459.336">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    Well, it depends on the nature of the legal proceedings involved in -- on -- on appeal, it's necessary that the entire record go, especially if there is evidentiary questions involved. 
    In a case of this nature, it's actually not -- not necessary that any record go, except that which can substantiate the allegations made in the petition. 
    For instance, if he had merely alleged that the -- the judge charged on a totally different crime, all he would have to send up was the charge in the court. 
    If he alleges any other isolated wrongful act that happened during the course of the trial, he would merely have to send that portion of the record which would substantiate his allegations.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4459.336" stopTime="4516.535">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I noticed here that, in this one, the first allegation is that the trial court deprived him in his rights to representation by counsel as required by decisional rules and established law of Florida. 
    I don't find anything in the record that -- that would bear on that. 
    The next is the trial court deprived him of a fair and impartial trial and I would assume that the -- that the charge would be a part of -- part of the trial that he could rely on. 
    And then I notice also that the trial court deprived him of due notice by refusing to furnish him a copy of the -- of the information. 
    I don't -- there's nothing in there about the information, is -- is there? 
    Now, how -- how does he protect himself in -- in that situation?
speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="4516.535" stopTime="4545.682">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    Well, it -- the same question might be -- well be asked of how the State would protect. 
    Now, those things are guided -- how would the State protect itself if you take those allegations as true? 
    When a man waits all this length of time and comes up with a blank allegation that the judge didn't do this or didn't do that and then does not support it, it would certainly put the State at a disadvantage.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4545.682" stopTime="4555.417">

    Yes, sir. 
    We have standard forms that's -- that there again, there's no set rule. 
    The -- most trial judges carry with them in court a large book containing charges on practically every criminal offense punishable and they sometimes have to paraphrase from one form to another. 
    Others use a standard form books put out by Robinson in Florida that have a form, a standard form for practically every kind. 
    Others just get it from memory.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4617.362" stopTime="4622.433">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    You don't have a form that's promulgated by the court -- Supreme Court?
speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="4622.433" stopTime="4889.618">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    No, sir, not to my knowledge. 
    We won't -- we -- getting back to the tradition the State takes, it's whether or not this record shows that this man was so incapacitated that he should have had an attorney. 
    We're again comparing him with Cash since that again is the formula that you furnished us. 
    And we say that another thing that probably influenced this Court in Cash was that he was a -- an uneducated farm boy of 20 years old wherein McNeal was a 29-year old Negro man, a veteran of almost six years in the Army. 
    There again would indicate if they kept him six years, it would indicate that he was not completely devoid of some mentality, that he was a GI student. 
    I assume that he was a GI student because he says "I -- I get money for going to school. 
    The Government pays me for going to school," and that's the only way I know that -- that you could get that pay, that he was an employee at a nursery. 
    Now, that would indicate a man of at least a normal intelligence. 
    The -- another thing we feel that -- that influenced this Court in the Cash case was that Cash was tried twice. 
    The first time he was represented by an able -- able lawyer from the Dade County Bar. 
    That trial ended in a mistrial. 
    While he was -- after that trial, he was sent back to Raiford and placed in solitary confinement and his lawyer withdrew from the case without his knowledge until just prior to the time he was brought back to be tried again. 
    And the second trial, he was not represented by counsel and they convict him. 
    At least this Court recognized the first mistrial as a concrete evidence of the help that a lawyer gave him that he -- that was unavailable to him in the second trial. 
    We have no such indication of innocence in this case. 
    Now, this opportunity to obtain counsel is another thing that we feel that this -- this case should turn on. 
    Cash, as going again as comparison, as I said, Cash was placed in solitary confinement immediately after his first trial. 
    He was unable to obtain counsel and he asked for counsel. 
    When he went to court at the first opportunity, he asked the court to "give me time to get counsel of my own choice or in the alternative, please appoint one for me." 
    McNeal had much more opportunity than that. 
    He was arrested on the night of his offense on -- on November 10th, 1958 or 1957. 
    And thereafter, in February, he was convicted some over three months between the time he was arrested and the time he was convicted and the -- he does not allege that he was in jail during this three months and the record doesn't reflect whether or not he was in jail but we get the reasonable indication from the record that he was not in jail during this three months. 
    And we say it's reasonable and logical because in his testimony, the -- he was asked, "Do you draw compensation?" 
    His answer was "I draw compensation for the school but the pension was cut off." 
    Question, "What kind of work do you do?" 
    Answer, "I work at the nursery in Lake Garfield." 
    This matter took place down in the garden spot of Florida. 
    And these questions and answers indicate the -- this -- the present tense connotations of his answers indicate that "I work now". 
    Now --

    -- that not only indicates that this man was out three months when he had an opportunity to get counsel but it also indicates that he draws money from two sources, from the Government and from the nursery.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4935.171" stopTime="5006.685">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, do you have to rely on some -- some finespun theory of that kind as to whether he was out on bail or not? 
    Couldn't -- wouldn't your records of your court show whether he was out on -- on bail or not? 
    Why should we have to -- have to have finespun arguments like that because a man says "I work"? 
    Well, he works when he's out of jail but he doesn't work when he's in jail. 
    Certainly, your records ought to show whether the man was admitted to bail and if he is -- is it reasonable to suppose that in this circumstance, he would have been admitted to bail? 
    Here's -- here's a man who's undoubtedly psychotic. 
    He's been in a -- in a safe hospital or a veteran's administration hospital for being psychotic. 
    You claimed he fired a shotgun at a -- at a crowd 14 feet distant from them.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Don't you think you should, rather than to -- to make an argument of this kind that you infer from some general language that had no application to bail at all that he was on bail? 
    Don't you think it would have been much fair to this man to -- to look at the records of the court and find out if he had been placed on bail?
speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="5038.968" stopTime="5056.211">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    Had I anticipated the case coming here, I would have put more in the record in Florida but it had -- once the record was perfected there and we've felt, at that time, we had enough in the record to dispose of the case and --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5056.211" stopTime="5076.523">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I mean, before you wrote your brief in this -- in this Court and before you -- you took the position that you now take that there is an inference that the man was on bail, don't you think it would have been fair to look at the record and find out if the man actually was on bail?
speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="5076.523" stopTime="5172.475">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    I have to agree with that, yes, sir, but it was not done in this case. 
    We felt that that deduction could be reasonably obtained from this entire record. 
    It's further stated in the record that this man had a big family, his mother and father and a big family living right there in Polk County. 
    There, again, an indication that he -- he was not cut off from an opportunity to obtain counsel. 
    The -- another factor that is considered in cases wherein the right to counsel is involved is the complexity of the elements involved in the charge. 
    Going back to the Cash case again, and this Court considered that in the Cash case, the complexity, burglary for which Cash was charged is usually a case -- an offense committed in the stealth of nighttime and usually, it's detected only by scientific means, fingerprints, casts and finally, the conviction is seldom obtained unless you have the testimony of an accomplice which brings in many complex questions of law. 
    The --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5172.475" stopTime="5177.750">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Are those questions, Mr. Henderson, were present in the Cash case? 
    There was accomplished testimony or there wasn't?
speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="5177.750" stopTime="5325.119">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    Yes, sir, there was. 
    There was. 
    As a matter of fact, his conviction would never have been obtained without it. 
    Incidentally, Cash went back on this Court's ruling and the question was asked, "What happened to him?" 
    He went back and a new trial was ordered eventually and he -- he entered a plea of guilty to the case. 
    The -- the offense of assault with intent to commit first degree murder is one in Florida which could not possibly put a judge on reasonable prior notice that the issues or testimony would be so complex that a normal person of ordinary intelligence could not defend himself against it. 
    It's -- logically, the court knows it's an offense committed against the person of another as opposed to this property that there's always an eyewitness to -- to such an offense and usually, more. 
    As in this case, there were a number of eyewitnesses. 
    The testimony is simple and that's why the entire testimony here, it certainly is short. 
    It's 32 pages, but it covers the entire story of what happened down there at that juke joint that night. 
    Elijah McNeal got into altercation with the proprietors of this place and came out second best. 
    He then departed to his home, went directly and produced a loaded shotgun, came directly back and in order to further the point that he was discussing when he was there before, he fired pointblank into a group of these people. 
    He missed the man that he was gunning for but he hit four more. 
    Now, that's the entire story of what happened down there. 
    There's no need for any more testimony. 
    The officers testified that's what happened. 
    Now, with reference to whether or not he knew what he was doing.

speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="6020.551" stopTime="6030.743">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    Manner -- the nature of the statement involved makes a great deal of difference as to whether or not it's an admission against interest or a judicial or extrajudicial confession.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Henderson, I took a lot of your time to question -- asking you questions. 
    If you want a few moments to -- to sum up your argument, please take the time and do it. 
    You may do that.
speaker="odis_m_henderson" startTime="6111.887" stopTime="6300.389">
    Mr. Odis M. Henderson 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    We will sum up very briefly by saying this. 
    That the elements which rule the Cash case are totally missing from this case. 
    The only question again, we feel, before this Court is whether or not this record showed that this man had reasonable intelligence. 
    We say it does. 
    We say he participated in his own defense. 
    We say that the record showed that he -- he'd been in the Army six years, that he attended GI school, that he worked at a nursery, that he did know what he did down there that night because he said, "I meant to -- to scare them." 
    We say that if this Court rules that a man of that experience and of that intelligence is required, under the Fourteenth Amendment, to be represented by a state-appointed counsel, then you're going to open the door so wide. 
    Of course, you're going to put a lot of lawyers to work but you're going -- you're going to open it wide enough where we'll have to have them in -- in municipal courts. 
    We'll have to have them -- the Fourteenth Amendment also extends to property rights as well as human rights. 
    We'll have to have them when some -- in another time, someone sues somebody for an old debt and we say it's opening the door too wide. 
    We say that -- that this case is -- is no stronger and not much different than the Betts versus Brady case, which we've quoted in our brief, wherein this very Court ruled that he was a man of sufficient age and intelligence to -- to defend himself and therefore, not come within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Finally, we say that this man did represent himself. 
    No lawyer in the world could have presented but one defense to this case and that was lack of intent to kill. 
    And if he established that defense himself adequately when he testified, "I didn't mean to kill anybody. 
    I wanted -- I just wanted to scare them and keep them from jumping on the people," and the jury gave him every benefit of the doubt by reducing the verdict to assault with the intent to commit murder in the second degree, which it actually was. 
    He was sentenced to a term allowed by Florida statutes which does not necessarily, in and of itself, infer prejudice on the part of the judge. 
    We say that we have attempted to follow your mandate that you handed down in Cash. 
    We ask that you recognize that we have followed it and affirm the decision previously handed down by the Florida Supreme Court in this case. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Sam Daniels
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="6300.389" stopTime="6300.817">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    May it please the Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6300.817" stopTime="6302.853">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Daniels.
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="6302.853" stopTime="6563.292">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    The counsel for respondent has taken the position that the Florida rule as to voluntariness of admissions is not a rule as to admissions but as only as it applies to confessions. 
    At page 18 of our brief, we quote from the Louette case and the second paragraph of it discusses incriminating admissions. 
    The rule clearly applies to admissions. 
    If we turn over to the page 22 of our brief, the same thing is said. 
    The language has used "admissions or confessions". 
    The admission in this case was not only concerning the fact that somebody was shot but the crucial element in the admissions was the intent to kill. 
    That's what they needed in this record and that's what they got from these three police officers that he intended to kill Scurry. 
    Now, on one moment, the counsel for respondent says that since he got up and testified that "I meant to scare him" that he admitted in crime of second -- of assault with intent to commit second degree murder. 
    That isn't correct. 
    The Williams case, which is cited in our brief, says that no one can be punished under the assault with intent to commit felony statute unless there is an intent to kill, that the gist of the offense is intent to kill. 
    The scaring testimony would be a five-year offense at most and he did not confess to that. 
    I won't go into the record but I'll leave respectfully with Your Honors the fact that after he said, "I meant to scare them," the prosecution came in and said, "You said you meant to scare them?" 
    And he said, "I must have meant to scare them." 
    But this goes back to the words that were put in his mouth by the prosecu -- by the arresting officers who had to tell him what he had done on the night of the offense. 
    Now, counsel takes the position that this case is distinguishable from Cash because Cash was only a habeas corpus posi -- petition. 
    The facts in the Cash case were true only in the pick wiki in a sense of a habeas corpus allegation but the thing that makes this case such a monstrous front to the Due Process Clause is that the -- these facts are proven to be true. 
    Here is a record furnished by the State which shows what happened to this man, shows that we did have an ignorant and mentally unbalanced man that was put to trial in a complicated case that could not defend himself. 
    These aren't allegations. 
    These are facts proven by the State. 
    The claim is made that the petitioner furnished the record to the State in this case. 
    The fact finding power of those in prison is rather limited and I would call Your Honors' attention, first, to page 24 of the record which describes the transcript of testimony as Exhibit D attached to the respondent's return. 
    The State of Florida prepared this record and it is shown that that is the fact that's attached to their return. 
    Now, petitioner was so upset when he received this return in Raiford without a copy of the trial testimony that he filed the motion in the Supreme Court of Florida which is contained at page16 of the record. 
    And he says, "The State has filed a return. 
    They had Exhibit C and D, including the trial testimony and I didn't get a copy of it and I can't make any reply to the return because I don't have a copy of it." 
    Not only did the petitioner not prepare the record but he wasn't sure it was a copy of the record until some later date.So I think all of the discussion that was had about how this petitioner prepared the record is beyond me. 
    This record was prepared by the State and it was not served on petitioner inquiries and until some further proceedings were taken.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6563.292" stopTime="6565.344">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It was about the serving.
speaker="sam_daniels" startTime="6565.344" stopTime="6900.021">
    Mr. Sam Daniels 
    Yes, sir. 
    The contention is made that the claimed right to counsel is a pure afterthought in a mere makeweight argument thrown in the petition for habeas corpus below. 
    If Your Honors will examine pages 7 to 14 of this printed record, which is half of the petition itself, you will find rather eloquent language of a good prison lawyer discussing vigorously the right to counsel, citing all of the cases that we're talking about today using the fine language of Mr. Langbein in the Cash case. 
    This is not an afterthought. 
    The suggestion that the Florida practice is to furnish counsel and so on leads me to ask this. 
    If it's so customary to appoint counsel in Florida, why is it that admittedly half of the habeas corpus petitions in the State come from the fact that they were tried without counsel? 
    As to the fact that McNeal's cross-examination was so brilliantly conducted, I call Your Honors' attention to the cold facts of the record at page 28. 
    He wanted to argue about whether the prosecuting witness had struck him or whether it was his brother. 
    And he made the statement, "You said you hit me but Earnest was the one that hit me." 
    The court stopped him right there and said, "No, that is testifying." 
    Now, that's the last thing that the petitioner ever said at his trial on his behalf other than his testimony. 
    Now, question was asked concerning the judge's help and how judges help these indigent and defenseless prisoners. 
    That page right there shows how much the judge helped him. 
    If we read the questions that the judge did ask, he didn't ask what the petitioner was trying to find out. 
    He didn't ask which of the Scurry's hit him. 
    He didn't do that at all. 
    But what did he do? 
    He extended a guiding hand to the prosecution because it forgot to prove its element of premeditation. 
    It forgot to ask if when McNeal was first in the "Blue Chip", he had a shotgun with him. 
    Is the trial judge helping this petitioner when he's asked of the witness, "Did he have a gun or anything with him when he was in there that you know about?" 
    Answer, "No." 
    Why would the Court ask that question? 
    For one and only one reason, to prove that McNeal had to leave the café, go somewhere and get a shotgun and come back. 
    That's not much this trial judge helped this petitioner. 
    And I defy any explanation of the refusal to conduct a medical examination under the Florida statute when not only did the record show release from the psychotic ward within 13 months prior to the commission of the offense but through one extent, Mr. Justice Whittaker, in answer to your question, I should have told you that, at page 42 of the record, the testimony is that, while he was discharged 13 months ago, he still went back to the hospital to get pills. 
    That is the record. 
    He was receiving treatment of some kind, presumably tranquilizers, I don't know, at the time of the commission of his offense. 
    Now, it is argued that since petitioner had enough sense to stay in the Army for six years, then he had enough sense to conduct his own defense in this criminal trial. 
    I deny the validity of the major premise and also point out that we do not know when his head injuries were received with reference to his service in the Army. 
    If his head injuries were received upon discharge, then the fact that he was in the Army would mean nothing. 
    As to what being a GI student means in this record, I do not know. 
    There are trade schools that you can go to under the GI Bill. 
    I suppose you can go to high school or any other school on it. 
    We come back to this fundamental proposition. 
    This is not a case where we have to sit and read allegations and then say inquiry must be made. 
    This is a case where we know what happened. 
    It's proven by the records furnished by the State of Florida. 
    This is not something that we might get excited about in the future. 
    This is the cold brutal facts of what went on in the State of Florida. 
    This ignorant, mentally unbalanced petitioner was tried without counsel in a case that involved extremely complicated issues of substantive law so complicated that the learned Attorney General, in speaking this morning, has made some statements which we are in a position to deny on the substantive issues. 
    The evidentiary problems are complicated enough that we're even arguing them here before Your Honors this morning. 
    Add the man that the petitioner was, the defense which he could not make but so desperately needed and add the type of issues that were involved in this case and we respectfully submit that the trial below in the State of Florida was much more upfront to the fundamental dignities of mankind. 
    Thank you.
