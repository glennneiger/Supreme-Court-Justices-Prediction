    Mr. William E. James 
    Third. 
    Thank you. 
    Now, I will proceed in regard to these exhibits. 
    As you recall, we've examined the exhibits that are -- were before the Court on the motion for change of venue made by petitioner Moya, joined in by petitioner Baldonado on January the 13th, 1959. 
    Among the exhibits was the Oxnard Press Courier. 
    A town in the Ventura County close to the City of Ventura in which on the front pages headline, or rather not headline, the picture of petitioner Duncan and it states, "Daughter-in-law, missing impersonation jails woman." 
    This continued in the other exhibits that were before the Court, Exhibit Number 12, which was the Ventura County Star Free Press of December 17th, related authorities fear attractive nurse foul play victim. 
    And the story is -- commences authorities in Santa Barbara now are convinced that all the Duncan attractive three-year-old nurse and wife of Attorney Frank Duncan met with foul play. 
    And it continues, gives the facts which the news media obtained which it reported in the public press.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you, do you have a brief in the Duncan case also?
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="118.244" stopTime="160.254">
    Mr. William E. James 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We filed a brief in the Duncan case, in the Baldonado case and the Moya case, separate briefs in all three cases. 
    On December 18th, the next day, and this is all prior to the finding of -- of the victim's body, Olga Duncan in the Ventura County Star Free Press which is Exhibit Number 13 before the trial court is the headline "Ex-convict sought for rolling Duncan fake annulment". 
    DA says man post as lawyer and it has a picture of Ralph Winterstein who is the codefendant with petitioner Duncan in the fake annulment proceedings. 
    On the succeeding dates --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="160.254" stopTime="162.567">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did he plead guilty too?
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="162.567" stopTime="208.180">
    Mr. William E. James 
    As I recall, yes. 
    And he testified in the trial of Elizabeth Duncan which occurred from February the 20th to the 16th of March. 
    On December 19th, Exhibit Number 14, the Ventura County Star Free Press, there is a story on the front page, "Chase of the Fake Annulment." 
    She witness gives DA valuable information and a story is placed in the paper, they're concerning this fake annulment proceeding. 
    Then on the succeeding day, Saturday, December 20th, there is the report in the Ventura County Star Free Press, December 20th Exhibit 15 (a), kidnapped murder charges filed in case of missing nurse, mother-in-law, two men held.

    Succeeding day.
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="602.728" stopTime="827.333">
    Mr. William E. James 
    -- or the Saturday paper reported the filing of the conspiracy charge in Santa Barbara Friday, and Sunday he confessed and led the authorities to the crime, and Exhibit Number 30 which is the -- an issue of the Los Angeles Times of December 22nd contains two articles relating to this matter. 
    One, relates, body and missing bride on earth may have been buried alive, man confesses, points to grave, contains a story of the confession of finding of the body, a picture of the victim as well as one of the defendants. 
    Also, in the same issue of the Los Angeles Times, is a little chronology which is captioned police reconstruct kidnap murder events. 
    Now, this is police reconstruct the kidnap murder event. 
    So far, there's certainly been no conduct of the District Attorney to which we have reference to and to which this Court limited the granting of certiorari on the question of publicity and the question whether the defendants could obtain a fair and impartial jury for their trials in February and April of 1959. 
    On December 22nd, Monday, which is Exhibit 3, which has been referred to by counsel for petitioners and has been incorporated in one of their briefs is the issue of Ventura County Star Free Press of Monday, December 22nd, in which it is related that Olga's body found in County, nurse was beaten, strangled. 
    And a news report relating that suspect admits murder for hire in Casitas' place. 
    Now, in the separate article on the same page, on the same date, is a headline which reads, "DA urges death term in killings." 
    (Inaudible) plurally writer of the caption and I believe counsel for these petitioners have said that they do not attribute to the District Attorney the headline or the caption on any article. 
    But the caption was written by one who understood this as a statement of the District Attorney about his position on capital punishment, nothing more. 
    And he, at this time, it says, "The District Attorney, Roy Gustafson, today saw the Duncan murder as a reason for continuation of California's death penalty." 
    He issued the following statement, and then it relates what is set forth in this addition to which reference has been made. 
    Now, we submit that this is a statement of the District Attorney in relation to his position on capital punishment, and as we point in one of the later exhibits, he had a purpose in doing it. 
    Petitioners would say, it was a sinister purpose. 
    It was not, it was because he is one of the outspoken advocates of retention of capital punishment in California. 
    The legislature within a short week and a half we're going to meet and as we'll see in one of the exhibits, the -- there were to be two measures which were going to be quite important measures before that legislative session in regard to abolition of capital punishment. 
    And so the District Attorney was making his statement in regard to proposed to a pending legislation. 
    And there's nowhere in here any relation to his asking that the citizens of Ventura County arise against these particular defendants. 
    He is merely making his statement urging that the people retain as one of two alternative punishments in California for murders, the death penalty. 
    And that's what it is, pure and simple. 
    That's what the District Attorney said it was. 
    That was accepted by the trial judge in his ruling thereon was accepted by the States upon report.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="827.333" stopTime="854.853">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But of course Mr. James, if in fact, if in fact the District Attorney makes a statement regarding a pending case which fairly considered may poison the minds of prospective jurors. 
    The fact that at the time, California was seriously considering measures dealing with the abolition of capital punishment wouldn't -- wouldn't make a difference, would it?
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="854.853" stopTime="875.872">
    Mr. William E. James 
    I agree with you, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    Obviously, if any statement by District Attorney so inflamed the minds of prospective jurors in Ventura County that they could not render a fair verdict and give the defendant a fair and impartial trial. 
    The purposes of a District Attorney would have no consequence. 
    But we're merely pointing this out to show --

    Mr. William E. James 
    Unfortunately, we have a number in -- in the State of California. 
    And he referred I believe in one statement to the Glatman case which was a -- a case that received a great deal of notoriety. 
    The defendant there killed three women before he was apprehended in the process of strangling a fourth. 
    And he had also obtained the death penalty and I think the District Attorney took occasion to make reference to that. 
    Now, on December 23rd, Exhibit Number 31, there is an article in the Los Angeles times which relates the -- relates as to the murder case in Ventura County and it says, "Blackmail charged in bride slayer." 
    And also relates and we've referred to it in our briefs to a statement made by Defense Counsel. 
    Defense Counsel was making statements of this time and it refers to Mr. Sullivan who represented the petitioner Duncan it said, Sullivan who talked for two hours to Mrs. Elizabeth Duncan 54 today, said tonight, "I firmly believe that these two men maintained a bitter grudge towards the Duncan family and they resorted to murder in an attempt to blackmail this poor woman." 
    Now, the news media were reporting just exactly what occurred. 
    They reported the confession of Baldonado, the finding of the body, the fact that Olga was murdered. 
    They later reported the confession of Moya which occurred on or about Christmas Day in 1958. 
    They reported that the petitioner Duncan said she was innocent. 
    They reported that the petitioner's attorney thought she was innocent. 
    Certainly, there's been no slanting of the press in this regard. 
    There could be no claim that the people were so prejudice against these defendants that they could not fairly and impartially consider evidence presented at a trial to be held a month and a half later and more than that in the case of Mrs. Duncan and solely on the penal -- on the penalty issue in April as to Duncan, as to Baldonado and Moya.

    This is Exhibit Number A4 which was an exhibit on the application of Moya on April 16th, because this happened after his motion for change of venue made on January 13. 
    This is the Exhibit A4 which is dated January 29th, 1959. 
    It's a Ventura County Star Free Press. 
    The headline of this article is, "Moya admits nurse's murder" and it contains the sub caption, "Insanity, his sole defense for slayer." 
    It has a picture of defendant Moya, his counsel, Mr. Henson, and then in a separate story, attorney explains move criticizes DA's actions, in part of the criticism which was apparently a press statement by counsel representing Moya is one thing that troubles me about this case is the fact that the District Attorney appears to be following a course of selective prosecution and selective retribution. 
    It appears as so the District Attorney is again deciding who is to be prosecuted and who will be a target of retribution. 
    And it continues on in that same thing complaining that the District Attorney had not filed charges against an -- an additional person who introduced Moya and Baldonado to Mrs. Duncan in Santa Barbara.

    To answer Justice Frankfurter's question in regard to this radio broadcast, this is, as I say A4, the Exhibit of Thursday, January 29th, Ventura County start to be pressed. 
    Right next to the column in which the District Attorney is criticized by one of Defense Counsel, because he didn't institute charges against additional defendants. 
    It says, "Moya confession broadcast set." 
    This is the front page of the paper. 
    "Luis Moya's Christmas night confession of the slang of all the Duncan will be broadcast by a tape recording tonight at 7 o'clock on KUDU, Ventura, 1590 kilo cycles." 
    Moya's confession was recorded by sheriffs' officers and was then released to his attorney Burt Henson who rerecorded it and gave the recording to KUDU station spokesman said today. 
    Henson recorded a prologue and epilogue with the confession. 
    That concludes the news announcement.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And after -- after the confession in the finding of the body, was it front page news for days thereafter?
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="1665.172" stopTime="1865.762">
    Mr. William E. James 
    From time to time when the matters were -- was scheduled for court hearing, it was published on the front page. 
    As you will see from examining some of the exhibits, it was relegated to the second and third pages from time to time, and was not as fully covered by the press when the trials commenced by then the news coverage. 
    Particularly the trial of Mrs. Duncan, there was news coverage with by press photography and other news media of the trial proceedings of Mrs. Duncan. 
    That was reported in the press both in Ventura and in Santa Barbara County. 
    Now, on December 23rd, there is a -- this is Exhibit Number 16. 
    Ventura County Star Free Press, this is front page headline, "Husband of slain nurse missing sought by District Attorney -- by DA." 
    Grand jury set for murder case. 
    And it relates the fact that the District Attorney is going to present to the grand jury of Ventura County the murder case. 
    The succeeding issues of the Ventura County Free Press do not contain necessarily front page stories. 
    One is a story that appears on an internal page, "Olga's dead claims body." 
    Now, that's Exhibit Number 17, it's Wednesday, December 24th, 1958. 
    On December 26, that's Friday, the day after the confession by Moya, there's a headline in the Ventura County Star Free Press Exhibit Number 18, "Moya admits he kidnapped the nurse and it relates the grand jury hear story of kidnapped murder of Olga." 
    And it relates the confession of Moya and the fact that the grand jury was here for the matter. 
    Now, likewise on December 26 in the Oxnard Press Courier, there is a headline, "New confession in slain reported, mother-in-law case before grand jury." 
    And there are pictures of two of the defendants, Attorney Frank Duncan and the District Attorney in the Oxnard paper. 
    In the Ventura County Star Free Press of December 27th, which is Exhibit 5, there is the headline and a sub-caption, "Hint brain injury to Mrs. Duncan." 
    And it contains a statement made by hers attorney son to the press in regard to the suffering of brain damage by his mother and his statements that there was no indication that she would have done such a thing. 
    Likewise on Monday, December 29, there is in the Ventura County Star Free Press which is Exhibit 9, state in heart attack since Mrs. Duncan to a hospital which she lands back in jail cell. 
    Now on the next day, there is -- there appears in the Ventura County Star Free Press the statement in regard to the transcript of the grand jury and it says, "Lured murder plot beard in transcript." 
    Secret testimony tells of hiring, the hiring of the two --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, what date was that?
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="1867.114" stopTime="1988.447">
    Mr. William E. James 
    This is Tuesday, December 30th. 
    This is the Ventura County Star Free Press which is Exhibit Number 8 in the application or change of venue made on January 13th by defendant Moya and joined in by defendant Baldonado. 
    And it was also incorporated by reference as I recall in the application for change of venue made by petitioner Duncan on February the 16th. 
    Now, the front page contains the report, the summary of the grand jury proceedings. 
    On the interior page, page 6, the caption of the headline continues the testimony in Duncan murder revealed. 
    And on a separate, in the separate article on the same page, is the second article, which is attributed to the District Attorney in which counsel for these petitioners are so critical and it is captioned and they don't blame the District Attorney for the caption but the caption is, "Roy Gustafson explains why yell asked death penalty for Duncan murder trio." 
    Now, as it will be seen by an examination of these exhibits a full month later, the District Attorney had still not told the press that he was going to ask for the death penalty in this case. 
    And as you read the story, you will see that the District Attorney is again merely giving his reasons why he thinks capital punishment should be retained in California. 
    And he describes the purposes of punishment and he gives to retribution a -- a prime position and relegates to a lesser ground rehabilitation and protection of the public. 
    But it's strictly a statement by the District Attorney in regard to capital punishment a matter that was to be before the state legislature to which was to convene in a matter of few days. 
    Now --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. James, may I -- may I just interrupt to ask you if -- if it is claimed that there was any slanting of the -- of the news for the purpose of -- of prejudicing any of the petitioners in this case or was there any editorial matter in the newspapers that is complained of by these people.
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="2012.916" stopTime="2016.849">
    Mr. William E. James 
    There is -- they had no complaint that I know of that there was slanting of the news.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="2017.244" stopTime="2028.247">
    Mr. William E. James 
    As I recall, there were some editorials that appeared both in the Oxnard Press Courier and also in the Ventura County Star Free Press in regard to capital punishment.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2028.247" stopTime="2028.935">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    Well, are they --
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="2028.935" stopTime="2030.601">
    Mr. William E. James 
    They have been referred to.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2030.601" stopTime="2031.568">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They have been referred to in the case.
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="2031.568" stopTime="2032.325">
    Mr. William E. James 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2032.325" stopTime="2034.072">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, you shouldn't be bothered about that.
speaker="william_e_james" startTime="2034.072" stopTime="2151.226">
    Mr. William E. James 
    But as we will see, these particular Exhibit 8 is interesting for a number of reasons on the back page which is page number 14 is one of a number, I believe three letters to the editor in response to the statement by the District Attorney on capital punishment which had appeared in this paper on December 22nd. 
    And all three of them, took a position opposite than -- from the District Attorney on the issue of whether capital punishment should be retained in California. 
    And it obviously was clear that the District Attorney was merely making his statement on capital punishment or was publishing the paper, letters by people who disagreed with the District Attorney's position on capital punishment. 
    There was no intent. 
    There was no campaign to require or to force the jury in Ventura County to render the death penalty in the cases of these three defendants. 
    They were now defendants but they obviously had not been convicted. 
    They were entitled to a fair trial by an impartial jury and that's what they were going to get. 
    On the same page as the District Attorney's statement in regard to capital punishment is the little caption, "Duncan defender hits DA." 
    And it says District Attorney Roy Gustafson was accused of going along way to prejudice and jury that might hear the Duncan murder case. 
    The accusation came from Mrs. Elizabeth Duncan's defense attorney, S. Ward Sullivan who charged that Gustafson's public statements using this case as an argument in favor of capital punishment are a very obvious effort to influence a verdict. 
    His remark Sullivan said, certainly will influence potential jurors in Ventura County. 
    Gustafson is going a long way to see that these defendants do not receive a fair and impartial trial of the hands of an unbiased and unprejudiced jury. 
    Now, this was --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What date is that?

    Mr. William E. James 
    This is December 30th, 1958. 
    They were already announcing their proposed grounds in the event of a conviction. 
    They obviously haven't even attempted to find if they could've obtained a fair and impartial jury in Ventura County. 
    They were already announcing that they could. 
    Well obviously, a fair reading of all of these exhibits which the trial judge did would not convince anybody that the citizens of Ventura County will become so in plain by these two articles on capital punishment. 
    They couldn't' render a fair and impartial verdict in the trial as to petitioner Duncan on the issue of guilt and penalty and as to the penalty issue on the defendants Moya and Baldonado.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2199.847" stopTime="2226.579">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Thus not merely the two articles, but this circulation of the confession because it's -- if merely the fact that grand jury minute a public documents right pleading, the District Attorney wasn't contend to rely on that. 
    He himself was an active agent in putting it in circulation. 
    He didn't rely on the things being a public document.

    Mr. William E. James 
    Well of course, all of the news media at this time and this is on December 30th were reporting only what were -- was the fact and that was that Moya confessed and Baldonado had confessed --

    Mr. William E. James 
    That's true. 
    But this was a matter of interest to the press. 
    The press was publishing. 
    There is no claim that the press did not publish what was false. 
    That the -- that there was false publication in the press. 
    The press published what was the fact and if the hearing --

    No, Your Honor. 
    There -- these defendants were entitled of fair and impartial trial by jurors who, if they had formed any opinion from these newspaper clippings would be able to put those opinions aside and decide the case solely on the basis of the evidence produced at the trial and the instructions as given to them by the Court.

speaker="william_e_james" startTime="2975.225" stopTime="3136.742">
    Mr. William E. James 
    I have realized how it had been running. 
    I have just some brief references that I might make to these other exhibits. 
    And as I say, I will ascertain if they are before the Court, because these are the exhibits which formed the basis of these defendants' applications for change of venue. 
    They were the matters before the trial court and upon which he ruled as to whether there should have been a change of venue in this case and certainly, the trial judge could have taken in the consideration his own experience and the fact that jurors would not be inflamed by the articles that appeared here. 
    He could take cognizance of the fact that for the most part, these articles merely related the facts without any slanting. 
    And as far as I know so far, there's been no claim that there was slanting of any newspaper reports. 
    And you will see as you read through these exhibits as they continue on, pictures of Defense Counsel. 
    In fact, there is one article which contains a very nice story giving a biography of Defense Counsel for petitioner Duncan. 
    Mr. Sullivan give -- relates his long and distinguished career before the bar. 
    There is also an article of the District Attorney. 
    It's quite evident and the petitioners here have never been able to establish that there was any slanting of the news here. 
    There was a fair and full news disclosure. 
    The news media was not perverted or slanted by anyone, nor particularly not by the District Attorney. 
    And obviously these defendants could and did get a fair jury trial in Ventura County. 
    On February the 16th, many, many days have gone by from the first publication of these articles to which reference has been made. 
    Since the first article was December 15, a total of 63 days had gone by. 
    Obviously, the trial judge on his ruling on a motion for change of venue could consider that jurors would have forgotten as it's already been said, most people barely read the news. 
    And obviously, they retained the news for only a short period of time. 
    It served no purpose to rule at Ventura County, the citizens of Ventura County and there's been some reference that it's a rural county. 
    Well obviously, it's not a rural county. 
    On the 1960 census, it had almost 200,000 population of the 58 counties in California which is a fairly populous state. 
    It ranked number 15 among the county, so it was not a rural county in California. 
    And obviously, the jury panels were not exhausted. 
    If the jury panels were exhausted before they could have gotten any jury, this would have any good basis --

speaker="william_e_james" startTime="3393.484" stopTime="3607.707">
    Mr. William E. James 
    Well he was -- he was referring to crimes in that caliber and I think in a later quoted statement in the press, they -- he refers to other crimes of a similar nature. 
    Now as I say, before I pass this point, the exhibits which I assume are before the Court, I think the Court will want to read because obviously as you read those exhibits, the references to which we made to Defense Counsel statement, it will become manifestly clear that there was no conduct by the District Attorney as such which resulted in publicity and which prevented these defendants from obtaining in Ventura County their impartial jury. 
    Now, turning to the point to which the Duncan matter relates and which relates not at all to the other two cases and that was the question certified on the granting of certiorari in this case, was the petitioner's right to a fair trial is guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America denied? 
    Was there a violation where in a trial of a capital offense by jury? 
    The trial court permitted to remain in the jury box and sit in judgment three jurors who would enter the jury box with fixed opinions as to petitioner's deal and retain such opinions while being examined on voir dire. 
    Well obviously, the petitioner here had overstated herself in her application for certiorari because there was no permitting by the trial judge in this case. 
    There was never any motion, there was never any challenge for causing interpose, challenge of any nature interpose by petitioner Duncan as to these three jurors who sat Hall, Bertsch and Horrell. 
    And obviously, the statement that they entered the jury box with fixed opinions and retained such opinions while being examined on voir dire is not supported by the record. 
    It obviously wasn't the question addressed to these particular jurors or not post by the District Attorney in this so-called technique that's been referred to the District Attorney. 
    They were post by Defense Counsel himself in the case of Ms. Hall, who Ms. Hall who sat and not the Ms. Hall who was excused. 
    This is the question, "Do you know of any reason whatsoever why you could not be fair and impartial as a trial juror in this case? 
    Answer, "No sir, I do not." 
    Mr. Sullivan, "No further questions." 
    The Court, "Did you pass for a cause?" 
    Mr. Sullivan, "Yes, Your Honor." 
    And this is page 648 of the transcript in the Duncan case. 
    Now obviously, these petitioners have no case here on these either points. 
    They made no effort to preserve this constitutional point as they assert it in the trial court. 
    They made no effort to raise it in the automatic appeal in the State Supreme Court. 
    I understand that there's been lodged with this -- this Court. 
    The briefs filed on behalf of petitioner Duncan in the State Supreme Court. 
    I have here my copy of the appellant's opening brief. 
    The first point is the trial court committed prejudicial error in disallowing appellants' challenges for cause for actual bias.

    Not necessarily. 
    Obviously, our position is the trial court was not wrong as to the four and we have stated that in our briefs. 
    The State Supreme Court went into this matter. 
    This was the issue before the State Supreme Court and I think this was quite clearly set forth in the opinion of the unanimous State Supreme Court where the statements by each of the jurors on the voir dire was summarized, and the Court concluded that pursuant to Penal Code Section 1076 of California Penal Code that these jurors were not disqualified.

    And in one publication, this was all before any grand jury transcript was published. 
    The District Attorney, this is on December 22nd in the Los Angeles Times, said, "I was tired of waiting for somebody to do something with this case so I ordered my men to question Baldonado."

    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    Alright now, with respect to the confessions then, December 26th, 1958 issue of Exhibit of Star Free Press with the headline, Moya admits he kidnapped nurse. 
    The article reads, "Moya reportedly told about the same story as Baldonado of the murder." 
    Gustafson, the District Attorney said, "The confession revealed the pair had driven to the apartment of Olga on November 18th and that Moya had gone to the door telling the attractive nurse that her husband Frank, from whom she was estranged, was in the car and wanted to talk to her."

    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    That was the Ventura County Star Free Press, December 22nd, Exhibit 18. 
    Then it goes on, "Baldonado has confessed participation in the kidnap slaying" and says, "He was hired with Moya by Mrs. Duncan according to Gustafson." 
    Now if you go back, this case came alight around December 15th and this -- the first major headline was lead sought in bizarre plot. 
    This was December 16th. 
    The fake annulment charge jails three nurses in this. 
    Thereafter, these statements were made by the District Attorney or associated law enforcement officer, that is investigators working in his office, under his personal control. 
    First of all, DA says man post as lawyer. 
    This is about Winterstein. 
    And in this article, Gustafson says, "I feel very strongly," Gustafson said that there might not have been any disappearance that Olga Duncan had we'd been able to move on the case in October. 
    The next day, December 19th, key witness gives DA valuable information.This was Star Free Press Exhibit 14. 
    And in this, the District Attorney says preferring to Mrs. Duncan, "She has been through enough annulment proceedings to have known that what she obtained here August 7th, was not a legal annulment."

speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="4818.372" stopTime="4886.933">
    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    Yes, sir. 
    On the bottom of page 16, a client believes and they're on alleges that there is widespread and deep-seated prejudice against the defendants and the above and titled case. 
    Client believes and thereon alleges that a primary reason for the existing prejudice, this is the fact that certain public officials made certain public statements concerning above and titled case. 
    And going on some high ranking public officials publicly expressed their opinions concerning the case, other public officers released information to the press and other public media concerning the investigation. 
    Many of such statements were made before any legal tribunal had heard any evidence. 
    Many of such statements divulge information which would not have in any way constituted legal evidence in a trial. 
    The statements of opinion published would probably have been classified as prejudicial misconduct as stated in a court law, then I go on and recite Roy Gustafson, the duly elected acting District Attorney served in that capacity for approximately eight years. 
    Then --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4886.933" stopTime="4898.995">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, do you -- you don't -- with that paragraph, you don't necessarily charge him, do you?

    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    Yes.

    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    A number of -- that is many of the individual statements were not set forth in the affidavit but were contained in the existence which I was about to recite to the Court but I'm not able to do so by that part.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4946.560" stopTime="4963.485">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, there isn't there a difference in the -- in which you're expecting to respond to depending upon whether you charge him with something in an affidavit or whether -- or whether you just file a group of newspapers?

    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    Yes.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did you file the affidavit? 
    I -- I take it that -- that he would be -- he should respond to it, so it would make an issue on your motion for change of venue. 
    But if you -- if you just put in a lot of newspapers, would -- would he have to deny everything that's in the newspapers?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, you may.
speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="4989.663" stopTime="5020.525">
    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    -- say anytime preparing an affidavit without making it too long, but we did cite some of the things such as he did state in the -- in his interview with Marvin Sasona, the describing reasons why a death penalty should be applied here. 
    He had said that Moya had been using marijuana when he was arrested, which was false and which he did deny --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5020.525" stopTime="5021.314">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    He denied that, didn't he?
speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="5021.314" stopTime="5023.591">

    He denied making that statement.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="5024.356" stopTime="5080.527">
    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    Then the statement now, at further on down page 19 headline, "Heart attack sends Mrs. Duncan to hospital." 
    District Attorney Roy Gustafson this morning said that Mrs. Duncan's illness may have been real but added that, this is a trick used by many persons in jail in a serious charge. 
    It is known as suspects fake illnesses to get into a hospital where there's a chance to escape. 
    Further on down, Santa Barbara Police Lieutenant Charles Thompson, the execution of the $6000 slaying was called by Santa Barbara Police Lieutenant Charles Thompson, the most cold-blooded crime I've ever heard. 
    And then I perhaps don't specifically bring out other articles. 
    There were some 35 exhibits attached to the affidavit.

    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    No. 
    It was offered on that specific purpose for change of venue to support the affidavit. 
    Then of course the affidavit also points out that the same things that were contained this page 22, the above entitled case has also been discussed and commented upon by practically every radio and television newscaster in the Los Angeles Ventura County area. 
    The broadcast which our client has heard was in substance the same as that reported in newspapers attached hereto its specifics.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well Mr. Henson, on the 10th day of January, when that affidavit was -- was made, every fact that you complained of in there that has not been denied by the District Attorney, was made known to you and to the public and to the press of course, through the -- the regular records in this case, were they not?
speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="5151.972" stopTime="5153.675">
    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    No, Your Honor. 
    There were many, many things.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Alright. 
    Now what things that -- what things do you charge him with that -- that were not -- that did not stem from the -- in your affidavit? 
    What -- what things do you change him with that were not in the testimony of the grand jury before the grand jury?
speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="5170.011" stopTime="5184.909">
    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    For example, the testimony before the grand jury insofar as Moya was concerned didn't say anything about his prior criminal record and that was fully brought out by the District Attorney's statements.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5184.909" stopTime="5187.630">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    I -- I didn't charge him specifically.

speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="5207.425" stopTime="5225.703">
    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    Your Honor, the motion for change of venue was not direct solely at the District Attorney. 
    It was on the broad general ground that petitioner could not have a fair and impartial trial in Ventura County at which the --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5225.703" stopTime="5250.262">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, if -- if that's the purpose of it, is one thing, but if you seek to -- to pass all of these things on -- on the District Attorney, then it seems to me that you have to charge him specifically with him with those things before you can say he has failed to deny them. 
    That's all I'm -- I'm concerned about now.
speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="5250.262" stopTime="5250.526">
    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    Yes.

    If you -- if you just want to take to thing in its totality, and say these things whether they came from the District Attorney, whether they came from a sheriff or a police officer, or anybody else, has applied to this -- has applied to this petitioner deprives him of a -- of a fair trial. 
    I can unders -- I can understand that, but this thing is sort of congealed around the District Attorney and if -- if he is to be charged with these things, it seems to me that he should -- and -- and in addition of being charged, if he's to be charged with not answering when he should have, it seems to me that we should be able to find those things in the affidavits supporting you -- your motion for change of venue.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I don't quite get the complete importance of the question you raised of the -- who did it. 
    It seems to me like if you were to try the right to -- if you were forced to try a case in a county where you should be because of the -- that feeling in that county, the question is whether you -- whether they should give you a change of venue. 
    And what difference would it make who said it except to the question (Inaudible)
speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="5347.347" stopTime="5360.918">
    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    Your Honor, I think there is a practical difference here. 
    One being that material purporting to him an aid from District Attorney would be more likely if he believe and --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think that -- that was -- give you a greater -- greater reason to get your change of venue?
speaker="burt_m_henson" startTime="5365.675" stopTime="5430.056">
    Mr. Burt M. Henson 
    Yes, plus the fact that he could release what information he wanted to. 
    For example, he released the -- the confessions of Moya and Baldonado but Mrs. Duncan had denied it and that wasn't released to the press. 
    And then I think there's something a lot deeper too and that is due process, as I understand it, means a denial of rights and whether the rights are denied by a trial judge in a trial or by other state officers such as the District Attorney or police officers that it makes no difference by which particular agency, due process is denied. 
    District Attorney, being a state officer, could clearly violate the person's right to due process such as in the cases of using purged testimony, willfully suppressing evidence favorable to the defendant.
