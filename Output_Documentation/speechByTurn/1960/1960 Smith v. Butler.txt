    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Gentlemen of the Court. 
    In response to some questions which were raised yesterday afternoon, I would like to point out that if the clause of the plaintiff's case in the trial of the court below, a motion for a directed verdict was made on the ground --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="30.843" stopTime="31.742">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible) the second trial?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="31.742" stopTime="117.718">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    The first trial. 
    The second trial, of course, was merely a profit. 
    A -- there are number of motions were made, but included in them were a motion for directed verdict on the ground that no actionable negligence under the Federal Employers' Liability Act had been proved. 
    There was another motion to strike all testimony as to the right to give the test to Smith. 
    There was a third motion to strike those allegations from the complaint, which dealt with the right to give Smith the test. 
    So you can see that all the fundamental issues in the case were properly raised by motion. 
    At the close of plaintiff's case, the judge took those motions under advisement. 
    The motions were renewed at the end of all of the testimony, and then they were brought up again after the verdict in the form of a motion for judgment, notwithstanding the verdict. 
    They were brought up for the fourth time in a motion for new trial. 
    So certainly, if the trial judge had ample opportunity to do what we think he should have done. 
    And when this got to the appellate court, the appellate court pointed out that the trial court had had ample opportunity to consider all these questions and they reversed it. 
    And remanded the case for a new trial for doing what they said he should have done, which was to give a new trial limited to the last six allegations of negligence in the complaint. 
    I hope I pointed out --

    Well, I think that's probably has something to do with it because if you look further on down, you'll find in allegations C through H. 
    There is alleged, the fact that he wasn't given a place -- safe place to work. 
    There's alleged that the test wasn't conducted properly, wasn't properly supervised and all that sort of thing. 
    They held that as a matter of law, the mere right to give a test was not negligence or the deprivation of that right was not negligence under the Federal Employers' Liability Act because everybody has conceded, including counsel for the plaintiff that this Board, that the railroad had the right to give a reasonable test. 
    And the complaint didn't say that the test was not reasonable.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What -- what comment have you got to the suggestion that the Supreme Court's opinion can be read -- could be read or the appellate court's opinion could be read, is saying that although there was a sufficient pleading under Florida law of negligence in the requirement of the test, nevertheless and because of the Railway Labor Act, that kind of negligence, so they're not actionable under the FELA.
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="222.018" stopTime="231.704">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    All I can say to that is that there are six allegations of the complaint, which clearly give him the cause of action for the thing he wants.

    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    And I don't think it's up to this Court or us, to try to read in to some mirky language in Sections A and B of the complaint or in the opinion and try to figure out that it means something else. 
    All this Court is concerned with is whether the right result was reached. 
    And the right result was reached because he was remanded for a trial on those issues which alleged negligence under the Federal Employers' Liability Act and where he was entitled to a trial. 
    And he was only deprived to the trial on those issues which did not constitute negligence under the federal act. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Harlan, that's about all I can say about it --

    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    I am afraid it is, but after all when you win a case and you win it on the right basis, if the court uses some dicta or some mirky language, you don't go back and say, "Judge, let's change this around a little, because he may change it and end up ruling for (Inaudible)."
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="289.168" stopTime="290.418">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I sympathize to that.
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="290.418" stopTime="463.032">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Now, let me impress upon the Court if I may. 
    The factual context in which the appellate court held that this motion for -- that this motion should've been granted and that there wasn't a cause of action stated as to the right to give the test. 
    In the first place, these are the undisputed facts. 
    Now, these are the facts that were before the Court at the end of the plaintiff's case and this is what the appellate court was dealing with. 
    We had mystified by fire Smith, the trainman, who had reduced from 327 to slightly under 300 pounds, but he was still a pretty hefty customer. 
    He was in his early 60s and according to the testimony of one of the witnesses, his condition was such that he couldn't even step up from the ground and get on the lower step to get into the coach. 
    He had to get a stool or something and stand on that and then get into the coach. 
    Now, the trainman's chief job as everybody admits, is to protect the rail of the train in case of emergency. 
    Fortunately, only too rarely, do we have a rear-end collision, but rear-end collisions or terrible vengeance. 
    And when there is some breakdown in the railroad mechanism and the rear of the train needs protection, that's what this man was on there for, to go back on sufficient distance to flag or put a fusee or put a torpedo. 
    Now, imagine having a man of those dimensions and those qualifications charged with that dreaded responsibility on a passenger train, loaded with people. 
    Now, there's not neither is there any question that it takes about a mile for passenger train to stop at such a -- in such a manner, as not to endanger the passengers. 
    There's no dispute about that when he's making the maximum speed which on the Florida East Coast, is 79 miles an hour. 
    Now, we can stop him sooner than that. 
    We stop one sooner than that a few weeks ago to avoid hitting a truck and we put 92 passengers in the hospital. 
    Now, it's to provide for the safety of the passengers that the train has to be stopped in a reasonable manner and that takes a mile. 
    There's no dispute about that. 
    Now, Smith himself testified that on prior occasions, he had gone back a mile or more to protect the train under circumstances where it was his duty to go back and protect. 
    On top of that, his counsel, my good friend, Bill Frates adverted to that fact in his argument before the jury. 
    And on top of that, the appellate court opinion, whatever else it may have wrong with it, is might good on this point, it also calls attention to the fact that he had to go back a mile. 
    Now, under those circumstances, with the man on the train almost entirely for the purpose of protecting of the railroad in the event of a mechanical failure or something happening which required the train to be protected.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="464.830" stopTime="562.168">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    What would be a reasonable test as to whether the man was able to perform his duties? 
    Can you think of any of the test on earth other than seeing if he could walk him off and that is the terrible, unrighteous, awful test that they are complaining about here. 
    We simply told Mr. Smith that because of your physical condition, he doesn't look to us like you're able to perform your duties. 
    And Smith said, "Well, I've just been up the hospital. 
    The doctor says I'm in good shape." 
    So we said, "Well, we still think that you order retirement." 
    He says, "No, I won't keep on." 
    So we said, "Alright, then you take a test." 
    Smith said, "He wasn't going to retire, he was going to take that test." 
    So, we put him out on a mile of the railroad in Dave County, the same county where Miami is, we didn't take him off to the jungle somewhere, as people of entity. 
    We had to get him off where there weren't any crossings or anything like that, whether there's straight mile of track. 
    And who was started out on the test? 
    Five people, two people from the railroad, Smith and he didn't bring one union chairman with him. 
    He brought two, so five of them started out. 
    The two railroad people walked long and unleashing pace, they made the mile in 19 minutes. 
    The two union chairmen, tried to be as good they could to their fat friend and slowed it down as much as possible, but they made the mile in 23 minutes. 
    What happened to -- just to file the fact, he never did make it [Laughter]. 
    It took him 32 minutes to make 3000 feet and he couldn't go any further, as one of his own human chairman testified, he failed with utter exhaustion.

    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    3000 feet, in 32 minutes. 
    Now, suppose you were a passenger on that train with your wife and your children and there were some mechanical failure, where about that trainman had to go back and protect you from another approaching train, how would you like your lives to be in the hands of a man who couldn't even walk a mile? 
    And you could only make 3000 feet in 32 minutes and it was in such shape at the end of that time, that he had to be taken to the hospital. 
    Is that an unreasonable test, gentlemen of the Court? 
    You can see why. 
    My friend, Mr. Frates, wanted to try the case on the basis of bias and prejudice as the appellate court said he did, rather than get down to the merits of this case and you can see why it was reversed.

    Mr. Justice Frankfurter that all sounds good, but if you'll just read paragraph (3) (c) through (h) of the same paragraph, you'll see that he properly alleged the things that are involved here and there wasn't any necessity to try to get strain constructions of some language up above, when it's clearly stated down below.

    The record is replete with the fact that tests were given everyday on the railroad as to fitness and efficiency. 
    And the man's own union chairman, one of those two fellows that took the 23 minutes to counsel off a little way, testified that the only kind of test that you could give a man under these circumstances was the kind of test that he was given.

    -- or I'd say, it wouldn't be a very happy situation. 
    The very -- many of our employees couldn't walk a mile when the -- their whole duty involved walking a mile to protect the rail of the train. 
    As a matter of fact, they had to walk two hours. 
    They got to walk a mile down and a mile back.

    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    No question about it. 
    He realized he couldn't get in anywhere other ways.

    That was the theory on which he tried it and he was -- the lower court was reversed for permitting to try it on that theory, because as he conceded yesterday, before the bar of this Court.

    And regardless to the errors that his predecessors have committed, when he came along and saw Mr. Five by Five couldn't even stand up and get on the lower step of the coach without put -- put under it. 
    He figured that the man could not safely protect the rail of the train and that's what it brought this up.

    No question about that. 
    That the new train master who came in, the new man incidentally, Mr. Smith, just gotten out of the hospital and come back. 
    He'd have a whole lot other trouble. 
    And he came back from the hospital claiming it was alright to go back to work and had a certificate from the doctor. 
    But the train master after he came back from the hospital saw him walking around and he just was afraid to entrust the lives of his passengers to that man without being sure that the man could perform his duties and protect the rail of the train. 
    I figure that question was going to come up but just because they made errors in the past, can maybe to risk passengers' lives by having a trainman who couldn't protect the rear of the train properly. 
    That isn't going to be in the defense. 
    If some -- if some train plows into rear of another and a whole lot of people are killed and hurt, regardless of our mistakes in the past, it's our duty to have safety at the present time.

    All of the testimony on the first trial which embraced the last six and the first two issues, which of course was improper.

    The other two dealt with the giving up the test. 
    The Court held under the opinion that I'm reading from page 332 that this was a pretrial part of the proceedings. 
    That on retrial, we are not going to be able to go into the propriety or impropriety of giving this particular test, although I did it, the original trial admit evidence on that fact and I felt that it was a question. 
    However, I have been reversed.

    Mr. William S. Frates 
    Your Honor, the Court held and may I read from 341, "But I would sure entered an order and this was discussing all of the remaining allegations on the pretrial before they were abandoned which was later on." 
    And here's what the appellate court said discussing those items and I refer to page -- page 340 and 341 in a discussion, a pretrial discussion, in trying to determine the issues in this case, over here on 340, "The remaining allegations were discussed." 
    Then the Court said, "But I would sure enter my order that I would sustain an objection to any testimony offered or proffered, which had to do with the grievance of the employed as the propriety of the right of being given this particular test on the basis of this opinion." 
    The evidence --

    It says that the other -- the other elements in the record show that the Court said that those are reasonable safe place to work. 
    We still stand on the fact of the negligent given test, which was a jury issue and the Court said that all the evidence in relation to that test, sir, was inadmissible and that's what the trial court held. 
    We could not put an isle of evidence about this test in -- before under any of this counsel and --

    Did you --

    Mr. William S. Frates 
    -- they ruled that in the first case.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did you make any of objections to a ruling which you -- I understand you to say was made, that you couldn't prove the allegation from (c) through (h)? 
    Did you object to that ruling that the Court wouldn't let you make proof from (c) through (h)?

    Mr. William S. Frates 
    No, sir. 
    No, sir, because the Court had said that they wouldn't permit any evidence.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1778.768" stopTime="1789.180">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, but you can object when the Court denies you something and you think the denial is wrong, the normal rudimental thing is to object to a wrong ruling not to yield to it.
speaker="william_s_frates" startTime="1789.180" stopTime="1825.363">
    Mr. William S. Frates 
    Yes, sir. 
    But I also did yield to one and two which said that the issue of this test was not a triable issue and we rely on that and didn't yield on -- on that issue. 
    And that is the whole basis of this case. 
    There has never been any contention by the railroad until here that the manner and the method of giving this test, their whole brief, their question say, "This was a proper test." 
    We say it was not a proper test, that this was a jury issue as to whether an improper, an unreasonable test became a -- a jury question under the FELA.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What you're saying in effect is that it made allocation negligence for the railroad to give any test however appropriate. 
    This test may have been in normal circumstances to a man who weighed X number of pounds and by whom they had this -- has knowledge, is that the theory of your case?
speaker="william_s_frates" startTime="1844.294" stopTime="1877.664">
    Mr. William S. Frates 
    That's one theory. 
    We also say that there is an issue as to whether or not this test was a reasonable test under the circumstances. 
    And that was the jury, whether it was a proper test, whether it had any relations to -- to his duty, whether that this was a test designed to get rid of him. 
    All of which evidence was adduced at the trial in which the jury believed. 
    And the jury believed that there was no requirement to go back a miles. 
    That was an issue.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, Mr. Frates, are those not the assignments that you abandoned?
speaker="william_s_frates" startTime="1883.516" stopTime="1928.900">
    Mr. William S. Frates 
    No, sir. 
    The only assignment that has been abandoned, the only thing that we could've shown is shown in the record by the Court, was to show that the erring where this man walks was a reasonably safe place under the circumstances. 
    That's the only fact that we could have proven as shown in the pretrial evidence and the rulings of the Court. 
    That was the only evidence we could and that wasn't the major issue in the case. 
    Thank you, gentlemen.
