Noto v. United States
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="6.402">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Francis Noto, Petitioner, versus the United States. 
    Mr. Davis.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="6.402" stopTime="233.105">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    I will address myself first to a paragraph in the Court's order for rehearing which I did not reach yesterday. 
    That is the question dealing with the application of the clear and present danger doctrine. 
    The question as it was stated in the Court's order reads, whether the clear and present danger doctrine as interpreted by counsel has application to the membership clause. 
    However, with respect to the accused, are with respect to the society, group or assembly of persons described in the statute, if that will hold whether such doctrine was or can now be properly applied in this case. 
    In the Dennis case, Judge Hand held that the clear and present danger doctrine as interpreted by him to meet that situation did apply to a conspiracy to organize a group to advocate violent overthrow and did apply to a conspiracy to advocate violent overthrow. 
    And he specifically found that on the record in that case, a clear and present danger then existed. 
    Now, in the principal opinion of the four Justices on the majority side of this Court and there was no opinion for the Court in the Dennis case, but in the principal opinion in which four Justices erred. 
    The Judge Hand's formulation of the rule and of the application to that set of circumstances was specifically affirmed. 
    The concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter however placed more weight on the congressional determination that speech should be regulated in this case and less emphasis upon the clear and present danger doctrine as applied by a Court. 
    It is our position that this doctrine should apply to the membership clause in precisely the same to the -- precisely the same extent that is applied to the organizing clause or the conspiracy clause. 
    If constitutional limitations on interferences with speech require some such overwriting limitations and the Court has generally held that it do, then it seems as though they should apply to all aspects of the Smith Act and reasonable of the application should be made here. 
    I think that some danger in -- in making this application in the -- in the original language of the rule, I think that Judge Hand was carrying through the spirit of the rule but certainly varying it from its original applications. 
    But for the present purposes I think that you do get a sufficient protection if you accept that rule. 
    That is, that in each case that must be asked whether the gravity of the evil discounted by its improbability justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid danger.

    Instead, the danger which was involved in the Debs case, the Abrams case was interference, a lesser interference and overthrow, but an interference was recruitment and all that was necessary in order to find a clear and present danger in that case was, if there was a clear and present danger that there would be some affirmative interference with enlistment and recruitment.

    The Act itself is suppose to -- it deal -- deals with advocacy. 
    And so, the majority of the Court said, "We have no need of following the clear and present danger doctrine because the legislature in that case of New York legislature has made a determination that free speech should be restricted to this extent." 
    Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent joined in by Brandeis in the Gitlow case said that he felt he still had to have a clear and present danger, but here when he was talking about a clear and present danger, he was talking about a clear and present danger of the offense which was defined in the statute.

    Or -- or what?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="649.236" stopTime="698.918">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    -- what it means is Congress in adopting the Smith Act, adopts an Act which says that advocacy which is a type of speech shall be restricted in these ways and they say it's necessary. 
    Congress said it is necessary because of the subversive activities which are recurring and that these organizations are controlled by foreign countries and it's proved dangerous in other countries and they well proved dangerous here. 
    And -- and a long, long basis of hearing from reports showing that it's necessary for this type of legislation in this restriction on free speech if you please, in order to protect the country from the danger of -- of violent overthrows. 
    Now, the majority --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="698.918" stopTime="702.667">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean, violent overthrow or advocacy of violence to overthrow?

speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="707.851" stopTime="749.433">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That's right. 
    Now, Congress has made a determination when it passes this Act that this limitation on free speech is essential for the welfare of the country. 
    And the question is, whether in that situation the Court should then, as a new matter make a determination of whether there is a clear and present danger or whether they should instead review and give weight to the determination by the Congress that there is a clear and present danger in that for this necessity of restriction on free states.

    Well there's still another view that might be taken and that is that even though you assume or trying that at the time the Congress acted, it was within its rights in making its legislative findings that take a long time for legislation to get appealed.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- that is challenged under the Due Process Clause, (Inaudible) regulation statute is found constitutional by this clause during the war and later on was found no longer to satisfy the requirement. 
    That it had become by -- of course by circumstances clearly the advocacy.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="813.361" stopTime="1019.875">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That -- that's right. 
    I think Mr. Justice Harlan that this is the refinement on -- on the weight to be given the decision of Congress rather than a third approach to it. 
    Although, you can cut this kind of argument and then you kind of (Inaudible) but it -- that's -- I would think that this was a -- was a refinement on the -- in giving weight to the congressional finding. 
    The second part of the Court's questions here is whether the test, whatever test it should be and I think there's some danger in tying it down to specific words, but whether the test should be applied to the accused or to the group. 
    Now, here we have a (Inaudible) different opinion with petitioners, both petitioners in -- in Scales and in Noto because we think it's perfectly obvious that the application under this statute should be to the group rather than to the individual. 
    In this respect, the offenses charged here are comparable to the conspiracy statute. 
    It's a type of statute which attacks the effect of group activity although the individual action of any one of the members of the group cannot itself be said to result in the -- in the effect which is to be prevented. 
    In the ordinary conspiracy case which we're all familiar with and I -- I'm not asserting that this is a conspiracy case. 
    It's of a similar nature. 
    In the ordinary conspiracy case, the individuals involved very likely cannot bring about the -- the evil plan which the group has planned and it couldn't prove that anyone of them was primarily responsible and it isn't important that you should. 
    And all that I'm suggesting is that it's not a strange concept to hold each one of these individuals responsible for the group actions to which he contributes even though you do not prove that there's any clear and present danger from his particular activity, the group activity which we are looking at. 
    Now, I wish to return for just a minute to what we were talking about yesterday as the activity factor in defining membership. 
    I don't think that this needs be considered as a complicated -- complicating additional element in the crime. 
    Congress has prescribed certain action and it has used the term membership. 
    And it's impossible for us to abide this Act to facts of individual cases without giving some meaning to that term membership. 
    Now possibly, it could have been construed to mean that the person was carried and enlist on the party role for the Communist Party then he would be a member. 
    But, in the first place it's far from clear that there are any party roles in this entirely -- seems entirely foreign to what Congress intended that they would want to impose a criminal liability on an individual because the party has put him on this role.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, the -- this -- I -- I'm not sure that active membership couldn't well be called membership per se. 
    I'm trying to give the -- the definition of what membership is and I think that active membership might well be called, could be called. 
    But the -- the reason that the Smith Act goes beyond membership per se is because it requires under the statute knowledge of the purpose of the organization and under the interpretation given in the Dennis case, it requires a specific intent to carry out those purposes. 
    And these are the additional elements that show that membership per se is not sufficient but I am trying to believe that my present argument as to membership, meaning active membership would include -- that active membership would be -- couldn't be considered membership per se.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Davis sir, something has been bothering me about your whole construction of the membership clause which as I understand is, I mean, as you presented to us, under that clause the Government has to prove associating a -- an association with an organization bent on the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence. 
    And this association has to be entered into by the defendant with a personal intent to overthrow the United States of America by force -- the Government by force or violence and that he has to be active in that association.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, I -- I -- in many cases, yes but not in all cases. 
    Now, of course it won't come within the organizing factor, that's been thrown out so that we can now deal with conspiracy (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    And I think that -- I don't think it would necessarily prove the advocacy feature. 
    This is only a question of whether it can prove the conspiracy feature as such. 
    A conspiracy has always been defined in -- as Mr. -- General Taylor points out yesterday, American Law Institute sticks to the thought that there must be an agreement. 
    There must be a specific conscious agreement of -- rather than as we have in this case, a mere association together. 
    It's very close and I'm not sure you couldn't prove a conspiracy in almost all of these cases but there are technical differences. 
    There is a technical difference which at least the American Law Institute has recognized between the conspiracy doctrine and just being a -- just associating yourself with this group.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1300.955" stopTime="1344.047">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now the -- in the Yates case, as I understand it, it was the Government's theory that the Communist Party itself with the -- was the conspiracy. 
    And I -- I have read the Court's opinion had the Court read that the -- that the proof of incitement to action to overthrow the Government of the United States at some convenient time was sufficient. 
    That -- that would have been a valid case under the -- under conspiracy section. 
    And why -- how is that different at all from the -- from the membership section as you've now beat it up --

    I -- I want to -- I wanted and I haven't been trying to beat it up but I'm just trying to interpret it, but the -- the -- in your -- you're quite right, in Yates, there were two elements. 
    We tried to prove conspiracy in two ways. 
    We tried to prove it once through their participation, their -- their formal action in connection with the party as such and that the nexus was then, what the party itself proved. 
    We also tried --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1373.758" stopTime="1377.534">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that the Court didn't accept. 
    I think purely as a matter of insufficiency of the evidence.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1377.534" stopTime="1443.266">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That is right. 
    Now, I think it's possible that in this case for example, certainly in the -- in view of Mr. Noto's conferences with -- with Lautner and his appearing with his joining together in -- in the various schools that you could've planned the conspiracy in this case. 
    You -- you do have the overt and active -- well, you don't need the overt and active conspiracy in the Smith Act. 
    But you do have the joining together, the specific joining together of this man with the other people to carry out the aims of the party and that would -- we could have put it under the -- the conspiracy charge. 
    It's a little harder. 
    You've got more to prove. 
    You've got to prove specifically the he did sit down with other people and do certain things. 
    I think it's proved in the case, but I -- the Government didn't undertake to make that proof in the case. 
    They undertook to make the proof only that he was unknowing an active member and whether his activity was in conjunction with somebody else and did not -- didn't undertake to prove.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    No, there wasn't.

    Mr. John J. Abt 
    Mr. Maroney says that the Yates standard was met not by what was said either by party members or by the petitioner here, but by the evidence on the party's concentration policy and the evidence as to the elaborate measures of concealment which were taken to protect party leaders and members. 
    It shows inference of the purpose of these activities was to prepare for the day at some uncertain future time when conditions with the auspicious for an attempt of that forcible overthrow. 
    It seems to me that all these inferences are, to say the least very farfetched. 
    But even if they're reasonable, they don't help the Government's case because Mr. Maroney's error is that he confuses steps in preparation of insurrection of some future time with present incitement to forcible overthrow in some future time. 
    The Yates case rejected evidence of precisely the kind that Mr. Maroney relied -- relies on. 
    Mr. Justice Harlan said in his opinion in that case, however much one may abhor even the abstract teaching of forcible overthrow the government or believed that forcible overthrow was the ultimate purpose to which the Communist Party is dedicated. 
    It is upon the evidence in this record and I assume that that means the evidence in this record on the question of incitement that the petitioners must be judged in this case. 
    And Chief Judge Clark in the Second Circuit disposed of the Government's contention in the United States versus Silverman where he said and I quote him, "The prosecution stresses the proof of industrial concentration and of concealment." 
    But these do not rationally raise any inference of the appellants engaged in a plot to advocate insurrection at the time they were hiding and seeking factory jobs. 
    The industrial concentration possibly suggest the conspiracy to commit sabotage, espionage or political strikes going beyond mere labor proselytizing. 
    But it not -- does not point very directly toward illegal exhortation. 
    Similarly, concealment is consistent with any unpopular or illegal enterprise, but the jury could not tell the nature of the enterprise from the mere fact of concealment. 
    Furthermore, Mr. Maroney did not and cannot point to any evidence of the advocacy of forcible overthrow even as a matter of abstract doctrine in the limitation period. 
    And he has no reply to my demonstration that he can't convict the petitioner on the theory of a presumption of continuance. 
    Now, not only is there is no evidence of party activity in the limitations period, but there's no evidence of any significant conduct by the defendant. 
    My brief at page 65 -- 66, I summed up everything in this record with respect to the activity of the respondent during the limitations period and here it is. 
    In September 1951, he solicited a $10 contribution to the party and talked about the American Labor Camp Party candidates with one witness. 
    In the same month, he told another witness he was going under a disguise to conceal himself. 
    Months later, he picked up some party publications which is -- his wife had left for him at the home of a witness and told this man that he had to move on. 
    And in 1953 or 1955, he lived in New Jersey where he was employed by the Goodyear Rubber Company as a stock clerk under an assumed name. 
    Now, how can any of that evidence be probative? 
    Number one, that the petitioner knew that the Communist Party was engaged in incitements to violence or second that he intended to overthrow the government by force and violence. 
    I say that obviously it can't to prove either of those propositions. 
    And certainly, none of the evidence in this record, either about the petitioner or about the Communist Party within the limitations period can conceivably establish to anything they were doing in this period created a danger even remotely to the Government, let alone a clear and present danger. 
    Now, I also want to say just a word about the -- in turning the -- the testimony about the man who was said to be on the lamb. 
    That incident was supposed to have occurred in the early spring of 1951 and it likewise therefore is outside of the statutory period. 
    All we know about that incident is the following, page 299 of the record. 
    That Noto said one of our top peoples on the lamb. 
    He said the government is trying to frame this man and throw him in jail. 
    He said it was over what the newspapers call was Adam's spy business. 
    He said it was necessary to get this man out of the country in order to get him out of the clutches of the law. 
    And he wanted to know if I were to give him shelter in my home. 
    But the man never showed up. 
    Nothing other -- ever further happened about the whole business. 
    There's nothing here to indicate that this man, whoever he was -- and by the way there's not the slightest suggestion in the record that he was either Rosenberg or in any way connected with Rosenberg. 
    There's nothing to show that whoever he was, he was engaged in any criminal activity at all. 
    At best, they mostly have is Noto's statement that the Government was trying to frame him. 
    He may have been a perfectly innocent man. 
    Even if he wasn't, as I indicated to Mr. Justice Stewart in response to a question yesterday, the whole incident might have some conceivable relevance to a prosecution for harboring or some crime of that kind that has nothing to do with incitement. 
    Now, just a word about the constitutional issues. 
    Mr. Davis said Dennis found a clear and present danger in the provisions denouncing conspiracy to organize and advocate and that takes care of all the crimes under the Smith Act. 
    But that obviously is not true and Yates itself demonstrates that that is not true. 
    Yates said that we construe the conspiracy to advocate provisions of the Smith Act as requiring proof of a conspiracy to engage in incitement now for future violent overthrow. 
    We don't have some of the questions of the constitutionality of a conspiracy to engage in incitement at some time in the future. 
    And we don't do it because a conspiracy to engage in incitement at some time in the future is one further removed from the advocacy itself. 
    Now, Dennis have decided all clear and present danger questions under all offenses created by the Smith Act, but obviously there would have been no necessity for that reservation. 
    It seems to me that the membership clause, even with all the garnishments that the Government gives it, is one step further removed either -- even from conspiracy to advocate incitement in terms of the incitement in the future. 
    Obviously, therefore you've got to consider whether the membership clause itself satisfies the clear and present danger doctrine. 
    Mr. Davis says, "Well, it's just like a conspiracy." 
    I tried to analyze the Act -- the statute yesterday and to show that it didn't bear any resemblance to that period. 
    All I want to say at this point is that it denies the defendant whatever is entitled to in a conspiracy case. 
    And that is a jury trial on the essential issues in a conspiracy case. 
    Was there a conspiracy? 
    Was the petitioner for the accused a participant in the conspiracy? 
    Did he perform some overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy? 
    And in addition, in a conspiracy case, an accused is entitled to instructions as to the character of the evidence which would be introduced against third party declarations. 
    Here, as I show in my brief and I haven't argued it here, time didn't permit. 
    The petitioner in this case was convicted on third party declarations of -- which were completely outside of his knowledge. 
    He knew nothing about and he didn't get the benefit of a conspiracy instruction that he would have had in a conspiracy case, to the effect that those declarations couldn't be used against him unless a jury first found that there was a conspiracy, that he was member of it, then the declarations and that the -- the client was also a member and that the declarations were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
    And all this proves the point that I was trying to make yesterday. 
    What the Government is asking for here is, is to validate this statute as a conspiracy law. 
    As I say employed the -- the difficulties that they found in securing convictions in the Smith Act conspiracy cases. 
    Thank you.
