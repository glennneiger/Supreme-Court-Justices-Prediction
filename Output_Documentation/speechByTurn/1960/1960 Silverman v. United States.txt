Silverman v. United States
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="0.000" stopTime="77.163">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    If the Court please. 
    I want to say a word about what the record shows on whether or not there was a trespass in this case. 
    Really hinges upon the same testimony which is involved in -- and we were discussing before lunch about how far the needle protruded into the wall. 
    The evidence of the Government witnesses -- under the evidence of the Government witnesses, this would not have protruded beyond the middle line of the party wall. 
    There is evidence of the police officers who had examined the plans of the house, as well as the rooms themselves that the walls were 13 to 14 inches thick and that includes trimming the baseboard and things. 
    But -- so that we get a -- we get 13 or 14 inches and the question is whether -- if you're going to find out whether there's been a crossing of the standard line, it would presumably have to be between six and a half and -- and seven inches but this would've had to go into the wall.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    In a party -- yes, the principle cases that followed the case, which is cited in our brief, and District of Columbia law is, apparently, the same as the law in most of the jurisdictions in the United States that each party continues to own up to the division line, but he owes their cross-easements of support --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="137.911" stopTime="138.369">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    For support.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    -- mutual support for the -- for the others, so that you can't pull down. 
    You owe -- you owe the other man a right to keep it there, to keep its post up.

    But you have an undivided ownership in the wall up to the midpoint.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="150.690" stopTime="211.361">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Up to the center -- centerline. 
    So that, under that law, if that -- and I think that is the law in the District -- the Fowler case, I would think, established it. 
    If we did go beyond the centerline, there was an -- crossing over the -- into his property in that sense, I may say that I do not concede that the mere fact, if it were established that we crossed over the centerline, I don't think that establishes that there was an illegal search because, by and large, the law is that there has to be an intrusion inside the house, not a crossing over of a property line, not a trespass, but an intrusion into the -- breaking into the other person's house. 
    I think the leading case on that is the Hester case, which Justice Holmes decided, in which there was an admitted trespass on the land of the -- of the defendant but this, itself, didn't make an illegal search since there was no breaking into -- into a house involved.

    On the other hand, the dissenter in the Court of Appeals said that it went six to seven inches or something like that, I think.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, you can -- I guess, the only evidence would be on that, would be the depth of the duct and there's evidence -- the heating duct which is said to be -- well, the Government -- the Government witness wasn't very clear on it. 
    Four to six inches. 
    He said this metal duct itself was four to six inches. 
    The defense gave more accurate or more precise, I don't know if it's more accurate but more precise testimony on the depth of it, and that appears towards the end of the record. 
    I don't find it. 
    I -- maybe I'll find it in a minute. 
    But then, the only way to find out how far it would have to go would be to take that testimony of -- let's say -- let's take for the minute, six inches and it's --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="450.532" stopTime="451.277">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I beg your pardon?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="451.277" stopTime="487.446">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Let's assume that the metal duct was six inches deep and that it was one inch from the wall. 
    Then, we would -- we'd know that it would take up about seven inches of the 14-inch wall. 
    If it were less than -- here is the -- the testimony on the depth of the duct from the defendants' witnesses appears at pages 211 and 212. 
    He says that the duct was four and nine-sixteenth inches from the wall. 
    It went four and nine sixteenths. 
    So, taking actually five, it would have taken seven inches to hit it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="487.446" stopTime="489.847">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This is four and ninth-sixteenth from the defendants' wall, is that it?

    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="490.650" stopTime="505.233">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    So, it would've -- if that would -- if that testimony is to be given credence and if it did hit the duct, then it would have to gone in about seven inches, at least, which would be about halfway.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="505.233" stopTime="515.595">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, now, I'm an -- I don't get that. 
    I don't -- if those distances, if it's four and three quarters inches, four and three quarters inches from where?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="515.595" stopTime="638.963">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    No. 
    That -- the metal piece itself, the metal piece which runs from the pipe out into the room is four and three quarters inches. 
    But, when you refer out to the wall and get the molding on, it -- it comes from the outside wall to the back of the duct. 
    Looking at it from the point of view of the petitioners' side becomes five and nine-sixteenth inches, if these -- if these figures would be given complete credence. 
    This is the defendants' testimony. 
    So that, if this is so, it would have to be -- so, that's nearly -- that's five -- a little over five and one-half. 
    It would need six -- it would need more than halfway to touch the duct. 
    It would have had to have been inserted more than halfway to touch this duct. 
    That's why the defendant introduced this testimony because he was tempting to show that it did go more than halfway. 
    I may say that if we're going to take these measurements, we ought to examine them pretty carefully. 
    Now, this becomes very technical and I -- and I don't want to rely on it but their testimony as to where the -- the heating entrance was into the room shows about 18 inches from the front wall of the house, and they say when they looked in there, they saw indentations on the metal about two inches, I think it is, from the end. 
    So, this will put it about 18 inches from the front of the -- from the front wall of the house. 
    On the other hand, when they go around to the other side, they say that the indentation where the spike was inserted was 18 inches from the front wall. 
    Well, this will mean that the spike would not have gone in straight when they measured -- when they measured the distance, the spike would had gone in through the indentation to the -- in the shoe molding to the dent in the thing, it would go in at an angle and then measurement as to the distance, I think, may not be accurate. 
    I -- these things are difficult to appraise and this Court ought not to be called on to make that kind of finding of fact, but --

    Then Judge Holtzoff's conclusion go up on the penetration point?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="779.975" stopTime="917.686">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    No, I think Judge Holtzoff felt that a party wall -- there'd be no trespass in going into a -- it was common. 
    I think he felt there was common ownership of the -- best way I read his opinion that there was ownership of the party wall, and I think that is not -- the property concepts are not designed for this -- for this purpose and they don't fit it very well, but I -- I think that that is not the property law in the District of Columbia. 
    I think the property law is set forth in Fowler that if there is a property line running down through the middle and there isn't common ownership of the wall. 
    But, Judge Holtzoff said -- would say that tenants and common cannot trespass on each other's property. 
    Each one of them has got a right as long as he's not injuring the other. 
    Well, I think that if this case is decided on the basis of the law today, that the action of the officers in this case was not in violation of the Constitution. 
    I think the case is directly covered by the decision of this Court in the Goldman case and that it's -- by covered, by equal implication from the law in the Olmsted case. 
    I would state that law, I think, as follows. 
    That, if there is no physical illegal intrusion into the premises, there is no illegal search or seizure through overhearing or through seeing what takes place in those -- on those premises even when one uses electric devices to do it. 
    I think Justice -- Justice Burton really stated the law in accordance with this in his dissent in the On Lee case. 
    He said, "This Court has generally held that, in a federal criminal trial, a federal officer may testify to what he sees or hears take place within a house or room which he has no warrant or permission to enter provided he sees or hears it outside those premises. 
    This holds true even where the officer supplements his hearing with a hearing aid." 
    I didn't make up at all, but "with a hearing aid, detectaphone, or other device outside the premises."
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="917.686" stopTime="922.346">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Detectaphone or other device. 
    Are they synonym?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="922.346" stopTime="992.373">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Not entirely. 
    This merely enables him to hear more distinctly where he is, what reaches him from wherever it may come. 
    He and his earing -- hearing aid pick up the sounds outside of rather than within the protected premises. 
    Well, if this is the law, and if it stands up until this case, then the question really comes down to whether or not electronic devices have developed to such a stage or the practice of electronic snooping has developed to such an extent that this Court now feels that it's necessary that this law should be changed. 
    And, I suggest that, in making a determination of that kind, it should be based upon what we have before us and it shouldn't be based upon some type of electronic devices which are mysteriously -- described in -- in some other context.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="992.373" stopTime="1031.355">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Davis, may I ask you the question that Mr. Justice Harlan asked Mr. Williams? 
    Do you make any distinction so far as this right that you're talking about now in the police officers between the situation where they're just going around generally and listening into people's homes or the situation where -- on the other hand, where they suspect that maybe there's something going on illegally in there? 
    Do you make any distinction or do you say that all of them are --
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1031.355" stopTime="1032.522">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Are legal?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1032.522" stopTime="1036.826">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Are proper.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1036.826" stopTime="1164.202">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, I -- I think there may be -- I don't know how to answer the question in terms of just going around listening because I think that if police officers are -- are patrolling and they hear things, whether they -- I mean, if it's their job to keep the peace and they're patrolling, and even if they have some device that helps them hear, if they hear things that are breaking the law, that this is -- this is not improper. 
    I think -- I do think that you reach a stage of intrusion upon people's privacy where you reach violations of the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment, as -- as the Court implied in the Rochan case and some members of the Court and the Irvine case, that there can be such unplesh -- unpleasant intrusions into people's privacy that it violates the Fifth Amendment. 
    And, in that respect, we do not have -- we've got a rather careful situation here. 
    I mean, here, the officers had information that these people were carrying on a gambling operation. 
    They observed it from across the street and they saw people whom they knew had -- to be -- to have been gamblers, they had police records, entering and leaving the premises. 
    They found that the kind of equipment had been installed in the house which is used in this, namely, the telephone with three or four lines going in. 
    It was on this basis that they began to watch more carefully what was going on inside the house. 
    They gained entry into the house next door and they used this listening device. 
    The house was, as I say, not a -- not a dwelling house.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    My -- my question is very similar to the one that the Chief Justice just asked you and it may be the same question, although I'm not sure. 
    The Government used what was overheard by this device in this case in two different ways, as I understand it. 
    It was used, first, in the affidavits which supported the search warrant. 
    That is correct, isn't it?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1254.855" stopTime="1255.760">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That is right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1255.760" stopTime="1286.252">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    These officers who overheard the conversations swore to that fact and it was on that basis or partially on that basis that the search warrants were issued. 
    And then, in quite a different way or a second way, a distinct way, what was overheard was testified to at the criminal trial of these defendants and was admitted into evidence. 
    Now, do you distinguish between those two uses at all? 
    Might it be -- did you --
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1286.252" stopTime="1286.768">

    I think --

    It might --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1288.728" stopTime="1291.573">

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    I think it might be, but I think it cannot be important in the disposition of this case because I think that if -- I think the stricter rule would be in connection with the introducing -- introduction of the evidence at the trial. 
    And if this was error, then this should be reversed as -- so that it washes out --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1310.393" stopTime="1310.718">

    But the question then is how do -- how does the public get protection from this kind of thing and I may suggest that appropriate -- the only effective way to get real protection if there are abuses, and there are abuses in parts of the country on wiretapping and -- and eavesdropping, is through legislation. 
    The most that the Court can --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1407.181" stopTime="1414.755">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But before you go into that point, my -- my question was in the context of a constitutional violation.

    Yes.

    If it was a constitutional violation, how would this Court stop it if you went as far as to say that it was perfectly alright for a police officer to -- to go to a strange home when he didn't know anything about? 
    And, for the purpose of inquiring and finding out what -- what they were doing in there was to use this instrument. 
    Well, I wasn't talking about whether Congress could do it --
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1439.883" stopTime="1441.206">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, in that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1441.206" stopTime="1445.428">

    -- or whether they should do it, as talking in terms of the constitutional question.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1445.428" stopTime="1516.575">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, the con -- it cuts into the constitutional question, too, because the type of legislation which has been suggested by Senator Keating, in the Senate and earlier in the House, deals not only with interception of telephonic communications, but also this kind of thing. 
    And, there, there is a -- he concludes a provision for the issuance of warrants. 
    So that -- if that kind of legislation were adopted, then the situation would be that this would be -- could be -- would, under the legislation, be considered a search, if you please. 
    But, if the terms of the warrant were -- were met, by then, it wouldn't be considered an illegal search, an unreasonable search because it would be the kind of search which is ordinarily carried on through physical search warrants where you give authority to people to go into the premises and -- and hunt the things out so that we can get some relief on the constitutional ground, as well as on the -- on the legislative ground, through legislation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1516.575" stopTime="1549.719">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Davis, you suggested about embarking and showing that it's -- there's no other way of dealing with this kind of united social conduct. 
    The search warrant was based on this instrument we used on higher knowledge or belief, namely, reliable sources arouse suspicion but they must have known something. 
    This kind of business is carried on either by people going there through the telephone. 
    The people go there in numbers. 
    You said there were quite a number, a hundreds of them, whatever there is.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1549.719" stopTime="1550.312">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1550.312" stopTime="1583.804">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But steady stream of people who were supposed to be at home raises the possibilities for inventing detectors to pursue and, if it's over the telephone, there are other means of finding out what this kind of heavy traffic over the phone does. 
    Simply suggest even assuming that he's got with extra set of copies, I just wonder how much of this thing is -- the characteristic easy way of getting information instead of using brains, instead of devices like this.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, I -- I think that this -- in this particular context of this particular case, and I don't know that all interception cases are like it, that you do have an example of the capital painstaking police work.

speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1684.652" stopTime="1801.996">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That's right. 
    I think, in determining whether to -- if I'm right, in determining whether to go further than was -- than the courts were willing to go in Olmsted and in Goldman, consideration should be given to, as I say, one, whether this thing is so horrifying, these things have developed so far that the situation which existed in a time ago when Olmsted is -- no longer fits -- fits the present picture and I submit this -- this thing doesn't show anything like that. 
    The second question is whether the practice, with the practice of wiretapping, snooping, and things like that has gone so far, become so distasteful that, now, we feel we have to do something different than -- that has been done before and do it through court-made law rather than legislative law. 
    I think it may be of some help to the Court to read a report of the Committee of Privy Counselors, published in 1957 as Command Paper 283, in which an investigation was made in Great Britain with respect to interception of communications and the report of this Committee is -- Committee of a man who carry some weight. 
    There was Lord Monson and Sir Norman Birkett and Mr. P.C. Gordon Walker who made this report and, their feeling was that no action should be taken in Great Britain to prevent the -- to upset the then status quo which did permit, and they felt lawfully, the interception of Massachusetts.

    Mr. Davis, since you rely on that report, more needs to be said about it. 
    First and foremost, no such tapping is authorized in England, except by the person, I emphasize, the person who associates the permission. 
    The second, they have State for Home Affairs. 
    He's the third most important member of the Cabinet. 
    He personally is responsible for it. 
    He's responsibly in the House of Commons to defend it. 
    And, if you -- since you read the report, you know how few such permissions are given. 
    They're almost negligible in number. 
    All of which is true, isn't it?

    I have here the reports of the Senate Committee investigating wiretapping and this extremely thorough report shows a great deal of eavesdropping by detectives in -- in some of the States in New York.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, but it's held to the extensiveness of it.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="2070.501" stopTime="2196.992">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    It's very extensive in many places, particularly in the big cities, and if it has become -- now, what the courts, if -- if this is to be handled by court-made law, the most that can be done, may I suggest, is to discourage the only type of wiretapping that has a social -- social benefit, namely, wiretapping by police officials who are attempting to -- to enforce the law. 
    This will -- nothing this Court does with respect to that will have anything to do whatsoever with wiretapping by private detectives, by state agencies or by purveyors of -- of malicious gossip, blackmailers, I mean, all that is out. 
    So that, really, if this is a problem -- a social problem which needs correction, the appropriate way to correct it is through legislation and Congress has -- has been worrying with this problem for a good -- for a good period of time and I suggest for your consideration the bills which have introduced by Congressman Siler in the House and Senator Keating in the Senate, neither of which received -- well, the Senate Bill didn't receive the entire approval of the department because, there, you'd have to get a court order for wiretapping and the department's position is it should've continued to authorized by -- by the Attorney General. 
    But, these -- these Bills, particularly, Senator Keating's Bill will fetch not only teleph -- interruptions of telephonic communications, but it will cover the kind of thing which is involved here insofar as there's any federal authority to do it. 
    And, it will cover it not only as far as federal law was concerned, but it will cover it in the much more important field where -- whenever there is federal power, it will be outlawed when -- whoever does it. 
    Now, the State of New York has already passed its own legislation which outlaws not only wiretapping but eavesdropping itself. 
    What they haven't done in New York is to outlaw the use of that evidence, of course, in criminal cases. 
    So, I suggest to Your Honors that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2196.992" stopTime="2204.955">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They have outlawed, it's used by private people altogether, haven't they? 
    People are being sent to jail in New York for private detection.

    For -- for wiretapping or eavesdropping --

    Yes.

    -- that is true. 
    Well, but the -- the detectives can be sent to jail, too, if they don't -- if they don't get a court warrant for it. 
    The only question that's opened is whether or not the evidence which is illegally obtained in New York can continue to be used in the criminal trials. 
    It's outlawed in civil trials but it still can be used in criminal trials in New York.

   Argument of Edward Bennett Williams
speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="2277.382" stopTime="2623.890">
    Mr. Edward Bennett Williams 
    There were some questions asked of counsel for the Government that I think should be cleared up by record references. 
    The suggestion was made to the Court that it was wholly a defense theory that the agents of the Government were hitting the duct of the premises at 408 21st Street. 
    The record doesn't bear this out because, at page 144 of the record and 145, it's shown that Officer Stone said, and I cite the bottom of page 144 that, in response to a question, "Now, when you penetrated with your mic, you penetrated at the point of the heat duct, did you not?" 
    "Possibly, yes, sir." 
    Then, over at 145, "And you thought you were going in at a point where the duct was, did you not?" 
    Answer, "I had an idea that might be the case. 
    Yes, sir, and the duct at 408 filled the part of what otherwise would have been a party wall, did it not?" 
    "That's correct. 
    It was inserted into the wall." 
    And that particular duct was a duct that serviced 408 exclusively, did it not?" 
    And, he answered, "That's correct." 
    Now, at page 158, if the Court please, a reading of the colloquy at page 158 where the same witness is under examination, I cannot but to suggest to the Court that he believed, although it was difficult to get him to admit that he was penetrating at a point where he was touching the duct. 
    He says, at the bottom of page 58, after several questions at 158, "I believe I did state that I thought of the possibility that the mic was contacting the duct on the other side." 
    And, at page 160, the question is put, "Now, you testified," and I'm reading from two-thirds of the way down, "in answer to a question by Mr. Williams, you knew you didn't think you were hitting brick when you came into this object, isn't that correct?" 
    Answer, "It didn't feel like a brick wall, no, sir." 
    Question, "What did it feel like to the best of your memory?" 
    "Well, there was a sleight, slight bit of give, a slight before it stopped." 
    The record is absolutely uncontradicted, if the Court please, that the only place where this needled could penetrate is was for a nine-inch stretch under the baseboard of that wall, precisely in front of the heating duct. 
    Mr. Chief Justice asked the counsel for the Government if there was anything in the record to show how far this needle had to be inserted before it touched the duct. 
    The rec -- the record is entirely clear on this, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I direct your attention to page 215 of the record. 
    Page 215, Question, and I'm reading from about one-fourth of the way down, "Will you tell His Honor and the jurors the measurements that you found when you measured that distance including the shoe molding, the baseboard, and then the plain airspace." 
    We found we had to go in seven and a half inches -- seven and an eighth inches to touch that duct -- the back of that duct." 
    Seven and an eighth inches counting what sir, counting the shoe mold and the baseboard, yes, sir." 
    At 220, that testimony is repeated. 
    Halfway down, "Now, I believe you testified there came a time when you went to 410 21st Street and you insul -- inserted a coat hanger or a spike. 
    You had to put this object seven and a half inches from the lip of the toe molding to touch what you referred to as the back of the duct, is that correct?" 
    Answer, "I believe I said seven and an eighth inches, sir." 
    "Seven and an eighth?" 
    "Yes, sir." 
    Again, at page 234 and 235, if the Court please, that testimony is repeated. 
    If you will look at the very top sentence at the page 235, you will see that it was seven and an eighth inches that this spike had to penetrate in order to touch the duct. 
    Again, the record speaks contrary to what counsel for the Government says when he says that it's silent with respect to whether this had to come in contact with the surface in order to be effective because, at page 200 -- I'm sorry, at page 156, it's entirely clear from the record that this had to touch something. 
    From the testimony of the Government's own witnesses, two-thirds of the way down, Question, "Well, will you explain it to me again then, please, because I didn't understand?" 
    Answer, "I said from my knowledge of this instrument, it should be in contact, that the point should be in contact with some surface which would act as a sounding board to pick up the sound waves and transmit the sound waves to the needle. 
    The needle does not have to be embedded into that object so long as there is a contact." 
    Also, the record is very clear, if the Court please, that the fact is they could hear conversations from all over the house at 408 21st Street, petitioner's dwelling house." 
    Page 97 of the record and, again, it's the Government's own witnesses, at the very bottom, "Now, where did Mr. Menendez and Mr. Martin conversed?" 
    Answer, "I couldn't tell you exactly where they conversed because I was not in the premises. 
    I could not tell you exactly where they conversed because I was not in the premises of 408 but, it seems to me, they were conversing in the room on the first floor, on the first floor of the building, I would say and, mind you, they were on the second floor when they conducted their electronic surveillance. 
    It --

speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="2629.364" stopTime="2743.091">
    Mr. Edward Bennett Williams 
    Then, again, at page 98, question, "Is it your testimony that this microphone on the second floor picked up conversations on the first floor?" 
    Answer, "That is correct. 
    I would say that." 
    Again, at page 99, if the Court please, "Now, on the occasion that you were there with Detective Stone when you inserted the spike microphone and Mr. Menendez was present in the other house with Mr. Martin, you were in this front bedroom, were you not?" 
    "That is correct. 
    I was in the front bedroom. 
    That was on the second floor." 
    Again, if the Court please, at page 100, question, "Did you go downstairs when you found that Mr. Menendez and Mr. Martin were conversing downstairs? 
    Did you go downstairs and insert your microphone?" 
    Answer, "No, sir. 
    It was not necessary to go downstairs to insert the microphone." 
    So, I say that it's accurate and there are other references here. 
    Again, at page 101 and 104, that they were using the sound -- the elec -- the heat conductor system of 408 is a giant sound conductor. 
    There was nothing else there for this needle to touch except the -- the metal heating duct it gave, and it gave them auditory observation of all of the premises at 408 21st Street by seven and one-eighth inch insertion into the party wall.
