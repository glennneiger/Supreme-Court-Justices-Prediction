    Suppose instead of the present one, there was a recital which read as follow -- what we read as follows, "The union representative has been designated as bargaining representative by a majority of the employees of the production and shipping employees. 
    The employer without accepting this representation, either denying or agreeing with it, designed to settled a disastrous strike, poses the following basis for settlement," and then go on with one -- the -- the rest of it and at the end of it, accepting on behalf of the International Ladies' Garment Workers by (Inaudible), that have been alright?

    And after the contract has been signed, the union has been acting as the exclusive bargaining representative for everybody, the fact that the contract did not specifically say so. 
    If, in fact, if, in fact, the union by virtue of the contract terms applying to everybody and by a virtue of its post contract conduct is acting and being recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="212.702" stopTime="242.280">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't understand any of those things. 
    They're all in your mind. 
    Suppose I'd make a further disavow. 
    And in no -- I -- I make the union represents this, the employer neither accept -- neither accepts nor rejects it, but decide to settle a -- a disastrous strike and therefore offered the following to all employees. 
    Now, you said that as a matter law, that in -- that would make the union be the exclusive bargaining authority.
speaker="dominick_lmanoli" startTime="242.280" stopTime="285.124">
    Mr. Dominick L.Manoli 
    No. 
    Now, I understand it more clearly, I think, what Your Honor is after. 
    I think that the employer in this case, and this is one the arguments made on the other side, that our position would have barred this employer from dealing with issuing and for the purpose of settling the strike. 
    Now, the employer could talk to almost anybody about the settling the strike but whether or not, whether or not that settlement would be binding upon the employees would depend upon what the union or whoever it was that was entering into the settlement, to this alleged settlement with the employer, whether or not that party had the authority to speak, had the authority to speak on behalf of the employees. 
    Now, if in this case here, the employer and the union and the employer saying, “I don't know if you have a majority or not, but let's talk --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="285.124" stopTime="285.914">

speaker="dominick_lmanoli" startTime="285.914" stopTime="320.055">
    Mr. Dominick L.Manoli 
    I don't care. 
    Let's talk about the settlement of the strike. 
    That -- that settlement would not have been binding in our -- under our view, would not have been binding upon the employees, because only a majority representative can speak for all of the employers, both the consenting as well as the nonconsenting -- consenting majority as well as the nonconsenting minority. 
    An employer could talk to the president of the United States about settling a strike and the employees might respect that settlement. 
    But it would not be binding upon them, because the President of the United States would not have authority to speak on their behalf and bind them.

    In other words, you do not -- the Board does not here contend that the employer cannot make in the absence of the existence of any exclusive bargaining agency either designated by the Board or agreed to be in existence by virtue of the fact that it is a majority by taking care of all the -- all the elements, the nonexistence either authenticated or in fact of a majority that can speak for the union, for this matter, the employer can make an agreement with anybody who represents anybody either a single individual himself or representing incorporate or a union speaking for less than the designated job.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I wonder, Mr. -- Mr. Manoli, if we will -- wouldn't run into the same kinds of -- of a take to speak of in a situation of that kind. 
    If -- if the unions could have bargained for themselves here but not for the others, and if they receive these benefits under this contract and those who were not members of the union did not receive those benefits, wouldn't that in itself be a -- a pressure upon the non-union members to -- to join the union so they would get the benefits?
speaker="dominick_lmanoli" startTime="449.686" stopTime="517.609">
    Mr. Dominick L.Manoli 
    Your Honor, I should've also added to my answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question at this whole problem of whether an employer can recognize a minority union even for its own members is a very difficult problem. 
    Now, there have been several Board cases in which the Board has said, which the Board has said that the employer may bargain with the minority union for its members. 
    This is in the absence of any majority representative of course. 
    May bargain for -- but then he is under a duty not to discriminate against the non-union people in that -- in that unit. 
    He's under a duty. 
    Now, it may well be that the employer, in order to avoid a charge of discrimination, will have to extend the benefits which the minority union has obtain for its people to the non-members. 
    But analytically, Your Honor, this does -- it's not the equivalent of saying that the union has been speaking for the -- for the non-members. 
    It's something that may flow from the fact that the employer has made a bargain with the minority union, that the only way he can save himself against the charge of discrimination with respect to the non-members is to give them the same benefit.

    Mr. Dominick L.Manoli 
    But, Your Honor, let's take a case like this. 
    Suppose that -- suppose the General Motors enters into a some sort of bargaining contract with its -- with its people, Ford will probably have to follow that the union that General Motors has called the two but is surely is not bargaining, that union is not bargaining for the people over -- over Ford at the same time, just the economic realities that caused an employer to do certain things. 
    Now, here, in the case of a minority union be in accordance to certain benefits for its people, and as I say this is a wholly unexplored issue, because while there are these Board cases that say that the minority union may bargain for its people provided the employer does not withhold the benefits from its -- from the other -- from the non-union people, the Board in its latest decision on this subject has said, “We are reserving judgment on that problem.” 
    And I think it's really never been studied, explored completely. 
    But at any rate, whatever books or whatever cases there are the Board on this subject, they do say that the employer may not, may not withhold the benefits from the non-union employees if the only reason is for withholding the benefits are that they are non-union.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, that -- that was differentiated from the illustration that you made of Ford and General Motors, wouldn't it, because Ford would not be required to -- to give the benefits that General Motors gave.

    Mr. Dominick L.Manoli 
    That -- there is that difference, Your Honor, but again, I say that it's not analytically, analytically -- and I think you do have to pay attention to the analysis of the -- what it -- what the situation is analytically. 
    It's not because the minority union has been bargaining, it has been bargaining for it's -- for the non-members that the non-members obtained the benefits which have been given to the members.

    The only other word that I know that deals with the subject is this Court's decision to Consolidated Edison and it's largely dictum, I think.

    Mr. Dominick L.Manoli

    That's right, it's not a bar. 
    It's not a bar and incidentally I'm -- as long as we're talking about contract bar, under the Board's rules, under the Board's so-called contract bar rules, this contract here, which on it's face, looks -- looks alright gives it -- presumably, is giving exclusive recognition to a majority union that this contract here would bar an election for the duration of the contract, the duration of the contract. 
    Now, Judge Fahy in the court below, whose opinion I respect the great deal, he dissented. 
    Judge Fahy here said, “Well, those -- that's merely the Board's rules that the contract -- the contract has barred in election.” 
    But I think we have an additional answer even if, even if this contract would not a bar to an election, never the -- and we did go to an election upon the -- some petition to determine who the representatives are. 
    This union by virtue of the recognition which -- to which is not been entitled to has obtained a certain amount of -- of support.

    I -- I quite follow your tainted momentum of -- of recognize -- recognition and all that. 
    But why, is it because, for all one knows, some people would rather state out on strike in other month -- in other month on a -- on a theory that a successful or disastrous strike that the employer may use to there advantage.

    And then the Board might have said, you might have gone a distinction between those people on those who joined after. 
    Those who joined after and the Board might have said, “Well, with respect to those who joined after, their membership is tainted. 
    Well, at least we cannot determine whether it was uninfluenced by the fact that the union had obtained exclusive recognition.” 
    The Board could have done that but I suggest, Your Honor, I suggest, Your Honor, that this is not a very clean cut satisfactory solution that what it seems to be good, solid, practical solution to this problem is to restore these employees the freedom to choose.

    I think to answer a question that Mr. Justice Frankfurter put to Mr. Manoli earlier, our brief does indicate the number of organized employees out of a total labor force and the figure is approximately 15 million out of 60 million or one out of four and we cite a --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1406.601" stopTime="1408.113">

speaker="morris_pglushien" startTime="1408.113" stopTime="1430.319">
    Mr. Morris P.glushien 
    Industrial workers, sir. 
    It's one out of four according to the latest study of the Bureau of Labor Statistics which you will find on page 35 of our brief. 
    And also, in the two years from 1956 to 1958 which are the latest available figures, the union population declined by 400,000 members.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1430.319" stopTime="1430.836">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Thank you very much.
speaker="morris_pglushien" startTime="1430.836" stopTime="1553.890">
    Mr. Morris P.glushien 
    That's on page 108. 
    Now, Mr. Manoli, I think, was sparring or answering questions in which there is a real dilemma, apparently, from the Board's point of view. 
    I think Mr. Manoli was indicating that if you have a members only contract with the same terms applicable to everybody, it constitute a kind of exclusive recognition. 
    That would be bad if the union were a minority union presumably. 
    But if they were members only contract with different terms, then as the Board has held, it would be discrimination. 
    So which ever leg of the dilemma you're on, you're in difficulty and that is not the only dilemma that the Board's presentation presents. 
    Let's turn to the question of good faith doubt. 
    The Board cases hold that if an employer does not have a good faith, honest doubt of a union's majority, it is the employer -- but nevertheless asks for a definitive proof of majority, the employer is bargaining in bad faith if it turns up that the union did have a majority. 
    Conversely, however, if the employer who has no good faith, doubt and beliefs, honestly that the union has a majority doesn't ask for definitive proof, then as the Board is now urging to this Court, 
    He acted as (Inaudible). 
    And if it turns out ultimately that the union didn't have the majority, in that case, the employer is been guilty of the illegal assistance and support which is -- gives rise to that old saw, which many of you, I'm sure, are familiar with, that a foresight were as good as hindsight, we'd be better off by a damp site but that is not the way law ought to be made. 
    Now, I want to add one other thing that under the Board's order, and this has not been brought out, if an election were conducted and lost by the union, it couldn't even represented to all members the way the order is phrased, not even its own members.

speaker="morris_pglushien" startTime="1557.121" stopTime="1653.280">
    Mr. Morris P.glushien 
    Well, I think, Mr. -- it's on -- it can -- it is on page 9, I believe or take the page 9, the employer is debarred from recognizing the ILG as the representative any of its employees or less than two until it demonstrates its exclusive statement -- exclusive status in a Board conducted election. 
    That's paragraph 1 (b) on page 9. 
    And the remedy part by the way, Mr. Justice Black, bears that out, too. 
    Several times they've repeat that. 
    So that the union couldn't -- there's a members only representative unless he becomes the majority representative, and I think that's an absurd order. 
    Now, Mr. Manoli has several times talked about wiping the slate clean that has a marked advantage over any other, these are cliches which the Board has repeated many times, and I ought to understand the kind of thinking that goes into it, but I think these cliches ought not to be a substitute for facts that a particular case ought to be looked at in its own context. 
    And if in a particular case, as we think here, the union did not get any marked advantage. 
    It settled the strike, it got benefits for the workers and the exclusive recognition clause, I think, was just an addendum which, in a practical effect, had no reality and that the October 10th contract, as I said earlier, resulted in a fair uncoerced -- came after a fair and uncoerced majority and that the union should be entitled the bargaining rights. 
    Thank you very much.
