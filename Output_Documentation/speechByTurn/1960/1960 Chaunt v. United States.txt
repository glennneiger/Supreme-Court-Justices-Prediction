    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Forer, you may proceed.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2.537" stopTime="964.518">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honor. 
    I was saying at the recess that in order to meet the statutory requirement, that a suppression had procured denaturalization. 
    It follows as logically and inevitably that you have to show one of two things. 
    Either that the true facts, if disclosed, within themselves have justified the naturalizing court in denying naturalization under the then applicable standards of naturalization or two, that the true facts, if disclosed, would have led to the discovery of other facts, which if known, would have justified the naturalizing court in denying naturalization. 
    Now, if I'm right and this becomes a crucial issue, then you can't say that a person shall be denaturalized because the suppressed facts, which if disclosed, might have or would have led to an investigation. 
    Because if I am right, you'll also have to then go on and show that the investigation would have discovered facts which would have justify denaturalization or which you have justified a refusal of naturalization. 
    If the investigation would have been fruitless, in the sense that it would not have discovered anything to the man's discredit or would not have discovered anything that would have justified denial of naturalization, then the investigation has nothing to do with whether he got naturalization or didn't get naturalization, it therefore has no bearing on whether or not denaturalization was procured by the misrepresentation. 
    And I -- I think if we will see, that is the principal issue between my position and the opposition of the court below. 
    And I think my position follows, not only from the language of the statute which says that you can denaturalize only if naturalization was procured by the suppression, but it also follows from the principle which this Court has repeatedly announced, which is in substance that in a denaturalization case, the defendant, denaturalized citizen is given every possible benefit, both on the facts and on the law. 
    And I think that's particularly important, in view of the fact that there seems to be no statute of limitations and no rule of laches so as to prevent the Government from bringing stale cases many years after naturalization was obtained. 
    Now, I think it is apparent that if my test of materiality, which I think is the statutory test, is applied to this case, then the -- the judgment below was wrong in holding that the petitioner was rightly denaturalized on the arrest ground. 
    If you'll look at the statute which set the rules at the time of naturalization, namely the 1906 Naturalization Act, there was only one ground which had any possible relevance to the subject of arrest. 
    And that was the requirement of the statute that before an alien could be naturalized, he had to be -- be a person who had behaved for the five preceding years as a person of -- of good moral character and attached to the Constitution. 
    Now, it is perfectly clear that if you use the first branch of my test, that if these arrests had been disclosed, they would not have justified the naturalizing court in holding that the then alien did not meet the requirement of five years good character. 
    First of all, the arrests were remote. 
    They were 10 years before the petition not within the five-year period. 
    Secondly, they had no application to a man's character anyway, since they were for trivial offenses, did not result in convictions and at least two of them were -- were unconstitutional offenses. 
    And the Court of Appeals did not claim and did not hold that the arrest, if they had been divulged, would have justified the denial of naturalization. 
    So, I think we can -- I can get safely pass the first prong of my test of materiality. 
    This leads to the next -- the next branch of my test, and that is, did the suppression of the arrest result in suppressing facts, which if known or if discovered, would have other facts, which if discovered, would have justified the denial of naturalization. 
    Now, in the first place, the Court of Appeals didn't claim that that was the situation either. 
    The Court of Appeals said, in their opinion and it's perfectly clear, and this is at pages 95 and 96 of the record. 
    The Court of Appeals said the only thing that mattered was that the falsification blocked an investigation and it didn't make any difference, what the investigation would have discovered. 
    And it didn't make any difference that if the investigation had been held, nevertheless, naturalization might have been granted. 
    Now, for the reasons I've already gone into, that seems to be clearly wrong. 
    So, let's come now to a -- to apply the correct test, which is, would the investigation have disclosed a disqualifying factor to the facts. 
    The only testimony in the record on this subject was offered by the Government's witness, the hearing examiner, the -- for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a man by the name of Derringer, and I quote this testimony in full, beginning at the bottom of page 17 and running on to page 18 of my brief. 
    And Derringer testified that if a person had an arrest record, an investigation would follow but he testified that the only thing the investigation would do, would be to verify the facts concerning the arrest. 
    And that's what he said, would be just to check whether or not the listing of arrest, for instance, had been accurate and complete. 
    So, if you take Derringer's testimony, if the petitioner had disclosed his arrest record or if you take Derringer's testimony, the only thing an investigation would have disclosed is the identicals matter concerning the arrest that we know now and then it's now in the record. 
    And as I've already said, obviously, those trivia in themselves would have not had justified refusal of naturalization and the court below recognize that they would not have justified refusal of naturalization. 
    So on Derringer's testimony and that is the only testimony there is in the record, there is nothing to -- Derringer's testimony negatized and there's no other testimony for the contrary, any assumption that an investigation would have discovered any disqualifying fact. 
    And when you consider that the Government has the burden in a denaturalization case, approving all essential parts of each case by clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence which does not lead the issue in doubt, then it is perfectly clear that if the Government, as I say it had, had the burden of showing that there was a dena -- disqualifying fact in the background, which an investigation would have led to, then the Government has not carried that burden because the only testimony in the record is to the contrary. 
    Now, the Government, in its brief, now subs -- tries to substitute a complete speculation for proof. 
    They say that at the time of these arrests, 1929 and 1930, they say that the record shows that at or about that time, the petitioner was a district organizer for the Communist Party in Connecticut. 
    And they say, well, it seems we -- it seems likely or it can be assumed that if the Service have had the information about the arrest, it would have investigated the arrest and presumably the arrest would might have had something to do with his activities as an official of the Communist Party, and then the Service would have discovered from the arrest that he was therefore a -- had been a district organizer for the Communist Party and this might have led to a denial of naturalization. 
    Now, there are about four things wrong with that argument. 
    The first argument is that it is a complete speculation, which can't possibly meet the test for denaturalization, which has been repeatedly announced by the Court. 
    It not only has no evidence to support it, it is a speculation and direct contradiction to the testimony of Derringer. 
    In the second place, there is no competent evidence in this record, that at the period of the arrest, the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party or was a district organizer in -- for the Communist Party in Connecticut. 
    There is incompetent evidence on that subject in the record, consisting of some hearsay testimony by John Lautner, the Government's perennial witness and of some articles in the Daily Worker. 
    But I don't even -- but I don't think that's the important fact because even if you accepted the hearsay testimony as establishing membership in the Communist Party at this period, nevertheless, there is nothing in record to show that the arrest had anything to do with the Communist Party or that the investigation of the arrest would've led to anything to that sort. 
    And I may also say that, as a matter of fact, membership in the Communist Party at that time would've been irrelevant anyway for a large number of reasons. 
    One reason is that it was 10 years before the petition for application and not within the five-year period. 
    The other reason is, and under the 1906 Act, that Communists were not barred from naturalization nor for that matter were persons belonging to organizations advocating the overthrow of the Government by force and violence. 
    And Schneiderman, for example, was naturalized under the 1906 Act and this Court held in the Schneiderman case that -- that didn't seem to be anything wrong with that. 
    Now, in my original brief, I said nothing about or made no argument about the two grounds of denaturalization other than the arrest ground, namely the -- what I've called the "Communist Party ground" and what I've called the "attachment ground." 
    And the reason I didn't argue those two grounds was because the Court of Appeals hadn't discussed them and said that it didn't have to consider them. 
    And I assume as I said in the footnote in my brief, that under those circumstances, if this Court thought that I was right on either of my -- either of the points that I raised so that the judgment was wrong, so far as the arrests were concerned, that the Court would follow the normal practice of remanding the case to the Court of Appeals to dispose off and decide the remaining issues, namely, the Communist and attachment ground. 
    In its brief, the Government alleged as an independent ground for sustaining the judgment below, that there had been a misrepresentation as to membership in the Communist Party. 
    The Government didn't allege what I call the "third ground" as an independent ground. 
    They didn't talk about the "attachment ground" but they urged the Court to affirm the judgment below even if the court below is wrong on the arrest, on the grounds that there had been a misrepresentation as the Communist Party membership. 
    And the assumption in the Government's brief is, that it -- the Court ought to do this even though it's an exception to its usual remand practice because there isn't any factual issue or no real dispute on the facts and it's just the question of law. 
    So in my reply brief, I took up this question. 
    Now, as far as I'm concerned, this issue has to be decided and it's up to the Court whether the Court wants to decide it or whether it wants to send it back to the Court of Appeals to decide it. 
    That is it has to be decided if -- if I am right on either of my first big point. 
    And I wouldn't presume to tell the Court whether it should decide it or whether it shouldn't waste its time and let the Court of Appeals decide it. 
    But since the issue was raised in my reply brief, I did analyze the record. 
    I analyzed the facts and I think I showed that there -- not only is there a factual question but that the only correct resolution of the factual question is that the petitioner did not, did not lie on the subject of Communist Party membership, or that the Government did not prove that there had been any misrepresentation or suppression on that issue. 
    This depends on -- on rather complicated and involved state of facts. 
    In addition to that, I went on and said that the subject was not -- was not a material subject within my definition in any event under the 1906 Act. 
    Now, for present purposes, since I don't know whether the Government still adheres for its position, that there basically is no factual dispute. 
    I would like to, unless the Court appeals otherwise, reserve any possible discussion on the suppression as to or alleged suppression as to Communist Party membership until after the Government's argument. 
    And for that reason, I will reserve the remainder of my time.

   Argument of Maurice A. Roberts
speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="970.369" stopTime="1075.238">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Perhaps at the outset, I should clarify the Government's position with respect to the question which counsel for petitioner just raised. 
    When we filed our brief in this Court, we had supposed that the fact findings below with respect to the petitioner's membership in the Communist Party at the time of his naturalization were not questions. 
    For the reasons that we stated in our brief on the merits, we felt that there was no dispute as to the evidence and we feel we were justified in taking that position but it seems now that we were wrong. 
    Petitioner does dispute the evidence underlying the District Court's fact findings. 
    Under the circumstances, we feel we cannot ask this Court to decide these factual questions on a very large record without the sifting process in the Ninth Circuit, and without having that particular issue briefed. 
    I might point out that the adequacy of the evidence in this regard, was not raised, or briefed, or argued in the Ninth Circuit. 
    And it is for that reason that we assumed that there was solely a question of law with respect to the Communist Party concealment which this Court could determine and could affirm on the basis of the facts found below. 
    Now, turning to the specific issues, I'd like to add one further word though.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1075.238" stopTime="1075.356">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="1081.089" stopTime="1105.889">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    If -- if we are incorrect in our view that the judgment is sustained by the arrest concealment then the only basis left would be the Communist concealment. 
    And since questions of fact are raised with respect to that, then we feel that this Court might wish to remand rather than plowing through this record initially. 
    I'd like to point this out though.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1105.889" stopTime="1113.112">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May I ask also if there is a remand, what court should remand, remain?
speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="1113.112" stopTime="1115.568">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    Well, I think that would go to the Ninth Circuit.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1115.568" stopTime="1116.716">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    To the Circuit Court?
speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="1116.716" stopTime="1171.611">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    That's right because it was that Court which, free to admit it, this issue. 
    I -- I must point this out though. 
    These questions were not specified as errors in the Ninth Circuit. 
    I don't know whether the Ninth Circuit would consider them open and if the Ninth Circuit should be disposed to consider this, perhaps we might want to brief the matter in the light of these objections which are now raised it seems to us for the first time, but denaturalization is important. 
    And if there are questions with respect to the evidentiary basis for the findings, we -- we receive from our request that there be an affirmance on the alternative basis for judgment because evidently, we were wrong when we assumed that -- that petitioner conceded the fact as found by the District Court.

    I can only say, as counsel said that we cannot tell this Court or ask this Court to decide a question of substantiality of evidence on a large record. 
    That -- that's a matter entirely for this Court. 
    Now, it's true that this Court does review the evidence in denaturalization cases and ordinarily, it does so after the facts have been sifted by the two lower courts. 
    I don't know what to tell this Court in that respect.

    I would wrestle myself to (Inaudible) inadvisable where this Court send the case back for examination on the fact if the Court of Appeals should think it -- it's free to examine the fact.

    Well, we don't think that the claim is supportive but it is not frivolous. 
    I mean the petitioner can argue the point. 
    It's a matter of how you evaluate the evidence in this large record. 
    Summarizing briefly the issues before this Court, the District Court found as fact but that at the time the petitioner filed his petition for naturalization in 1940, he concealed and misrepresented the fact that, as the District Court found, since 1929 at least, he had been a member, officer and full time functionary of the Communist Party. 
    And the District Court found that he had been a member of the Communist Party at the time he petitioned for naturalization. 
    The District Court also found that he had misrepresented and concealed his arrest record back in 1929 and 1930. 
    And the District Court found that as a result of these misrepresentations and concealments, the Government has been precluded from making an adequate investigation of the petitioner's qualifications for naturalization. 
    And that as a result, the naturalization examiners had recommended that his petition be granted and that the Court had granted the petition, the naturalization court, without these items having been adequately sifted. 
    The Court --

    That is true but of course since its conduct which is being inquired into, are not the question of whether he has been convicted even an acquittal is not res judicata. 
    There maybe instances in which an arrest will point to conduct which indicates an absence of good moral character even though there has been no conviction. 
    In other words, arrests are leads, investigative leads, which are important and the naturalization questionnaire the preliminary form for naturalization in 1929 embodied what had been the practice and this question with respect to arrest was incorporated at that time it has been there since.

    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    Oh I think -- I think that -- that the questions asked should be relevant to his eligibility for naturalization and there are various eligibility requirements, good moral character and attachments. 
    And as I propose to develop in the course of my argument, those are ultimate facts which must be found but they depend in the final analysis on developing subsidiary facts. 
    For example, I don't suppose it can be expected that the requirement of good moral character would be established merely by asking the petitioner, "Are you a person of good moral character? 
    Or are you attached to the principles of the Constitution?" 
    and accepting his affirmative response. 
    The whole history of the nationality laws and their development indicates that when naturalization was an ex parte proceeding in the courts before the Nationality Act of 1960 -- 1906, so many frauds were perpetrated that as a result of a presidential commission's findings, the 1906 Act was enacted with specific provisions requiring a naturalization examination. 
    The -- the underlying facts are well-developed in this Court's opinion in the (Inaudible) case and so I won't go into the details. 
    But in the 1906 Act, Congress set up two safeguards against fraud. 
    First of all, it set up a Bureau of Naturalization to administer the Act and it authorized naturalization examiners. 
    This was Section 11 of that Act. 
    It authorized naturalization examiners to appear in court representing the Government and to question the petitioners and to present evidence with respect to the qualifications for citizenship. 
    That is the first time that this was done. 
    And then Section 15 of the 1906 Act had another safeguard against fraud. 
    It set up the ancestor of the present provision authorizing judicial revocation of naturalization which had been fraudulently or illegally obtained. 
    In fact, this Court pointed out at an early case, I believe it was the Nest case that the naturalization examiners were the ones who, by reason of their expertise, could best be relied upon for determining the qualifications. 
    But in the final analysis, the qualifications for naturalization must depend on the good faith of the petitioner.

    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    I -- I was trying to answer your question fully, Mr. Justice Black. 
    As we see the issues here, they are two. 
    First, whether the affidavit can support the judgment as affirmed by the Court of Appeals on the arrest point. 
    Then the second question is whether the concealment of the arrest was material to this petitioner's naturalization. 
    We have suggested a third point which this Court may wish to consider in the event there is a remand. 
    That is if we are incorrect in our first two points. 
    And that is the question which petitioner has raised in his replied brief and which we have discussed somewhat in our brief on the merits as to whether the concealment of Communist Party membership, even if adequately proved, was a material fact under the statute, the 1940 when petitioner was naturalized. 
    At a later point in my argument, I hope to discuss that if time will permit. 
    We feel that that is an issue which this Court might wish to determine since it is a legal issue not dependent on fact findings and which would give guidance to the Ninth Circuit in the event of remand or if we are incorrect, might end this litigation.

    One thing we do suggest is that it probably would have disclosed what the District Court found that the petitioner at that time and in fact since the 1920s had been an active member, an officer, a full time functionary of the Communist Party.

    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    The statute authorizes denaturalization for concealment or misrepresentation with respect to a material fact. 
    All arrests are material facts. 
    They should be disclosed so that the naturalization court which has the ultimate burden of judgment should have them all before it. 
    Now, our view is that when the Government has established by requisite evidence that a clear question was asked with respect to a material fact such as arrests and an answer that is false has been given, and this answer blocks a line of inquiry that is prima facie material. 
    Of course, it is open to the petitioner or the defendant to show that notwithstanding this, he had the eligibility requirements and that he would have been naturalized. 
    But one never knows what might have resulted from an inquiry. 
    We don't know to this day what a -- an investigation, the 1940 with respect to this petitioner would have shown.

    Now, I suppose that ground comes under a cloud, either because of the -- the suppression didn't bar further relevant testimony which might have barred his naturalization or because where they were or wasn't arrested, it was doubtful as that.

    Now, suppose one reaches the conclusion that the record doesn't sustain -- satisfy what this Court has ruled now and whether it settled doctrine. 
    The necessary quantum of proof and denaturalization cases, suppose one reaches that conclusion, what then does one do with the case? 
    Can we go on the other grounds? 
    We can't do that because non-concept that the Court of Appeals which is the tribunal that in all but there are cases, exceptional cases should have the last say, didn't have the last say on that, that was end up to be a remission to that court wouldn't it?
speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="2971.404" stopTime="3837.564">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    I think that is so. 
    I should like to discuss briefly the question of the adequacy of the affidavit. 
    We suggest in our brief on the merits that this question has been abandoned by the petitioner below. 
    It wasn't raised in the Court of Appeals and in fact, it seems to have been abandoned even in the District Court because while it was specified in the motion to dismiss the original complaint, it was not included in the subsequent motions to dismiss an amended complaint and a second amended complaint based on the identical affidavit. 
    In the motions addressed to those two subsequent complaints, the petitioner repeated the identical basis of objection that were incorporated in his original motion, the constitutionality of the denaturalization statute and res judicata. 
    But in these subsequent motions, he did not repeat the affidavit point. 
    We feel that this could be taken as an abandonment. 
    And certainly, the Court of Appeals didn't mention this because the question was not raised in the Court of Appeals. 
    Under the rules of the Court of Appeals, specificity of error is required. 
    We feel that this was not an obvious error nor was it an error which otherwise seriously affects the integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings within the meaning of the cases decided by this Court, where this Court will notice error not pointed to the -- or not brought to the attention of the Court of Appeals. 
    I should like to turn now to the second question, and that is whether the affidavit is adequate to support the judgment on the basis the Court of Appeals supported it. 
    Now, this Court pointed out in the (Inaudible) case and in the Nowak case why the affidavit of good clause was required. 
    It was required to protect a defendant in a denaturalization suit against ill-considered or irresponsible governmental action in instituting such a proceeding. 
    Therefore, Congress required that there should first be a screening by, I believe, Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in the Nowak case referred to a responsible official who after reviewing the facts would make an affidavit setting forth the evidentiary matters justifying or showing good cause for denaturalization. 
    I don't think there's any quarrel with the affidavit filed here insofar as showing good cause is concerned. 
    It recites essentially the facts which were recited in the complaint with respect to the concealment of the Communist Party membership and the court below that is the District Court found those facts sustained by the evidence. 
    But petitioner argues that that is not enough, that the affidavit must, in effect, contain all the grounds on which the judgment below is based. 
    We don't believe that that is so and if I may draw an analogy, I'd like to compare the affidavit of good cause with the requirement that probable cause be shown under the Fourth Amendment to warrant an arrest or search. 
    As this Court pointed out in the Baumgartner case, the quality of the evidence or the standard for determining the adequacy of a showing of probable cause differs from the evidence which the Government must use to prove a conviction. 
    And we feel similarly that the evidence which must be shown to satisfy the statutory mandate that there be good cause for denaturalization is not the same as the evidence which the Government must educe to prove a denaturalization case. 
    Moreover, we feel that the petitioner or any defendant would gain no meaningful protection from such a requirement. 
    The affidavit when executed is a safeguard against departmental irresponsibility in starting such a proceeding. 
    The complaint tells the defendant what charges he must defend against. 
    In combination, they give him an adequate safeguard. 
    We don't feel that Congress in addition to requiring a showing of good cause intended that the affidavit include everything that the complaint must include, such a reading of the statute would make the affidavit and the complaint almost identical and would render the complaint meaningless. 
    Now, this Court pointed out in the Schneiderman case that it is to the complaint that the defendant must look to see what he must defend against and the Government may not base a denaturalization decree on a ground not stated in the complaint. 
    Even though it is stated in the accompanying affidavit, the reverse does not follow. 
    We feel that there is adequate protection to a defendant in a denaturalization case if there is an affidavit setting forth one good cause for denaturalization. 
    We do not feel that the statutory mandate is violated if instead of there being one good cause, there turned out to be two. 
    Now, a petitioner has mentioned the fact that this could be used as a device perhaps for alleging one ground in the affidavit and then abandoning that and using an entirely different ground in the District Court. 
    That would indicate bad faith and we agree that there should be no bad faith. 
    But that is not the situation here. 
    Here, the affidavit set forth good cause for denaturalization and the Government proved that case, the concealment of the Communist Party membership. 
    In addition, the Government proved a little more but we feel that taking into account the purpose of the affidavit, this affidavit was adequate. 
    Now, I should like to discuss the question of materiality. 
    And as I said, we disagree with petitioner in the criteria for determining materiality. 
    We feel that a misrepresentation in a naturalization case is material if there's a reasonable possibility though not a certainty, that the alien would have been denied naturalization if the truth had been revealed. 
    It must be remembered that naturalization, although it is a judicial proceeding is not the usual proceeding for the vindication of existing rights, rather it is a proceeding to have granted to the petitioning alien rights which have not yet come into existence. 
    That was the position this Court pointed out many years ago in Manning versus United States 278 United States 17. 
    And the burden of proof in a naturalization proceeding is on the petitioning alien. 
    Any doubt as to whether he may see eligibility requirements must be resolved against him. 
    The Congress has laid down some specific eligibility requirements and has set up machinery so that the existence of those requirements can be ascertained. 
    And as I pointed out before, since these requirements very often relate to state of mind, that is what's going on in this petitioner's mind with respect to his attitude toward Government? 
    In the final analysis whether he has those requirements depends upon his good faith during the course of a naturalization examination preceding his court hearing. 
    This is underscored by the fact that hundreds of thousands of petitions are filed each year. 
    As a matter of fact, in fiscal year 1940 when this petition was filed, some 278,000 petitions were filed and there were 201 examiners. 
    Naturalization is not like a commercial transaction where the parties may deal with one another at arm's length. 
    The courts have frequently said that the petitioner must deal in good faith with the Government. 
    In fact, one court said the alien must deal with the utmost good faith toward the Government. 
    Now, with respect to the question of materiality, some of the elements which Congress has required and which are important, such as attachment to the principles of the Constitution depend for their ascertainment on subsidiary facts. 
    Attached within good moral character are ultimate conclusory facts. 
    But from the very beginning of the naturalization process, the naturalization examiners have inquired into certain subsidiary facts to determine the existence of these ultimate findings. 
    And as I pointed out, the arrest question which is material to good moral character has been in the naturalization, regulations and in the form itself since 1929 even though arrest questions were asked even before that. 
    The arrest question can also furnish information or leads with respect to other elements of naturalization. 
    This was -- we feel possible right in this very case. 
    We feel for example if the petitioner had revealed these arrests minor though they may seem in the context of the times back in 1940, the investigator on checking and finding the nature of the arrests might very well have pursued these leads. 
    It must be recalled that in 1940, the war had broken out in Europe. 
    The Stalin-Hitler Pact was of recent memory. 
    There were numerous inquiries into the extent to which foreign organizations and ideologies were -- in all of the United States, the German-American Bund was being inquired into the Communist Party certainly. 
    There were various legislative inquiries both on the national and state level into these questions. 
    The Smith Act and other acts, which seem to have been directed at the Communist Party, were enacted in June 27th -- June 28th, 1940, the very day after this petition was filed. 
    The -- the question of membership in the Communist Party was being inquired into by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, not only in connection with naturalization petitions but also in connection with deportation possibilities. 
    So that had the arrests been revealed, the investigator or perhaps even the judge might have been led to inquire -- what were -- what was the nature of the hand-bills which he was charged with distributing and whose behalf where they're being distributed? 
    What was the nature of the oration or harangue which led to his arrest, assuming that -- that there was such an oration or harangue? 
    What was the nature of the conduct which led to his arrest for breach of the peace? 
    All these might do without necessarily inquiring or without the fact that he had been convicted because he wasn't, we assumed. 
    And in those days outside investigations were authorized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service Regulations. 
    In other words, reliance was not had solely on the examination by the naturalization examiner. 
    There was a regulation at that time, I refer to 8 Code of Federal Regulations 1938 Edition 70.9 which required the district directors of naturalization to have naturalization petitions reviewed and further investigations conducted. 
    We are warranted. 
    And we feel --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there any thing in the record, Mr. Roberts, about the character of these pamphlets or the character of this harangue?

    The -- the record is silent on that. 
    Now, I'm not saying that the Government's case necessarily presents on that with respect to materiality. 
    All I'm saying is that where -- where there are arrests, the Court is entitled to know about them. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3865.333" stopTime="3866.106">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I understand it (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="3866.106" stopTime="4281.530">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    Now, when the -- when the inquiry is made, perhaps nothing more will appear and the Court will be satisfied that the -- that the good moral character is shown notwithstanding the arrests. 
    In fact, notwithstanding conviction sometimes because not all convictions necessarily point to poor moral characters and they feel of the underlying conduct which is the important thing. 
    All I'm saying is that arrests are material to good moral character and the time to investigate is at the time the petitioner applies for naturalization where he blocks a material inquiry such as this by his misrepresentation then I say that that misrepresentation is material to his naturalization. 
    I'd like to draw a parallel here between naturalization and some of the other types of inquiries during the course of which misrepresentations are made. 
    For example, in the course of a judicial inquiry such as a trial or a grand jury inquest, if a full statement is made and that blocks or torts the inquiry or has a tendency to block the inquiry, the full statement is precarious. 
    There need not be any showing that it would necessarily have altered the result.Counsel has stretched the word "procured" in the present statute. 
    We feel that bad word does not have a significance, counsel attributes to it. 
    In the prior statutes, the 1906 Act and the Nationality Act of 1940 which did not come into effect until shortly after this petitioner was naturalized, the denaturalization provision relating to fraud was on the ground of fraud. 
    The word "procured" was not used with respect to the fraud ground. 
    I know of no court decision stating that the Government had to prove that naturalization would have been denied had the truth been revealed. 
    In fact, it is my recollection that the Montalbano case which we cite in our brief and the Corrado case which is cited in our brief were under that statute and they stated quite the contrary that if a relevant line of inquiry -- a material inquiry to arrest his blot then the Government does not have to show that it would have resulted in the denial of naturalization. 
    I believe that the -- the great majority of the circuits which have considered this question have gone along with that. 
    Now, the -- the legislative history of the change does not indicate that Congress intended any change in the standards of materiality. 
    The 1952 Act under which this proceeding was brought was the result of an intensive study by the Subcommittee on immigration of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate. 
    That study went on for two years and the Subcommittee brought out a report, Senate Report 1515 in the 81st Congress, which analyzed the existing laws and made recommendations for changes which were incorporated in the new bill which became the 1952 Act. 
    Now, the Subcommittee analyzed the denaturalization provision and pointed out that there had been a couple of courts which had questioned whether denaturalization could behead for intrinsic fraud. 
    And therefore to obviate any question, they recommended the present language in order to make it a little more explicit. 
    There was no suggestion that the word "procured" was to have any particular significance. 
    As a matter of fact in the same 1952 Act, there was a parallel provision in the deportation section. 
    Section 212 (a) (19) of the 1952 Act has a provision authorizing the exclusion and consequent deportation of any alien who has procured a visa or other document by willful misrepresentation of a material fact. 
    Now, in the cases which deal with deportation with the materiality of a misrepresentation, we find that the same standard for which we contend is applied. 
    As a matter of fact, in the (Inaudible) case which was decided in the Southern District of New York and affirmed by the Second Circuit on the language -- on the opinion I should say of Judge Dimmick there and that -- in which this Court denied certiorari last Monday. 
    The Court sent forth a very good reason for this. 
    A decision that an alien may make a full statement in his application for a visa, we could substitute for naturalization. 
    In order to avoid the raising of a substantial question as to his eligibility and then if he is caught in the full statement after having successfully trumped off investigation may try out his eligibility just as if nothing had happened would it seems to me be an invitation to full swearing. 
    There are also additional reasons why we feel that the same standard should apply with respect to the materiality of naturalization falsifications as applied to the falsifications in the course of other governmental inquiries. 
    The First Circuit in the case of Landen v. Clark stated this so well that I'd like to quote it. 
    In that case, the First Circuit reversed the District Court, which had held that the Government must show that the visa would have to be denied in order to show materiality.

    No, I would not suggest that, Your Honor.

    If the misstatement blocks or chokes off or torts a relevant line of inquiry, then it is prima facie material. 
    But I think that that door is open to the defendant to come in and show something else. 
    And on the sum of all the evidence, after it is all in, the denaturalization court might conclude that this prima facie case of materiality has been thrown out.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Thank you sir. 
    First of all, I don't understand Mr. Roberts when he says that the petitioner did not raise in the Court of Appeals the question of the insufficiency of the evidence on the Communist Party ground because I have here a copy of the appellant's opening brief in the Ninth Circuit and on page 2, they have a statement of points and it -- I'll read you just the first statement of the first points stated.

    That's in the Court of Appeals and -- and he -- you don't have that here but he -- he told you that the questions sufficiency of the evidence was not raised in the Court of Appeals. 
    But the very first point reads as follows. 
    Appellant here asserts the following points, one, that the evidence received that the trial was insufficient to support the findings of the trial court and that the findings of the trial court are not supported by the evidence. 
    The second point is that the judgment isn't supported by the finding. 
    On its first point is that the findings are not exploited by the evidence.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Well, he -- Mr. Roberts said perhaps he shouldn't remand because he doesn't know whether the Ninth Circuit will consider the point because they may say the point wasn't raised before them.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5220.247" stopTime="5223.116">

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    What?
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5223.584" stopTime="5224.005">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Did you say --
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="5224.005" stopTime="5329.458">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Well, that's true of the other points, Justice Harlan. 
    And nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit wrote an opinion. 
    So, that -- I was just trying to give you the facts on this particular matter which Mr. Roberts mentioned. 
    I'd now like to bring up the point that Justice Stewart alluded to. 
    It maybe true that lying to the naturalization examine law on a matter which is not material maybe evidence of bad moral character. 
    And when I say not material I mean not material in the sense that the lie wouldn't made it -- that note was purposeless in the sense that if he told the truth, it wouldn't make any difference. 
    But that's to an irrelevant fact, Justice Stewart, because of the fact that the denaturalization statute does not, as it now reach and as it passed since the Immigration and Nationality Act was enacted, does not authorize denaturalization just because the person was ineligible for naturalization. 
    It does not authorize denaturalization because naturalization was wrongly or improvidently or even illegally granted. 
    It authorizes denaturalization only where there was a misrepresentation or concealment. 
    This incidentally is a change in the law. 
    So the fact that the man was a person of bad moral character, even if was -- he was shown to be such by his misrepresentation, does not bring him under the denaturalization statute.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5329.458" stopTime="5332.896">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does the statute say that there must be a misrepresentation which --
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="5332.896" stopTime="5334.148">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Or concealment.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5334.148" stopTime="5344.844">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- or concealment, which we prospectively canvassed and considered would have barred examine of the citizenship?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="5344.844" stopTime="5346.958">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    It doesn't say it in -- in those words.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5346.958" stopTime="5348.518">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, in what words does it say?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="5348.518" stopTime="5538.076">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    It says that you will be denaturalized an account of a naturalization which was procured by a concealment or misrepresentation and I don't see how you can say that naturalization was procured by a falsification unless you show that it is a falsification which made a difference to the result. 
    Now, let me get in terms of the fire plug parking analogy, and I think that's very good to show the differences between us. 
    Now, I -- it seem to me that Mr. Roberts vacillated somewhat on his answer to whether lying about fire plug parking was or was not a denaturalizing fact and I thought that he ended up by saying, "Yes, it was caused for denaturalization but maybe a judge or the Immigration Service in such circumstances would give the individual a break and they wouldn't -- they wouldn't press it." 
    Now, the way I look at it is this. 
    I say that if the alien, the applicant for naturalization lied about this fire plug parking, it might or might not be cause for denaturalization. 
    If all you showed was that he lied, then you haven't carried the burden of materiality, because obviously he has not suppressed a fact which would have made any difference to the naturalizing court. 
    So if the Government really wants to use that to denaturalize him, then they should do it. 
    There might be a case in which they should do it then the Government might show that this man parked in front of the fire hydrant because he was trying to -- to perpetuate a scheme of arson and this was a way of doing it. 
    And if he had told the Immigration Service about this arrest, you -- it might reasonably have led the Immigration Service to discover an attempted arson and if they had discovered that, that might well be relevant to his good moral character and might have led the naturalizing court to deny him citizenship. 
    The point I'm making is that you can't look at it from a point of abstraction like they're doing about. 
    Is it the kind of thing that sounds bad or it doesn't sound bad? 
    The burden is on the Government to show whether or not that misrepresentation, whether it's about fire plug parking or anything else would resulted in or had in effect on the procurement of naturalization and that very often maybe a question of fact. 
    A question of what was -- why did he conceal this fire plug parking.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5538.076" stopTime="5565.237">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    As a practical -- as a practical thing, as a practical thing, as I see it, we attended many naturalization proceedings along though, what you're doing is reading out of the propriety of the regulation or the inquiry, an inquiry to whether a man was arrested, as a practical thing, it means was on the holding that he lied about whether you arrest him.

    I -- I --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5565.751" stopTime="5583.179">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Joseph Forer

    The longer that the Government waits, the harder it is to get at the facts here.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Well -- but, you have no time limit here. 
    This -- they can convict the man for perjury if it's a really mat -- if it's a material allegation. 
    This is a question of putting an additional sanction on but it's a sanction which has no time limit.

speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="5717.010" stopTime="5805.299">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Well, I don't think you're encouraging lying. 
    In the first place, I think the policy judgment was made by Congress when it said a naturalization procured by misrepresentation. 
    In the second place, any -- any dilution or any rule of materiality can be said to encourage lying in that sense. 
    And in the third case -- place it just proves too much. 
    If -- if you say you had a rigid materiality standard that encourages lying, then you can say that it -- they have any materiality standard in encourages lying and you're driven to what the Third Circuit did in the Montalbano case which is quoted approvingly by the Government in their brief on page 29. 
    And they said, "As long as the Government fought the question was worth asking that makes the question material in the individual is under a burden to answer." 
    Now, I don't think that's a sound rule and it throws materiality out of the window. 
    And it's particularly an unsound rule when you think of some of the questions that some of the subordinate officials or the Immigration Service thinks worth asking. 
    Thank you.
