Lurk v. United States

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- versus United States, Mr. Davis you may continue your argument.
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="5.403" stopTime="266.806">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In the time remaining to me, I should like, if I may, to make a few more comments on the threshold in forma pauperis question and then to pass on to the merits of the questions involved in Judge Jackson sitting at the trial of this case. 
    What I would like to say on the issue of in forma pauperis appeals, I mentioned yesterday and that is in on our view, the standard of review given in these cases is no different from that to which a paid appellant or an indigent who has been granted leave by the trial court is entitled. 
    The only difference is that in those cases, the issue on the merits does not come before the Court of Appeals ordinarily until after argument. 
    The judges don't know about the cases. 
    They don't have the kind of conferences that this -- this Court has, but that does not mean that if the issue did happen to arise at a preliminary stage, at some interlocutory stage that comparable action would not be taken. 
    Now we have in a case cited in our brief for another point, an example of that which I would like to tell the Court. 
    It doesn't happen to be a criminal case, it's a civil case but it bears on -- on the issue. 
    It's the Boomhower case, 220 F.2d 488. 
    It was in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia about five years ago. 
    There, the appellant, the issue on the merits was very similar to the one here. 
    Judge Robert Wilkin of Ohio, after he'd retired for disability had sat in the District Court here and the -- and the appellant claimed that he had no right -- a judge retired for disability had no right to sit in another circuit and the appeal was taken on that ground. 
    Well the appellant apparently did not file a full record and the appellee made a motion to dismiss the appeal, not on the merits, but on the ground that the record was not in -- full one and not proper for the consideration of the Court of Appeals. 
    Well, what the Court of Appeals did was to dismiss the appeal not only that ground, but they said, we go on to the issue on the merits and since we find nothing of merit in it, we will dismiss the appeal on both grounds, on the ground that the record wasn't properly presented to us or a full record and also on the merits. 
    And I present that as an instance of a case which happens to have come before Court of Appeals at an interlocutory stage and -- and which the Court of Appeals acted on the merits as we think is done in these forma pauperis cases here. 
    And I'm told, though I cannot cite you specific instances that in the District of Columbia Circuit, there had been cases in which an injunctions pendente lite, where an appellant goes to the Court of Appeals to seek an injunction pendente lite that the Court of Appeals, a three-judge panel Court of Appeals, hearing that injunction pendente lite has said, your issue on the merits has -- your issue has no merit at all. 
    We will dismiss the appeal or summarily affirm at this stage. 
    I'm also told that in a -- in an immigration case, again I don't happen to remember the name, that the Second Circuit in the deportation matter where an application was made to the Second Circuit for a stay of deportation, the Second Circuit did the same thing. 
    They went into the issue of the merits. 
    They said there's nothing to it. 
    We will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court and therefore, it was unnecessary to consider the issue of a stay. 
    Now, I -- I mention all these instances in order to indicate that the -- that the difference is that in the -- in the ordinary case, the prepaid appeal, I'll say, the issue doesn't come before the -- the Court of Appeals until after argument -- until argument of the merits. 
    But if it should happen to come, the Court of Appeals would be entitled to and apparently would do the same thing that's done here and at this point I want to specifically to deny that from our point of view, a statement which Gressman made yesterday. 
    From our point of view, the Court of Appeals is not limited in relation to dismissing an appeal, to deciding only that the appellant has raised issues which are unreviewable. 
    We don't think that's true at all. 
    We think that the Court of Appeals can either dismiss an appeal where there's no absolutely no merit to it or it can summarily affirm and if it's not limited to so called nonreviewable issues.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well Mr. Davis, how can you say it's the same when they're in the -- the court's in a better position to dismiss and appeal that is taken in the ordinary way after the briefs are filed, but before argument on the ground that is frivolous and -- and presents no real issue than it is when -- when the defendants through appointed counsel in this way, makes his initial representation?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="297.194" stopTime="331.472">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    What I'm saying Mr. Chief Justice is that in this case and in other comparable cases, the -- what the defendant has done through his appointed counsel is not a mere initial representation. 
    He has gone as far as he really could and that the three judges of the Court of Appeals can say that we are satisfied on the materials that have been presented to us in this case, which is a simple case and on the issues which have been presented to us that we don't need anymore argument just as this Court does when a motion to affirm is filed in a direct and sometimes even in a certiorari case where it affirms or reverses without further argument.

    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    No, I happen to have it in our brief on another point and I read it and found it, (Voice Overlap) that's the way I found it Mr. Chief Justice. 
    It just -- in preparing for this argument, I happen to read it on the Judge Wilkin point and I saw what they had done on -- on this issue and that -- that's why it came up. 
    Well, in essence, that I think is what I have to say on -- on this issue.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="382.218" stopTime="399.983">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Davis so long you were being very frank this morning, let me say that with respect to the Sixth Circuit, I have no idea what the practice is there now, I was just thinking about it, as to what at least my practice was when I was there and maybe the practice there is now quite different and I would --
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="399.983" stopTime="539.635">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    I -- I haven't seen a case a Sixth Circuit recently. 
    I -- I just happen to look through the last volumes of F.2d to see any reported case from the other circuits and -- and I found them from the Eighth and the Ninth and the Second and there is a case pending in this Court from the Fifth, which I happen to see in the office and so I -- I knew about that as well as the District of Columbia. 
    Well I -- I now have passed -- well what -- and what I have to say on this point by saying that in our view, Section 1915 presents a standing mechanism for bringing the matter if the Court of Appeals so wills and the circuits have so willed, bringing it before the court at an interlocutory stage. 
    But that in essence, it is no different from the situation which would happen if other appeals were -- came before the court at the interlocutory stage. 
    I now pass to the -- to the issues relating -- involving Judge Jackson's participation in the trial. 
    And I think, I should make it clear because I don't think I did yesterday that the Government agrees that subs -- subsumed in the questions presented by the petitioner, are all the issues on the merits relating to Judge Jackson. 
    We do not think that he -- that the petitioner waived those issues because in our view, he limited the issue that he presented to the three-judge court below, to a single facet and didn't raise all -- all the elements. 
    On the other hand, we don't think we that we have waived any defense such as we may have it, as the de facto defense. 
    So we think that if this Court wishes, it can consider the issues on the merit and there is precedent for this in the Pollard case, which is cited at the very end of our brief in a footnote to our conclusion. 
    The court there said it was unnecessary to pass on the issue whether the Court of Appeals had granted -- improperly denied leave in forma pauperis because on -- they went on to the merits and that is a precedent for doing so here and the Bakelite case which if of course, the very important in the whole issue on the merits as far as Judge Jackson is concerned, the -- this Court there said, we won't pass on the issue of whether we have power to issue a writ of prohibition which has been mooted before us. 
    It said, we can't do it because we decided that even if we did have the power, we wouldn't issue it. 
    And -- and judge -- Justice (Inaudible) specifically said that they were reserving the question of their power. 
    So there is precedent for the court for doing that. 
    Now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="539.635" stopTime="557.123">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The ordinary rules of the game Mr. Davis, would be for us if -- if we agree with what -- now, both sides of this controversy can see that there is a non-frivolous issue involved would be simply to remand it to the Court of Appeals and tell them that, wouldn't that be it?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="557.123" stopTime="558.308">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Well that might --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="558.308" stopTime="570.254">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And not hurry the result of complicated constitutional issue that may never come up in this case, because the Court of Appeals might conceivably reverse it on the -- on the evidentiary point?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="570.254" stopTime="573.075">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Well there, I doubt that Mr. Justice, but --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="573.075" stopTime="574.159">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You may doubt it, but if it --
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="574.159" stopTime="579.825">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    -- it's possible. 
    There are reasons against that which I like to say and they are practical.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="579.825" stopTime="581.177">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The rule is -- is right.
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="581.177" stopTime="605.385">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Yes, but the court has not followed the rule automatically and rigidly, in a situation where it is felt that is was important to resolve a question or in order to avoid pure security of action, because there are other cases involving Judge Jackson. 
    Even if this case should happen to go off on another ground, Judge Jackson has been sitting. 
    I think, I said for two years yesterday, I'm wrong. 
    He's been sitting for four years in the District of Columbia.

    I do not think it will go away. 
    I -- I think it should be resolved, will ultimately have to be resolved by the Court. 
    But of course, one has – the - the advocate has to leave to the Court ultimately the question of whether it wishes to follow what maybe considered the normal rule or whether because all the circumstances, it wishes to make an exception in -- in this kind of case, as it has done in the past.

    Well that's right, that's right. 
    These are all judges of the court and because I have only a few minutes left, I -- I should like if I may to -- to concentrate on a particular point which doesn't go to the whole status of all these courts as well as they're legislative or Article III. 
    I'd like to say just for the moment that whatever else Congress may have done in 1953, 1956 and 1958, we think that it made these judges Article III judges, because they all had life tenure before, the judges of the Court of Claims, of the Customs Court and of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. 
    The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and Court of Claims since the beginning of the constitution of those – of those courts had life tenure. 
    So what was the difference between those judges and the Article III judges sitting in the Circuit and District Court? 
    Only that Congress could if these courts -- the courts we're dealing with here were not constitutional courts before that Congress could reduce their compensation as this Court held in Williams case or could limit their tenure. 
    It could cut down their tenure and what we think that these statutes of 1953, 1956 and 1958 did is irrevocably give up a part of Congress, the right to reduce the tenure or limit or reduce the compensation of these judges, thus making them full Article III judges whatever you may want it, whatever characterization you may want to give to the court on which they were sitting. 
    They -- these judges were made Article III judges.

   Argument of Francis M. Shea
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="1580.847" stopTime="2192.945">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I am here on behalf of the judges of the Court of Claims appearing as amicus curie. 
    The interest of those judges, I think, is quite evident. 
    The status, unquestioned status of the Court of Claims which has existed for 60 years as an Article III court was first drawn in question in the Bakelite case, dealing with the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and then in the Williams case, it was held a legislative court. 
    The court relying on the dictum in the Bakelite case and saying there was no basis for differentiation for these purposes between the two courts. 
    The 1953 legislation relating to the Court of Claims and the 1958 legislation relating to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals are identical. 
    Now, may I make this suggestion to Your Honors that it seems to me that the clearly wise policy standing behind the settled view of this Court that you should not reach constitutionally issues, where case can be decided on narrower grounds, it seems to me that that policy doesn't exist at least in full measure in the case which is here before you. 
    The issue which is squarely presented, as the Chief Justice has noted, raises very considerable problems with him in the administration of justice. 
    If anybody has the full scope of experience needed to settle this issue, it is this body and it seems to me, we're in a narrow of sense. 
    The validity of the statute relates to the problem of the proper administration of justice, so there is reason to dispose of that issue and not to avoid it, which was if one does not find in dealing with constitutional issues under the broad grants of public. 
    Now, if the court please, I should like first to turn to this point. 
    The Congress in 1953 expressly declared that the Court Claims was constituted as an Article III court. 
    To be sure of legislative history indicates, as Mr. Davis suggests, that the Congress had carefully examined the Williams case and the legislative history behind the earlier statutes and had concluded that Williams was wrong and it intended in that statute to declare that the Court of Claims had at least since the repeal of the appending provision noted in the Gordon case in an Article III court but further that they were mistaken in that or not, as held by this Court in Postmaster General v. Early, if the language of the Act can be given prospective effect and clearly it seems to me in this case it can be given prospective effect then it will be given prospective effect. 
    Now it seems to me that it would be rather clear that if the Congress today constituted a court and invested it with Tucker Act jurisdiction and declared that it was exercised in Article III power in so doing, that that would be a valid act. 
    In my view, quite clearly it would be investing in that court, Article III jurisdiction. 
    Quite clearly it seems to me, Tucker Act jurisdiction arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. 
    I have to think of also that it involves cases to which the United States is a party as that phrase was used in the Constitution. 
    But whether that be true or not, I suppose there can be no question of the fact that Congress could invest Tucker Act jurisdiction in constitutional courts even if it might at the same time, elect to invest it in legislative courts. 
    Indeed, it has invested in the District Courts and therefore, if it is within the congressional elect to determine which power they've exercised, Article I or Article III power, where they expressly declare that they have exercised Article III power, it seems to me that that should be an end of it. 
    Now, if they could, if they could today establish such a court and invest it with such power and declare finally, it was Article III power, with utmost respect for Mr. Gressman's view, it seems to me that to suggest that you have to disestablish the Court of Claims and then reestablish the Article III court. 
    It seems to me that that argument has had substance. 
    That it must be possible to do this in a single act and equally, I -- I must say I find little substance in the suggestion that there's need for reappointment. 
    These judges, as Mr. Davis has pointed out, were -- were appointed by the President, bind with the advise and the consent of the Senate. 
    They were appointed to serve during good behavior and Congress certainly has done everything it could to relinquish if it ever had any right to reduce their compensation to their -- during their term of office. 
    And moreover, may I point out to the Court that the President and the Senate concurred in legislation which certainly contemplated that the existing judges would continue to serve. 
    Now, it seems to me therefore that since 1953 certainly, the Court has been an Article III court and the judges are Article III judges, but I think that the Congress' right while I share Mr. Douglas' high regard for members of the court set on the Williams case, I think they were plainly wrong. 
    This has been the materials for judgment and this I think had been set out in great detail in the Solicitor General's brief in the Pope case. 
    We put it in capsule form in our brief, but with all the necessary references. 
    I invite the Court, as Mr. Davis has and I think Mr. Gressman but certainly Mr. Davis, to review the Williams case and may I, with a broad rush, note the basis why I think that decision was wrong. 
    In the first place, I think Your Honors will find by review of the legislative history before the original act that those who were managing the Bill, both in it's final form and those who were opposing thought that the option of the election was between either creating a board of commissioners or creating a court under Article III. 
    Now to be sure, some of the chase pointed out to -- laid to the Chief Justice that he didn't think it could be an Article III court, it wasn't to be final. 
    But the men who were managing the legislation thought that that was the election that they were making and they elected to make it a court. 
    When this Court in the Gordon case, noted that the court not take jurisdiction because the Court of Claims did not have finality of judgment because of the intervention of the Secretary of Treasury, immediately Congress repealed the offending provision. 
    Immediately this Court changed its rules, so as to provide for appeals from the Court of Claims and the court that did that as you will find from the opinion of Chief Justice Taney which was prepared and later filed in the case with the approval for surviving judges. 
    This Court that time was of the view that it could only take appellate jurisdiction from Article III courts and so it must be assumed that they did believe that they were taking jurisdiction from an Article III court. 
    Moreover, within six years of the Gordon opinion and Kline, the whole subject was reviewed and unmistakably, this Court stated the view that the Court of Claims was an Article III court and reiterated this view over a period of 60 years. 
    And I ask the Court to note that in 1887, Congress reenacted the basic jurisdictional statute of the Court of Claims and I assume, reenacted it with its gloss on it and the gloss that was on it at that time, was the view of this Court that it contained Article III jurisdiction and was invested in an Article III court and then in Williams, all of this was avoided. 
    The Court did not deal with the question as to whether it was an Article III jurisdiction that the Court of Claims is exercising, because they were dealing with cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.

    It dealt with the – with the issue as to whether or not, they were exercising jurisdiction over cases in which the United States was a party. 
    They said it couldn't have been contemplated that -- that cases involving the United States as a party defendant was within that phrase of the Constitution, because it was well understood at the time that the Constitution was adopted that the sovereign could not sued, he had sovereign immunity. 
    And -- and it was understood, but it was equally well understood and that it existed in England from the 13th Century, that the sovereign waiver of immunity, well established in England and well established in the colonies. 
    And if I may point out to you Your Honors, dealing with cognate problem, Marshall and Madison in the Virginia convention, dealing with the problem of suits involving a state said, of course this doesn't waive the sovereign immunity of the states, but it provides a court and jurisdiction, if the states waive that immunity. 
    And this was the view I believe, Your Honors at the time the Constitution was adopted and was so decided in this Court, in the Hitchcock case. 
    It seems to me, I've had to deal with this obviously only in the suggestive way, but I think Your Honors will find on the review of the materials that despite the fact that they were men of great stature on that bench, but in this regard, they were clearly wrong.

   Argument of Eugene Gressman
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="2383.039" stopTime="2555.357">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would like to address myself in my remaining time to this constitutional issue and with particular reference to the 1958 declaration by Congress. 
    Parenthetically, I might say just as a matter of clarity of the proceeding below that I disagree with Mr. Davis' analysis of the issue that I sought to raise there in these constitutional terms. 
    I think a fair reading of the memorandum will demonstrate that I sought to erase the basic constitutional issue which has been fully developed before the court in the briefs before it. 
    And that it is unfair to single out any particular argumentative statement that may have been made and seek to confine that in terms of an issue raised. 
    In fact, I think this demonstrates better than anything else the desirability at the appellate level below, of having an opportunity fully to brief a basic constitutional issue such as this. 
    I think that it's unfair to confine and to limit what was before the Court of Appeals in terms of the issue before it, by any single statement that might have been made and particularly with reference to the fact that we are dealing here with a retired judge. 
    Now whether that has any significance or not, remains to be one of the matters to be considered on full briefing of the issue which has never occurred until we've arrived in this Court. 
    Now with reference to the de facto doctrine, which is the first line of defense taken by the United States here, I will say only this. 
    I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter yesterday pointed out the -- the real answer to the de facto defense in this case and that is, as I have developed in my reply brief at length, that the de facto doctrine does not apply. 
    It does not help where there is a constitutional or a statutory reason why a judge cannot sit in a particular type of case and that is what we have alleged here. 
    What is involved here is the claim that there is there constitutional prohibition against Judge Jackson sitting in an Article III court. 
    And when that type of claim is made, something that goes far beyond any technical defect in Judge Jackson's assignment such as a failure to file his assignment with the office of the clerk of the District Court or to – to -- a failure to obey some technical aspect of the statutory assignment provisions, but where we have this --

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="2563.590" stopTime="2665.112">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That is the inevitable conclusion to which this argument goes, yes, Your Honor. 
    I don't think you can avoid that. 
    I mean it's either one or the other and the -- the cases are cited, Norton against Shelby County says precisely that where the -- there is a constitutional or a statutory prohibition against a judge participating in the case and these -- this was the case that the -- the Solicitor General relied on last term in the American Foreign Steamship case in order to avoid the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in that case. 
    They pointed out and I think accurately that the de facto doctrine there could not be interjected to say the -- the judgment no more than it can be interjected in this case, I submit. 
    Now, turning to the 1958 declaration by Congress which has been described as irrevocable declaration by the Congress of the United States, I submit that there is nothing irrevocable about any declaration by Congress in this field or in any other field. 
    What Congress says today, it can change tomorrow and the whole theory is that the -- in fact, that history has demonstrated how Congress has treated this Court on and off, as a legislative court from -- from its very beginning. 
    In 1932, Congress cut the salaries of the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, an obvious recognition of the fact that it was dealing with a legislative court and this Court sustained it, precisely in that term.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, but I don't think that the constitutional status of the District Courts or the Courts of Appeals depends upon a congressional declaration to that effect. 
    I think it depends, as the Bakelite case pointed out it does not depend upon the expressed or the over legislative intention. 
    It -- the true test that this Court unanimously in the Bakelite case, lies in the power under which the court was created and in the jurisdiction conferred. 
    And it is ultimately the function of this Court to determine under what power those courts were created and what Congress says as to its Article III status or as to legislative status, particularly at a subsequent time as they did in this case, is absolutely meaningless and that is precisely what the Bakelite case forecast would happen and which was declared to be completely without relevance.

    Because Congress I think -- you look back originally to wonder what Congress did at the time it created the court.

    Congress in 1958 is no -- certainly no better judge of what Congress in 1909 meant to do, then is this Court when called upon to interpret the power under which the court was created.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2802.281" stopTime="2814.246">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, but can Congress in 1958 transform a tribunal of one kind into -- by saying, we are now conserving with a different power, in giving future scope and authority to this tribunal.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    You – you can Your Honor if Congress at the same time changes the nature so as to have a new act of creation, a new jurisdiction, a new function, a new scope to that court, but Congress was very careful to point out here, Your Honor that we are in way changing this jurisdiction or the function or the scope of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and leaving it just as it was presumably as described and delineated in the Bakelite case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2840.082" stopTime="2848.927">

    Well, if I -- I don't see where it --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2850.271" stopTime="2862.327">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And all – all this -- all that means is that Congress was satisfied in 1958 that what the Court of Claims was doing is what the District Court of New York is doing when it had the Tucker Act case?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="2862.327" stopTime="2873.156">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well I don't think that -- that Congress at that point is the final arbiter of what was created in 1909 or what was created in 1854 in the Court of Claims.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2873.156" stopTime="2907.010">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But everybody was doing, it was doing a creative thing in 1958, namely saying, from today on, instead of establishing a brand new tribunal, we say there is an existence of tribunal which – which -- the jurisdiction of which is the business of which is to be very concrete, the business of which is – the business in – which is – which is conducted in a way, the finality of its judgment as such that it will be doing it all over again today, we could call it an Article III court and so we call that court an Article III court.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="2907.010" stopTime="2931.039">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, Your Honor I think that the -- the facts of its jurisdiction and -- and its nature, negative is that kind of an interpretation of the 1958 act. 
    Only last moth the court claims for example, issued four decisions on legislative reference from Congress which are the type of advisory opinions which this Court said has time and again cannot be rendered by a constitutional court.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    And I can only say in conclusion that as Senator Gore stated with respect to this very type of jurisdiction of over advisory opinions on reference from Congress. 
    In 1953 he said and I quoted this on page 62 of my brief, “And I think it epitomizes the ephemeral nature of these congressional declarations that if in the future, the judges of the Court of Claims had refused to act upon congressional reference cases on grounds, they are not within the proper scope of jurisdiction of the constitutional court, I suppose the simple remedy will be for Congress to re-designate the Court of Claims as a legislative court.” 
    Now I submit that this is an indication of the view and I think a legitimate view as each – as Congress views it, that they can turn the constitutional and legislative nature of these courts on and off like a faucet.
