   Argument of Reno S. Harp, III
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="24.023" stopTime="125.532">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    There is some great disagreement between Senator Boothe and myself as to what the question presented in this case is. 
    We have set it forth on page 5 of our brief, it is the green brief and I'll read it, because I think it is the controlling matter in the case at bar. 
    The question as we see it is this, is a person, who is represented by counsel of his own choosing in a state court and who is convicted of a capital offense and sentenced to life imprisonment, entitled to have the court-appoint counsel upon request to represent him for the purpose of appealing his conviction in the absence of any allegation that he is a pauper or that his own counsel has withdrawn from the case. 
    It is important to note that petitioner has never, in any of the enumerable habeas corpus proceedings, in which he has been involved, alleged, stated, or suggested that he was without funds in April of 1953. 
    He's never said he was indigent. 
    Moreover, he has never made any allegation that any error occurred during the trial of -- of his case. 
    The record before this Court and before the state courts is silent on this question. 
    Moreover, there is no affirmative statement contained in the record on this question. 
    What is the history of this man? 
    We think --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="125.532" stopTime="136.835">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May I ask -- may i ask -- on what theory the case was argued in your -- in your Supreme Court and on what theory the Court decided it?
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="136.835" stopTime="210.158">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    The answer to that Mr. Chief Justice is this. 
    This is the first time that the respondent has been represented by counsel in a court proceeding in this case. 
    The history of this case is this. 
    He filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond, that is equivalent to a Circuit Court. 
    Judge Young, one of the three judges of that Court, appointed an attorney to represent him. 
    The attorney looked into the matter and filed a brief of some type with Judge Young. 
    In Virginia, the respondent, State Superintendent or the Penitentiary, by counsel, through the Attorney General of Virginia, cannot come wondering into the case until ordered by the Court. 
    We can't file any pleadings. 
    We're not permitted to until an order to show cause or -- or a writ is issued. 
    We don't appear and cannot appear. 
    So, we didn't appear in that case at all. 
    Then as was stated yesterday, writs of error in Virginia are discretionary. 
    So, there's no reason -- we have no idea as to why the petition for a writ of error was denied.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="210.158" stopTime="231.299">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do I infer from what Senator Boothe said yesterday that on the application or whatever it's called, to -- on leave of appeal, the grand jury writ of error in the Supreme Court, thereto the State -- the Commonwealth was not represented and couldn't be represented until that discretionary writ was granted?
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="231.299" stopTime="238.298">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    Yes, sir. 
    We could not have come into the case. 
    Yes, and it was a habeas corpus case, we could not come into it until such time --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="238.298" stopTime="242.754">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Either -- either in the nisi court or on -- in the appellate tribunal.
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="242.754" stopTime="290.984">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    That is correct Your Honor. 
    That is correct. 
    So, why the Supreme Court of Appeals denied the writ? 
    I don't know. 
    I could think of several reasons, one of which is this, and it's not in the record, it's immaterial but the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond had no jurisdiction than attain this suit, because there were facts not matters of record alleged in the petition. 
    And under Virginia law, a petition for writ of habeas corpus which alleges facts which are not matters of record must be filed in the Court in which the conviction was suffered. 
    So, if we had been in the case, we would have immediately moved to dismiss it on the grounds of Law and Equity had no jurisdiction. 
    And that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="290.984" stopTime="300.845">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did you file -- did you -- in response to the -- to the petitions in this Court, did Virginia raise this local procedural problem?

    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    No, sir, we did not. 
    I did not file the response that was requested by the -- this Court. 
    It was filed by a former -- a former Assistant Attorney General Thomas M. Miller, who is no longer any officer.

    You didn't take too much about what until last night?
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="414.105" stopTime="469.148">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    Until the question -- it hit me last night, Your Honor, in going over this case that Law and Equity had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter as originally filed. 
    So that when the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia denied the petition for writ of error, they may have denied on the grounds. 
    Well, Judge Young didn't have any authority to enter the order or to write the opinion because Mr. Newsom filed in the wrong court. 
    Moreover, it's interesting to note that Mr. Newsom is a busy little man and while his petition for a writ of certiorari was pending in this Court, from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, this petition for writ of habeas corpus was found in Judge Young -- Young's court. 
    And while his present petition for writ of habeas -- for a writ of certiorari, in this case, was pending in this Court, he filed a petition for writ of coram vobis in the Hustings Court for the City of Richmond Part II. 
    So --

    The -- to continue, then the -- we've listed on pages 2 through 4 of our brief, the chronological history of this man's efforts to secure his relief and have included as appendix 2, the opinion of Judge Walter Hoffman, the District Judge, the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division of April 10, 1958, which gives a rather thorough, complete and exhaustive history of this man's efforts. 
    He was tried on the charge of murder. 
    He'd been having a list of relations with another man's wife and when she rejected him, he shot her husband. 
    He was represented by two attorneys of his own choosing in the trial of the case. 
    This -- there's no indication in the record before this Court that those two attorneys ever withdrew from the case, after it was tried in the trial court.

    That he said -- at one -- at some point rather, I don't know whether it's the 1953 letter, you can interpret it the way you like.

    That you're suggesting something else by what you've just been telling us after the time of this interrogation. 
    In other words, in answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's inquiry, aren't you suggesting this? 
    This man was tried and convicted of a -- of murder and he could've -- he could've been sentenced to death. 
    He was not and its -- we all know, as a practical matter, that offered him their very best lawyers in the world. 
    After a trial like that, they could see better part of valor not to take an appeal because of the rest that on a new trial, there maybe a -- a capital -- there maybe a conviction that will lead to a sentence of death. 
    And that this man, did have lawyers, lawyers of his own choosing, who were advising him and that -- that it's at least possible that they advised him not to take an appeal. 
    That would at least, have been a very reasonable, understandable and everyday a count of advice to give in that situation. 
    Is that what you're suggesting?

    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    That is correct, Your Honor.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're suggesting this that it would be a -- (Inaudible) state of the law if the person's own lawyers told him and advised him not to take an appeal and he understood the wisdom of that advice, but decided he drafts to play on both ways and therefore on his own, decided to take an appeal and ask the Court to appoint a lawyer to take an appeal. 
    If that were denied, he'd get a -- he'd have two bites of the apple.

    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    That is correct, Your Honor.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1109.515" stopTime="1164.036">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But can a defendant -- can a prisoner reject the advice of -- assume this, assume, assume that due process does impose upon the States the duty to supply a lawyer to an indigent -- indigently convicted defendant in a capital case and otherwise, you'll have the situation as you're having here, with all the hypotheses in fact, in the record, which Justice Stewart had put to you. 
    Assume all that, can the defendant say, "I reject the advise of my lawyers and I would like -- I think, I have a chance," but would he be barred by the -- not only the honest and contentious, but the wise advice of lawyers and go on his own?
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="1164.036" stopTime="1234.270">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    I would say that he would be barred, but there's one factor that I think, Your Honor left out of that question that I should like to supply if I may, because we ran into this very situation, not two months ago, with a habeas corpus case. 
    Suppose he can't get an attorney and suppose no attorney will take the case because he says, there's patently no error in the record. 
    Where does that leave you? 
    We had a recent habeas corpus case involving an indigent, the court-appointed a very fine attorney. 
    The man looked into and he talked to his client, he had coverage with the court with the petitioner present and his lawyers said, "I'm -- I'm court-appointed but I cannot honestly argue this proposition because it's -- you're obviously wrong and the man was ignorant and you just couldn't explain it to him," the question involved figuring the -- whether he was serving third time, half time or flat time, good time or bad time, in a state penitentiary. 
    What do you do in that case? 
    I think that -- that due process would not include the right of a man to have an attorney when the attorney says obviously. 
    An expert attorney says, "There's no error in this record." 
    It's a clear-cut case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1234.270" stopTime="1242.837">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1243.226" stopTime="1282.240">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- which -- which caused to be raised a very different question in view of the explicitness of the right to counsel in the federal court as against due process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And the mere fact that it's a professional judgment of the lawyer, and a good lawyer, or an able lawyer, recognized lawyer, doesn't necessarily make a question frivolous for the one who has been many years or few years at the bar, you get jokes in picking something that's frivolous and -- and the majority of the Court quite disappoints your prophesy.

    To continue then, if I may --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1284.079" stopTime="1366.787">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Harp, business is a little different from the case you were just telling us about two months ago because there, the Court did appoint a lawyer for the man and the Court did advise him that or the lawyer did advise him on his appeal that he had no case. 
    And the Court, after having appointed counsel, said that he had not -- had gotten that reaction from him and he suffered no injury. 
    But here, here, a man is apparently from what we can see here has been abandoned by his lawyers so far as the appeal is concerned. 
    The lawyers may have had reason for it. 
    They may have had no reason. 
    We don't know. 
    But apparently, obviously from his letters, that he wrote to the judges within the statutory time for appeal. 
    His case had been abandoned by his lawyers. 
    He was doing everything he could as an individual to -- to note his appeal and get it moving and he was writing to the judge saying that I -- I haven't had the time, I haven't been able to get a lawyer and so finally, I appealed to you to appoint a lawyer for me and that was within the statutory time for taking an appeal.
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="1366.787" stopTime="1418.588">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    The end to -- I didn't tell the complete story on this recent case which will answer part of your question, sir. 
    We never had to reach the determination which this Court, which you -- of the question which you asked me, sir, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, for the reason that while the matter was pending, the man escaped from the state farm and we haven't caught him yet, so the case has been dismissed. 
    But in this case, Your Honor, I think that you're reading a great deal into this very short letter, which the petitioner wrote. 
    Now, I hold him right strict to his words, because he is one of the finest con lawyers we've got, incarcerated in the Virginia State Penitentiary today. 
    And he's not a dumb fellow by any stretch of the imagination, he's been in watch before for murder and was pardoned. 
    So he knows what the score is.

    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    It's in the appendix Your Honor. 
    You'll find it in the opinion.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1423.570" stopTime="1497.420">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- all we know are these letters and because they are -- because they are briefs, maybe I can read them in -- this first one, eight days after he was ordered committed to the penitentiary reads, "In lieu of any known action on the part of my attorneys, I am taking this method of respectfully noting an appeal, from the life sentences imposed upon me in your Court from April 10th, 1953. 
    I will, within the allotted time, attempt to get counsel to complete the appeal." 
    Then five days later, he wrote a second letter in which he said, "Due to circumstances beyond my control, I have been unable to complete arrangements with an attorney to complete my appeal. 
    Therefore, I respectfully request that you appoint me counsel to appeal my case to the State Supreme Court of Appeals." 
    Now, isn't the firm interpretation of that he -- that he had no lawyer, that he was doing his best to appeal, that he wanted a lawyer and that he requested the Court to appoint one?
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="1497.420" stopTime="1597.530">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    I would concede that he wanted a lawyer. 
    There's no question about that. 
    But insofar as any other facts are concerned, they are pure supposition and I cannot concede any other fact from the fact that he wanted a lawyer. 
    Now, if I maybe permitted to point out one thing at this point, which is in our brief, it is not overly emphasized but it is in there and I think it's important. 
    If you examine the Court order which appears on pages 11 and 12 of this record and count the number of jurors, there are only 11 jurors on that -- on that list. 
    This man is not now detained under this order. 
    And detained under the order entered in the nunc pro tunc proceeding held in November of 1956, which put the name of Duncan on that list. 
    He was represented by court-appointed counsel in the nunc pro tunc proceeding. 
    He was an indigent at the time. 
    He asked the Court to appoint an attorney to assist him an appeal -- in appealing his case. 
    One was appointed and was later discharged. 
    Mr. Harlan, Ruby was appointed to represent him on appeal.He was later discharged by the petitioner in writing. 
    The petitioner is now detained in the Virginia State Penitentiary on that order. 
    He had an appeal from that order. 
    He is not detained under this order which contains only 11 names.

    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    No, sir. 
    He asked for a -- he asked the same Judge, Judge Douglas now, who tried him. 
    He said, "Judge, I don't have any money, I want an attorney." 
    The record shows, he was indigent. 
    And Judge Douglas immediately appointed an attorney to represent him. 
    Now, as we pointed out in the case at bar, from his original conviction, there's no indication that he was indigent. 
    And I have very carefully examined all of the papers ever filed of which we have copies which is everything by this gentleman. 
    And he's never said that in April of 1953, he was indigent. 
    The first person who ever suggested that was my good friend, Senator Boothe here and he assumed it. 
    It's a -- it's a very nice assumption, but it's not going out by the record. 
    The record doesn't show what his financial condition was. 
    And for that reason, we don't think that there's any merit to the suggestion made by counsel for petitioner before this Court. 
    And Mr. Newsom was broke without funds in April of 1953. 
    There's nothing in the record to support it. 
    Now, maybe if he had a hearing, it might be something different. 
    Of course, if we had a hearing, we could've looked in to see where his outside bank account is, because of couple of times going to govern, filing his petition, took all his money out and put it somewhere else.

    If this was -- if he was an indigent, have he -- if -- if Newsom had been an indigent in April 1953, and he told the judge so and the record so indicated before this Court, we have an entirely different case, as we see it. 
    But there's no clear cut case before this Court, there's no clear cut constitutional question. 
    This is not the case of an indigent, ignorant man being convicted and desiring an appeal. 
    This is not that case at all. 
    This is the case of a man represented by his own attorneys. 
    We don't know whether he was indigent or not. 
    We know he's an able man as an attorney. 
    You've only got to look at pages 2 through 4 of our brief and see what he's filed so far and he hasn't done badly. 
    He hasn't won anything yet, but he's getting better and better. 
    He's finally gotten here in the highest court of the United States. 
    He's no -- no ignorant person, at all. 
    This is not -- this is not the case at all of a -- of the ignorant indigent. 
    We have a confused situation, frankly, a very confused situation and it does not present a -- a constitutional question as suggested by my good friend, Senator Boothe in a clear cut, concrete or in sided form.

    Mr. Harp, may I ask you to put these views, (Inaudible) now, we have a confused situation. 
    Put aside your jurisdictional -- the jurisdictional question that you stirred and merely addressing oneself to the question of indigence, what do you say to this, we have no -- we have no light, no direct light from the Virginia court as against court or anybody else, is that right? 
    At best one can argue one way or the other is to write that opinion of his presupposes whether he did or didn't assume that this man was indigent.

    We have before us, the underlying documents. 
    Maybe the two letters to which Justice Black referred to them a while ago. 
    What do you say may this Court, in the situation which we find ourselves, make an independent judgment and conclude that those letters are if not an ignorant man, in elegant way of expressing the fact the he doesn't have a lawyer, because he hasn't got the money to hire one, to pay one.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If it -- if it appeared on the record that he was not indigent, then of course, your courts, whatever one may think about the law, need to appoint a lawyer for him. 
    It doesn't appear clearly that he was not indigent. 
    It doesn't appear clearly as far as your argument that he was indigent.

    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    I would respectfully suggest that the petition for writ of certiorari should be dismissed, as improvidently that would for lack of the proper record, for this reason that the -- the situation facing us today, I think is this. 
    You have a -- a filed up record and although I am very young at the Bar and a neophyte when one gets down to it, I have never felt that a court should determine a case on facts which are not recited. 
    I've never felt that we can assume anything in making a decision. 
    Indeed in this case, all the assumptions if any need be made are against petitioner's suggestions because the record clearly negates his financial condition that's signed. 
    The record negates also any allegation had he made one, which he did not. 
    That there was -- that there were any errors committed in the trial of the case. 
    So the question if any would be this, you've got man, we don't know if he's indigent or not, he makes no allegation as to whether or not, there were any errors in the case, moreover, the previous opinions of federal courts, two of them, in fact indicate that the man had a full and fair trial. 
    And there was nothing wrong.

    Mr. Harp, the very tribute you paid to the skill of this layman, namely that even experienced killer may be proven by the fact that he thinks it would be irrelevant for him to argue the merits of an appeal when all he's arguing now, is the right to have an appeal in the course of which, the merits of the appeal could be established.

    Mr. Harp, I hope before your time is done, you would say what you think about the case on the assumption. 
    The record shows this man was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life that he asked for an appeal. 
    Thereafter, he wrote the judge and asked him to appoint him a lawyer and on the assumption that he was indigent and couldn't get one, I'd -- I wish you would argue the merits of it and further, we read some announcements.
speaker="reno_s_harp_iii" startTime="2422.864" stopTime="2582.968">
    Mr. Reno S. Harp, III 
    Well, I'm frank to state that I had not devoted a great deal of time preparing for that particular question because I don't think it's raised by the record, but I would say this that in this particular case, in this particular man, with his ableness as an attorney, manifest on the record that in this case, the Court did not have to appoint an attorney to represent him. 
    Now, it is perhaps valid that the State should have some type of procedure, whether it be a certificate of probable cause, set up as, I understand the Federal Government has something along those lines so that if a man wanted to appeal, an attorney could be appointed to at least investigate it and read some sort of determination as to the merits of his contentions or see if there is an error of the face of the record or even in the transcript, if there'd be one. 
    Some setup perhaps, should be provided. 
    I don't know that if -- that you've got to appoint an attorney to carry it all the way out. 
    There should be some way that it could be handled to avoid that very situation, for this reason that if -- if the Court should hold -- furthermore, if the Court should hold for instance, that a man is entitled to have an attorney, an indigent male, the man is clearly broke, clearly without funds, if he is entitled to have an attorney to represent him on appeal, the Court should hold that now, what do we do? 
    There are approximately 125,000 people incarcerated in the penitentiaries of this country today, roughly. 
    About 6000 in Virginia alone and the -- the result of such a decision if it be made retroactive as it was, would be horrendous in the state courts anyway. 
    I don't know what would happen. 
    I'm frank to say, the -- as the Assistant Attorney General of Virginia signed to the overseeing of all habeas corpus cases, the -- an idea goes to the entire penal system including 31 road camps, 2 state farms and a state penitentiary for a -- a new ground for relief, takes roughly three days, we figured it. 
    Before the time the first petition comes in, alleging the particular matter until we get one from the farthest road camp away.

    If these letters are sufficient now, if these letters are sufficient Your Honor, let me put this case before the Court. 
    You have a man who's -- who was convicted we'll say, 25 years ago, at the age of 17, represented by a competent counsel. 
    A first degree murder of say, three or four people for heinous crimes and put away for the rest of his natural life, 25 years have now gone by and the Supreme Court of United States writes an opinion and says, "A man is -- a man is entitled to have counsel on appeal." 
    And he comes in to the -- the courts in the State of Virginia and files a petition for writ of habeas corpus and says, "I was denied an appeal." 
    And we say, what the records sound, we don't have any court -- official court reporters in Virginia now, so it has to be in the final judgment order of conviction. 
    The record's silent, everybody's dead, whoever had anything to do with the case.

    But I think this, I think that we miss one point in this case and that is this that in Virginia, insofar as we can tell from the Commonwealth side, if a man is indigent and is wrongly convicted, his attorney, who was appointed by the Court, will bring the case up himself without anybody asking him to other than -- other than the man who was convicted. 
    And we've had three during the past four months, one of them was reversed and the other two were not.

    Mr. -- Mr. Harp, I'd like to get some clarification on one or two things. 
    The assumption to which you answered on the merits, as I understand -- as I -- as I followed you, you dealing with the merits or an aspect of the merits, suggested the -- the grave consequences as you see them of making this a decision in case and who should prevail, retrospectively saying this is -- this has been -- is and has been a right under the Constitution and you addressed yourself to that for all the practical difficulties. 
    One of the assumptions that was put to use, is that there were errors in the trial. 
    Now, practically, how often would that assumption in its unquestioned form come before this Court? 
    You couldn't tell whether there were errors until you examine the record on the merits, unless the State confesses error and if the State confesses error, it wouldn't be confessing it here. 
    I mean, if it confessed it here, it would take appropriate step, I should suppose, to confess it below, so that to determine whether there is error in the record insofar as or there was a fair trial insofar as that is relevant and you urged its relevant for the consideration you gave, couldn't be determined merely by an assertion, but would require this Court to canvas whatever record is available of the original trial.

    Now, to conclude, I would say this, that we can't assume any of those things. 
    The record is silent as to his financial condition. 
    The record shows conclusively that he is expert in appellate proceedings. 
    The Fourth Circuit opinion as well as that of Judge Hoffman indicates that he had a full and fair trial, so there were no errors in the trial and he doesn't allege any errors.

    The record indicates he had a fair trial.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="armistead_lboothe" startTime="3443.045" stopTime="3705.069">
    Mr. Armistead L.boothe 
    -- try and answer one or two questions which have been raised. 
    Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I have obtained Section 8-596 of the Virginia Code and very practically, it appears to me that the petition for habeas corpus could've been filed either before the judge, who entered the original judgement order or in the Circuit Court of Corporation Court of any -- of any or any judge of either in vacation in the county or city in which the man was detained. 
    Now, the Court of Law and Equity Part II in the Hustings Court, they have a pretty similar jurisdiction and -- and it seems to me that -- that the man was absolutely right in going to any court, any trial court, any court of record in the jurisdiction which he was -- detained which was Richmond City. 
    And I don't believe that counsel will -- will deny that even though that's not shown in the record. 
    Now, Mr. -- Mr. Justice Black asked a good question. 
    Well, I'll -- I'll come back to that a little bit later. 
    Now, I would like to very briefly touch upon this question again raised for the first time, not in the response, not in the brief that the man's not held under the order which is in the record. 
    Now, this is the stipulated record and the order is at -- appears on page 10 -- page 11 as being the -- being a part of the record and we're now told that he's held under this record, under this order but under a nunc pro tunc order issued as a matter of fact, several years later. 
    Now, if that were a nunc pro tunc order and if it is in effect, what it says it is, then it takes the place of and it's substituted for this order and the man would be appealing from the same order changed only to add the name of the 12 jurors, which was originally wrongfully admitted from the -- from the first order. 
    Now, this nunc pro tunc order actually, was started after this man in March of 1956, filed for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he had been tried only by 11 jurors. 
    And then the State in November of 1956, more than three years after the -- the original proceedings proposed and -- and did have this nunc pro tunc order drawn up. 
    Now, one other comment I would like to make, Mr. Justice Clark, was referring to Judge Hoffman's opinion and the dates there I think, sir, that we could note it in the third paragraph in Appendix 4 of the State's brief. 
    It said there that a few days -- that -- that the -- the judge did make up, I beg your pardon, it's not on Appendix 4, it's -- it's on Appendix page 2 -- in the appendix at page 2 of the -- of the State's brief. 
    They said that, "While no transcript of evidence is available, a summary was prepared and signed by counsel" and Mr. Justice Clark, I mentioned that was his counsel at the -- who had been his counsel at the trial and who had not appeared from the time he made his motion to dismiss and from the time he filed his motion to dismiss back in 19 -- back in -- in April of -- on April 10 of 1953. 
    Now then, here in September, more than four months after that, when you couldn't have taken the case up, the -- Judge Hoffman says, the trial judge -- learned trial judge did certify the written testimony of three of the witnesses on the date following the trial. 
    Now, I -- I'm sure this was done in good faith, but I mentioned those things, number one, to say, they haven't gotten any of them. 
    They have no bearing on the case that we have before us -- this Court has before the other day and as a matter of fact, it does and I respectfully say to -- to my friend and colleague that because the case is so simple, because the issue is so simple, I do not blame him for trying to confuse this record by bringing in proceedings which have gone on since 1956 to date, covering 25 pages of his appendix and about a third of the main body of this brief.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3705.069" stopTime="3735.397">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, Senator Boothe, one of the things that isn't at all simple about this is the -- is the factual issue of whether or not, this man was an indigent. 
    He certainly does not allege -- did not allege in 1953 that he was an indigent. 
    He simply alleged that he was unable to make arrangements to obtain counsel. 
    And on Appendix page 4, there is a very clear indication in the opinion of Judge Hoffman that the -- that a possible reason other than indigency and which is that he was dissatisfied with his trial counsel. 
    That claimed to the State Bar about them.
speaker="armistead_lboothe" startTime="3735.397" stopTime="3749.423">
    Mr. Armistead L.boothe 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, I'm -- I'm glad you raised that because that was the question in regard to counsel which was before Judge Hoffman. 
    There, he was complaining as to the effectiveness of his counsel in the trial court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3749.423" stopTime="3751.644">

speaker="armistead_lboothe" startTime="3830.219" stopTime="3840.845">
    Mr. Armistead L.boothe 
    That's right, sir. 
    Insofar as the record shows, the only reason that association was terminated was because of his dissatisfaction or was there effectiveness?
speaker="armistead_lboothe" startTime="3840.845" stopTime="3928.124">
    Mr. Armistead L.boothe 
    I -- I think that -- that the -- from the record, that assumption could be made that he was dissatisfied. 
    Yes, sir. 
    I cannot -- I do not feel that that is the only assumption that can be made. 
    Now, I feel we've gone a good deal beyond the record for which I apologize. 
    I think the States gone a good deal beyond the record and the State went beyond the record before I did. 
    But we have got this man's own life before the Court now. 
    That he had $40 and -- $50.03 when he went in the penitentiary in -- about April the 10th -- 10th and on the 23rd, when he was trying to get his lawyer, he had $40. 
    And he said, "This was a reason for my failure to secure assistance and why I requested the court to appoint counsel. 
    And I'm sure check the prisoner records will reveal them. 
    I had my rival here. 
    And I'm saying to this Court, I'm sure check of the prisoner records by the able Assistant Attorney General of Virginia has shown that." 
    Now, as a matter of fact, that is true. 
    There is -- there is this doubt in the record and it's the doubt which can be expected when you realized that it is an ignorant man trying to -- to appeal. 
    Now, this -- the -- the States -- United States, I mean the -- the State Attorney General talked about this man. 
    I've been down seeing that, pop news in the corner. 
    He's a very distinguished nice looking, white-haired man, wouldn't harm a fly, if you looked at it -- just look at him.

    He failed to allege -- they say that he was indigent and -- and that is perfectly true, but that does show the -- the difficulties in these cases and of course, a man in his condition.

    Mr. Armistead L.boothe 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, I -- I feel that in closing, I -- in one minute, I would like to get right back to exactly what the case was about. 
    Mr. Justice -- Mr. Justice Black, in your question to Mr. Harp, you asked him to discuss the merits. 
    I would like to point out to the Court the merits as they appear to the State. 
    Now, I think that he's answered your questioning his brief. 
    And on page 5, in the question presented, he says in effect, is a person -- I'm going to leave that to represent him by counsel of his choosing because he's certain of -- he mentioned, a man represented by counsel of his own choosing, when his counsel has withdrawn from the case. 
    Now obviously, he has asked for the counsels. 
    I'm going to leave this language here, just get right down to the very crux of the case. 
    Is a person convicted of a capital offense and sentenced to life imprisonment, entitled to have court-appointed counsel upon appeal, in the absence of any allegation that he is a pauper? 
    Now, the State of Virginia has in all fairness and honesty, not say -- not said that he was not a pauper. 
    They have simply based their entire case upon the fact that he did not, unless he was a pauper. 
    They are admitting when you seize upon and look at that question, that had he alleged he was a pauper? 
    He would have been entitled to -- to have had counsel representing him on appeal in this case. 
    And winding up finally, I would just like to go back to the record, something from which we have won. 
    Again on page 27 and the able, scholarly trial judge who decided this very issue, which is now before the Court, the man from whose decision certiorari has been granted ultimately, said on page 27, "Whether an indigent defendant is entitled to the assistance of counsel on appeal has not yet been squarely decided by the United States Supreme Court." 
    An annotator says that such a decision in the affirmative would appear to be no more than a logical extension of the Griffin doctrine. 
    And then the judge, in a nutshell, places the case by saying whether this due be correct or incorrect is of course the question in the instant case. 
    Now, there's your evidence, there is the record and there is the matter which was before the trial judge and which is before this Honorable Court today.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Senator Boothe, on behalf of the Court, I should like to express our appreciation to you for your representation of this indigent defendant. 
    We're always comforted when lawyers will accept assignments of this kind. 
    We know they're burdensome. 
    And Mr. Harp, I want to say to you that we -- we appreciate the earnest and diligent manner in which you represented the interest of your State.
