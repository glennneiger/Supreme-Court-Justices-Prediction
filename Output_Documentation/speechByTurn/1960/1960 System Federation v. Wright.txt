    Mr. Richard R. Lyman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    I represent the petitioners in this case who are a group of railroad labor organizations, commonly referred to as shop craft unions as well as some of their subsidiary component local unions who were enjoined along with the respondent Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company some 15 years ago from discriminating against a group of non-union plaintiffs with respect to affording those plaintiffs' full and equal enjoyment of all of the rights given to them and other employees in their respective crafts, under collective bargaining agreements that were negotiated between this petitioner organizations in the railroad company. 
    We are now here seeking for reversal of decisions of the courts below which refuse to modify that old injunction to the extent of permitting us to ask the railroad to execute a union shop, union security agreement with this petitioner labor organizations as bargaining representatives. 
    The type of agreement we sought to negotiate of course is the type that was authorized by the 1951 amendments to Railway Labor Act which came along some six years after this old injunction was issued and which subject to enumerated safeguards, did authorize union security agreements in the railroad industry which had previous had been an open shop industry. 
    And this Court is very familiar with that in view of the decision in the Hanson case which was the first time that those 1951 amendments had been held to be constitutional. 
    We petition for modification of this injunction in accordance with Rule 60 (b) subparagraph 5 under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which authorizes modification of an injunction in its prospective application when circumstances have so changed as to make it inequitable for the injunction to be continued in an effect -- in effect in its original form. 
    What we --

    Thank you.

    Mr. Richard R. Lyman 
    What we asked the Courts to do was not to vacate the injunction, not to open the door to any unlawful discrimination against these original plaintiffs and members of their class, but simply to give us a pro tanto modification. 
    So that the injunction which at time of its issuance had declared and protected plaintiffs' rights under the Railway Labor Act as it existed at that time would now be modified so that it would protect the rights of these plaintiffs and their class under the Railway Labor Act in its present form. 
    And we sought and obtained a review by this Court on three questions that we urged that were involved, three points in which we stated that the courts below aired in the decision that they reached. 
    First of all, the Courts concluded, both the District Court and the per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals which was primarily a paraphrasing of the decision and reasoning of the District Court, the Courts concluded first that the amendment of the Railway Labor Act is so as to permit union shop agreements, which had previously been unlawful, was not a sufficient change in circumstances as to justify removing this injunctive prohibition against our negotiating such agreements. 
    Then they also ruled that in view of the fact that the original decree of an injunction had been a consent decree rather than a decree written by the Court following a complete trial and litigation of the old suit. 
    Therefore, we must be deemed to have agreed with this original plaintiff's and their class that never at anytime in the future would we ever negotiate a union shop agreement. 
    So the courts below both fell into the error that this Court come in to (Inaudible) Swift case of treating the consent decree as a contract rather than as a judicial act. 
    And third, both courts --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="386.758" stopTime="389.733">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible) decree, there's a contract did you say?
speaker="richard_r_lyman" startTime="389.733" stopTime="504.803">
    Mr. Richard R. Lyman 
    Yes Your Honor, and of course in the Swift case, this Court discussed that concept in considerable length. 
    And third, both of the courts below give such comments in their opinions to evidence submitted over the objections of the moving parties, the petitioners here that -- that we must consider that they give weight to it and -- and give it effect in refusing to modify injunction. 
    That evidence was to the effect that as a result of an economic strike on the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad in 1955, they remain a great deal of bitterness and hostility among the employees of the railroad and the evidence showed that these petitioner organizations had find and expelled members who worked during the strike. 
    The L &amp; M claim that 2500 of these employees stayed at work during the strike. 
    And now, they came in this proceeding to modify the old injunction to permit us and negotiate a union shop and urged that because there was this antipathy among the employee groups, which had nothing whatsoever to do with the original injunction against discrimination in the enjoinment of contract rights, had nothing whatever to do with this union shop agreement but was simply bitterness in strike out of -- between strikers and strike breakers that this should be construed as holding us without clean hands and hence not entitled to negotiate the union shop agreement.

    Yes Your Honor that -- Judge Sherburne's opinion appears at page 69 of the record.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Oh, yes.
speaker="richard_r_lyman" startTime="529.973" stopTime="952.710">
    Mr. Richard R. Lyman 
    Now, I think it's important to have in mind the nature of the discrimination that was charged in the original complaint, it illustrates that I have nothing to do with this so-called bitterness or hostility. 
    What these plaintiffs originally complaining about was the fact that the non-union employees they alleged had been -- had been denied equal opportunities for promotions from one category of employment to another, had been denied their fair share of overtime assignments, and had been denied certain attributes of their seniority status, all claim to be governed by the contracts between the company and the organization in certain matters such as picking man to be temporarily upgraded from helper to a temporary mechanics job or in assigning men to be called for overtime in particular jobs. 
    There is discretion that's exercised by a local foreman and a local union committee in deciding who they think to be the best man to be upgraded. 
    And that was the gist of this original action. 
    There was no question of a union shop agreement back in 1945. 
    But this Court just prior of entry of this consent decree, had decided the landmark Steele and Tunstall cases which contained a complete and new to all of us exposition of the statutory fiduciary duty of bargaining agents and the carriers under the Railway Labor Act not to join in discriminating against members of the class representative. 
    Now up until the Steele and Tunstall cases were decided of course the -- as this Court knows from having reversed both the Supreme Court of Alabama and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, there was a quite a body of authority relied upon by many course to the affect that you couldn't maintain a lawsuit based on discrimination which was joined in by the company and the union. 
    But, when these cases were decided, there was no longer any point in litigating this lawsuit on the original complaint for the purpose of trying to create any precedent. 
    The precedent was there for us, this Courts opinion in the Steele and Tunstall cases practically wrote the form of our consent decree force. 
    But then when we came along after the Railroad Labor Act was amended as to permit a union shop agreement, the railroad suddenly said, "Do as, well, we won't sign that agreement with you because somebody is going to hold us some contempt of this old decree that says we can't discriminate based on non-membership in the union." 
    So, that's was this case is about and that's what precipitated this motion to modify the injunction. 
    Now, probably one of the most basic concepts on modification of injunctions is it in -- in injunction does not create a right but simply furnishes the protection, a remedy for the protection of a right which must find its source some place else. 
    In this case, the source of the right asserted in the original complaint was the Railway Labor Act. 
    It was the statutory fiduciary duty defined by this Court in the Steele and Tunstall cases. 
    Now, our position to support of the modification and the injunction is quite simple, these rights stems from the statute. 
    The statute has now been amended so as to change the nature of the right. 
    And if we don't have the injunction modified to conform to this change, we're confronted with the situation of these petitioners continuing under threat of this injunction, under panic contempt proceedings for violating it, continuing to be prohibited from negotiating agreements which Congress has said in these words, "They shall be permitted to negotiate." 
    And the original plaintiffs and the people that have been intervened in these more recent proceedings would be continued to be protected, would continue to have this injunctive remedy for the protection of a right which is no longer in existence. 
    And of course aside from the inequity of being prohibited from engaging in con -- conduct which is lawful and which Congress said it is desirable now for national public policy in the railroad industry to prevent free riders to require employees to bear their fair share or the cost of burden -- the cost in the burden of collective bargaining. 
    In addition to -- to just the inequity of being prohibited from doing something that you have a legal right to do, there is of course the additional very substantial financial consideration that's involved in which these petitioners are seeking the right to enjoy. 
    We have by railroads argument in this brief, I believe this claim that 2500 employees work during the strike and that everybody that work doing the strike was expelled from the union or was not a member of the union to begin with. 
    But we took a very small figure for the amount of dues income that would be lost by these organizations as a result of being kept under this injunction. 
    I suspect a very conservative estimate what the dues lost would be if you would assume 1% of an employer's monthly earnings for -- for his monthly dues. 
    I suppose you have between $100,000 to $200,000 to this lawsuit dues to these group of petitioners so, this is not a situation where the petitioners are not suffering any particular inequity or in any particular wrong or not hurting from the continuously injunction.

    Mr. Richard R. Lyman 
    They can be. 
    And we would very much like to be able to require them to join and to make their contributions to the overall cost to collective bargaining. 
    Now, there is one point that and one only that runs through all of the briefs of the respondents, both the respondent, Railroad Company and the individual employee response. 
    That is this idea of an agreement, an agreement to the agreement. 
    They don't speak of the decree. 
    They speak of the decree and the agreement. 
    And they give the impression they try to give the impression in their briefs as they seem to have succeeded in doing with the District Court that this was not an ordinary kind of a consent decree of injunction but it was something a little unusual. 
    The say that we agreed in some kind of a tripartite agreement between the plaintiffs, the company and the unions that there would be never be a union security agreement negotiated on this property. 
    The fact is there is no such agreement and we challenge counsel in the District Court and the Court of Appeals and we've done it here to point to any place in the record where there is such agreement. 
    We have further demonstrated that by reference to their own briefs, that when press, what they say is that the decree was the agreement. 
    And they say that by the act of settling the case by a consent decree therefore, we must by some magical method be assumed to have entered into some implied agreement. 
    We would not ever negotiate the union shop agreement.

    The parties agreed to one, the entering of the consent decree two, the waiver and release by the plaintiffs, the law claims against the defendants for damages and three, the payment of the sum of $5000 by the defendants to the plaintiffs.

    There's no issue of burden of proof there or anything. 
    We say that the statute was change -- was completely eliminated, pro tanto, the right that the injunction previously protected and the Court has no discretion to misapply the law, if it were request of weighing evidence or having at some appraisal as to what the effect of this modification might be for factual point of views and to review the discretion.

   Argument of Marshall P. Eldred
speaker="marshall_p_eldred" startTime="1739.078" stopTime="1972.212">
    Mr. Marshall P. Eldred 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    At the outset, let me call the Court's attention to the fact that the release which counsel mentioned as being not sure whether it was in the record is in the record. 
    It begins at page 138 and continues through -- through page 144. 
    As you were allude to that release in a few moments from now, if I may proceed with what I deemed to be -- should be said first to this Court and an orderly presentation of the reasons the respondents have for affirmance of the decisions below. 
    In the first place, I think we should determine what requirements for modification of an injunction are, necessarily saw in order to determine whether the facts in this case bring us within permissive modification. 
    Well, of course the leading case on that subject is the case decided by this Court, the Swift case, and this Court has clearly said in the Swift decision that the requirement for modification is that there must be a clear showing of grievous wrong that must be shown by the movement evoked by new and unforeseen conditions. 
    Secondly, we wished to point out that the courts have held at modification must effectuate and not what the purpose of the original decree. 
    In the next place, we desire to call the Court's attention to the fact that, as already mentioned, that modification under Rule 60 (b) is addressed to the sound legal discretion of the Court and is not to be disturbed except for an abuse of that discretion. 
    It is our position that in this case, the petitioners have failed to show any abuse of the discretion of the District Court. 
    In order to point that out, I think we should briefly analyze what the District Court held when he denied the motion to modify the injunction in this case. 
    The District Court recognized his continuing authority to modify the injunctions not withstanding the consent nature of the decree. 
    He recognized that authority -- his authority continuing to modify under the formulae setup by this Court in the Swift case. 
    The District Court concluded that the 1951 amendment, which is the sole reliance of petitioners in this case for modification for 1951 amendment to the Railway Labor Act which is Section 211 of that Act was permissive only and the District Court concluded that on the basis of this Court's decision in the Hanson case. 
    Secondly, the District Court concluded that the Railway Labor Act leaves the railroad and the unions at liberty to agree that a union shop shall not prevail. 
    He concluded that there was such an agreement in this case namely that a union shop should not prevail and that that agreement underlie the decree issued originally in this case.

    All that was necessary for the unions to have done in this consent decree since evidently, they did not want to take the issues to the Court in the trial, was simply to do what is done in -- for example Fair Labor Standard Act cases.

    They said that the entering of a consent decree in the force of action the purpose of which will be protect the undersigned against any future acts or practices, however, by the defendants which will deny to the undersigned any -- any of their rights benefits under the collective bargaining agreements. 
    Now, in effect, all which may hereafter be entered into -- in accordance with the Railway Labor Act.

    Mr. Marshall P. Eldred 
    By reason of their failure to join or maintain membership in the union, at that time of course, the Railway Labor Act forbad the union shop. 
    Now, they're saying here that in view of giving up certain rights than we have in this lawsuit and in order to settle all our issues, we agree that the non-union employees on the L&amp;N Railroad in the six shop crest shall not be required to join or maintain membership in the union under any bargaining agreement now in effect, of course you didn't need it because the Act forbad it then are hereafter in effect in accordance with the Railway Labor Act.

    Mr. Marshall P. Eldred 
    It was well. 
    It was because two years before this suit was filed in 1945 and in 1943, the unions had made a demand upon the L&amp;N and other railroads for a certain wage increases and a union shop not withstanding the fact that it's Railway Labor Act at that time for better union shop. 
    The dispute was so serious that it was referred to a presidential emergency board. 
    The Mulholland Firm of Toledo, Ohio which is the firm representing the unions today, participated in that hearing before the emergency board. 
    And Mr. Willard H. McEwen was before that board. 
    He was also one of counsel for the unions when we filed this case in 1945 and took discovered deposition before this decree was agreed upon. 
    Before the emergency board, Mr. McEwen and other counsel representing the unions advanced the contention that even then, under the Railway Labor Act as it existed, the unions were entitled to a union shop but they made the argument that it more expedient that the emergency board should recommend to the Congress that the Railway Labor Act be amended so that they could have a union shop. 
    And that the fact the notice given to the carriers was to grab a union shop, and that was two years before this suit, and two years before this agreement was entered into by the very counsel who was representing the -- these unions before the presidential emergency board.

    Pick out a railroad, said the XYZ railroad where no union shop prevail. 
    Suppose as in this case, the union in that case was not permitting non-union employees to get fair share of employment, rights and benefits. 
    Suppose the suit had been filed asking for declaration of rights and for an injunction against that discrimination and for damages for the loss of wages that the non-union employees had suffered. 
    Suppose the parties had gotten together and said, "We will settle all the issues in this litigation." 
    And among other things, we're going to agree that there will be no union shop now, under the -- under the provision for the Railway Labor Act as it exist or in the future under the Railway Labor Act as it may then exist.

    Mr. Marshall P. Eldred 
    Correct. 
    Now, there must be a grievous wrong which results -- now, simply, a change in the law which permits a union shop agreement is not sufficient, because the unions have not shown under your Swift formula that this decree results in a grievous wrong to them, nor have they shown that that grievous wrong was evoked by new and unforeseen circumstances. 
    I think I've already pointed out to the Court that the -- it was not a new and unforeseen circumstance, the amendment to the Railway Labor Act because the unions knew two years before and were trying their best to get a union shop on a railroad and had sought to have a recommendation come from a presidential emergency board that Congress amend the Act and forbid a union shop agreement.

    Mr. Marshall P. Eldred 
    On page 77 of the record. 
    The Court concluded that the Railway Labor Act leaves the railroad and the unions at liberty to agree that a union shop shall not prevail, and then immediately after that that there was such an agreement which underlay the decree of December the 7th, 1945. 
    And the Court further, on page 78 of the record, concluded that, "Under the Railway Labor Act as it then existed forbidding a union shop, it was not necessary for the unions to agree to that but that they went farther than they were required to do in order to agree that no union shop would prevail." 
    Then the Court -- District Court goes on to find that the change of law alone is not sufficient, because it does not result in any grievous wrong to the unions, resulting for new and unforeseen circumstances. 
    The unions have not met the burden of proof which this Court, in the Ford case, said, "is upon the movement in an effort to modify an injunction." 
    Now, the only thing the -- the union has shown is simply on a member of the Railway Labor Act which permits the parties but doesn't require it." 
    The unions in effect, argue that the amendment to the Railway Labor Act compels a union shop agreement.

    Mr. Richard R. Lyman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I wanted to state that particularly with respect to this agreement argument. 
    I want to call the Court's attention to the fact that Mr. Eldred, when called upon to read the agreement, turned to page 36 to 37 of the record and what he read was the course decree which -- which simply serves to emphasize a -- a statement that what Mr. Eldred and the Court -- and the District Court and the Court of Appeals in the language which he read to you held that that decree was an underlying agreement. 
    That would -- the decree itself that they said was the agreement. 
    And of course, we argue here and it is our position that it was error where the Court too so hold and it was directly contrary to the Swift case. 
    And one -- one further point I would like to finish was --

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    I thought he was reading record on 138.

    Mr. Richard R. Lyman 
    -- he turned -- he read the -- from the release for a while and then we he got down to the declaration of rights, he was reading from page 37 of the record, the decree. 
    He says that when -- when Your -- Your Honors pressed him for more language as to what the obligations and what the prohibitions were, where was the agreement that said, what they were prohibited from doing, what he read was the decree and that of course is what we're here seeking to modify.

    May I ask you this question and -- these 28 plaintiffs, the original plaintiffs for the class which they represent, do they -- was there any -- any differentiation between them and the other members of your -- the members of your unions except for these people have principles regarding union empathy?

    Mr. Richard R. Lyman 
    That's all that there were in the original action and I might say that -- I propose Your Honor's question to Mr. Eldred down the consideration concept and settlement of this thing for $5000. 
    The -- the Swift case would seem to say that the fact that 28 people might have entered into such a contract if there were any contract, wouldn't justify preventing a union shop agreement to be negotiated for anybody else except for those 28 people.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3886.019" stopTime="3900.504">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What they did -- the settlement or the claim which was settled in there and something for them, was a claim of discrimination, wasn't it? 
    Is it claimed that the union didn't -- this bargaining agency didn't do well about it, is that right?
speaker="richard_r_lyman" startTime="3900.504" stopTime="3934.704">
    Mr. Richard R. Lyman 
    Well, we learn as we go along. 
    The claim was really a -- a claim of agreement violations. 
    This case was decided before this Court decided the cases Local against Steele and W. which created the concept of exclusive jurisdiction in the National Railroad Adjustment Board and I think where we going back to retry this lawsuit, we might well have had quite a hassle as to whether these men wouldn't have had to file their claims for deprival of overtime under the overtime rule with the National Railroad Adjustment Board.
