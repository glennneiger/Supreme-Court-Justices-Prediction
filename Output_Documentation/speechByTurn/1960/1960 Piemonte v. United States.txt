    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    Mr. Chief Justice, just prior to the recess Mr. -- a question was asked with regard directly to the statute. 
    And I think the Government's answer without any question is that the man has immunity. 
    And I think this is related to the question that the Chief Justice asked me and I like to explain it in these terms. 
    Take this example, if we take Piemonte in this particular context and he was at the point where he was granted immunity by the court and then he is now taken in front of a grand jury, the same grand jury that day or the next day as happened here. 
    And the very first question that's -- I think this is a part of it. 
    The very first question is, “Now, did you rob the First National Bank?” 
    I think the answer is yes, he has immunity in regard to that transaction. 
    And I say it for the same reason that I answered the Chief Justice. 
    And that this -- the prosecutor has decided quite clearly in that case that this is relevant to the inquiry. 
    I do not think that the witness has to decide or should decide what is relevant to the narcotics inquiry if the prosecutor chooses to open up this avenue and that's where we're going. 
    And in this connection of course, it's true the prosecutor and he usually told to be very careful because Congress has continually told the prosecutors, "Don't give anybody an immunity bath," as they term it. 
    But I say very clearly without any question, that if the prosecutor in this grand jury asked this question, he does get immunity. 
    Now, this doesn't always have to happen in this sequence and it's only when you get away from this particular -- the particular facts here that I come to another problem namely --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="143.313" stopTime="182.294">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Before you get to that, can we just pursue this just a little farther? 
    Apparently, that the robbing in the First National Bank is well about as far away from a narcotic bracket and as you would expect almost any other crime to be. 
    Now, does that mean that -- that any question that he asks would -- would confer immunity? 
    Any question whether it's -- it's murder or robbery or -- or anything else?
speaker="theodore_george_gilinsky" startTime="182.294" stopTime="190.772">
    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky

    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    I -- I think the witness is entitled to rely on the Government. 
    If the Government tells me he has immunity in this circumstance and the Government then asks him a question which the Government thinks is relevant, I think the witness has a right to rely upon. 
    I think the statute gives him immunity.

    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    Well, now, may I make this clear?

    But because if I may -- if I may say --
speaker="theodore_george_gilinsky" startTime="231.204" stopTime="232.256">
    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="232.256" stopTime="277.105">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- after all, Judge Campbell and no other judge normally, when -- when wasn't assumed irrational judges, but there maybe such or irrational moments, the judge was specific as to what he compel answers from which the compulsion leading to immunity by virtue of a statute, which is a restrictive statute. 
    Congress has again and again refused a general immunity statute. 
    It has passed ad hoc immunity statutes, beginning with the case that came up at the provision of 18 -- whatever it was in Brown against -- that was sustaining Brown against Walker.
speaker="theodore_george_gilinsky" startTime="277.105" stopTime="279.334">
    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    Brown and Walker.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="279.334" stopTime="373.586">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Step by step and even today, there are very few, so that the grant of immunity is limited by congressional command, by congressional direction to specific crimes. 
    And the judge grants immunity by enumerating it in this case, to what subject matter the grant for what subject matter -- the grant to what subject matter the grant applies. 
    And presumably, it's one thing as you said a minute ago, if the district attorney considering the latitude one has as to relevance particularly before a grand jury in determining what is relevant, certainly, if -- if he thinks that. 
    But if he goes on a joyride of his own and suddenly takes it into his head to be asking him about the man act in a narcotics -- in the jury court for narcotics inquiries are restricted to that, you got a different problem. 
    In that way, you mustn't assume (a) that the U.S. Attorney would travel outside of the framework of that which grants immunity, (b) that a witness doesn't know that he's traveling outside as in this case, where he's given a whole day until he's asked to return to the grand jury to consult with his lawyer. 
    And (c) that court would act on it. 
    All of those, this is the house the judge built, would have to be involved in order to find and in order to conclude that when quite outside of the scope of the allowed immunity, a strange U.S. Attorney does the kind of a plea that you interpreted.

    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    -- let me add this -- this -- let me add -- may I have this problem here? 
    On the other hand, there are instances and they're not usual in this type of field, because it just doesn't come up. 
    But where we would have let's say, a small town grand jury who have the problem of investigating a lot of things besides narcotics and where the grand jury has under consideration a great deal more than they would have in this -- in this case, I can see a situation where the prosecutor may say to a witness even after the grant of immunity and in the grand jury after discussing the narcotics situations say to this witness, either them or some weeks later. 
    Now, the questions that I am about to ask you are not related to the immunity that you were granted and I am telling you so, they are related to another matter which this grand jury is investigating. 
    Under those circumstances, I do not -- and if -- without any question that this was made clear, I would say unto those circumstances the statute does not, does not grant immunity to the -- the questions that would come after that. 
    Now --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I want to ask you one question on grant.

speaker="theodore_george_gilinsky" startTime="601.090" stopTime="692.699">
    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    I think we have to start Mr. Justice Black with a problem of a narcotic question under this statute or a relevant question under any other immunities that I think they all work the same. 
    If you don't start with an investigation in regard to which the immunity statute is directed, I do not think that any judge either has authority or can just give immunity. 
    So, we have to start with a -- with a general type of narcotic investigation. 
    Now then, after that and -- and after complying with the statute in that regard, then the judge let's say as in this case, told him to go back and answer these questions in front of this grand jury. 
    I think at that point as I told Mr. Justice Stewart that if the first question is in regard to this bank, I think everyone is entitled to understand that that is relevant and it has to do with narcotics and it's a link in the chain and as the Chief Justice mentioned, many of these people have to get their money by robbing and -- and murdering is not unusual for them to be involved in this and this would get into the whole controversy.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, let me put this case to you. 
    Let's test these things. 
    The first phrase is a great deal of confusion arriving from talking about the statute-conferred immunity. 
    The statute doesn't confer immunity. 
    The statute authorizes a judge.It gives him certain powers. 
    Therefore, we are dealing with jurisdiction in the ultimate sense of the term, "power". 
    Let me put to this question, suppose the judge was brought before him this defendant, says “While we're about it, I know this grand jury is at large. 
    It isn't called just to deal with narcotics. 
    I know that it's also investigating a counterfeiting ring.” 
    And therefore, while we're about it, I tell you if the district attorney, when he gets through with narcotics question or when he wants to play another question, while he talks about narcotic matters, asked you about counterfeiting. 
    I instruct you now to answer those questions too and I grant you immunity. 
    Would he have immunity for those counterfeiting problems? 
    Has the judge power to grant him immunity for counterfeiting your offenses?
speaker="theodore_george_gilinsky" startTime="802.663" stopTime="804.458">
    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    I do not think so.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="828.161" stopTime="863.686">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand well that what is relevant that if a district attorney on his conscience and none for his duty, deems a question relevant considering the scope we've given the grand jury investigation and the hearsay and all the rest. 
    I can well understand and that I well understand, I agree that if the district attorney thinks the question is relevant, we aren't going to test this in another case. 
    But if the district attorney travels outside of the orbit of the subject matter for which the judge is authorized to give immunity, he can't give immunity.

    Namely that he must keep within the framework of narcotics question and I'm not going to sit here to decide whether in fact, what he asked was relevant. 
    I presumed that when a U.S. Attorney asked a question, he's asking a question in accordance with law and it would be not in accordance with law to compel an answer outside of narcotics legislation because that's the only basis on which immunity could have been given by a court --

    I think that the prosecutor and as far as I know, they always do, they ask some questions relevant to the narcotic statute. 
    Now, it maybe that there are a lot of other things related to getting at a conviction of narcotics and the statute is broad in that scope namely any testimony or any transaction. 
    I mean, you don't have to pinpoint -- the -- the violation doesn't have to be pinpointed and the question doesn't have to be pinpointed in order to grant a greater immunity. 
    But I -- I've always assumed that the prosecutors will ask questions as they're -- in -- in this -- in this field. 
    Certainly, the United States Attorney when he made the affidavit told the judge, “This was a grand jury investigating trafficking narcotics.” 
    And that's all the evidence in this record shows that's exactly what was going on. 
    And the -- all the prosecutor's questions, well, some of them certainly, with some of -- "Do you know John Doe?"

    The problem -- the problem is that is you see, I -- I would agree to the -- let me go to another spectrum maybe to help answer this. 
    If -- I think there is no question that if the United States Attorney or whoever is interrogating the -- in front of the grand jury says to a witness in front of the grand jury, “Now, I am now about to ask you some questions on narcotics. 
    The judge did -- or on that counterfeiting. 
    The judge has not granted you immunity on counterfeiting and I am telling you in no uncertain terms, do you understand that?” 
    And if the witness says, yes, I under -- I don't mean that you have to use a particular formula. 
    What I'm getting to is that -- now, I think it would be unrealistic, unrealistic to assume that that petitioner then thought he had immunity after that.

    Yes.
speaker="theodore_george_gilinsky" startTime="2051.886" stopTime="2194.071">
    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    -- one of my -- my -- what I'm really getting to is the -- I think you have to deal in real life situations. 
    If everyone on the grand jury was so certain and so clear about this whole thing, I think the petitioner wouldn't -- I don't think, whatever the question about whether he thought he had immunity either. 
    I mean he can't do perfectly abstract about the problem. 
    These are people that understand things. 
    And this petitioner, I don't think -- well certainly on his motive, let me add and while it -- it is relevant to this extent in this case, certainly on his motive for not answering, which he said that he was afraid, I think there's no question that he wasn't worried about the confusion problem or anything else and his lawyer was not worried about any confusion and very clearly, his lawyer told the judge at the time of the hearing to show cause that the real reason this defendant is not answering is because he's afraid. 
    No one said anything about as the petitioner now raises some questions whether you can ask marijuana questions, we think it clearly covered. 
    We -- if the question as to the scope of the grant, this type of problem I suppose, can always be raised. 
    As a matter of fact, it was -- the scope was raised in Reina, the same type of question. 
    That we -- we can get -- you can always enumerate a number of questions after the fact that could have created a confusion. 
    But we think if you really read the record that you find that the Government was not only fair to this petitioner, or watched his -- his rights all the way through. 
    And if anything, the colloquy about the question of whether or not he should have been granted of privilege or not, I think all it goes to is the fact that the Government bought more it had to buy, if anything. 
    That we did not have to grant as -- all this immunity, but we did out of the matter. 
    Fairness wouldn't have to pick and choose, we did grant more. 
    Of course, this is normal in a number of cases that happened in Reina, it happened in Brown versus Walker, the very first case. 
    The -- there's no question, the whole opinion talks great deal about the fact that the auditor may not have been incriminating himself at all, as a matter of fact on -- on the questions.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2194.071" stopTime="2202.723">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I'm trying to get to the answer to your -- at the start of your questions affecting the facts --
speaker="theodore_george_gilinsky" startTime="2202.723" stopTime="2456.517">
    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    I'll -- I'll go that immediately. 
    The Government's view on the -- on the indictment is that this is irrelevant to this case. 
    First of all, this petitioner was not a defendant in a case at the time of the grand jury. 
    There's no question about that. 
    There's an assumption. 
    This -- this petitioner was not a target of this grand jury. 
    This comes nowhere near the type of case where we get concerned about who's being interrogated in front of a grand jury. 
    In the reply brief, the petitioner posed the question as if he had stood mute. 
    And that that was all that was necessary. 
    Now, without getting into the vagaries of grand juries and why they indict and why they do not indict, if anything -- if anything, we think -- and this goes to the whole scope of all legal questions including even fairness, if anything, they all arise if at all in the indictment case. 
    And this is true even under the statute. 
    If we read the statute in its narrowest terms, wit, that the Government had merely an election and I think that's much more narrowly than the statute should be read in election. 
    The statute specifically says and from the last clause of it, “No witness shall be exempt under this section from prosecution for perjury or contempt.” 
    We're clear, they would end this statute. 
    This is not to say that there may not be problems in another case, as with this Court has had other cases like that. 
    And one of them that come to mind is Regan versus New York. 
    A serious problem or much more serious than this, because in that case, the man had waived immunity, so that he clearly was going to be not only indicted, but could be held in contempt. 
    So the clear problem in this Court very clearly understood, those problems can arrive and they'll be handled in another case, if they are problems at all. 
    We do not say that this is a criminal case. 
    This is a criminal proceeding. 
    This man was not a defendant. 
    If this man were as the petitioner so places him, he certainly would've been entitled to a lawyer right then and there, in the grand jury room. 
    And I have yet -- I do not believe this Court has ever felt that. 
    Certainly, there's no difference in the calling it a witness statute and the Fifth Amendment uses the same term. 
    I mean, we're not -- we're not talking about words then in those -- in those terms. 
    I cannot see how and I know of no case, how a subsequent proceeding entirely unrelated, because it's a crime in narcotics and the other, this case is about disobeying a court order, how it can retroactively knockout and that's the way I read it, “Knockout a judgment that a -- a court has made without more than that.” 
    I know of no case that would so hold. 
    It is the reverse argument that was made in Reina. 
    Reina wanted a pardon for what he'd already -- and this is just the other way around that he wants something that he may not be entitled to. 
    But if he were even, that would be a problem which clearly should be raised in the indictment case in whatever it's worth it. 
    The facts in this case, it will not come because the indictment was dismissed by the Government because the witness was unable to identify Piemonte at that time of the trial. 
    And that's clearly disclosed on the record. 
    Unless there are some other questions Your Honor, why I think that covers the problem for the Government. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Melvin B. Lewis
speaker="melvin_b_lewis" startTime="2463.364" stopTime="2586.180">
    Mr. Melvin B. Lewis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I can think there are only two propositions that would be appropriate to the reply that I here, undertake, both in the view of the rather limited scope of what's been brought out on the oral argument and in view of the rather limited remaining time. 
    I should suggest Your Honors that when we speak of whether immunity will result in a different -- in -- in varying situations, we get into rather a dangerous area of comparing equitable immunity in a situation in which a man would have every right to come up and urge to a trial court, "Good heavens, look what happened to me down there and just generally, equitably, I ought not to be prosecuted." 
    On the one hand, with statutory immunity, the absolute, complete uncompromising bar on the other. 
    Now, equitable immunity will indeed arise as counsel as in -- as intimated from reliance upon the Government in his representations in certain circumstances. 
    However, a failure to perceive on the basis of equitable immunity will not I believe, serve as a basis for a contempt order. 
    The statutory immunity of the provisions I think, are plain. 
    Now, I would take some issue with the proposition that the court grants immunity in these situations, just as the Isaac case does and just as counsel here did not seem to urge with any great vigor. 
    What the court does in these circumstances, is to evaluate the petition and then to compel the witness to surrender his constitutional immunity. 
    It does not however, grant him immunity from prosecution. 
    The grant is statutory and close from the witnesses testifying, with reference to any subject, matter or thing concerning which he has first claimed his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and then thereafter, testifies. 
    The most significant words in the statute as I read it, are having first claimed his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination or words of that genre.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2586.180" stopTime="2593.022">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It requires -- it requires this order of the court before immunity could go to him.
speaker="melvin_b_lewis" startTime="2593.022" stopTime="2594.338">
    Mr. Melvin B. Lewis 
    Oh certainly, certainly yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2594.338" stopTime="2600.772">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And it is the court that must enter this order. 
    And it is the court that must be satisfied the conditions in the statute as satisfied.
speaker="melvin_b_lewis" startTime="2600.772" stopTime="2603.190">
    Mr. Melvin B. Lewis 
    Yes, sir. 
    This is true, absolutely. 
    But the court --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2603.190" stopTime="2604.569">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The court doesn't give him immunity.
speaker="melvin_b_lewis" startTime="2604.569" stopTime="2606.266">

    If I understand, Your Honor, properly --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2611.558" stopTime="2621.121">

speaker="melvin_b_lewis" startTime="2621.121" stopTime="2624.923">
    Mr. Melvin B. Lewis

    And the -- the immunity is --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2624.923" stopTime="2631.954">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It doesn't say that he must have a red -- a red band rather than a blue band or covering the paper or a seal --
speaker="melvin_b_lewis" startTime="2631.954" stopTime="2632.182">
    Mr. Melvin B. Lewis 
    No, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2632.182" stopTime="2639.049">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- it is -- it requires the adjudication of a constitutional court to bring this about.
speaker="melvin_b_lewis" startTime="2639.049" stopTime="2693.354">
    Mr. Melvin B. Lewis 
    Certainly, Your Honor. 
    Absence such an adjudication there could be no immunity, certainly. 
    Now, I would further submit to Your Honors that -- with reference to counsel's argument rather attenuated on the proposition of the effect of the man's subsequent indictment. 
    Counsel points out I think quite properly that you couldn't say at the stage of which -- at which the -- the petitioner here appeared before the grand jury that he was then a defendant, nor you could you say that about anybody for that matter that the grand jury is subsequently indicted. 
    Yet, it did return indictments. 
    The indictments were as settled law, a part of the criminal case and the proceedings before the grand jury were as it evolved a part of the criminal case against Piemonte. 
    Counsel suggests to Your Honor that the Government just itself voluntarily dismissed the case. 
    This was done after some six weeks of trial or something on that order and long after the defendant had been subjected to very, very serious jeopardy indeed.

    Mr. Melvin B. Lewis 
    Well, Your Honor, I would -- I would think of -- of my experience that it -- well, it's -- it's not customary.

speaker="melvin_b_lewis" startTime="2715.263" stopTime="2768.985">
    Mr. Melvin B. Lewis 
    In any case, Your Honor, you cannot punish a man in my view, for refusing to testify before the grand jury which ultimately indicts him. 
    Because of the fact in his refusal to testify in those circumstances, if it please the Court, is not to be justified by whether his testimony might incriminate him. 
    Rather, it is an absolute privilege not to testify, he need not to show that the testimony might incriminate him. 
    He need only to show ultimately that this was a part of a criminal case against himself and this Mr. Piemonte has done. 
    The fact of the situation is, if it please the Court, that without -- the statute takes away his right to refuse to testify on the grounds that his testimony might incriminate him somewhere else, but it does not in any way affect his right, nor does the order affect it -- his right to refuse to testify in a criminal case against himself.
