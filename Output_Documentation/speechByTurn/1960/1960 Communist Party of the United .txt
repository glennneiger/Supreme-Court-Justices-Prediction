Communist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- versus Subversive Activities Control Board. 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="7.344" stopTime="242.433">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Returning to my argument, I tried to give some further consideration to this problem of separability and see if I couldn't draw upon the decisions of the Court to find a case that might elucidate, illuminate the questions better than I have been doing. 
    And I thought that it would be helpful to the Court if I would call its particular attention to the case of Electric Bond Company versus the Commissioner, in 303 U.S. 419. 
    You probably immediately recall that that's the Public Utility Holding Company Act and it provided for a number of things in the Act and one of them was of course registration and another was that they file a registration statement and then there were a long list of other provisions that were also included in the Act. 
    And a very bitter controversy occurred before this Court, which the petitioners in that case, claim that the Act was inseparable and that you had to construe all of the various provisions together. 
    I make my position clear in this case on behalf of the Government, in telling the Court yesterday that the Communist Party alone could register. 
    I did not mean to indicate that I was giving up, on behalf of the Government, any of the other provisions. 
    I was trying to make it clear that I thought the Court had the duty, under the law and under its decisions, to take each part of the statute step by step and examine each part since there was a separability provision and determine the validity of each provision as it became ripe because of its properly coming before this Court under its decisions for determination as to each of the various portions. 
    And I did not mean to indicate, if anyone misunderstood me, that the Communist Party should not be required to register on a statement as the next step after registering as a Party. 
    And that then various other provisions of the Act would still be applicable unless this Court determined that they were unconstitutional or invalid in a proper case. 
    In such event, and each one that the Court would strike down, would disappear from the Act but the rest of it would be enforceable. 
    I also tried to indicate that I thought that this Court only has before it, limited issues at this time because the other issues were premature and not ripe. 
    Now, in the Electric Bond and Share case, we have a case that is exactly parallel on this element of separability. 
    I'm not saying for a moment that it involved a First Amendment problem. 
    In this case, it does not but it does involve the -- the problem of whether or not, an Act has numer -- numerous provisions and whether those provisions should be treated separately when the Congress says so in how this Court should Act in such a matter and treatment.

    Did it involve the Fifth Amendment problem (Inaudible)
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="245.951" stopTime="275.623">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, Mr. Justice Black, I think it could've been in this regard. 
    It -- the registration statement, of course, required all the kinds of information as I'm sure you are familiar with and a part of that, for example on the Insul Holdings, there are all kinds of fraudulent transactions alleged with regard to (Inaudible) about stock transactions.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    No, I mean that -- that that was a factual situation that came -- that was revealed to the public in connection with the Insul and if --

speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="295.583" stopTime="328.814">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes, but it also would probably give a lead to who the officers in the Insul Empire were in regard to all of these various transactions that were alleged to be fraudulent about the issue of the Insul stock, if you recall, at that time so that I think there was the problem of whether a registration statement would reveal, although it was not developed in the case as -- as decided by the Court.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    It was not suggested in this as far as the opinion of the Court rules, but it did deal with the question of separability and the duty of the Court to -- where there was such a provision like there is in this case to separate out a portion of the statute that was divisible and you said there was a presumption in that regard and it should be followed. 
    And therefore, the statute was found to be enforceable and valid.

    Is that â€“ the case dealt with it, the case turned on?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="376.009" stopTime="406.848">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, that's what I mean Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    That was the heart of Chief Justice Hughes' opinion in regard to it and the contention was bitterly made that you couldn't consider a registration and the registration of statement as a separate matter, but you had to -- had to consider them altogether and the Court said, "That was not correct and that you should take those separately.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="406.848" stopTime="517.177">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I understood they were raising and may be I am wrong about it, the place is in fact different, possibly a district case. 
    The argument here that I can gather to each of the problems is, what is decided in the Act in Communist Party in fact, amounts -- well, not expressly declare it to a direct money unequivocal practical outlawry of the political party, which at least, in some of the evidences is (Inaudible) small political party. 
    The plaintiffs argue -- argued outlawry and that cannot be done. 
    Only way I see it is to determine that it does not invade the Party and its outlaws and the criminal fee of the Party (Inaudible). 
    The only way perhaps, that it grieves death certificates to see whether taken as a whole, it does amount with the three outlawing of (Inaudible) when illegal Act relates to Justice Stewart's opinion to -- I recall the Mr. Justice Brandeis -- if he made a crime but you couldn't go all the way to the bridge between them of speak and express influence, simply because some of the activities were illegal. 
    I assume that that is done. And assuming that you can only find that out by looking at the whole Act and all of its statutes, how could the Court and members of the Senate merely to registration as the other Parties.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="517.177" stopTime="566.505">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, Mr. Justice Black, in the Electric Bond case, it was claimed that that was a Death Sentence Act and all of these provisions were so extreme, including prohibition of use of mails for legitimate purposes that it would kill the Utility Holding Company. 
    So the same parallel contention was being made and the Court said the examination should not be made on that basis. 
    The question was to carry out the will of the Congress and deal with it on a separable basis and take each part and see whether that could be enforced in dealing with the problem.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="566.505" stopTime="591.377">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you have any other cases, as I understood, of that case under the light -- that case which did not refer to freedom of speech, prayer and proximity as far as I recall it and (Inaudible). 
    The mere registration is met to providing or to make any changes as for the -- the other members to bring about a conviction.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="591.377" stopTime="608.006">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, there were all kinds of Fifth Amendment claims in that case, but they were question of whether you take the property without due process but they were there and they were apparent that they were doing real damage.

    You could go after the direct act to consider. 
    Does this -- do these laws (Inaudible) make it legal or illegal (Inaudible) is not a punishment of what the Congress wanted to do, tried to do, to outlaw the parties which burdens on it that make it impossible to act in the Party to any of the things that the Party is doing.

    Wouldn't it be better to meet the case in on to put on something down. 
    Congress has intended to the Communist Party, it imposed sanctions that amount to outlaw (Inaudible). 
    It is not singled out action which it has -- it has imposed, although it hasn't said so but in doing that it can place the burden as to the burden which would seem to bond from doing all of the -- to the business of the Party, would have to be the function. 
    Tactics, no -- no tactics as that there is no (Inaudible).

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And I -- I understand that, I agree with that (Inaudible) 
    My question is based on that assumption. 
    Did it believe and said that was -- that they engaged in business of advocating some kind of reason at all, whatever it was to the old law of this Government by the Court upholds toward the staff and that's the reason that Congress had -- as I read the Act and sought to make it impossible to (Inaudible). 
    Perhaps, someone may have thought, as was suggested by distinguished citizens that it would find the outlaws, would violate the Constitution. 
    Whether it could be done, simply, by imposing the sanctions of the burden and they did impossibly and that is -- is the form of sanctions. 
    I'm not criticizing it as to that but isn't that what we have to meet here in this case and taken as a whole that this Act, insofar the various threats hanging over to all these sanctions, but the operation of it is advised.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="965.484" stopTime="974.887">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin

    They have a right to come in and sign their names, say they're officers, say who the members are, what their finances are, and that's their legal right under the law and this Court has so held.

    I think that's the way you would have to decide what you're asking me now. 
    And that you know they said that it was separable but you couldn't find if they were separable as a matter of constitutional law. 
    In that case, you would have to go further. 
    What I'm trying to say is that in this case, exactly the same distinction was made and the Court rejected, and said it had to do if it could, what Congress said and take it piece by piece.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, I think you can as to certain phases of it. 
    For instance, I think you might well think -- consider that First Amendment was in the provisions in regard to registration and the Fifth Amendment might be in regard to some. 
    But then you got the problem of the registration statements and whether or not the Government can ask for the information and you have not said, as I read the case, that they can't ask for the information. 
    And you say -- and you have said they can't compel the information. 
    Therefore, until you know whether someone is going to invoke their privilege or give you the (Inaudible) the Government the information, you don't have the case ripe for decisions before the Court and I don't think you reached that particular point, although you reach others.

    Well, as to those who are members and apply for a passport for instance, you have the problem of whether or not there is a law outstanding at that time that then was -- was triable which is the constitutional right to having a passport and how you will interpret that provision and -- and how the application of the regulations to that provision might be made. 
    I think that those questions, according to your holdings in the past and all you've reserved until they come before you with a Party who was asking for that particular relief. 
    Well, then when some organization claims it on their behalf, I don't think that any of your cases would sustain your -- a passing upon that kind of question in this context. 
    Now, time after time, people appeared before this Court asking you to pass on constitutional questions. 
    You say we'll never reach that question because you have to and it seems to me, all of those sanctions would have to be treated under those holdings as you adhered to when they come up, depending upon on the context in which they're presented and not reaching out to get them decided in this case when they're not necessary.

    All I can say is what Congress did say and it was -- it very -- it very clearly said that they could satisfy the requirements of registration by coming forward itself without a trial or hearing or anything else and say, "We do register." 
    That was one particular section of it and they wanted that, and it meant a lot because it would be a recognition that this party --

    The Government is contending for all of that but it does take the position that -- that with the separability clause, you take section by section and see what you can sustain under the law and that it was -- would satisfy one of the purposes of Congress. 
    It's very important to have them just come forward and say, "We register with nothing more." 
    Another purpose was to get information in the registration statement and I think you can properly and should consider that separately -- separately. 
    And that the Government can ask questions and they don't have to answer, which this Court has said. 
    They can say this will incriminate us, we don't answer or would tend to incriminate.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, I -- only make that argument and saying, if you find that they can't do more, you can say that much is valid, but I don't want to be misunderstood to say it that I -- I'm not urging that you find much more than that valid. 
    But I say that Congress said and I can only resort to their words, and I think the history is plain and I think the Court in this case, Electric Bond and Share, said, "We turn to that language and it was contended by counsel that you look at the legislative history and Congress wouldn't have -- have urged any -- passed such a bill with just the registration." 
    That same argument was made and they said, "Look at the legislative history," and the Court said, "Look at the language that Congress said."

    Therefore, it was the Government but I understand that it was far more subject to the matter there.

    That's where you start. 
    You don't start in the other presumption. 
    So it seems to me, with that kind of a presumption, if you have duty to see if you can't make any portion of it standup alone.

    My difficulty is that once a registration statement of the form of -- prescribed by the Attorney General if filed with all the data, a lot of other things come into play. 
    We know, state laws, loyalty boards, Boards of Education, state laws that disqualify people from holding though a certain jobs, would seem to come into play.

    I think there is -- the radiation that you describe is involved in the Act. 
    I think you could say that certain portions are valid without allowing the -- the other to come into play and that's what I mean by taking step by step to see whether it's here and if it is here, whether it's necessary and if it's invalid, you leave what you can to itself.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You see (Inaudible) as to these questions on the assumption that you will permit them that the legislative history of the Public Utility Holding Company has. 
    Do you mean by that, the report doesn't -- submitting (Inaudible) Congress in the long, long debates in those (Inaudible) and I would like to ask you whether you think, and on reading those debates and those reports, you are prepared to say that Congress would've been satisfied that all Congress wanted to that elaborate process with which one is familiar in that particular legislation and that all that Congress wanted is to establish instant right, a letter saying I am the boss of this holding company.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2117.316" stopTime="2143.109">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I can't answer the question with the assumption because I'm only familiar with the newspaper accounts at the time and I haven't examined that history. 
    But from the newspaper accounts, it was clear that Congress wanted more and that was the argument that was made in this particular case and the Court rejected it saying, "We'll turn to the language of the separability clause that governs our duty and we'll follow."
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2143.109" stopTime="2179.886">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, the next question I want to ask you, whether you think that with reference to the death sentence statute to the very main important which was involved in the death sentence statutes, whether you think there were no radiation with reference to that Act flowing from the fact of registration, whether the -- the opportunity to the -- in the national market, whether the relationship between either corporate bodies of the great Insul Empire, etcetera, etcetera. Whether no radiations in that situation?

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, there's no question that there were on the burden of the argument of the petitioners in that case, was that the radiation for such that -- that registration in itself was part of -- only a part of what the Congress wanted and these other steps were up -- attached to it and bound to do them such injury. 
    And of course, the recitals in the legislation, the purpose of it were the terrible evils that the Public Utility Holding Companies were to indicate what the Congress was trying to do. 
    I think that was clear that there were plenty that would flow from the mere registration and the filing of the registrations.

    Now, you might not agree that that is the -- what we have before the Court here, but that is the concept and I think it's a valid one. 
    And I think that when they take peace for instance or when they say, "In Soviet Russia today we have a free press." 
    They're not talking the same language that we are and when they say that kind of thing or when they say they're -- they have peace, they're for peace, they use that as a means to accomplish their -- their objective and their purpose to support this foreign power and you can't use lawful means for that illegal purpose. 
    Now, that's the difference whether you agree with it or not, but I'm trying to point out and I don't think that you can use advocacy either for an unlawful purpose if you tie them together, trying to carry out that unlawful purpose.

    Mr. John J. Abt 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the Court. 
    Yesterday, an answer to a question from Mr. Justice Harlan, I stated that the question of the privilege would drop out of the case if the Act could be construed as permitting the filing of an unsigned registration statement. 
    I was wrong. 
    The question would still remain on the case because Section 7 (d) requires a statement to list the names of all officers and members of the organization, and Section 15 (b) punishes omissions from the statement. 
    Thus, if an officer or a member of petitioner prepared a statement, he would be obliged to incriminate himself by listing his name as such even if he didn't sign the statement. 
    Again, that the state -- statement was submitted by a lawyer, as Mr. Rankin suggested, the lawyer would have to get the names of the officers and members from one of them and the latter would have to incriminate himself by furnishing his name to the lawyer for inclusion in the statement. 
    Hence, there is no escape in this case from a question of the privileges.

    Mr. John J. Abt 
    I have only one moment, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and I'd like to come to the second point. 
    Mr. Rankin urges that the Court should not pass upon the sanctions now but should await criminal prosecution for their violation. 
    But once the order is affirmed, the sanctions have immediate and devastating consequences from the organization by writing that the way its members through making them ineligible for jobs, passports, making them subject denaturalization of what not, and drives away its contributors and supporters and that it even drives away its potential audience. 
    Thus, if the sanctioned -- as that aren't passed upon now, the patient will die before the doctor arrives. 
    The organization will be destroyed before the validity of the sanctions would have passed upon and in this aspect this case is entirely different from Bond and Share. 
    The heart of the Public Utility Holding Company Act was the so-called death sentence of Section 11. 
    Of that which required, under certain circumstances, public utility companies, when ordered to do so by the SEC to dispose off their operating companies. 
    But that this sentence never came into operation without an administrative hearing before the Section, with all kinds of opportunity for judicial review. 
    And when Mr. Justice Frankfurter used the Court in your time have finally got around to testing on the validity of a sentence. 
    You were reviewing an administrative determination made after an administrative hearing and the judicial review in the Court of Appeals.

speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="3367.083" stopTime="3444.834">
    Mr. John J. Abt 
    Yes, but they're quite different, Your Honor. 
    Here, the sanctions of the Act automatically go to effect as a result of the registration order. 
    In Electric Bond and Share, the registration order was a first step and the Court -- Mr. Justice Hughes discussed the so-called incidence of registration. 
    What he didn't discuss and what he said were reserved for later, was a death sentence which didn't go into effect as a result of registration, didn't go into effect until there was a full hearing before the Section -- an order by the SEC and judicial review. 
    That's the difference.
