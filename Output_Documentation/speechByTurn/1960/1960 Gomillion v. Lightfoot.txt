Gomillion v. Lightfoot

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    C. G. Gomillion et al., Petitioners, versus Phil M. Lightfoot, as Mayor of the City of Tuskegee. 
    Mr. Carter, you may continue your argument.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="22.522" stopTime="126.788">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    If I may recapitulate briefly from where we were when the argument broke off yesterday. 
    It's our contention that Act 140, the statute herein question by redefining the boundaries of Tuskegee in the bizarre fashion indicated from the back from -- in the chart on the back that has -- has accomplished a purposeful and intentional discrimination against Negroes as a class. 
    The Act has cast outside of the city, all of the qualified Negro voters with -- with the exception of four or five and has reduced Tuskegee from a city of approximately 7000 persons of whom about five -- in excess of 5000 more Negroes and 1300 white to a population of approximately 1310 white persons and at best, a few hundred Negroes. 
    The Negroes, who are left in the city, are left in the city only because of the fact that they could not have been cast out of the city without affecting white persons. 
    Now, it's our contention that this is a purposeful and intentional discrimination and that this case is governed by the discrimination cases and that the rule of law applicable to -- to them controls here that the allegations which we have made -- make out of case which is justiciable and actionable in the court and that we are entitled to a hearing in the court below. 
    Now, we --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You didn't get -- you didn't have, Mr. Gray, you didn't have the exact number of Negroes that were left in the redistricting.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    No, no --

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    We don't know, if the Court please. 
    We know that they -- and we alleged in our complaint that only four or five qualified electors or qualified voters were left. 
    But we do not, as Mr. Gray indicated yesterday, have the exact census figures to be able to tell the Court with exactitude how many Negroes were left in the city.

    Are they clustered in some particular place on that map?

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    They are not clustered on the map. 
    They are -- they live in -- in some parts of this various area here. 
    Now, our contention is --

    Proof of the purpose. 
    But I also have, if the Court please, the -- the natural consequences that we think we can show the fact that this cannot be disputed but the facts of the matter are that all of these Negro neighborhoods had been cast out of the city. 
    This is --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose -- suppose, they would split up, would decide to split up a county whether that way. 
    Would you say it is dividing up the county in two parts, if it could be shown they did it because they wanted to get the colored people in one county and the white people on another that that would violate the Constitution?

speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="254.366" stopTime="265.821">

    I think that that would violate the Constitution because I think that the boundary line would be -- would be drawn on the basis of race and I think that this is violative of the constitutional -- of prosecution.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="265.821" stopTime="269.955">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The only you should get to that, of course, would be to show that was the purpose.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="269.955" stopTime="276.302">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, the only way I would get to that would be to show that that was the purpose but I can also get to it to show that that was the effect.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="276.302" stopTime="298.126">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, suppose that is the effect to the State, divides up two counties. 
    One county and then two or three, and that the effect of it is to live predominant, live one of the counties predominant to white, the other predominant to colors.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="298.126" stopTime="329.549">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    I think that if -- if I can show that in terms of the facts that I would be able to show discrimination because I believe that -- that if the -- if the effect, if the question of proof is the effect, this is an incidental effect, this is something else. 
    But in this, where this question we have before the Court, with the way these lines are growing as they live in and out of the -- in and out of the city then the natural effect, this cannot be an incident of where there's occurring, this is -- this has to be the natural consequences of the Act.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="329.549" stopTime="359.334">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What your -- what argument gets down to is this, isn't it? 
    That whether it is shown by the facts of the way that counties divided a city is to the -- that it leaves one part of it predominant to white which had been predominant to color. 
    That is enough to deprive the State, invalid to create -- to the take that part of land out of the municipality.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="359.334" stopTime="364.249">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, that is enough, I think, for us to go to court that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="364.249" stopTime="366.899">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That the State doesn't have a right to adopt that policy.

    That's right.

    If -- if the only way we can reach -- if the only -- if the Court concludes that the only way they can reach our problem is to overrule Colegrove versus Green, we would have to take that position.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    That's right, sir. 
    We're not asking to -- to overrule Colegrove versus Green. 
    Our contention is that this is not a reapportionment case and that the Colegrove doctrine has nothing to do with the problems which are raised here. 
    We take the position that this is purely a race discrimination case and that it is not involved in the Colegrove versus Green problem at all.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Carter, suppose I go on with Justice Black's hypothetical case, an existing county happens to natural coagulation, to a natural aggregation to have predominantly in one half of it white, said reduced and then in the other half, colored city and the State then splits it into half but each half continues to have voting right. 
    Nothing is done to -- to takeaway the -- either directly or to any manipulating of the electoral machinery, to potentiality or the opportunity for the exercise of the franchise. 
    What will you do with that case?

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, as I said to Mr. Justice Black, I don't believe that the State can adopt to policy of -- which would have -- would amount to divide the county or any territorial unit in order to generalize it in terms of white and Negro. 
    I think that this is forbidden by the county --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Forbidden by what, the Equal Protection Clause?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I suppose you have a county that divides in the same way not according to racial line but according to economic preoccupations or interests. 
    Half of it happens to be industrial and the other half is agricultural and the same division has been made. 
    What do you do with that?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="540.636" stopTime="586.771">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, that -- that is -- is a more difficult question but the problem I have -- I would think that that -- that that case in that particular kind of case that I would be -- that you would be able to show that this was a denial of Equal Protection. 
    But at the same time, it seems to me, if the Court please, there would -- there might be differences in terms of this, in terms of whether this is an equal protection argument. 
    I don't believe that we have that problem when -- when race is involved because of the Fourteenth Amendment and because of its clear provisions in respect to what this Court has had. 
    So that where race is involved, our contention is in this, the race discrimination case, we have a clear protection under the Fourteenth Amendment which would forbid the State from doing exactly what -- what you suggest is my opinion.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your position I think it's better to place it squarely on the fact as they actually are, from (Inaudible)

    If you wish to call it policy or policies, has the policy wants to change a municipality, make it smaller, cut off the lives part of it, that it does not take away the life of the people that have taken out of that municipality to vote. 
    They are left with the -- such right to vote as those in the county outside of the municipality here. 
    I presumed what you have to mean is in this. 
    Although the State has arrived to change the area, about the city, that have to look at its purpose that you are arguing, to see and to define that the perpetua to put colored people out of that area so that they could not vote in that area although they could vote outside of that area, that that violates the equal protection in our view, whichever authorities it does.

    We request that the declaratory judgment which were in that matter which would hold that this -- that this statute violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clause with the Fourteenth Amendment and the proscriptions of the Fifteenth Amendment as well. 
    We also request an injunction to enjoin the enforcement of the statute and an injunction to restrain state officials from keeping the -- the petitioners and other Negroes from voting in the municipal elections in Tuskegee. 
    As far as we are concerned, we think that is the same kind of relief which this Court has normally granted in cases of this kind and that therefore it offers no peculiar difficult problems of equitable relief. 
    For this reason, if the Court please, we think that we have presented a case which comes within the race discrimination cases and that we have presented a case which requires under the rules and the doctrine of about -- of constitutional doctrine which has been announced by this Court that the State cannot discriminate against persons because of their because of their race and color.

   Argument of Philip Elman
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="1382.922" stopTime="1566.626">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Because of the fundamental constitutional rights which are here asserted in the national significance of the issues, United States is appearing in this case as amicus curiae and supported the petitioners. 
    Before proceeding with the argument, I should like if I may by way of response to question from the bench yesterday to state that according to an official report of the United States Bureau of the census in January 1953. 
    The area of the City of Tuskegee as it existed in 1950 and prior to the alteration of the boundaries made by the 1957 law. 
    The area of the city then was 6.3 square miles. 
    In other words, roughly about 2.5 miles square, each of the lines on the trip reading about 2.5 miles. 
    Now, it's perfectly obvious looking at the face of the map considering just this 2.5 mile. 
    That from any point of the new city to any boundary of the old city is less than 1.5 miles which as was stated yesterday has some significance under Alabama law, Title 37 Section 9 of the Alabama Code of 1958 provides that the police jurisdiction of every municipality having a population of less than 6000 which is now the case as to new Tuskegee. 
    The police jurisdiction extends beyond its corporate limits for 1 and 1.5 miles, is another provision of -- of Title 37 Section 491 which puts upon the -- which gives the municipality the power of maintaining health and cleanliness within its police jurisdiction. 
    So that the inhabitants of this area outside new Tuskegee, inside old Tuskegee now receive to an extent not shown by this record but -- which has been illuminated by counsel. 
    By now receiving municipal services of a sort from the city, the point is of course that while they receive these services to some degree and extent not shown. 
    They are no longer in the position that they were before Act 140 of being able to assert through the exercise the franchise and through the exercise of less formal ways --

    There is a provision that where there is new -- new streets are laid, they can -- there's power to asses within the police jurisdiction.

    Did you elect there were --

    Mr. Philip Elman 
    -- counsel for the -- for the respondents, are in far better position to respond than I am. 
    But I -- I should like if I may to go to the heart of the case as -- as we think the questions of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Frankfurter have exposed it. 
    The complaint in this case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed, Your Honors I do not have before you proof, you do not -- you're not called upon to decide what the relief should be if that proof should be accepted in the judgment of violation of constitutional rights may. 
    The only question, which has been considered -- below, only question, which is here is the question stated by Judge Brown. 
    Whether the federal courts are open to hear and determine the serious charges that are made by this complaint, the charge that this Act of the State Legislature, although cast in neutral surveyors terms and terms of metes and bounds that the line which this statute draws is a line based upon race or color and that it deprives these petitioners of basic constitutional rights secured in them by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. 
    Now, the court -- both courts below answered that question in the negative, said that it is not the business of the federal courts to entertain and resolve the controversy, the dispute, which is created by these allegations, which are purposes of this review, I can take this is true. 
    And that disposition of the case was not based upon cynicism or indifference. 
    The courts below in saying to the petitioners that your remedy is not in the courts of the United States, your remedy is -- is to be found in the Alabama State Legislature, which you say is the body which has denied you -- your constitutional rights. 
    As the opinions below demonstrate, this case has received in most careful and thoughtful consideration. 
    And the decision below is based essentially upon three grounds, one, as to the nature of the statute here. 
    This was a statute which defined municipal boundaries and at such a statute, under the decisions of this Court in three cases, such statute may be enacted by a state legislature wholly unrestrained by the provisions of the Constitution of United States. 
    A legislature in drawing municipal boundaries and extract it -- and expanding them or contracting them as the case may be acts entirely as it pleases. 
    The second ground is that this -- this law on its face has not a word on -- on race and color. 
    It's neutral. 
    And the absence of an expressed discrimination on race and color makes it wholly improper for the courts to inquire into the motives of the individual legislators. 
    That was the second ground. 
    The third ground as -- was as to the inability of the federal courts to grant relief or the impropriety of granting relief, assuming effective relief could be given. 
    Now, I hope to deal with each of these grounds, but I think the hypothetical case of Mr. Justice Black has put may illustrate the Government's position on this. 
    I think -- we think that the Constitution of the United States serves as a complete obstacle to the establishment by law in America of any racial or religious ghettos. 
    If they state the union were to embark openly or validly without any pretense on the policy of geographical separation of the racist into separate communities, a policy which is sometimes described as the policy of apartheid. 
    If a State were to embark that, on that policy, who were to declare that -- as a matter of policy to avoid hostility between the races, to reduce racial tensions, the State considers it desirable, that people of different races live in separate communities. 
    That within each community, they will have full rights, full voting rights, full rights to municipal services, but they shall have a mayor of their own race, they shall have a city counsel of their own race, they shall have judges of their own race, jurors of their own race. 
    If in short, the State of Alabama, instead of drawing a line here, which it has had created two communities, White Tuskegee, Black Tuskegee. 
    We do not think this Court would consider a sufficient defense in such legislation, that the people who left in Black Tuskegee had full voting rights or had just as good police or better police, or fire protection, or health protection, or if their garbage was being picked up with as much frequency as the people in White Tuskegee. 
    It seems to us that in October of 1960, that kind of defense of -- of a -- at a -- of a law establishing a ghetto in the United States need -- need not -- cannot be asserted in this Court. 
    Now, the first ground of the decision below --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2144.848" stopTime="2160.826">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I assume that you're arguing based on the premises, they have to accept on the allegations of the bill that this was done by the purpose of excluding these people to see that none of them stayed in the City of Tuskegee.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="2160.826" stopTime="2287.728">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    No, sir. 
    I -- I -- in this respect, the United States does not agree with petitioners. 
    The petitioners have assumed a burden, which we do not -- do not think the decisions of this Court construing the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to racial discriminations requires them (Inaudible). 
    The petitioners need only show that this legislation, although cast in terms which do not reflect race and color is in substance and effect a racial discrimination. 
    They need not show that the purpose of the Legislature was good or bad, that the motives were -- were worthy or unworthy. 
    This Court in cases going back to Fletcher against Peck has rejected that line of inquiry. 
    As you said in -- in the -- Chief Justice said, for example, Norris against Alabama, Chief Justice Vinson in the Oyama case. 
    The inquiry is not whether a -- a constitutional rights have been denied in expressed terms. 
    The question is whether they have been denied in substance and effect. 
    And in the jury cases for example, Your -- Your Honors have frequently heard arguments that the -- that the commissioner who puts his hand in the box, which has yellow slips for Negroes and white slips for -- for white people, he -- he has testified without contradiction that the farthest thing from his mind was race. 
    His purposes, his -- his motives were -- were wholly admirable. 
    He was not thinking of race at all, and this Court has said that it would have to be a -- the blindness of indifference rather than the blindness of impartiality, which would attribute to a systematic result, such as the exclusion of Negroes from juries over a large period of time, whether the exclusion was total or not. 
    It would have to be compressive --

    As I understand you -- as I understand your argument, if I -- if I get the distinction, it is when you have a situation like this where a law has been passed, which cuts out the colored people from the area and puts them -- creates a -- decreases the size of the city. 
    It leaves them on the outside of that city. 
    And so if you look at it and see the -- the effect of it is, is that they deprived the living of having the area on which they live inside the city so that they can get the advantage, that -- that violates the Constitution.

    We are saying that any law which if you look to the reality rather than the appearance, if you look to what it is and what it does rather to what it says. 
    If that law in actuality draws a racial line, that is sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to establish its invalidity regardless of what may have been in the minds of the particular officials of the Government who were concerned with the drawing of that line. 
    That is our position. 
    We think it's the position that this Court has -- excuse me Mr. Justice Whittaker.

    Is there a provision against the Negro only filing night, day, any property inside the line?

    Mr. Philip Elman 
    The question is -- isn't whether there are prohibitions as to a -- or burdens on the Negroes. 
    The question is whether this statute draws a racial line. 
    If it draws a racial line, we would think it -- it is immaterial, whether they a -- the result of the -- of the drawing of that racial line may result in -- in burdens or not.

    Yes.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="2416.407" stopTime="2491.272">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Class legislation on the basis of race or color, we think, has been barred by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as it's been construed by this Court from cases starting with the Slaughter-House cases and started in West Virginia going through the line of cases exemplified by Brown against Board of Education. 
    If people live in a ghetto, it doesn't make any difference if the houses in the ghetto were finer than the houses on the outside. 
    The point is you cannot in this country enact legislation, which is -- which contains a racial class -- classification. 
    Now, in others -- other areas, classifications between farmers and working men for example or other, in tax legislation hearing -- that this Court is always faced with the -- the problem of -- of scrutinizing classifications and the classic formulation of the scope of your inquiry is -- is there are rational basis for such classification. 
    But when it comes to race and color, you don't -- you are spared to that problem because the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment have declared that race or color is an impermissible basis of classification.

    Mr. Philip Elman 
    No, sir. 
    The answer is no, but we think it is immaterial because if the statute in express terms declared that the City of Tuskegee shall be redistricted or redraw -- its boundary shall be redrawn in such a way that as many Negroes is possible shall be removed from it. 
    If that duty were entrusted to an administrative officer or a city surveyor, that -- that would -- I am very confident to present, no problems to this Court or of any court of the United States.

    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Exactly. 
    Supposed -- supposed for example, I -- I may be restrained from the issue here, but supposed for example, a -- a municipality were bent upon avoiding the consequences of -- of Brown against Board of Education and it redrew a school -- this school attendance districts in terms of the existing residential pattern. 
    Now, surely, the fact that a child -- a -- parents of a Negro child wanted to attend some other school would have the right to sell their -- their house and try to find their house in a -- in another neighborhood. 
    Even if that right were expressly recognized by the -- by the statute, it's hard to see that that would constitute the kind of constitutional justification for violation of rights, which this Court has said light of very base of Government.

    Mr. Philip Elman 
    If it is -- if it is, the question is whether a declaratory judgment will suffice should the Court go further and enter an injunction against the enforcement of the law, which is declared not invalid, should allow a reasonable period for the State Legislature to attempt to enact other lot. 
    All those questions are going to be presented when the District Court, if he reaches it, has to decide what kind of relief should be granted, but they're not here. 
    The question here is, whether this complaint should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and for lack of judicial power to consider it. 
    That's the question. 
    And unless you are -- unless the Court is prepared to say that there is nothing at all that any court can give by way of relief, then I think, the question of relief would be come relevant here. 
    And I don't think that it can they assume as it was in one of the opinions -- the opinion of Judge Wisdom below that, "No Court can grant effective relief here because the day after it's a decision in validating this law, the Legislature of Alabama may enact a new law with slightly different variation and there will be new litigation and -- and there might be an endless series of -- of lawsuits. 
    Well, certainly, the -- the premise that a legislature of a State, the United States is -- is not going to respect the determination of the court. 
    The language is charged with the duty of determining what the Constitution means and then it's -- it is -- and you -- you assume that it's -- it's going to -- its purpose will be to flout in every conceivable way that determination.

    Now, that right could've been taken away from them by a valid law redefining the boundaries. 
    They had no vested right to live in Tuskegee, obviously. 
    But they did have a right under the Fifteenth Amendment not to have their voting rights taken away because of their color.

    The trouble I have to that, I'm not talking about an ultimate conclusion of what happened.

    But you just look to see its effect and of course, at each instance, without voting rights of people have changed, when they're against a new territory, are cutout since they are drove in this problem. 
    This case illustrates the new failures of the fight that's been going on. 
    Most of us are familiar with the tribes from those who lived on there, outside in a both hand, what (Inaudible) done that vested right not to be in the municipality.

    It actually it is. 
    And now, I will not dock the question on that ground. 
    So far as what kind of proof is concerned, it -- why should the petitioners in this kind of a case had a greater burden than was put upon the plaintiff in -- in the -- in the case for example, in the United States last year in the case of United States against Thomas where -- the voting case, where Judge Wright found that there challenges to 1377 Negro voters and only to 10 white voters and he said, "As a matter of statistics, just looking at the numbers, somehow or other, the Negroes were challenged and the whites weren't." 
    And from that I infer that this was a racial action. 
    Now, we think that in this case that -- that the maps, the population in themselves, are -- should establish a prima facie case. 
    It's -- it's enough to shift the burden of going forward to the State. 
    If the State -- if there's -- if there is a rational justification for this other than race or color, surely, the State can -- can come forward with it and should be compelled to come forward. 
    And -- and in cases for example, like the Bates case, it was before you last year, you -- Your Honors have said, on the face of it, we see no discernible justification for this -- if this there is that the-- the navels is sustained. 
    If it can be met, if there is such a discernible justification that we don't know about, let's hear from the State.

    What you get to is this, that you -- it's claimed here that if a State exercises its general power to change the boundaries of municipality in way this has, in such ways it bar a great many people in remaining in the city, in that area who have lived there before and they are -- are actually all -- are all (Inaudible) in color.

    He referred to psychoanalysis of the members of the Legislature, prying into the subconscious motive. 
    Now, we -- we think that that poses this -- this puts up a strong end. 
    No one suggests when -- when a court is seeking in to ascertain the meaning of legislation or the, "intent" of the Legislature, that you take affidavits from the -- you subpoena the members of the Legislature and ask them, "Oh, just what did you have in mind when you voted for this or when you voted against it?"

    Mr. James J. Carter 
    If I may before getting into the main part of my argument, answer a few questions that were asked yesterday that was not cleared up. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked when Tuskegee Institute was organized. 
    It was in 1881. 
    You also asked I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter, about the previous boundaries of Tuskegee. 
    Tuskegee was first organized in 1866 with the boundary of 2.5 miles on each side, the boundaries being equidistant from the then courthouse. 
    In 1868, by an act of the Legislature, those boundaries were pulled in to an area of 1 mile square. 
    History gives some very interesting side lights of why that was done. 
    Later on, they were expanded again. 
    There have been several acts and I believe the last act that really touched the boundaries in any significance was an Act of 1898, which again placed the manner in this position 2.5 miles square. 
    The question was asked as to following police jurisdiction. 
    That's a general statute of Alabama applicable to all towns and cities, in towns having a population of 6000 people according to the last federal census, the police limits are 3 miles beyond the corporate limits and in towns of less than 6000 is 1.5. 
    Tuskegee at the present time has police jurisdiction of 3 miles beyond the new city limits by reason of the fact as we haven't had the official 1960 census, we yet announced nor have we had a legislature meet as it will next year after the announcing of that. 
    It's a -- the population of Tuskegee is less than 6000 without the next legislature then of course, we'll refer it back to the 1.5 mile limit.

    Is it a police power to arrest or is it a -- is it a day-to-day police protection from the State?

    Mr. James J. Carter 
    They have a power to arrest, to answer calls and to actually patrol the area in most cities do. 
    As a matter of fact, they furnish police and fire protection to the entire area. 
    As a matter of fact, in this entire area here, they have water and electricity which is -- they have municipal electric plant which furnishes this entire -- none of this has been withdrawn.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3596.511" stopTime="3600.144">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, do they pay -- of course, as I assume they pay for the water.
speaker="james_j_carter" startTime="3600.144" stopTime="3627.643">
    Mr. James J. Carter 
    They pay for water and electricity, but these people that have been on the outside of this city paid no city taxes. 
    In other words, since 1957, no -- no city taxes, the only taxes levy within the police jurisdiction off of businesses. 
    Now, business organizations pay one-half the license that people within they (Inaudible) would pay and that is based on if they -- they do get the police and fire protection and these health services.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3627.643" stopTime="3629.629">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    By health services, you mean what, garbage collection?
speaker="james_j_carter" startTime="3629.629" stopTime="3674.798">
    Mr. James J. Carter 
    Well, no, they don't have garbage collection as such but I mean they have the advantage of coming into the city health department, of any of that, it goes to have the water in the sewage lines, which of course are available there and are huge. 
    Now, we also point out here as to the population of this area, the way it was drawn, the little argument they pulled in, you will see here, for example, a rather heavily populated neighborhood. 
    That's -- that's a Negro neighborhood there, which begins out here and it goes way off. 
    Now, we are in a position here drawing lines that we must if those people wanted to do, so you must come in the city. 
    You're discriminating against this because we're colored. 
    That's another point. 
    Now, I believe Mr. --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Voice Overlap) I didn't -- I didn't take in what you've just said.
speaker="james_j_carter" startTime="3677.805" stopTime="3696.719">
    Mr. James J. Carter 
    I'm saying here that that gets back to the point. 
    I believe that one of the Justice, Mr. Justice Whittaker, someone asked that if you had people on the outside the city in the area, if you would be discriminating against them if you didn't take them in. 
    And so that would illustrate that particular point if these people in, say green, would open here, wanted to come in the city.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3696.719" stopTime="3698.041">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's never been a part of the city.
speaker="james_j_carter" startTime="3698.041" stopTime="3985.638">
    Mr. James J. Carter 
    Never been, no, sir. 
    Now, I believe yesterday there was some method asked about the procedure for changing boundaries. 
    The Constitution of Alabama provides and this Act was not as -- the first counsel suggested a private act. 
    It was a local law. 
    Pass after notice and proof regarding to our Constitution, to pass such a law, you have to advertise it for weeks. 
    That's to give the people affected, I tend to come in and protest if they desire to do so. 
    As far as I know, there's no -- this -- this law is advertised, no protest was ever made. 
    Now, that's a perfectly legal and been upheld by our State Supreme Court as being the proper way to change boundaries. 
    In fact, nearly all boundaries in Alabama changed that way, harm the session of legislation of what means. 
    But you won't have 50 to 100 boundary line changes. 
    There's probably been thousands since our Constitution in 1909. 
    Now, there is -- there are other ways of changing boundaries. 
    For example, in the city, the city made by -- initiate its own proceeding. 
    The counsel may propose it and by -- present it to the probate judge and then by popular election, bring in additional territory. 
    You could also contract the city that same way the city here could initiate it. 
    This was state action, however not city action. 
    This was done by the state legislature. 
    Also I thought as to fact that a -- that people, 75 or more people, may form a municipality. 
    In other words the people outside here, they form their own municipality if they care to do so and may initiate the action and carry it right through separate by a popular vote. 
    Now, I believe that probably gets us down except to one thing that Mr. Justice Stewart makes in the essence that the district judge characterized this as a sea dragon. 
    That was the plaintiffs that characterized the sea dragon. 
    He put it in quotes in his opinion. 
    Now, as we look at it, it might be a bit of a descriptive term and it would take ones imagination but that's not too unusual looking outfit when we look somewhere in the cities in the United States. 
    And last night I haven't pick up to run magnetic road add list and of course we've been a good bit out of this record all the way through, so we might just mention someone -- man in town of Pennsylvania. 
    I suppose it looks more like a cloud. 
    These boys, they used to lay on the grass and watch the clouds and figure what it looks like. 
    Concord, New Hampshire, Stanford, Connecticut, Scranton, Pennsylvania, it looks likes a jigsaw puzzle sitting on top of the other, Cincinnati, Ohio by this bed, even Sacramento California (Inaudible). 
    So you just don't know why the city has the boundary lines it has but let's get down now to what I consider. 
    If Your Honor please, to meet and the (Inaudible) in this case. 
    And that is this and finally after being in the lower court and the Court of Appeals, finally for the first time on page 11 in the petitioner's brief is we have to get them to admit there were such cases as Hunter versus Pittsburgh and Laramie County versus Albany County. 
    The Hunter versus Pittsburgh and Laramie County versus Albany County, Mount Pleasant versus Beckwith are the cases upon which we stood in the lower court of the fundamental merits here. 
    And that is the power of a State acting through its legislature as a sovereign right to extend comfort limits, to draw him in, to consolidate cities or to abolish it. 
    That's true of counties and it's true cities. 
    The first case only said, it was the old Laramie County versus Albany County which involves county lines and of course the county is simply a political subdivision of the State. 
    It's a creation of the State created for the convenient administration of Government. 
    Shortly after that, we came to Mount Pleasant versus Beckwith where they, again, pointed out that corporations are composed of all the inhabits of the territory, all the people who lived within the territory. 
    And they see that the organization and the territory maybe modified and I'm now quoting from Court by the mere wheel of the Legislature. 
    Now, that goes back, if the Court pleases, to other quotations we look into this constitutional limitation. 
    We find Professor Coolidge saying that they may as a political manner the drawing of boundary lines for cities and political subdivision peculiar that vested in the State. 
    And it says this, "If the legislative action in these cases operate injuriously to the municipalities or to individuals, the remedy is not with the courts. 
    The courts have no file to interfere and the people must be looked to, to write through the ballot box all these wrongs.

    Alright, there was a city, the city was complaining about having to take on debts of another city. 
    Now, that was a city action. 
    Now Hunter versus -- Kelly versus Pittsburgh, if we take that one, was where the city around the State increase the limits and brought in Mr. Kelly's farmlands. 
    They brought about 80 acres of farmlands and Mr. Kelly, an individual, came in and said, "You are depriving me of my property without due process of law. 
    Now, this is what you do with it. 
    I've got farmlands. 
    You've increased my tax rate.

    Mr. James J. Carter 
    Language if you please. 
    Yes, sir, I think it's a law because I believe it's been repeated and I think it's been followed by this Court that it has -- just because I don't agree with Judge Brown in his dissent and said, "You've only got one case that had been decided in the -- this century." 
    Well, I don't think because the case is old and it makes it bad law, but not in Hunter. 
    We said this and they go back to it and I agree with you. 
    There was a question of bringing -- allocating in to Pittsburgh. 
    We are allocating they had a nice little town and they had all their debts paid and they had all of their facilities in Pittsburgh was trying to do everything in going that going there. 
    But they said this, "We have nothing to do, was the policy, wisdom, justice are bad as to act under consideration." 
    Those questions are that the court -- the consideration of those whom the State has entrusted this legislative power. 
    It goes on to discuss what municipal cooperation that they are simply political subdivision. 
    Then says a State may add its pleasure, modify withdraw those powers, extend the contract to territorial area. 
    And said that all these respects, the State is supreme and its legislative body conforming his action to the state constitution may do it as it will on the restrain by any provision of the Constitution of the United States. 
    Now, we take flat foot in the position in this case, that this is a case within the confidence of the State of Alabama to fix the boundaries of his municipalities.

    May I ask Mr. Carter --

    Mr. James J. Carter 
    Yes, sir
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4300.000" stopTime="4314.309">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible) could this lawful power construe with confidence that being through unconstitutional objectives?
speaker="james_j_carter" startTime="4314.309" stopTime="4618.189">
    Mr. James J. Carter 
    Of course to that extend Mr. Justice Whittaker I won't say that -- that there's no possible situation that it might not be abused. 
    But I do say this. 
    I think it's a matter even then, that the States himself should have an opportunity to correct by going to the state courts to do it. 
    If -- if they did get off base on something like that. 
    For example, in many things, that the Courts have said and I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in Colegrove versus Green that courts just can't do. 
    That -- that -- to some extend, he pointed out for example that we have some constitutional guarantees that -- that can't be enforced for example the guarantee of a Republican form of government, the congressional regulation of the Indian tribes, the legislative executive control of foreign relations, the control of civilian and military appointing power. 
    They only get the civilian and military appointing power, just keep touch it. 
    This Court has decided that recently. 
    The inherit wisdom of any legislative executive policy, if you were to see that laws have faithfully executed. 
    And then we go on beyond the fact that stay on boundary lines, we've got the old cases from this Court of Benson versus United States were there. 
    A man was on trial for his very life. 
    And the issue in that case was, did this occur on Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation, didn't it? 
    And he took the position that it was all land owned by the Government but he had never used it for reservation and to show what answer to it was the executive as determined that these are the boundary lines of Fort Leavenworth Reservation and that is it. 
    And in that case, it went all to all the proposition that there was -- there were things within the legislative an executive field and throughout the cases and all of them and every state of country as (Inaudible) Hunter and Laramie and the others, they have consistently held that the drawing of boundary line in cities is a legislative and not a judicial function. 
    We come back to this proposition in this case to -- to get to the racial angle. 
    Of course, we would have to go back and see what the legislatures -- Legislature meant. 
    Of course we speak of intent and reaching of intent and construction of legislation and -- and that's true. 
    But of course that's an ambiguous legislation where -- where we always go back to commit a reports. 
    Here, there is none. 
    There's nothing in the act. 
    There's nothing to construe in the statute from that end. 
    These are the boundary line period. 
    That's the only boundary line. 
    Now, when we come to motive and motive is really what we're talking about. 
    We can fence around whether it is purpose or intention. 
    The purpose and intention I believe in South versus Peters, there, the contention was made that the purpose are effect of the Act, it was worthy use but this Court still went off there. 
    It didn't go into that. 
    They didn't -- they didn't go to the proof act. 
    But this Court has said repeatedly. 
    And we go back to the Duplix Printing Co. &amp; Press case that even on acts of Congress, you can't take what legislator say and read into that the motive behind it. 
    It just can't be done. 
    And we go back to the verb beginning of this country Fletcher versus Peck. 
    That was a case where it was alleged that the legislators of the State of Georgia had bribed to pass certain legislation to make land grants. 
    And Mr. Chief Justice Marshall refused in that case to even inquire into it, saying that the motives could not be inquired into. 
    The courts consistently followed that line. 
    Mr. Justice Holmes, in Koller versus The People of Michigan said that, knowledge, negatives or manners or motives of legislators will not be inquired into. 
    Terry versus (Inaudible) reaffirmed the principle, Arizona versus California, again by the Supreme Court of the United States where it was alleged that the numbers of Congress had some ulterior motives in trying to pass that act. 
    Somehow, it was trying to do it for personal reasons and to -- to make a lot a money, and they said motives which induce members of Congress. 
    To pass a Boulder Canyon Project Act will not be inquired to. 
    There are things with which the Court may not inquire. 
    And we say there we can talk about motive or purpose or affect, that's what we're talking about. 
    And they want to go here to certain -- they wanted quote for example from what the newspaper said that the author of this act said, when he first advertised it, before it was introduced in the Legislature. 
    They even go so far in the record as to cite an article from the New York Times, Time magazine. 
    Now, may it please the Court if we have to get the part of determining motives of what people mean by what magazines say about us or about our courts or about our legislature. 
    We have put in bad shape because we just can't always determine motives that way. 
    Now, to my third point, to me I think it is an important part, and that's the question of judicial restraint in cases of this kind. 
    We have a number of cases, we --

    No sir, I think the decision to this Court it may deter that when you have the statute says, it has to be stricken down, if you done that in the school segregation case, as a matter of fact in Alabama, we do have a constitutional provision of segregation. 
    But we are not here inline upon that. 
    We realize that there's been a change of climate and that the recent decisions will clarify those points. 
    And what I'm saying here, understanding flatfootedly upon the proposition, that in a case of this kind, whether it's says there's been a boundary change. 
    That the State has a right to do it, there is nothing here as was pointed out before. 
    Negroes live within Tuskegee. 
    Negroes live without Tuskegee. 
    They may change boundaries. 
    Nobody has been removed from Tuskegee except that there's some territory that has been attached from a municipal corporation.

    It doesn't affect the services at all.

    Therefore, exercising the right to do what we -- judicially unreviewable power to do namely three district municipality, we redistrict it because for the wellbeing of the State, I mean they could for colored people to flock together, for white folks to flock together.

    -- the -- the courts always find a way to -- to look into matters if you could come in and say now, "We've got a case here with absolute violation of the Constitution." 
    But we have constitutional provisions that correlate, that mesh in together and we have one. 
    We have the Tenth Amendment, which says the States are supreme in certain fields. 
    If they have sovereign power to the old government and here they've exercised it and created a political subdivision to carry out the old parts. 
    They haven't taken away anybody's right to vote.

    Mr. James J. Carter 
    Yes, and they're asking --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5075.024" stopTime="5077.363">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You are not asking us to decide anything here.
speaker="james_j_carter" startTime="5077.363" stopTime="5320.085">
    Mr. James J. Carter 
    But this -- this decision of itself what they ask, if Your Honor please, is to go into motive, to go into purpose and to tell the court below, and as he pointed out, this case has been very carefully considered by two courts and I was interested to know that they realized that. 
    It's been studied. 
    It's been studied on several theories, not only the constitutional issues themselves but upon the question of judicial restraint in the statute. 
    The court below looked and Judge Wisdom did, that this is about as highly political thing as anybody can get into as to where boundary lines go. 
    If we start drawing boundary lines as such for every ward and every precinct and everything is going to be question after question. 
    Now, in Colegrove, we get back to that. 
    In that case, of course, was your congressional redistricting. 
    It's not exactly this case and I wouldn't say that it pronounced any absolutes but it did point out that the courts generally refrain from getting into the political figure of districting. 
    Now, this is not, as I say, a congressional district but it does draw lines of a political subdivision of a State in the South versus Peters, where again we had the question of the Georgia unit vote. 
    And there, the courts simply went all from the proposition that it was a political question because it wouldn't get into it. 
    Now, there was a dissent to that case and the argument in that case was very much as it was here. 
    The argument in that case being that the effect and purpose of the Georgia unit system, its purpose and effect was to dilute and to cut down on the vote of Negroes, and I believe, labor, but this Court nevertheless with Justice Black -- Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas dissenting held in that case that it was not a matter for judicial concern. 
    We say that this is a matter of local policy. 
    We say as the cases are pointed out that it's a question of local policy, purely political, that the courts held all the -- all the way back, not only these matters of equity, but it's a matter of judicial abstention if you please or judicial self-limitation perhaps would be the better word. 
    They have refused to go in to cases of this kind, which pose the line drawing political questions that this would and someone said, "Then what's the remedy?" 
    He said the only remedy we could have would be to declare this Act unconstitutional. 
    Of course there, we go back to proposition that you -- you've got intervening rights and have come up in the meantime. 
    We have this Act that was passed in 1957. 
    It was advertised two to three months before that. 
    Nobody felt that they were discriminated against it. 
    It did anything to almost 14 to 15 months later. 
    And then they decided they were which makes you wanted sometimes that people had rather have a lawsuit than to try -- use their right to petition on the Constitution to say, "Well, I don't think this law is right and I wish you wouldn't do it." 
    Now, we'd assume that legislators will not listen to anyone. 
    We'd assume that their right of petition had to go down and discuss this thing as they don't go this far, but go somewhere else. 
    You -- you're not doing the right by us. 
    But no, the matter is going on. 
    They accept the benefits of no taxes. 
    Accept the benefits of their police and fire protection. 
    But now, we come back at this late 80s, even intervening election and say, "Oh no, let's get into this thing now and tell us maybe where the line should be drawn," and say, "But all the courts not drawing a line." 
    Well, of course you can say it in this case, but if we draw another in some way as some court sometime has got to tell us how far we can go. 
    What percentage of colored and white there must be? 
    Of course, somewhere, sometime, if that goes on, somebody's got to draw the line.

    So we respectfully submit, if it please the Court, in this case. 
    That for the courts below to grant the relief that these petitioners ask, they would have had to have ignored precedents that have been established, reestablished, affirmed and reaffirmed throughout the history of America jurisprudence. 
    And we go back and we say again in the terms of Judge Wisdom. 
    We think he put very wisely. 
    He agreed with the majority opinion and he -- he wrote a concurring opinion on this question of judicial self-limitation. 
    As a matter of fact, the opinion of the majority and the opinion of minority, as well as dissent could well make the briefs in this case, my brief, his brief because they have covered the field factor. 
    But he did point this out and we'll come back to the situation in this case.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    I just have one word and I just want to point out to the Court what we -- again, what we think the propositions are before us. 
    What we are -- we have alleged, made allegations that Act 140 accomplishes disenfranchising based upon race and a denial of residence because of race. 
    It is our opposition, if the Court please, that we are entitled to have that both claims heard in the Court. 
    The abatement of racial discrimination has always been the business of -- of the -- of the courts and particularly, the federal court certainly since the civil war. 
    The fact that this was done by virtually of boundary lines and so forth we think makes no difference that the question we think that we're entitled to is to go into a court, to have a hearing and to put -- and to submit proof that racial discrimination, which we alleged had been accomplished and as such, we think that this is -- this is our case and that this case is governed as we said before by the race discrimination cases, where this thing has been aligned. 
    Thank you.
