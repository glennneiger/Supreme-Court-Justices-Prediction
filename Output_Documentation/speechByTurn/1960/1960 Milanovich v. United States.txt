speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="11.679" stopTime="431.911">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    I am J. Hubbard Davis of Norfolk, Virginia representing the petitioner, Virginia Milanovich. 
    Mike Milanovich is represented by Mr. Bergan. 
    We are here today on a writ of certiorari to the United States District -- I mean, Court of the Appeals of the Fourth Circuit. 
    We are appealing on the grounds that she was erroneously convicted. 
    Virginia Milanovich was erroneously convicted of both stealing and having possession of the stolen goods and also that the Court erred, in failing to instruct the witnesses not to discuss their testimony, both of which, for prejudicial and harmful error to the petitioners. 
    Briefly, the facts are that in June 2nd, 1958, Mike and Virginia Milanovich, husband and wife, Mike being a chief in the Navy of some 18 years experience, had met the three accomplices who were called in the lower court, the three thieves. 
    They had been -- met them sometime earlier in the spring, April or May and they had come to Norfolk with the -- Norfolk, Virginia, with the idea that they would go into business. 
    Mike lent them their -- his automobile. 
    It was licensed to travel in and out the military installations because of the proper sticker that was on the windshield. 
    On June 2nd, 1958, the jury still believed from the evidence presented that Mike and Virginia Milanovich and the company of the three accomplices, entered the United States Naval Amphibious Base, Norfolk, Virginia and burglarized the commissary store. 
    The jury so believed that Virginia Milanovich was a driver of the car and that Mike was present therein, neither of the two Milanovich has touched any of the stolen property, did not enter the building, did not enter the safes. 
    The three thieves broke into the building, broke into the safes and some $14,000 in cash, currency and checks were removed. 
    The burglary took such a lengthy time that according to the evidence that the jury believed, the Milanovichs did not wait in their automobile at the appropriate rendezvous, but returned to their home. 
    The three thieves, finding their transportation gone, buried their loot in the nearby woods and found a way by devious means to the Milanovich's home, subsequently left for their respective homes in Ohio. 
    Some two weeks later, on June 18th, Mr. Grammer, one of the three thieves, returned to Norfolk and visited with the Milanovich. 
    And the jury so believed that at that time, he and the company of Virginia Milanovich went to the Amphibious Base and recovered some of the stolen loot. 
    On the morning of the 19th, the FBI, on information, raided the home of the Milanovichs and there found Mike and Virginia Milanovich, a female friend by the name of (Inaudible) and one of the thieves, Mr. Grammer. 
    At that time, with permission of the Milanovichs, their home was searched and approximately $1000 wrapped in bank wrappers of coins, were found in two containers. 
    One of which was a cosmetic bag of Virginia Milanovich. 
    She denied knowledge of the money. 
    She said it was the property of the other woman in her house. 
    Be that as it may, the jury so believed that this was stolen property of the June 2nd break-in that it was in the possession of Virginia Milanovich. 
    And under the instruction given to the jury, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as a principal and as a receiver. 
    The charge to the jury, we say, was erroneous and should not have been given. 
    We say that the jury should have been so instructed that they could have found Mike and Virginia Milanovich guilty as a principal under the larceny statute or as a receiver of the stolen property, not both. 
    The charge is given to the jury was, as I quote, "I might say in passing, that if they did participate as aiders and abettors that they may be found guilty as principals, then as to the count as to receiving.” 
    Now of course, if they had actually removed the contents of the safe themselves, they cannot be guilty of receiving those same contents, but the evidence is clear in this case that either Mike Milanovich or Virginia Milanovich actually had their hands on the safe or removed any money from any safe. 
    The Court is drawing a fine line of distinction, saying the fact that they were principals in the theft, that they could also be guilty of receiving the stolen property, because they did not touch the loot at that time. 
    Yet it's inconceivable to think that these two individuals, if they did participate as they did by driving the three thieves to the scene and had the loot and transported to their automobile at that time, then it would have been split the five ways at that time, then there'd be a clearcut case and no question would've been raised by the District Court nor would we be here today." 
    But, here, they are present and certainly if they were present and as drivers of the gateway vehicle or the transportation, they certainly expected to participate in the proceeds. 
    And even though there were some two weeks delay in the actual receipt apart of the money and of course, as it might say in passing, the other $13,000 has never been accounted for, has never been found, only the $1000 in coins, which could not be removed at the time, has been recovered. 
    And we say that they expected to participate in the loot and the interven -- intervention of the time has no bearing whatsoever, that it is one offense and one alone. 
    The fact that they were tried on the charge of -- of receiving as well as the principal, we in the lower court, asked constantly that the -- the prosecution elect. 
    Of course the judge said, "It could not be and rightly so." 
    But the jury should have been instructed that their verdict of guilty, if they found either the defendants guilty, would be that of either the receiving or as a principal.

    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    The majority of the Fourth Circuit did set aside the receiving charge, yes.

    How does that correct in the error then?
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="445.475" stopTime="511.627">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    Because Virginia Milanovich asked for a jury trial. 
    We feel that in the case of Com -- Commonwealth versus Haskins, a Massachusetts case in 1880, where a person was found guilty of stealing a cow and having the cow in his possession, was found guilty of both offenses and the Court at that time, the District Attorney -- Commonwealth's attorney asked that the case be now cross as to receiving, the trial judge so upheld it, but the court of -- the Supreme Court of Appeals in Massachusetts reversed the case saying that the verdict was inconsistent in law and therefore, no judgment could be sustained. 
    And we say the same in this case. 
    It was up to the jury to decide which count they were guilty of.Virginia Milanovich was given ten years for the larceny, five, for the receipt. 
    The evidence is such that the jury, had he been properly instructed, may have found that the evidence was more credible as to the receiving count and would have found her guilty of that alone, rather than the larceny. 
    And we say --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the guilt of larceny in turn, on the ruling of the law, whether an aider or an abettor scam the principals, doesn't it?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Presumably, if the jury instructed it, you find that they in fact did aide and abet. 
    They are principals, proper, the jury had any choice. 
    They can -- the jury can do anything but he can't go behind their determination.
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="542.977" stopTime="563.903">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    Well, we say that this case falls in the ruling of this Court in the Heflin case, where it was set forth, very clearly that one cannot be guilty of robbing a bank and possession of the stolen goods. 
    That case was decided in the spring of 1959, which was after this particular trial, but we say it is applicable --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="563.903" stopTime="567.591">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, it is that they couldn't be guilty or -- but you can't impose two punishments --

    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    You cannot --

speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="575.703" stopTime="576.195">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="576.195" stopTime="605.441">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Suppose -- suppose, appellee Milanovichs -- Milanovichs -- I beg your pardon, had left as they did and the money has been -- the loot has been accomplished by the so-called three thieves and the money had been dissipated by them so that (Inaudible) come to the couple, would they be tried for larceny?
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="605.441" stopTime="617.904">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    Yes, sir. 
    Because they were aiders and abettors, they were there at the scene. 
    They were responsible for the three thieves to get to the building. 
    They were as much guilty as the three thieves, who actually touched the money.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="617.904" stopTime="628.151">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In fact, they will give them money. 
    In fact they will give them money. 
    And they were indicted on two separate counts, the two offenses not pleading him as murder, is that correct?
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="628.151" stopTime="629.308">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    Right, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="629.308" stopTime="633.392">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And then the Court of the Appeals set aside one of them.

    They vacated --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    It wouldn't take care of the situation if the jury had to determine the sentence.
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="646.357" stopTime="680.080">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    But we feel that had the jury been so instructed that they could only find the defendants guilty as a principal or as a receiver. 
    We feel that that was a correct inter -- correct interpretation of the statute. 
    We say that this larceny statute of 18 U.S.C. 641 is no different from that of the bank robbery statute, which this Court so decided in the Heflin case, that one could not be guilty of bank robbery and receiving the loot.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="680.080" stopTime="714.427">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What we said is they can't be punished, because it's only one offense, but they can grip more because there had been no receipt subsequently in aiding and abetting making them principals wouldn't have evaporated. 
    They would've been guilty of that, they -- after they received money and they can't be punished for both, but one offense hasn't evaporated. 
    There's one thing to say, people can't be punished for what turns out to be a single move that can -- having two constituents, (Inaudible) but the offenses having been committed.
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="714.427" stopTime="785.610">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    Well, we think that the jury should have -- should have been so instructed that they could bring in only one verdict that a person cannot be found guilty of both as a principal and as a receiver. 
    And I think, it was the intent of Congress and the legislative history is rather meager, just as it is in the bank robbery statute. 
    First, we had the offense of larceny. 
    Then some ten to 12 years later, the second paragraph was added to reach a new group of wrongdoers that it was not the intent of Congress to pyramid penalties, and that is what's being done in this case. 
    And we say that the -- no court, no judge can vacate a sentence and say that justice was done to the defendant. 
    And we feel that this case should be reversed, this conviction is reversed and remanded to the District Court for retrial under proper instructions that the jury should be so instructed that they can bring out one verdict either for the larceny or the receiving.

    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    At that time, no, sir. 
    He did not make any objection at that time. 
    It was after the charge had been given, then we felt it came to mind that they should have been instructed that they could only bring in a verdict of guilty as a principal or as a receiver. 
    We distinguish the Aaronson case in this matter. 
    That was one where the defendant applying the offense, several days in advance, made arrangements with two other people to steal certain government property. 
    He was never near the scene, did not even participate in it at all, but did receive the stolen property. 
    But in this case, Virginia Milanovich was right on the scene and as any -- you got a lookout and now, with the getaway car, just as guilty as the others. 
    It's not possible in a situation like this time was not usual I should think. 
    For all, I want to go into the building. 
    They were there and ready to make a quick getaway, if necessary, if caught.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    When they -- when their car left, when their car left and assuming as of that time, the -- the three accomplices had rifled the safe, part of the situation with reference that they had him. 
    Before they receive a penny, what was the legal situation and what could properly be charged -- for what could they be properly indicted and what could be properly charged against them?
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="921.175" stopTime="928.352">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    They could be properly indicted and charged under -- a larceny count as a principal, as being an aider and abettor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="928.352" stopTime="950.168">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you say, if two weeks later, they received some money, they can no longer be charged for larceny, as well as considering the intervening time also for receiving goods and having the proper charges to each on which the jury could find either or both, leaving the question of what punishment should be involved is a very different problem.
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="950.168" stopTime="955.083">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    As Judge Sobeloff said in his dissenting opinion, that the intervening time made no difference --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="955.083" stopTime="962.813">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="962.813" stopTime="973.279">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    Well, we feel that it was just a matter of circumstances that the money was not divided as of the actual time of taking. 
    Had the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="973.279" stopTime="980.938">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it's a matter of circumstances that some people don't carry out a planned crime and therefore, the result is a very different thing.
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="980.938" stopTime="1024.817">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    But had they been there at the time the loot was carried out, they would've probably and could have been charged similar manner, since they did not actually go into the building, did not touch the contents of the safes, could be probably found under this charge as given to the jury, would have been found guilty by this jury of both as a principal and as a receiver. 
    Because the judge says, "It makes no difference." 
    He said -- he says, "If they had actually removed the contents of the safe themselves, they cannot be guilty of receiving those same contents." 
    But the fact that somebody else gave it to them, made the difference. 
    And we say, it makes no difference because --

    But we didn't say that it is more creditable that they would be found guilty of receiving, rather than as a principal, because the testimony that makes them a principal in this crime is based entirely on that of the three accomplices, the three thieves. 
    The other evidence that the Court so found is rather weak as to the identification of the Milanovichs as being a principal. 
    But it's conclusive as to the receiving that the money was found in the Milanovich's home in a piece of luggage, which belonged to Virginia.

    The jury can well understand that they are the recipients of a thousand dollar stolen good. 
    But you are saying that the idea of being a principal to the rather aider and abettor, is the more complicated thing for a jury to understand and therefore, they could -- might rather disregard it, the judge's charge on the matter of law, that's what they said, (Voice Overlap) --

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1187.969" stopTime="1197.418">

    Not because the evidence was lacking for them to solve a crime, but because it's this metaphysical notion that the person who aides and abets in the law, is a principal.

    Even regardless of what the sentence was that the verdict was inconsistent in law and that it should be reversed. 
    And that the trial court and the jury should decide what a person is guilty of, just following the Heflin case. 
    We're not asking for that the rule of lenity be applied in this case, which was applied in both the Heflin and the Prince case, which is where both the defendants were already serving their sentences. 
    In this case, no sentence has been served, no time has been spent and we're asking that the convictions be set aside and that a retrial be issued on the grounds of -- that they were improperly instructed. 
    And we feel that the statute is very clear that you can only be guilty of one, whether you're an aider or an abettor and you're found guilty as a principal, you cannot be found guilty as a principal. 
    And that setting aside the sentence does not alter the fact that they have been found guilty of two separate and distinct offenses though they're very related. 
    The larceny and receiving has always been held as two separate offenses and in this case, that the jury should have been so instructed. 
    It'd be one or the other and not both.

    How do you ask for a new trial rather than a modification of a sentence?
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="1377.621" stopTime="1400.988">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    Because we feel that the defendants were deprived of the proper rights in the court by not having the jury so instructed. 
    We feel that Virginia should have the charge only if the court so feels of being found guilty as the receiver and not as a principal. 
    And as such, if she is so found guilty as a receiver, that her sentence would be the lighter one, rather than the heavier one.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    My question is why don't you ask this Court the lighter sentence -- that the sentence be modified there'd a direction or remission for the District Court or a modification of the sentence to the lighter one? 
    You don't say that as a matter of law, they couldn't be found guilty of either and that the evidence justified the jury in finding them guilty of either. 
    So why do you want to do a trial?
speaker="j_hubbard_davis" startTime="1427.700" stopTime="1440.941">
    Mr. J. Hubbard Davis 
    Because we feel they'd be up to the jury to decide rather than for the Court. 
    And at the end, that justice would be better reached by having the decision so made that one cannot be found guilty as a principal and as a receiver.

    No, I understand your argument. 
    But if -- if they could've been -- they could've been found guilty of either and weren't back upon guilty of both and sentences were imposed to the reference to both, although not -- although not in sequence or no -- why isn't the answer say since this was only one offense as a matter of whatever it is for the fashion in good sense that the lower (Inaudible) and not the higher.

   Argument of Raymond W. Bergan
speaker="raymond_w_bergan" startTime="1892.946" stopTime="2136.926">
    Mr. Raymond W. Bergan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think three minutes will be sufficient for this second point. 
    The second point which is in the case before the Court is one which affects both convictions. 
    But the only one which affects the conviction of the petitioner, Mike Milanovich, simply stated the position of the petitioners in this point, is that once having excluded prospective witnesses from the courtroom, it was error for the trial judge not to make this exclusion effective by failing to admonish them not to discuss their testimony. 
    At the early stages of the case before the first witness was called upon the request of the counsel for the defendants, the judge excluded. 
    The trial judge excluded the witnesses from the courtroom. 
    The further request of counsel for the defendants that the witness be admonished not to discuss their testimony with each other before they had testified or to discuss the testimony which had already been given with witnesses who already had testified, was denied by the trial court. 
    His ruling appears on the record at pages 33 and again at pages 50 to 52. 
    Now of course, we concede that exclusion of witnesses from the trial of courtroom in civil and criminal cases as a matter of discretion for the trial court. 
    But without a very good reason, it appears logical and it would appear that logic alone would require that once having exercised is right and his discretion to exclude witnesses from the courtroom that the judge ought to have a very good reason not to make his exclusion effective. 
    I think if the Court will refer to the ruling of the Court of Appeals in this case, which is at page 344 of the record, you will note the Court of Appeals although not reversing the conviction on this point, point it out that we wish to indicate our view, this is halfway down the first paragraph. 
    "We wish to indicate our view that ordinarily when a judge exercise his discretion to exclude witnesses, it would seem proper for him to take the further step of making the exclusion effective." 
    In fact, what the trial judge did in this case was not to exercise any discretion as to decline to instruct witnesses to give them this admonition. 
    The trial judge as appears on pages 33 of the record, when the request was made, pointed out to counsel for the defendants, "I do not think the Court can possibly police such a situation. 
    The fine points of questioning or matters of course that are relevant that there is not much I can do about such situation. 
    Despite my size, the trial judge continues I'm only one man and I cannot be in more than one place at a time." 
    Again at page 50, the trial court says, "Mr. Kutulakis, I cannot be a policeman. 
    The witnesses have been separated, but there is no law at anytime which prohibits them from talking to anyone -- prohibits anyone from talking to the witnesses." 
    We submit the trial court erred in saying that there was no law that prohibited the witnesses. 
    The trial court could have made such a law. 
    This Court has sanctioned the punishment of -- of contempt for the violation of such ruling in the Holder case. 
    The trial court has the authority, the discretion if it wishes, for the violation of such a rule to exclude the testimony. 
    Now, we submit that it's analogous to the case of Charles versus the United States, which is reported at 215 F.2d, at page 828, where the District Court of Hawaii had refused to issue a rule excluding witnesses because we don't do that anymore it said. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit pointed out that this was not reason enough. 
    It's a matter that's addressed to the discretion of the Court. 
    We submit that in -- particularly in the case of this type, where it's all accomplished testimony that the rule should have been issued.

   Argument of J. F. Bishop
speaker="j_f_bishop" startTime="2140.807" stopTime="2371.058">
    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    On both of the issues presented for petitioners, I looked at some of the record and maybe of assistance here, see what happens, see which witnesses testified to which facts, what instructions were asked for, when they were to asked for and what instructions were given. 
    Preliminarily as to the point just argued with respect to the witnesses, Government's position is relatively simple. 
    That is, we know of no rule promulgated by this Court and the federal rules of criminal procedure. 
    We know of no congressional enactment, no constitutional provision and no decisions, which are sought to circumscribe the discretion of a trial judge in dealing with witnesses in a particular case, under the particular circumstances. 
    And with a look at the record, I believe we will show that there was not something of the type of the Charles case, where the port abdicated its function, but that was here an exercise the discretion by a judge, whom we perhaps, can't even evaluate on the pulled record who had a difficult problem, some 50 to 70 witnesses and did what it could about it. 
    But we'll get back to that with the record. 
    Returning also preliminarily to the first point with respect to Virginia Milanovich alone that has been explored rather extensively by the Court and what has been suggested by the Court of course, is the Government's position. 
    Virginia Milanovich was convicted of aiding and abetting, the three safecrackers, who went on to the Naval Base and also of assisting in their escape. 
    On that count, separate instructions were given. 
    There were separate facts we submit and there was a separate verdict. 
    We don't have the problem here of a general verdict of a jury where we have any doubt as to what the jury found. 
    There were two separate verdicts on the two separate counts. 
    Now, the second count as has been observed by members of the Court was the count of receiving and concealing. 
    Dealing with a matter some two weeks later and relating only to one of these safecrackers who gave some of the money to Virginia Milanovich. 
    Now, as to that count and as to the instruction on that count, issue was taken. 
    And as to that issue, we are not here discussing a question of multiple sentences. 
    That sentence on the receiving count has been vacated and we know of no challenge of any of the instructions, the separate instructions if you please, on the aiding and abetting of larceny, so that we end a familiar case which has appeared before this Court, perhaps some numbers of times, but one count being bad, that has been separately handled, not on a question of fact or any inconsistency of the facts. 
    There is no question that both of these things happened. 
    That Virginia Milanovich did both of these things. 
    The question is -- has -- as has been suggested, the question of law and that maybe noted that the Court of Appeals below did not set aside the sentence on receiving in any idea, without reaching at all, the question that there was inconsistency of facts. 
    But solely, on the basis that in and their interpretation of the statute, they felt that the rule of this Court and Heflin applied and that there could be only one punishment. 
    And accordingly, set at the receiving, sentence aside and with that, we insist that all has been done for her that needs to be done.

    There is no question about that. 
    So therefore and here's the inaccuracy, "If they received any money and I do not suggest that they did or did not receive any money, they must have -- they must have received it from some other party." 
    And then we go into the discussion of whether they received with intent to convert to their own use or gain. 
    That is where the -- the District Court departed from what the Court of Appeals later found to be the statutory intent.

    And in this case, the jury could've found either one of the other and was perfectly claimed that the sentence was imposed by the judges with full awareness of all the circumstance in reference to this defense, so we don't have to speculate much, do we, in this case?

    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    I believe, Your Honor, on the record as to his reasons given for the totality of what occurred there. 
    His reason -- in other words, what disturbs -- I presume what is disturbing about this is that he did give five years concurrent sentence on the receiving count. 
    But I must confess that I am not as disturb by that because he did that not as he would have treated a receiving count alone, but in full realization that there would be ten years in any event. 
    And if -- I -- I must again answer that on the totality of the picture, if we were to consider what he would have done on the receiving count alone, I would say the -- the larger sentence would have been imposed on that.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3345.459" stopTime="3392.650">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I think the reason for that is I may say so, in going out in old experience, is the common place. 
    At least in my experience, well, what -- what happen doesn't yield in watching sentencing by federal judges. 
    That if the second sentence is concurrent, they throw that in as a sort of -- with not much concern what their -- if it's -- if it's a concurrent sentence, if -- if it's not to be add -- if it's not be added to the punishment, but is merely directed formally to a verdict of guilty. 
    That's the very common place to think. 
    They can give him ten years or eight years and then let's say on a second count whatever the difference is, two years drawn concurrently, hadn't much meaning. 
    They just want to fix the sentence to that for which they will not be in addition of serving of sentence.

    So how can we know either way of that, we can't can we? 
    I would think that probably a judge might proceed on one of the counts. 
    He might be reversed on one of them, if you get speculated. 
    What we have is a case where we cannot know what the judge would have done, isn't it? 
    If there had been a five -- if sentence or conviction merely for the one different, don't we? 
    We can't know it. 
    But we do have a case where the Court of Appeals looked at it and selected whatever you want to call, wiping out or the other. 
    It left one in effect and obliterated the other. 
    The one that was left in effect was the larger one. 
    It could have done either, couldn't he?

    We don't find that true at all. 
    We do not find true that there was no cooperation because in -- in many respects for instance, the sentries at the -- at the Naval Station, though that appears in our brief, corroborated these stories that the -- in many respects here.
