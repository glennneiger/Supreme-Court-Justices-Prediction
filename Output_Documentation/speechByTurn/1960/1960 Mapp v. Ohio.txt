    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Mr. Chief Justice, this Honorable Court, if the Court please? 
    We have a situation here arising in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. 
    The defendant-appellant in this case was living in a residential neighborhood, owned her own home, and living there in a two-family house on the second floor, having rented the first floor to another tenant. 
    She lived there with a daughter approximately eleven years of age. 
    The evidence in this case disclosed that she is a woman without any record whatsoever from the criminal point of view, a decent, respectable American citizen. 
    One day these police officers of the City of Cleveland, three in number, and the record sets forth the occurrence, came to the house and wanted to be admitted for the purpose of making a search. 
    When they rapped at the door or rang the bell, she looked out the window and asked them what they wanted. 
    And they said that they wanted to search the house.

    What time of the day was this, day or night?
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="120.489" stopTime="122.125">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    In the daytime.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="122.125" stopTime="125.145">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    On a weekday, on a weekday in the daytime?
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="125.145" stopTime="250.964">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Weekday, yes. 
    And she said that she would call her lawyer and see what he said. 
    Now, the evidence discloses that the police officers claimed that they were informed that there was some paraphernalia for the numbers game in the house, and they were also informed that a person wanted for questioning in a bombing was in the house. 
    She called her lawyer, Mr. Greene, who is my associate; and he said to her, if they have a search warrant, you permit them into the house. 
    So she told them that they'd have to have a search warrant. 
    One of the police officers then called his chief, a Lieutenant Cooney, and told him he couldn't get into the house because they required a search warrant and within a few minutes thereafter, several zone cars with many police officers surrounded the house. 
    Then, the evidence discloses, at least two of the police officers who knew -- one was Sergeant Delau, knew what he was there for, but made no effort to procure a search warrant, neither one of them did, but they testified that a search warrant was procured by a Lieutenant White. 
    Now, they didn't know about it. 
    The evidence discloses that they were told that a search warrant had been procured. 
    When they came to the house with the search warrant and by the time or supposed search warrant, by the time they arrived, Mr. Greene was also there.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="250.964" stopTime="253.244">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You say "supposed search warrant" (Inaudible)
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="253.244" stopTime="365.430">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    There was no search warrant, Your Honor. 
    I intend to go to that from the evidence as we proceed. 
    This Lieutenant White came and showed a piece of paper, and Mrs. Mapp demanded to see the paper and to read it to see what it was, which they refused to do, so she grabbed it out of his hand to look at it and then a scuffle started, and she put this piece of paper into her bosom and very readily the police officer put his hands into her bosom and removed the paper, and thereafter, thereafter handcuffed her while the police officers started to search the house. 
    Now, the evidence in the case discloses that the State claims there were only seven police officers, some in uniform. 
    Mr. Greene, who was there and was not permitted entrance to the house, but who was kept outside, says there were approximately twelve police officers in all. 
    Now, the evidence discloses that no search warrant existed, although they claimed that there was a search warrant, there is absolutely no evidence of any magistrate that had been asked for a search warrant, there was no record of a search warrant. 
    We asked during the trial of the case that the search warrant be produced and it was not. 
    The fact of the matter is that our own Supreme Court found that it was very questionable as to whether there was a search warrant in this case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="365.430" stopTime="368.392">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What was the piece of paper? 
    Did that get identified?
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="368.392" stopTime="416.676">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    We don't know what it was. 
    She was not given an opportunity to read it. 
    She doesn't know what it was. 
    It was a piece of white paper, but the police officers never produced it, because, as a matter of fact, if it please Your Honors, I waited in the trial of the case for Lieutenant White, who was supposed to be the man who procured the search warrant, to take the stand so that at least I could cross examine him as to where, when and how he procured the search warrant and what the search warrant contained, but the State was clever enough not to put him on the stand and no other police officer knew anything about it.

    I did not, I did not. 
    But the prosecutor promised, and we have the prosecutor here, that the search warrant would be produced, and it never was. 
    So the situation is that the home was entered, the place was searched from cellar to roof by all these police officers. 
    They found some paraphernalia in the basement pertaining to some lottery, belonging, later it developed, to someone else, the tenant downstairs, and she was tried for that and was acquitted and following the acquittal as to the paraphernalia, she was then arrested and tried for having in her possession obscene literature.

    Now --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="583.024" stopTime="585.686">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    From the same trunk?
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="585.686" stopTime="879.326">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Well, parts of the same trunk, we claim. 
    The evidence, of course, was this. 
    They claimed, the police officers claimed that they found some of this literature, a book or two, in the dresser drawer of her bedroom. 
    They found some literature, they claimed, in the room. 
    We say that she had a roomer in the house, a man by the name of Jones. 
    He had occupied that room. 
    He had moved and left and she had corroborating testimony to that effect. 
    He had moved and left, and left some of his clothes and these things, including a .22 caliber revolver, in the room. 
    And when she discovered that he wasn't coming back within the week or two weeks, not knowing whether he was going to return or not, she started cleaning out the room in order to put his things away should he call for them or send for them, because his room rent was paid to the balance, to the end of the month and she wanted to clean the room out so that she could give the room to her daughter. 
    And the situation was that while she was cleaning this room she found these things, a couple of books and so on, together with some of his belongings in the dresser drawers. 
    Her testimony, and the testimony of her corroborating witness, was that they took these things out of the drawer. 
    And these particular books, the obscene literature was in a brown envelope, a paper bag—and that when they took these things out they saw what it was, and she said to the girl that was helping her, look at what terrible things men read, let's put it away. 
    So that they took these things and put it in a brown box, a small brown box together with his socks and a hat and things of that sort, and put it in the basement, but the police officers deny that they found these things in the basement. 
    They said they found them all in the room and as a matter of fact the evidence shows, and the record is here, that they even denied that there was a pistol there, then later the other police officer says, yes there was. 
    So they didn't agree on their testimony at all. 
    However, she did explain to them and Sergeant, Mr. Haney who was the first witness, denied that she said that these things belonged to a roomer that formerly had had this room. 
    Whereas Sergeant Delau, and the record so shows, testified that she did tell him that, and that she was keeping these things for the man when he came for his goods. 
    Then following that, of course, she was charged and she was tried before a jury. 
    Now, the question came up in the trial of this cause, and this being a comparatively new statute in Ohio, the statute in itself merely says, "Whoever knowingly has in his possession," and goes on to say, "pornographic literature, even stories of crime, is guilty under this statute." 
    Now, the purpose, the reason for having it in the possession, as one of the judges of our own Supreme Court asked, what do you say we have it here and I said you're guilty. 
    No question about it because the statute does not differentiate for any purpose of having anything in your possession, knowingly having in your possession. 
    And the court charged the jury that under the statute she knew it was there, and knowing that it was there, she had it knowingly in her possession. 
    Consequently, he practically charged that she was guilty and his charge so showed.

    Without reference as long as she had it in her possession --

    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Even if in the cellar, because she testified that they carried it down to the cellar. 
    So, she had it in her possession.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="897.694" stopTime="903.644">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Did the judge require the jury to distinguish, though and find that the goods were in the room?

    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    No, he didn't.

    He did not?
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="905.431" stopTime="948.568">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    He did not. 
    He merely said that if, for any reason, even -- he even went far enough to say that if a person has things like this in their possession and conceals them they're still guilty, because if they find that these things were concealed because some of it was in a suitcase under the bed together with some of the man's clothing and socks and things of that sort that she had put away for him as she found them in the drawer.

    May I trouble you to tell us what you deem to be the questions that are open before this Court and I'll tell you why I ask that question. 
    Unless you correct me, I assume it is still the law of Ohio that the decision of your Supreme Court is what is contained in the syllabus. 
    Is that still the law?

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="978.547" stopTime="999.185">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, therefore, in going to the syllabi, I find that the court hasn't decided questions of evidence or the charge, etcetera, etcetera. 
    It decided only questions of the constitutionality of the statute.
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="999.185" stopTime="1001.876">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    That's what they decided. 
    That's what the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1001.876" stopTime="1016.051">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What else is open? 
    So far as I read the syllabi, I can't tell that any of these questions about search and seizure – no search --
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="1016.051" stopTime="1017.367">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Unlawful search and seizure.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1017.367" stopTime="1021.885">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, but not the charge and not the adequacy of evidence.
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="1021.885" stopTime="1033.784">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    They didn't decide those. 
    That's the reason we are saying that this is -- they went along, so on the question of a constitutional question, the violation of her constitutional rights.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1033.784" stopTime="1048.136">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there any thing else open – is anything beyond – is there anything open before us beyond what the court decided or the chance that they refused to decide a due question and they wouldn't decide it?
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="1048.136" stopTime="1068.898">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Well, that is right. 
    The one thing that I say that I am asking this Court to decide is the question of the deprivation of eight-and-a-half million citizens of the State of Ohio, depriving them of their constitutional rights to -- against unlawful search and seizure –
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1068.898" stopTime="1069.169">

    That is a –

    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    -- because one man was to be put in jail and wanted to be and should have been kept there and that's the Lindway case because they say in the Lindway case, they're actually advocating anarchy because in the Lindway case they say that the police officers that come to the home without a search warrant are trespassing. 
    Consequently, if they're trespassers, you may use force to keep them out of your home, but if they find contraband then the court will not inquire as to whether it was lawfully obtained or not.

    Now, they say her evidence clearly discloses that defendant not only took possession and control of the room which she had rented, but also of the belongings of her former tenant, including the books and pictures which the undisputed evidence shows she knew to be lewd and lascivious. 
    Hence it follows that if the portion of Section 2905.34, Revised Code that was applied in the instant case is not unconstitutional and void, then, even if we assume that there were errors in the trial court's charge as defendant argues, such errors could not have prejudiced the defendant. 
    So they speak of the charge of the court, but they hold that it wasn't prejudicial because if the statute itself is not unconstitutional, then the charge of the court was not prejudicial.

    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1357.685" stopTime="1368.538">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And that's the familiar doctrine in most -- so many states of this Union and which we dealt with in the Wolf case that you don't even refer to in your brief.
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="1368.538" stopTime="1502.687">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Well, we went through the Wolf case, but we don't refer to it here. 
    I think maybe the State does, but the fact of the matter is that we are, as citizens of Ohio, deprived of our constitutional rights against unlawful search and seizure. 
    Now, may I go on with Judge Taft's wording, “Defendant contends that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was violated by her conviction for possession and control of these books and pictures since that conviction was based primarily upon their unlawful seizure from her during an unlawful search of her home.” 
    There is, in the record, considerable doubt as to whether there ever was any warrant for the search of defendant's home. 
    No warrant was offered in evidence. 
    There was no testimony as to who issued any warrant or as to what any warrant contained, and the absence from evidence of any such warrant is not explained or otherwise accounted for in the record. 
    There is nothing in the record tending to prove or from which an inference may be drawn and no one has even suggested that any warrant that we may assume that there may have been described anything other than policy paraphernalia as things to be searched for. 
    Then we speak of our statute. 
    Section 2933.24, requires a search warrant to particularly described of things to be searched for. 
    And 2905.35 of the Revised Code, our Constitution, Section 14 of Article I, specifically forbids the issuance of any such warrant except upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation particularly describing the place to be searched and things to seized.

    The second syllabus says, “A conviction thereunder under this statute,” which you're attacking, “may be valid although that conviction is based primarily upon the introduction into evidence of lewd and lascivious books and pictures unlawfully seized during an unlawful search and seizure.

    There is nothing in the record of any response, nothing. 
    The record shows a motion to suppress the evidence was filed, was argued for the court, and the court overruled it. 
    And I'll say to this Court very honestly that the court overruled that because of the Lindway case. 
    It is the Lindway case that controls them because time and again we've had the same question in our courts, in which the court would turn to me and say well Mr. Kearns can we say anything about this since the Lindway case is still on the books.

    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    That is right, and if they do not find contraband then they are liable to a suit for being trespassers, that's what the law – the case holds. 
    As far as the case itself is concerned because at that time, in 1935 I believe it was, there was this one man who was making bombs for the unionists and so he was convicted and he rightfully so and Judge Herbert in his dissenting opinion speaks of that situation, but let us look at this other question. 
    Here is a woman who was lawfully in her own home. 
    She is not exhibiting anything like this. 
    She is not trying to sell it, she is not throwing anything. 
    Assuming that they did find it in her home, the sentence, the sentence imposed upon her is one to seven years for having exercising let us say her right to look at a book that she shouldn't look at, to have in her possession a book that she shouldn't have. 
    Not that she is a criminal, not that she has a former record, but one to seven years imposed upon her for daring to have a book of this sort in her home.

    She is sentenced to seven years in the penitentiary for daring to have this in her possession.

    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    That is true. 
    But I'm assuming for the sake and purpose of the discussion that the books were there and that this Court may feel that it was a crime, but we do say that this is not a crime under the factual situation in this case; that she did not intend to commit a crime; that she did not intend to injure any of the other citizenry of the State of Ohio.

    That's the situation that we're asking that this Court look into and correct the rights of this particular individual, this plaintiff, defendant-appellant.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Before I get into the area which was allotted to me, I would like to say that the American Civil Liberties Union and its Ohio Affiliate, the Ohio Civil Liberties Union, is very clear, in response to the question which was directed to counsel for the appellant, that we are asking this Court to reconsider Wolf versus Colorado and to find that evidence which is unlawfully and illegally obtained should not be permitted into a state proceeding, and that its production is a violation of the Federal Constitution, the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman

    An argument might be made under the question of Rochin, but we are not, because of the peculiar position in which we stand before you, are not raising that technical argument. 
    Our principal reason for appearing on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union and its Ohio affiliate is to urge the unconstitutionality of the Ohio obscenity law, which is Section 2905, Subsection 34 of the Ohio Revised Code.

    We did not consider that point. 
    This lady was convicted under this statute and given an indeterminate sentence of not less than one nor more than seven years. 
    She was convicted under this statute despite the fact that a majority of the members of the highest court of our State, the Ohio Supreme Court, felt that the statute itself was unconstitutional and the reason for this, of course, is the fact that Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution holds that where there has been an affirmance, a denial of unconstitutionality in a criminal case in the Court of Appeals, it takes all but one of the justices of the Supreme Court to hold a statute unconstitutional and therefore void a conviction thereunder.

speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2318.163" stopTime="2384.965">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    Those facts are not before us, Your Honor. 
    The statute under which the defendant in this case was convicted, as far as we are concerned, reads like this. 
    No person shall knowingly have in his possession or under his control an obscene, lewd or lascivious book print or picture. 
    There are some words left out, but this is the heart of the particular statute. 
    In short, as we understand it, if a normal adult knowingly has an obscene book or picture in his possession, without any criminal intent whatsoever, he has committed a felony in Ohio. 
    Now, as far as the facts are concerned, the only facts which are pertinent to our argument are that she was indicted and convicted under this statute. 
    She was not charged with any criminal intent. 
    She was not charged with distributing this material to minors. 
    She was not charged with commercial traffic. 
    She was charged only with knowing possession of lewd, lascivious, or obscene books or prints.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2384.965" stopTime="2388.915">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is there any issue in this case that the books were obscene?
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2388.915" stopTime="2528.413">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    I think not. 
    I think that by any definition which this Court would choose to apply the material was obscene, and for our purposes we are assuming that to be the fact. 
    We deplore the appellant's bad taste in the selection of her literature, and we are not now arguing in favor of pornographic literature for the population, but this aesthetic issue, we submit, is not presently before the Court. 
    As we see it, the central issue in considering the validity of this statute is this. 
    Is this an area in which the individual has the right to be let alone, to be free of governmental restraint? 
    Mr. Justice Brandeis, dissenting in Olmstead versus the United States has stated it better than I could. 
    It is cited at page 16 of our brief amicus and he said this. 
    “The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. 
    They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. 
    They conferred, as against the government, the right to be let alone, the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.” 
    More specifically, however, the issue is, does this statute constitute an invalid exercise of the State's police power so as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution? 
    Now, we do not deny that a state may properly legislate in the area of morals. 
    Nor do we argue at this time, although well at an earlier time we might have, after the decision in Roth versus the United States, that obscene utterances, the obscene word, the printed word, are within the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments as they relate to free speech and the press. 
    In passing and in candor, the American Civil Liberties Union adheres to the proposition that all forms of expression may be limited only by the application of the tests arising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the test of clear and present danger, or, as modified in Dennis, clear and proper danger.

    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, there are several branches to our request to this Court. 
    Number one, we think that, as far as all forms of expression are concerned, they should be protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    We think the Roth case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2592.298" stopTime="2598.077">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    My objection is not to your making any argument that's relevant. 
    You were given leave to file a brief.
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2598.077" stopTime="2598.417">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2598.417" stopTime="2607.826">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You were not given leave to make an oral argument on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
    You're sharing the time of the appellant, on behalf of the appellant.
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2607.826" stopTime="2884.931">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Our other branch of our argument is that we feel that, even in the area of morals, which we have conceded is a proper legislative area, that, as in other permissible legislative areas, such enactments or statutes must be reasonably adapted to accomplish the legislative purpose and must not be arbitrary and excessive. 
    Furthermore, they must not infringe upon paramount individual rights, particularly where a similar legislative result may be achieved by other less drastic means. 
    We submit that interposing a policeman between a normal adult and his library is not a proper means of accomplishing what might otherwise be a valid legislative purpose. 
    We contend that the statute is arbitrary and excessive. 
    We urge that there are important individual rights which are protected against encroachment by the states by the concept of ordered liberty embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment, and which are substantially and unnecessarily limited by this statute. 
    And we say that the evil sought to be controlled here can be met by less drastic statutory means without limiting the liberties of the citizens of the State of Ohio and as a consequence we say that the statute is unconstitutional. 
    Now, our brief has discussed some of the sociological and scientific studies at page 8. 
    In Appendices A and B we have correlated some of the studies which have dealt with the question of whether obscene material results in depravity. 
    We note that, at page 8, the conclusion seems to be that there is no positive study that so holds. 
    We are not saying that this is a necessary consideration to the matter of the First Amendment, clear and present danger. 
    That is not our point, but we are trying to demonstrate that this legislation is not reasonably related to, nor adapted to the accomplishment of any legitimate governmental purpose. 
    Why must the relationship be shown between the legislative means and the desired result more clearly in this kind of a case and it seems to us that it is because individual rights, such as the right of privacy, the right to read, which has been substantiated as part of the Fourteenth Amendment in Wolf versus Colorado and Butler versus Michigan, both of which opinions were written for the Court by Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    And we do not feel it necessary to consider whether the Fourth Amendment is incorporated bodily into the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We think that certainly the right of privacy is a basic concept of freedom which appears there. 
    We think also that Smith versus California gives an indication of the direction in which this Court may go in this case, and that is that even though the First Amendment is not involved in a matter dealing with admittedly obscene material, we think that this statute certainly has a potentially inhibiting effect upon freedom of expression, even if the material itself is not constitutionally protected. 
    And we feel that the evil sought to be controlled here can be dealt with by means that don't infringe upon individual freedom. 
    We think that there are other ways of attacking the problem of obscenity without saying to a person, “you cannot have in your possession a book which may or may not be obscene, which you do not know is obscene until you read it, and immediately after you have read it and have the necessary knowledge, whatever that may be, and that's a question which is left for another day too, as soon as you have the requisite knowledge, you are guilty of a felony. 
    We think that this is certainly a broadly drawn statute which is not necessary to achieve this purpose. 
    We urge the Court to keep in mind its own admonition in Roth, in which you will recall Mr. Justice Brennan, speaking for the Court, said this. 
    “The door barring Federal and state intrusion into this area cannot be left ajar. 
    It must be kept tightly closed and opened only to the slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more important interests.” 
    In this case, Your Honors, the door cannot be left ajar. 
    It must be kept tightly closed.

    At the outset, I want to say this, that when this case was pending in the Supreme Court of Ohio, or just after its deposition, one of the State's exhibits disappeared, one of the obscene books. 
    And when the exhibits were returned to the clerk of the Court of Common Pleas, there was just the cover of this one obscene book that came back, and we don't know what happened to it.

speaker="gertrude_bauer_mahon" startTime="3100.014" stopTime="3142.080">
    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    Well, that's what I have in mind in connection with the additional provision in the Ohio statute which was made in 1955. 
    Prior to that time, it prohibited possession, but possession for the purposes of exhibition or for the purposes of sale. 
    It was limited to that. 
    In 1955, the legislature included this provision to prohibit a knowing possession, the naked, knowing possession of obscene materials, without regard to the purpose.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does that mean, let me see if I understand that, does that mean that any book on my shelf, on any of my shelves, which may be found to be obscene constitutes the possessor, who does nothing but just have that on his shelf, a violator of that statute, is that correct or incorrect?

    No and scienter was proven in this case. 
    There was never any dispute raised on that in the reviewing court that scienter was not established, so that the elements of the crime were established beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    Now, the constitutionality of this legislation, of course, we are relying upon your decision in the Roth case, in which a Federal statute providing that obscene, lewd, lascivious or indecent material is nonmailable and in the Roth case, Mr. Justice Brennan made this statement. 
    “Implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance. 
    And we hold that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.” 
    We believe that this statute legislating the -- regulating obscenity and the dissemination of it, or the circulation of it in Ohio, is a proper exercise of the police powers of the State. 
    Recognizing that obscenity is an evil that has to be coped with, and of course, that is not peculiar to the State of Ohio alone. 
    We believe that --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is there any other state, to your knowledge, Mrs. Mahon, that makes mere possession a criminal offense?
speaker="gertrude_bauer_mahon" startTime="3818.486" stopTime="3827.872">
    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    Well, I haven't run down the statutes, Your Honor. 
    But this is true that when you -- when this Court had the Winters case before it --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3827.872" stopTime="3829.097">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Winters against New York.
speaker="gertrude_bauer_mahon" startTime="3829.097" stopTime="3872.949">
    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    In the Winters case you had a different part and that was a similar statute to the Ohio statute, but I do not recall that it prohibited possession alone. 
    And the portion of the statute that was under consideration had nothing to do with this particular provision. 
    But I do remember, in reading the Winters case that Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his dissent on that pointed out, among other statutes, a number of statutes of the states said that might be struck down as a result of the decision in the Winters case, and he mentioned the Ohio statute. 
    However, the portion that we have here --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3872.949" stopTime="3876.114">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    This must have been before 1955.
speaker="gertrude_bauer_mahon" startTime="3876.114" stopTime="4034.503">
    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    Well, I say, the portion that we have here was not in the Ohio statute at that time. 
    However, getting back to the Roth case, which the other side, the defense, completely ignored on the issue they've raised here in connection with the constitutionality of this legislation. 
    In the Roth case I want the Court to know this that in the trial of this case, the trial judge in instructing the jury on the test to be used to determine whether this obscene -- whether this material was obscene, used the definition that this Court laid down in the Roth case and told the jury that the proper test is whether, to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material in question, when taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest. 
    That was the instruction of the court. 
    He followed the definition that this Court laid down in the Roth case. 
    And, getting back to the constitutionality of legislation prohibiting scienter possession, in the Supreme Court's opinion, of course, in the dissent, I think Judge Herbert discusses the Smith case. 
    And that case came to this Court from California, and I think it's distinguishable on the elements required to be proven by our legislation. 
    This Court, in reversing that case, pointed out that scienter was not required, and that under those circumstances a bookseller could not be held liable, could not be held to examine all the books that he had in his store in order to avoid a prosecution under that ordinance, but we do have the element of scienter in our State statute. 
    I want --

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4059.695" stopTime="4071.451">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Really, your constitutional argument, if I understand it correctly, come from Roth, is that Roth says obscene literature is not protected, and therefore it's just like contraband, and therefore the State can do anything they want with it.
speaker="gertrude_bauer_mahon" startTime="4071.451" stopTime="4677.765">
    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    It is within the police power, yes. 
    Yes, that is our position. 
    There is a distinction, of course, in the Roth case. 
    The Court was considering knowingly mailing obscene material, but what good does it do to legislate, to prohibit the production of obscenity, the distribution of it, if ultimately possession is constitutionally protected -- the user of it, just as the user of narcotics. 
    On the -- the only other issue I think that is before this Court on this search and seizure -- on the trial of this case the two officers that testified were already on the scene when this Lieutenant White came out there, ostensibly with a search warrant. 
    The record doesn't show, and we have admitted, and as the Supreme Court held, this was an unlawful search insofar as this particular evidence was concerned, at least. 
    There was no search warrant to cover it. 
    But on the motion to suppress this evidence at the time of the trial, the court relied upon the Lindway case in overruling the motion to suppress and, of course, the constitutional provision against an unreasonable search and seizure, as this Court has held in the Wolf case, does not prevent a state from offering into evidence. 
    It doesn't affect the competency of evidence tending to establish the commission of a crime. 
    Now, we're relying on the Wolf case, too, with this Court that if this is a settled proposition insofar as the states rules of evidence are concerned. 
    It really is a judicial rule of evidence, and Ohio does not follow the exclusionary rule. 
    And this Court has held that the state has a right to, and it is not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to so admit evidence, even though obtained without a search warrant. 
    I have never been able to reconcile that is not reconcile, but it seems to me that the provision in the Constitution against an unreasonable search and seizure and the competency of evidence establishing the commission of a crime are not directly related in this respect that the absence of a search warrant can be no defense to a crime. 
    If the evidence establishes a crime, what defense is there in the absence of a search warrant? 
    It's a collateral matter. 
    It provides for a civil suit for trespass if that constitutional right is violated. 
    Police officers are amenable to, as held in the Lindway case, and I'm reading from the Lindway case right now. 
    “An officer of the law who makes a search and seizure in a dwelling or other premises without a warrant or with an illegal warrant in contravention of Section 14, Article I, of the Constitution of Ohio is a trespasser and amenable to an action for such trespass. 
    There are many constitutional and statutory safeguards provided for in the Ohio Constitution and the Ohio statutes to ensure that persons accused of crimes shall have a fair and impartial trial, and those safeguards apply to matters of form as well as substance. 
    But neither the laws of Ohio nor the Ohio courts are solicitous to a person accused of crime in concealing the evidence of their guilt and under Ohio laws many presumptions are indulged in, in favor of accused persons, and a strong measure of proof is required as to every material fact necessary to establish the guilt of the accused. 
    But such indulgence does not reach to the extent of rejecting competent evidence because of the method by which it was procured. 
    And so, in the Ohio Constitution and under the Ohio laws, the fact that there was a search warrant would not make the evidence any the more competent or the fact that there was no search warrant would not make it any the less competent. 
    It has no bearing whatsoever on the evidence itself proving the corpus delicti of the crime. 
    This brief amicus curiae, Your Honors, raises an issue that was not brought up in the Court of Appeals or in the trial court, and I don't believe that the issue should be enlarged upon by the time they reach this Court, because the Court of Appeals, for example, had no opportunity to pass upon a comparison of the statutes, this 2905.34. 
    In the brief amicus curiae, they talk about 2905.37 and 3767.01, and try to draw a comparison trying to show that there's a denial of the equal protection of the laws by reason of the exemptions in those other statutes, but the lower courts had no opportunity to consider those statutes along with 2905.34. 
    There was never any issue raised in this case by this defense until we got to the Supreme Court of Ohio and agreed to a brief amicus curiae being filed. 
    The defense never claimed that there was a denial of the equal protection of the laws in the Court of Appeals on 2905.34 and indeed, it makes no exceptions to that statute alone. 
    No one is exempt, but in these other statutes they talk about 2905.37, for example, sets forth that druggists in their legitimate business shall not be affected by 2905.34, but it says "in their legitimate business," and I don't think that under 2905.34 that a druggist, even a druggist, could violate that provision and unlawfully have in his -- and knowingly have in his possession in the drugstore obscene material, but this is what the brief amicus curiae raises and they talk about the right of a person to read being violated under the Constitution. 
    Well, under your Roth case you held that the Constitution doesn't protect obscenity in any respect. 
    The right to read and they said the right of privacy, and that's getting back to having books in your private library. 
    If under the Roth case the Constitution doesn't protect the collection of obscenity, then I say that you can't have them in your private library either or that there's no constitutional guarantee that that can be done.

    The only cases, Your Honors, perhaps I should say that I didn't cover the field in this issue, beyond what my experience has been as a prosecutor in prosecutions brought under this statute. 
    Now we've had a number of them, where individuals are found in possession of obscene material on their person. 
    They're perhaps in a car, a defendant in a car; the police are searching him for something else and they come upon a lot of obscene material. 
    That person is charged under this statute. 
    Now, my experience on it is limited to the cases of the type where they're walking around with the material and have an opportunity to disseminate the contents of it. 
    I had cases where the officers come upon it in searching an individual may be quite an amount of it that is in their automobile.

    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    Well, 2905.37 reads that, Sections 2905.33 to 2905.36, which of course, would include 2905.34, do not affect teaching in regularly chartered medical colleges, the publication of standard medical books, or regular practitioners of medicine or druggists in their legitimate business, nor do they affect the publication and distribution of bona fide works of art. 
    Well now, that is a reasonable classification, in the sense that 2905.34, so long as 2905.34 is not contravened, for example, it says a druggist in his legitimate business. 
    Now, nobody could hold or argue that it is the legitimate business of a druggist to knowingly possess obscene materials.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5739.142" stopTime="5753.605">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose that exemption is directed toward the part of the other statute that makes anything for the prevention of conception, the possession of anything for the prevention of conception, a criminal offense.

    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    I suppose, Your Honor. 
    There are other provisions in 2905.34 with which this case isn't concerned. 
    We have one portion of the statute under which she was charged, and it's quite a lengthy statute to begin with, and it covers various other matters. 
    However, I still say that this 2905.37 would not exempt a druggist from 2905.34 if he knowingly had in his possession obscene materials.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5788.740" stopTime="5808.020">
    Justice John M. Harlan

    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    No, it would not, Your Honor, because the very end of that statute says "whose demonstrated purpose does not contravene Sections 2905.06 through 2905.34." 
    That's the qualification, there, even if she belonged to a bona fide association of artists.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5835.681" stopTime="5841.594">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I don't know what those other sections define.

    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    Even if she belonged to the — if it was for the advancement of art, it cannot be held to contravene, I mean, there's no exemption if it contravenes 2905.34. 
    There were several other issues in this case, such as that the sentence of the court, that the sentence is unconstitutional. 
    Under the laws of Ohio, a sentence is not for a definite term, and in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio, the statute controlling that is mentioned. 
    For example, a crime -- a statute may call for a penalty of one to seven years, grand larceny calls for that. 
    The court doesn't sentence the defendant for one year or for two years or for seven years and they've been arguing all the way up through the courts of Ohio that this defendant has been sentenced for seven years, which is not a fact. 
    The court merely sentences for an indefinite term. 
    In other words, they sentence to the Ohio State Penitentiary, sentence to the Ohio State Reformatory, or I sentence you to the Ohio State Reformatory for Women, in this case, which means this that the statute provides for a minimum of one and a maximum of seven, but after serving the minimum, the defendant can come up for consideration for parole, and in fact may get out before the --

    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    In other words, on a sentence to the Ohio State Reformatory for Women in this case, the defendant's time could be one year or less a month; in other words, she's put in eleven months. 
    If that -- all rests with the Ohio Pardon and Parole Commission, under the laws of Ohio, as to how long a defendant will put in time, that is except in first degree murders, so that there's nothing cruel and unusual about the punishment in this case. 
    There's a minimum of a year and a maximum of seven.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But in your State -- is your State like other states, some other states, where they have an indeterminate sentence law that when they are sentenced they are sentenced for the maximum until the parole board --

    But in my State when they go for the indeterminate sentence under the indeterminate sentence law, the sentence is for the maximum until they do have that hearing and fix it at a lower number of years.
speaker="gertrude_bauer_mahon" startTime="6088.742" stopTime="6091.545">
    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    The sentence includes that?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6091.545" stopTime="6105.192">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No, there's nothing said about it, but that is the statutory interpretation of it. 
    I don't know that it makes a great deal of difference, I was just wondering.
speaker="gertrude_bauer_mahon" startTime="6105.192" stopTime="6441.037">
    Mr. Gertrude Bauer Mahon 
    Well, of course, I -- it's been my impression that they go to, for example, on the one to seven, or one to ten. 
    For example, we have an armed robbery; the penalty on armed robbery is ten to twenty-five years. 
    Now, under the rules and regulations of the Ohio Pardon and Parole Commission, and depending upon the institution to which the defendant goes, for example the Ohio State Reformatory takes offenders up to thirty, and the penitentiary beyond that, but if the man went to the penitentiary on an armed robbery conviction on a ten to twenty-five, he would put in a minimum of about six and a half years on that ten to twenty-five before he could come up. 
    But at the reformatory, the same person would put in two and a half years on a ten to twenty-five before he's considered. 
    However, there isn't any showing that this punishment provided by this statute is cruel and unusual. 
    It's not an unusual. 
    In fact, it provided for a fine or imprisonment, or both. 
    Now, the court could have fined her in addition to the imprisonment sentence. 
    And they have been claiming in the Supreme Court and in this Court that this woman's sentence that the Court of Appeals refused to review it and that isn't a fact at all. 
    If you'll look at the journal entry of the court, the Court of Appeals journal entry, you'll find that they said, "Upon review of the entire case" and this was one of the issues, that her sentence was cruel and unusual, if you look at the journal entry, they hold that punishment was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the trial court. 
    In other words, that the court, the trial court, had the discretion whether to give her imprisonment or just a fine or both. 
    So there was nothing cruel and unusual in sentencing her. 
    And that really was the -- is to be concluded from the journal entry of the court, because they said they reviewed the entire case. 
    They didn't refuse to review the question of her sentence at all. 
    Your Honors, we believe, the State of Ohio, that we have a right to rely on your decision in the Wolf case and on your decision in the Roth case if there is anything to the doctrine of stare decisis and that we also -- the trial court had a right to rely on the Lindway decision in handling this matter in the trial court, because the Lindway decision is in line with your decision in the Wolf case. 
    And we respectfully submit that there has been no violation of any constitutional right of the defendant in this case on the trial, by reason of there having been no proper search warrant. 
    We feel that that constitutional provision does not cancel out evidence of a criminal offense, or does not constitute a defense to the commission of a crime, whether the evidence is found upon the person or found in the privacy of a home. 
    And I don't think that if this obscene material was found upon her on the street and in her possession and there had been no search warrant, that there would have been any difference in the case. 
    In other words, if she had been searched on the street and all this obscene material was found, the constitutional provision against unreasonable search and seizure also goes to the person as well as the home and the fact that it was found in her home without a search warrant or a proper one, and on that issue, I want to correct something that I just remember Mr. Kearns told you, that the prosecutor promised on the trial of this case that she produce a search warrant. 
    That isn't so at all, and it's not even in the record. 
    He had as much right, if he doubted that there was any --what this Lieutenant White had, he had as much right to bring Lieutenant White in on subpoena as the State and it wasn't incumbent on the State to offer any search warrant as an exhibit, as an element of the crime to be proven. 
    And that is why, on the authority, in fact, in view of the Lindway decision, that's why the court overruled the motion to suppress the evidence.

    They talk about twelve police officers being there and surrounding the place and making the search. 
    But the only officers who turned up with this evidence were Sergeant Delau and the patrolman who testified in this case. 
    They had nothing to do with obtaining a search warrant. 
    When the defendant requested -- told them to get one, the officers said they waited and that Lieutenant White came out there. 
    They thought he had a search warrant.

   Rebuttal of A. L. Kearns

    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Do I have --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6509.489" stopTime="6514.712">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, you have some time left, I think, Mr. Kearns.
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="6514.712" stopTime="6677.652">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    To answer the question that was asked pertaining to our Supreme Court's ruling, on page 13 of our brief, our Supreme Court has said, “Under our statute as now worded, mere possession is forbidden even where the possessor does not have a purpose of again looking at the books or pictures; and, in the instant case, the jury could have found the defendant guilty and she could have been, as she was, sentenced as a felon, even though it believed her evidence that she had innocently acquired possession of these articles, had no intention of ever looking at them again and was merely keeping them pending instructions for their disposition from their owner and then they cite cases from this Court. 
    Now, the charge of the court to the jury, that portion of it is found on page 65 of our record. 
    Number three; that the defendant had in her possession and under her control the books, pictures and photographs mentioned in the indictment. 
    'Possession' means the act or state of detaining a thing. 
    It is the act of holding or keeping it. 
    Now, such detention does not mean that it is necessary always to have in one's sight the thing possessed. 
    For example, one who deposits articles in a place of concealment may still be deemed to have them in his possession. 
    To have something under one's control is to have the present right and power to do with it as one wills. 
    So that the court actually told the jury that under the language of this statute the defendant in this cause was guilty. 
    Now, a question arises as to what should she have done with these things after she discovered that they were improper things to have in her possession. 
    Now, our statute, Section 2909.01, reads as follows --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6677.652" stopTime="6679.760">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    We'll recess now Mr. -- We'll recess now.

    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    A question arose as to what this defendant-appellant could have done with these -- this material after she found them. 
    Now, we have Section 2909.01 of the Ohio statute which reads as follows, "No person shall maliciously destroy or injure property not his own. 
    Whoever violates this Section shall be in prison not less than one nor more than seven years if the value of the property destroyed or the injury done is $100 or more.” 
    So, that this being --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6735.366" stopTime="6742.016">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I suppose -- I suppose she could've called it to the attention of the police, couldn't she?
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="6742.016" stopTime="6750.707">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Well, if she called it to the attention of the police, she would still be in possession under this statute.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6750.707" stopTime="6753.071">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, (Inaudible)
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="6753.071" stopTime="6942.058">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    And -- and if the police were of the type that they were and doing the things that they did they usually do in Cuyahoga County using their badges as supreme authority, they would have done the same thing by prosecuting her. 
    I want to just say a word or two in the language of our judges. 
    Now, in the opinion of Judge's Taft, Bell, Herbert and Peck, the portion of Section 2905.34, Revised Code upon which defendant's conviction was based, now this is the majority opinion, is constitutionally invalid and for that reason, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed. 
    However, Section 2 of Article IV of the Constitution of Ohio reads in part, “No law shall be held unconstitutional and void by the Supreme Court without the concurrence of at least all, but one of the judges except in the affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, declaring a law unconstitutional and void.” 
    Now, I just want to say a word about the reading from the dissenting opinion of our Judge Herbert of the Supreme Court. 
    And he says, although I concur in paragraphs one and three of the syllabus, I must dissent from paragraph 2 which follows State versus Lindway, 131 Ohio State, page 166 and the judgment. 
    The facts are sufficiently stated in the majority opinion. 
    Section 14 Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides the right of the people to be secured on their persons, houses, papers and possessions against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation particularly describing the place to be searched and the person and things to be seized. 
    The judgment in the Lindway case is not in conflict with this constitutional provision. 
    Had I been a member of this Court at that time, I would have joined in the judgment as all the members of the Court tended because the evidence there clearly established that the defendant was operating a bomb manufacturing shop in the basement of that house. 
    As stated by Judge Jones in the concurring opinion in that case.

    The relevance that it has to our point --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- State -- State constitutional provision.
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="6951.075" stopTime="6954.678">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    State constitutional provision as well as the Federal constitutional provision.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6954.678" stopTime="6958.048">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You are reading from that. 
    I thought the State --
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="6958.048" stopTime="6974.703">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    I was reading from the State constitutional provision as same as Section -- practically a copy of our own federal constitutional provision which is the same that the people be secured in their homes against unlawful search and seizure.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6974.703" stopTime="6982.358">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes, but you are reading what the Supreme Court has held with reference to its own State constitutional provisions.
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="6982.358" stopTime="6985.460">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Not that they held. 
    This is the dissenting opinion Your Honor --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well --

    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    -- reading the State constitutional provision which is identical with the federal constitutional provision as to unlawful search and seizure. 
    But I just want to show this Court --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="7000.171" stopTime="7025.247">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That doesn't -- that doesn't reach the question that you ask about several times. 
    That is assume that -- what is assumed which would be illegal on the Federal Constitution, what you do with the Wolf case, you said that did not justify holding it unconstitutional to admit evidence that is the result of the search has been made.
speaker="a_l_kearns" startTime="7025.247" stopTime="7075.161">
    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    Well, we feel that in the Wolf case, this Court did not intend to make it a general matter or proposition of that sort because of the fact that there are such exceptions where as in the Lindway case, where there is real criminality, where there is violation of law knowingly, intentionally and profitably as in the case. 
    In this case, shall we be -- have our constitutional rights denied, wouldn't we do not violate the law except probably looking at or reading for the mental state the wrong type of literature?

    Mr. A. L. Kearns 
    I think it does. 
    Here, we have a situation if it please the Court, where there was absolutely no intent to violate the law where the public could not be injured. 
    We were speaking of the damage that narcotics might be cause by having possession. 
    That's a matter of health. 
    That's a matter of the body. 
    Here, we are trying to control the American mind as to what they shall read and what they shall not to look at.

    The -- we -- that's -- I -- I can't say definitely Your Honor. 
    I -- I'm very sorry, but I don't have all of the facts in the case, just the conclusions that I reached came through upon that. 
    Though I want to thank the Court very, very much for the opportunity of appearing before you.
