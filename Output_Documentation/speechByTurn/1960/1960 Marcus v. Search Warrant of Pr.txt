    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 225, William Marcus et al., Appellants, versus Search Warrant of Property at 104 East Tenth Street, Kansas City, Missouri, et al. 
    Mr. Glazer.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="29.437" stopTime="312.144">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is an appeal from a decision of the -- of Missouri Supreme Court. 
    And it presents the questions of the -- literally of this Missouri scheme for dealing with the seizure of alleged obscene material raising the question whether the Missouri statutes, in allowing the seizure of alleged obscene material prior to any judicial determination, that the material is in fact obscene, whether or not that constitutes a violation of the freedom of speech and press clauses of the Federal Constitution and whether the application of the Missouri statutes by allowing police officers to go forth under a general warrant authorizing them to go to six distributors of publications and seize all obscene matter, and to describe as all obscene matter, whether that also is an unconstitutional violation of the freedom of speech and press clause. 
    The other question presented is whether or not the publications condemned in this particular case or ever condemned by a constitutional test of obscenity. 
    Now, this Court has noted -- has postponed the jurisdictional question to the hearing on the merits. 
    And the first -- I shall first get into the statutory scheme and then the particular facts to this case and then discuss the jurisdictional question. 
    The statutes involved, they are set forth on page 35 of appellants' brief. 
    Section 542.380 of the Missouri statutes provide that upon a complaint under oath by -- in writing an essence to a judge that certain scribed property is being kept that the judge, if he finds reasonable grounds, may issue a search warrant for the described property. 
    And then, the Section further provides, at paragraph (1) that ceratin gambling paraphernalia might be seized, we're not concern with that. 
    And in paragraph (2), which is set out on page 36, it provides that obscene articles which were kept for the purposes of sale distribution or circulation may be seized. 
    Then in paragraph (3), another part, we're not concern with here, it deals with contraceptive devices. 
    In paragraph (4), which has an incidental bearing on the case, it -- it allows not only the seizure of say obscene material but any material used to manufacture say this -- any alleged obscene material. 
    The other provisions of the statutes provide that the warrant shall describe the articles to be seized and that the person from whom the article is seized shall have notice, that the officer who seizes the material shall retain in his possession until after a hearing and that the judge issuing a warrant shall hold a hearing to determine whether or not these items should be seized. 
    Now, in addition -- now and then finally if, after a hearing, these items are found to be obscene, their destruction may be ordered or they may be held for purposes of criminal prosecution and then the destruction ordered.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Under subparagraph (4), I suppose a printing press could be seized at the State.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="315.643" stopTime="573.746">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I think that's broad enough to include a printing press if it was manufacturing alleged obscene material. 
    Now, in addition to the statutory scheme, the Missouri Supreme Court has promulgated rules under the Missouri Constitution. 
    It has that right providing the rules only deal works as procedure. 
    Now, it has promulgated Rule 33, and it's -- which is set out on page 38 of the appellants' brief. 
    Under this rule, it set -- it sets forth requirements of a complaint for a search warrant. 
    And it says that a -- such a complaint may issue if -- if there is, in certain premises, personal property, if -- whose seizure is authorized by statute. 
    And it provides two conditions under which such a complaint may issue. 
    Number one, if the complaint is verified under oath and it states fact positively and not upon information and belief, the judge must issue a search warrant. 
    However, if it states evidential facts, then the judge must find probable cause. 
    Now, in the -- in this particular case, the facts are these. 
    It goes back to 1957. 
    And on October the 8th, 1957, a police officer went to the wholesale distributor, and he spoke to the wholesale distributor and apparently must have looked over what the wholesale distributor, what sort of magazines this distributor was -- was distributing this entire stock. 
    This distributor was the principle magazine distributor in -- in Greater Kansas City. 
    Then on October the 9th, he went to the five retail newsstands involved. 
    And on each of the five newsstands, he purchased one magazine. 
    Now, it so happens that there were -- he purchased actually three different magazines in all. 
    In other words, there were some duplications of -- of what he purchased. 
    Then on the next day, he went and he filed a complaint. 
    And that complaint -- they are all alike, and it was stipulated that they are all alike except for differences in name, and that complaint is set out on page two of the record. 
    Now, all that complaint states is that on October the 10th, 1957, the police officer, and -- he describes the premises. 
    There is no argument about the description on the premises being alright. 
    That certain persons have kept, and this complaint goes -- follows the wording of the Missouri statute, Section 542.380, have kept for the purposes of selling, publishing, exhibiting and giving away obscene books, and then it goes -- follows the entire wording of the statute obscene, lewd, licentious, indecent and lascivious books. 
    That's all the complaint state -- stated and that was -- each of the six complaints were identical except they had different descriptions of the new -- of the newsstand and wholesale distributor to be searched. 
    But they all describe what was being possessed in the same general terms of obscene. 
    Then, he presented this to the -- a trial judge in the Circuit Court of Jackson County. 
    The judge heard no evidence. 
    He presented no magazines to the judge. 
    All he presented to the judge were these complaints. 
    So, the judge --

    Yes. 
    The wholesale distributor was also searched.

    What are they -- what do they distribute?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="581.364" stopTime="585.662">

    They distribute all types of magazines to the Greater Kansas City area.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Newspapers?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="587.389" stopTime="592.180">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    The record doesn't show whether they distribute newspapers, Your Honor. 
    They distribute -- I know --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="592.180" stopTime="593.630">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    (Voice Overlap) -- know the conventional magazine?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="593.630" stopTime="722.899">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Yes, lifetime -- any -- they distribute salary-composed -- I mean, those were in seized, but they distribute it. 
    Now, whether they also distributed some types of newspapers, I do not know, and the record doesn't indicate. 
    This is the major magazine distributor in Kansas City. 
    Now, then, the judge, just acting on these complaints, issued the search warrant, which is set out on page three of the record. 
    And this search warrant was directed not to the police officer, this is little wired thing, not to the police officer who even filed the complaint and who had visited the newsstand, that was directed to any peace officer. 
    And the -- the search warrant recites that whereas this complaint had been filed alleging that there are obscene material at these various places and there -- that -- and actually issued a separate search warrant for each place, that the -- and -- and whereas he found probable cause, therefore, he -- he commands any peace officer to execute the warrant by day or night. 
    It actually was executed in the daytime and to seize all -- all the obscene material at these various premises. 
    In other words, what he does is he adopts the language of the complaint in essence. 
    Now, pursuant to the search warrants, the police, in the Sheriff's office in Kansas City, went to these five magazine -- retail magazine distributors and the one wholesale distributor and seized various magazines. 
    Apparently, the search at the -- at the retail distributors last about a -- and seizure lasted about an hour and a half and at the wholesaler, about three -- three hours.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did your challenge is to the search or to the warrant or the what?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="727.303" stopTime="762.806">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Our -- my -- our challenge is to the -- is number one is to the statute on its face as being unconstitutional. 
    And number two, it goes to the application of the statute in allowing, it's sort of an alternate challenge, in allowing such a general seizure. 
    In other words, assuming that the statute could be constitutional, it certainly cannot be constitutional if -- if you allow him to go out and just seize all obscene books without making any effort whatsoever to describe it.

    Does the statute do that --

    The --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="767.405" stopTime="769.799">

speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="769.799" stopTime="776.596">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    No, the statute on its face does not do that. 
    I don't think the statute on its face does not do that.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="776.596" stopTime="782.085">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Then what's the matter with the statute on its terms?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="782.085" stopTime="834.128">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    On its face, you have this problem. 
    If you don't consider the construction of it by the Missouri Supreme Court -- the statute, if I am operating a newsstand and I am selling magazines and tabloid newspapers, the statute says that a -- if somebody files a complaint and yet interpret the statute and the rule together just a general complaints stating positively that I have obscene material on my premises that the police can go out there and seize what they wish.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="834.128" stopTime="847.505">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Can he? 
    I thought that Section 542.390 required the warrant specifically to describe the place to be searched and the thing to be seized. 
    Am I wrong about that?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="847.505" stopTime="866.316">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    It -- it's -- it does so state that. 
    But the Missouri Supreme Court has interpreted the statute to -- to mean that if you allege that there are obscene publications on the premises that that's sufficient.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="866.316" stopTime="878.958">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, that's getting into the second question maybe, as to whether there are something wrong with the statute as applied. 
    But as to the statute on its face, my question was, what's the matter with it?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="878.958" stopTime="980.772">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, assuming you had -- let's -- let's go a little backwards. 
    Suppose you had a -- a search warrant, like in the Kingsley Books case in which -- in the Kingsley Book case, there was a complaint and pendent to the complaint was these 12 booklets under the general description of "Nights of Horror". 
    Okay, under -- under Kingsley Books, you have a situation that you can -- this Court said you can restraint the distribution of -- of "Nights of Horror" by issue -- by issuing a temporary injunction, but the Court didn't say, ?You can go out and seize it.? 
    It left open the question whether or not suppose I am -- I don't -- I don't agree with the -- the prosecuting attorney, I don't agree with the police. 
    I think I've got something important to say. 
    And if I'm in New York, and they have this restraining order, and they come out, and they inventoried my stock, and I think I've got something to say, I can still go and say it. 
    I mean, nobody says I can't say it now. 
    I maybe subject to contempt punishment for doing it, but I still have the right to go out and sell these books or give them away. 
    But in Missouri, they -- they don't give me that option. 
    They go out there and they seize these books prior to any determination that they are in fact obscene. 
    In New York, you cannot seize the books until after the judicial hearing. 
    And that's why I say the statue is void on its face.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, the Court didn't treat with the damage you did, did it, on page 121 of the record, the plea with your First Amendment claim with reference to the test of obscenity? 
    But all other constitutional claims, if they treat with, as raised by you, relate to the State Constitution and law, isn't that true?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="1233.365" stopTime="1402.600">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    No. 
    On -- on page -- we start off on page 118 where we -- the Court, it goes into the question and bound paragraph of 118 in the record where it says, The appellants charge that these statutes, and the court rule, are violative of their constitutional rights under the First Amendment. 
    Then, they compare the Missouri procedure with -- they talked about Near versus Nebraska -- Minnesota and then they compare the Missouri procedure with the procedure in New York. 
    And incidentally, it doesn't show in this particular printed record but on the page 119 in the sixth lines from the bottom, it says the constitutionality of the penal obscenity statutes was -- was attacked in the Becker case. 
    The original opinion written by division number two of Supreme Court said the constitutionality of these obscenity statutes were attacked in the Becker case. 
    And we pointed out in err that they were in error that the -- this statute wasn't involved in the Becker case. 
    They changed it. 
    So, then, they go on, on 119, and talked about our contention that we have a right -- we argue we had a right to circulate this matter prior to a judicial determination that the matter was obscene. 
    And they go on there and compare our situation with the Kingsley Books case and say, well, the Kingsley Books -- when -- when this Court upheld the Kingsley Books case, then in essence upheld a Missouri statute, and that the only difference is between Missouri law and New York law is a difference in -- in degree. 
    That -- we are all dealing is with the Missouri provides with a hearing from five to 20 days after the seizure, and New York provides for a hearing with one day after seizure and a decision two days after the hearing. 
    Now, I think, there, it's clear that the Missouri Supreme Court considered this to be an attack on the statutes and the rule on its face.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    No, here's what, at 124, it says with respect to probable cause, the separate complaints by applications for the search warrant which were sworn to by the lieutenant of the Kansas City Police Department represented the Circuit Court by the police lieutenant and assistant prosecutor of Jackson County. 
    The complainants swore to the facts of his own knowledge and the Court made a finding, there was a probable cause to believe the allegations in the complaint to be true and that there was probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. 
    Supreme Court Rule 3301 further defines the statutory procedure and provides that the judicial officer shall issue a warrant if the complaint is verified and supported by affidavits stating evidential facts for which such judge or magistrate authorizes the -- magistrate determines the existence of probable cause.

    Problem number one is the issue of -- in other words, the problem as to what the Court that -- that this statute doesn't require any preliminary finding by a court that there are obscene matters at a certain premise. 
    Problem number two is the fact, assuming the Court has found a probable cause for certain (Inaudible) for the issuance of the search warrant, it's our position that the executing officer should more or less -- the administerial officer shouldn't have any discretion to see if anything which he, himself, feels fits the general description of obscene, in other words, whereas obscene maybe be a perfectly good standard for a court when it's operating in the framework of a trial in determining whether to condemn a book or not.

    Yes. 
    Thank you.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2903.875" stopTime="3208.416">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Now, to sum up in -- in reference to this case, the major distinctions between this case and the Kingsley Books case, in Kingsley, there is a -- injunction is issued but no books were seized prior to any hearing. 
    Kingsley applies -- allows an injunction against a specific publication. 
    There was no general prohibition against a sale of books and Kingsley was sustained in comparison with a criminal statute. 
    And the Court taken a pragmatic view state -- holding there is little difference between Kingsley in the ordinary criminal statute. 
    In essence, the person still would have the right to circulate prior to a determination that the publications were obscene. 
    And in Kingsley, the Courts specifically pointed out there was no restraint upon matters not yet found obscene. 
    Now, the other question in this case is this, it's our position that a proper test of obscenity was never applied to the publications in this case. 
    The Court found some obscene and found others not obscene. 
    It's our position that the trial judge applied a test judging the effect on the susceptible person rather than the average person, and in essence, did what this Court said shouldn't be done primarily in the Butler versus Michigan case and then subsequently in the Roth -- in Alberts case. 
    The trial judge's opinion is set forth on page 81 of the printed record. 
    In that opinion, the trial judge, on page 83 says, ?What test must be applied?? 
    and he quotes form several Missouri cases and quotes from the State versus Becker case which we have set out in -- in the appendix to out -- to appellants' brief and that is set forth on page 41 of the appendix, the earlier opinion in -- in the Missouri Supreme Court in State versus Becker. 
    And all these tests and the test of the trial jury are set forth on page 84, our test which, in essence, judged the obscenity on the basis of what effect the book or publication has in the susceptible. 
    And then after applying this test, the trial judge concludes that certain of these publications were obscene, and concludes and says on page 85, "A judgment has been entered this day in conform -- in conformity with the views expressed herein." 
    Then, on page 91 and 92 is the judgment and the -- in the judgment, the trial judge said that the various publications listed in the schedule which he found were obscene -- were obscene within the meaning and intent of Mo. Rev. Stat., 542.380. 
    Now, on appeal, we contended -- we contended that the Becker case was not in line with Roth and Kingsley Book -- of Roth and the Butler case. 
    The Missouri Supreme Court differed with us and said -- and now, the Becker case sets forth a proper constitutional standard of obscenity. 
    It -- it relied on pouring on the fact that in the Roth case, the Becker case was cited in the footnote as applying the proper test of obscenity. 
    We think that any reasonable reading of the Becker case indicates that it adopted the susceptible person test.

    Well, in -- in the Butler case, this Court struck down a statute which allowed a -- a judge to mull a conviction to stand on the effect on -- of a publication on youth.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3266.227" stopTime="3285.510">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I suppose an argument is strong -- an argument could be made to the fact that if obscene books do an injury to the public by reason to their effect on the person, probably, the one that would mostly -- mostly the protection from would be the effect on the susceptible.

    No, I'll touch back on the -- another jurisdictional question. 
    I thought -- you see, in this particular case, the State didn't oppose jurisdiction, so I sort of had assume what the jurisdictional question was troubling the Court. 
    And in view of Mr. Justice Whittaker's questions, I thought that was the prime question troubling the Court. 
    Another question which troubled me somewhat is -- is this problem of -- here, the Court has said some of these -- one of our objections was whether or not these books could be seized prior to a judicial determination that the books were obscene or not obscene. 
    Well, now, we've had a hearing and so that -- that's somewhat worried me, say, well, don't we have a situation or perhaps the -- your complaint is -- is sort of moot. 
    But I think in -- in an analysis of this Missouri statute, is such that it can't be separated. 
    In other words, this entire Missouri statutory scheme rest on a seizure and the only basis or the only jurisdiction for the -- for Missouri to condemn these books is if these books are seized. 
    So, it's our position if the -- if the seizure itself is illegal that the entire scheme would fall.

   Argument of Fred L. Howard
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="3633.116" stopTime="3679.901">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In view of the question of jurisdiction here and the way it is related to the third point in these briefs which has to do with the test applied by the trial court and determine the issue of obscenity, I would like to consider those two matters somewhat together. 
    As far as jurisdiction is concern, it appears to me first, that there is in fact no substantial federal issue involved here on the question of the statutory scheme itself. 
    It is a contention of the State that those questions have been resolved against appellant by the decision of this Court in Kingsley Books.

    Now, the third point --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3724.432" stopTime="3729.961">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Would you agree that problem of general warrant is in this case?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="3729.961" stopTime="3732.168">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    I'm not at all sure that it is, Your Honor --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3732.168" stopTime="3733.022">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well --
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="3733.022" stopTime="3933.307">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    -- and which I will get to in a minute if I may. 
    The third point in both of the briefs has to do with the issue are the test used by the trial court in determining the issue of the obscenity of the magazine's publications before the trial court. 
    I submit that that issue is not properly before this Court. 
    It was not properly before the Supreme Court of Missouri, and the Supreme of Missouri pointed that out. 
    Now, this case was tried in the trial court before the judge alone without a jury. 
    In such circumstances in Missouri, the appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri is in effect de novo on both the law and the evidence. 
    The exhibits were before the Supreme Court of Missouri. 
    The Supreme Court of Missouri specifically announced that it had examined those exhibits, that it had applied the test for obscenity as set out by this Court in the Roth case. 
    And that applying such test to the exhibits, at the Supreme Court, determined that they were obscene. 
    Consequently, the judgment of the trial court was not clearly erroneous, and it would not be reversed. 
    Now, remember in this procedure, the trial court in Missouri makes findings of fact and conclusions of law only when specifically requested. 
    There was no such request in this case, but the trial court did write an opinion which in effect was fortuitous and which, under the practice of Missouri, has no binding effect upon any other court. 
    It is absolutely surplusage. 
    The Supreme Court of Missouri pointed that out in its opinion that they were not, in any way, concerned with that that the appeal is not from the opinion of the trial court, the appeal is from the judgment entered by the trial court. 
    That judgment appears in the record, the pertinent party is on page 92. 
    And if I may paraphrase it in an effect says that we have examined the exhibits and find that they are obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent -- obscene, lewd, licentious, indecent, lascivious, immoral and scandalous within the meaning of the statute here involved. 
    That was the judgment and that's what the appeal was from. 
    The question on what test he used actually was not important after these matters were looked at by the Supreme Court of Missouri because under these circumstances, if the Supreme Court had said, You are right, the trial court used a wrong test of what they have done. 
    If they'd reversed the decision, they would reverse it and said to the trial court, Your decision first was wrong because of the opinion you wrote, because of the test you used. 
    But your result was right, therefore, your judgment is vacated but you enter the self -- same judgment again." 
    That's the only thing they could have done when they determine by looking at the evidence and by applying the test for obscenity that these matters were in fact obscene and that the judgment of the Court was not erroneous. 
    So, it would have been an entirely useless purpose for that matter to have been considered. 
    Now, if --

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    I believe that that question is not before you, Your Honor.

    And therefore, it would seem to me that that issue is not before this Court.

    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="4123.720" stopTime="4193.868">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    -- because in considering the Becker case, the Missouri Supreme Court, and I'm reading from 100 -- page 110 of the record. 
    This is the divisional opinion but the divisional opinion was adopted in October by the Court en banc, so it's the same thing. 
    It appears twice in the record. 
    The Supreme Court, in referring to the Becker case, quoted the test used in the Becker case, as these questions have been considered and tested objectively as to the effect of these publications in their entirety upon persons of average human instincts. 
    They say that that test, as set out in Becker, is compatible and in effect the same as the test this Court set out in Roth which the Missouri Supreme Court paraphrased as being that the standard by which obscenity is tested is ?whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole, appears to prurient interest."

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And the Missouri Supreme Court said that the Becker standard was comparable to that from Roth and even if the matter was before the Court that the trial court did not earn relying on Roth.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    That's right, of the Supreme Court of Missouri, yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, as I have said, the -- the fact issue of obscenity had not been pressed by the appellant here and therefore, I submit that we are -- this case now I stands in the posture that the exhibits -- the matter seized are to be considered as having finally determined to the obscene under the test laid down by this Court in the Roth case. 
    And that the questions here at issue should be determined on that basis. 
    Now, the appellants contend that there has been, under the Missouri statute, an unconstitutional previous restraint upon their rights of freedom of press, apparently, is based primarily on the fact that under the statute, pardon me, the search warrant issues on the application of the -- in this case the police officer who swore to that search warrant as a matter of his own knowledge. 
    The Court found that the facts so sworn to were sufficient to establish probable cause. 
    The search warrant was issued. 
    The search was made. 
    The publications here we had books, we had magazines, we had pamphlets, we had just plain photographs and packages. 
    Those matters were seized and brought before the Court. 
    The Court issued its notice of hearing when required to be set not less than five nor more than 20 days after the date of the seizure and then return on the matter seized into the Court. 
    At that hearing, the person from whom they were seized, in this case, the book seller or anyone else who claims an interest may come in and contest the fact of obscenity and ask the books to be return to whoever had the right to them under their claim. 
    The Court passes upon the issue of obscenity in an expeditious manner. 
    And if they are determined to be obscene, orders them destroyed or held for evidence if necessary in a prosecution and then destroyed. 
    If the Court determines they are not obscene, they are returned to the owner, in this case, the book seller.

    I do not believe, and, in fact, the search warrant is subject to that criticism for these reasons. 
    There are, of course, two types of search warrants. 
    One says you will go out and seize a specific item which will be described as a -- the January issue of Playboy or a black and white 1967 Chevrolet of a certain serial number or whatever it maybe. 
    There are also other types of search warrants recognized in the law which are not, for a specific item, but for R4A described class of items. 
    In other words, you go out and seize all alcoholic beverages found at the place described. 
    You go out and seize gambling equipment found at the place described, you go out and seize whatever is described and whether you find one or three or five that it orders the officers to seize that.

    As I was saying there -- there are, I believe, two recognized types of search warrants.

    The warrants in this case were worded in the wording of the statute, that is, obscene, lewd, lascivious -- obscene, lewd, licentious, indecent, lascivious are of an indecent, immoral or scandalous character.

    Your Honor, the statute on that, I have it here, I believe, marked. 
    The statute Section 542.390 says that the warrant shall describe the place to be searched or the thing to be seized as nearly as may be. 
    Now, it seems to me that the description, as I have read, in the wording of the statute, in the case like this, does, in fact, describe I think as nearly as may be. 
    Now, further -- and which has been inactive since the inaction of that statute, Missouri Supreme Court Rule 33.01 paragraph (b), which is set out on page 39 of appellants' brief in this Court provides that the search warrant issued must contain a description of a personal property to be searched for and seized and the description of the place to be searched in sufficient detail and particularity to enable the officers serving the warrant to readily ascertain and identify the same.

speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5423.050" stopTime="5428.978">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    In other words, you say that the exercise of discretion by the police officer and determine what he is going to seize is to be a thorough --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5428.978" stopTime="5430.604">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is in effect -- is the -- is --
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5430.604" stopTime="5433.040">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Is the due process hearing.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5433.040" stopTime="5462.199">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm suggesting that the judgment that he's allowed to exercise under such a procedure, is that which comes at the end of a criminal trials in open court contest, pro and con, examination of witnesses, lawyer's objections, lawyer's argument etcetera, etcetera. 
    And so I said that that complicated process of a trial is all lodged in the judgment of the police officer making the search, isn't that right?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5462.199" stopTime="5474.656">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    I would beg to disagree with Your Honor on that point for this reason. 
    It seems to me that the action of the individual in determining whether or not the action he takes is criminal.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5474.656" stopTime="5476.726">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He must forecast what is going to happen in the trial.
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5476.726" stopTime="5478.211">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Forecast what is going to happen. 
    And --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5478.211" stopTime="5478.702">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I know but --
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5478.702" stopTime="5493.367">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    -- in order to protect his constitutional rights at that point, he is entitled to a statute which is definite enough to satisfy the requirements of due process. 
    And my point is that that test --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5493.367" stopTime="5493.823">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But he isn't --
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5493.823" stopTime="5495.706">

    -- as applied there.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5495.706" stopTime="5503.007">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that suggesting of his or that forecasting of his is put to the test by giving him a day in court.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5503.791" stopTime="5510.419">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, here, with reference to seizure, he has no day in court, he has merely inaction by the police officer, isn't that right?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5510.419" stopTime="5514.523">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The police officer is only a method of initiating a day in court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5514.523" stopTime="5516.744">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, but the seizure, so far as that seizure is concern.
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5516.744" stopTime="5521.093">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    If the seizure were in -- in and of itself, he would be right, yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5521.093" stopTime="5543.966">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, when those -- when the goods were seized or the material were seized, as Justice Harlan indicated, to that extent, until there is a disposition in a proceeding following, to that extent, he is already put in a position of having withdrawn what he may believe to be illicit good, isn't that true?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5543.966" stopTime="5545.139">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    That is right, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5545.139" stopTime="5558.792">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, in the other thing -- in the -- in the criminal case, he can keep on selling these things until finally a jury comes in and the judgment verdict against them is broad and the verdict is sustained.
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5558.792" stopTime="5568.143">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Well, he can keep on right after that as soon as he pays his fine or serves his sentence and walks out to the door. 
    He can go right back to selling that again, Your Honor. 
    And normally, those who are engaged in such procedure --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5568.143" stopTime="5568.284">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But in --
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5568.284" stopTime="5570.013">

    No, but -- but in the criminal case, he had the opportunity --

    Yes, sir.

    He has no such opportunity as to these particular --

    That's right.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Of course, there is nothing at all to keep him from procuring other copies of the same publication --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, no, no, but --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- then he hasn't been out. 
    The judgment has been vindicated. 
    But if here, in fact, there's been a seizure and subsequently, it is found that the good were not obscene, he has been out of an exercise of free enterprise as to those points -- as to those goods.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    As to those particular volumes, he has been, as you say, unable to distribute those particular volumes during the short interval that --

    And -- and determination of his -- of his -- what he conceives to have been his freedom of action in one case as the result of a process you should have a jury and a judge in this case. 
    It's beyond -- it's -- it's the single judgment of a police officer guided by what he has been instructed is to be deemed obscene or not. 
    That's the wording.
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5657.189" stopTime="5660.878">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Yes, sir. 
    In other words, that -- that initiates the judicial proceeding.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5660.878" stopTime="5664.999">

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5665.095" stopTime="5672.223">

    And 11,000 volume or issues. 
    All the issues presumably that they have to those 280. 
    And of those 280, the Court found that 180 of them were not obscene.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5695.951" stopTime="5709.582">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So he was exercising a rather wide discretion, wasn't he, when he -- when he started to select what was obscene and what was not obscene without any direction from the -- from the Court in the search warrant?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5709.582" stopTime="5732.248">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    He was, Your Honor. 
    And I think that because we are dealing with human beings in the inexact English language that unless the Court is going to say that constitutionally, you can seize only a specifically described item that cannot be mistaken that you have such problems.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    That says to him, "You can't sell any issue of Playboy until we have an adjudication." 
    Now, that's in rem.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5743.505" stopTime="5757.029">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Oh, no, it doesn't say that. 
    That isn't what Kingsley said. 
    It certainly didn't say it except after one or two or four days, whatever it is, until there is a determination which I get to this --
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5757.029" stopTime="5760.618">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Well, now, there was -- there was an injunction pendente lite in that case, if I understand it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5760.618" stopTime="5802.090">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Only after adjudication. 
    There wasn't an injunction. 
    The mayor of a city can't go into court under the New York statute and right away get an injunction pendente lite. 
    That has to be litigated. 
    And the statute provide with -- with an argument of this very problem by saying, "You must get two days notice. 
    The case must come on in forth and the question of -- of a pendente lite injunction is itself litigated and must be determined within four days, so that you got a judicial oversight of this power of restriction. 
    I think I'm right about that, Mr. Howard.
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5802.090" stopTime="5808.307">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Well, I wouldn't say that you weren't, Your Honor, because I think you had something to do with that opinion but --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    At one session of pendente lite?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5821.092" stopTime="5823.406">

    The Court issued on notice --

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5830.153" stopTime="5836.953">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And it's done only by giving four days notice, as I see that. 
    As end of four days, the thing comes on at once.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5837.529" stopTime="5845.810">

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    No, Your Honor, and we trust, Missouri is not a allegedly proceeding either. 
    I think that the difference in time there is of very minor importance. 
    And Missouri statute, of course, operates against the individual publication where --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I ask, Mr. Howard, what was the elapse time until the declaration of a non-obscenity in the 180 distributed?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="5874.280" stopTime="5879.170">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    The same as the other.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    That's right, that's right, Your Honor, in this case. 
    Now, as I mention before, I -- I submit that the reason for the delay was not on -- on the decision of the obscenity issue whereupon the decision of constitutional issues. 
    And there were -- there was time in the brief cases and things like that, I mean, submit briefs which strung it out a lot longer than if they only have the obscenity issue involved. 
    It is the position of the State of Missouri here that the Missouri statutory system is, in fact, comparable to that in Kingsley. 
    There are differences admittedly. 
    Missouri operates in rem upon the publication. 
    The publication is seized, brought before the Court the question of obscenity is determined, and it is disposed of either returned or destroyed. 
    In Kingsley, the -- they operate in personam on the particular individual. 
    They filed a complaint against the bookseller for having the publications listed in the complaint which they allege to be obscene. 
    They proceed to -- to an expeditious determination of the issue of obscenity. 
    If they determined it is obscene, he is enjoined from distributing that -- the books' name.He is also ordered to surrender them for destruction. 
    If he doesn't surrender them, then there is order of seizure to go out and get them and surrender.

    -- but as to obscene literature, as far as I know, it's never been used. 
    Missouri has several statutes that have been entirely ignored for long periods of time.

    In getting more moral, are you?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="6002.765" stopTime="6016.835">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Well, there is getting more uproar about this question, and I think there is getting to be a lot more of what is normally called "obscene literature" that it used to be. 
    If my short span of personal experience has anything to do with it, that is true.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6016.835" stopTime="6018.923">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You do have, I suppose, a criminal statutes.
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="6018.923" stopTime="6022.118">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Yes, we do, Your Honor. 
    There are misdemeanor statutes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6022.118" stopTime="6022.537">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="6022.537" stopTime="6196.374">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    And we have -- in the Becker case, which we were talking about earlier today, was a prosecution under the criminal statute. 
    But I submit that here, the -- one of the important arguments of appellant is that, is the appellants have a constitutional right to engage in the trade of selling obscene literature, and they have a constitutional right not to be interrupted in that trade, not to lose their profits therefrom that the hands of the State of Missouri are tight and that the State of Missouri can only interfere by way of enforcement of the criminal statute. 
    That goes contrary to the pronouncements of this Court that the State is not limited to criminal prosecution in order to protect itself from obscenity and to protect its citizens from obscenity. 
    But the appellants say that they have an absolute right and that that is all that Missouri can do. 
    And that if they consider that it is economically advantageous to them to continue to engage in this business and to run the risk of prosecution that they have a constitutional right to do so. 
    I submit to you that that is not true that they do not have a constitutional right to engage in making a profit out of obscenity, that the State of Missouri does have a right to protect its citizens against the dangers and the evils of obscenity. 
    This Court has said the State is not limited to criminal prosecution. 
    I submit that the statutes of Missouri are a reasonable procedure to protect the citizens of Missouri from the evils of that which this Court has said are not within the scope of the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press from the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Therefore, I believe that the statutes, considered as a whole, are not an unreasonable restraint upon the right of freedom of speech and of the press. 
    And this Court has more than once held that the rights under freedom of speech and of the press are not absolute. 
    They are, in many fields, paramount, I will agree with that. 
    But I do not believe under the holdings of this Court in Roth and Alberts and in Kingsley Books and in the Michigan case and the other cases going clear back the Near versus Minnesota, that such a scheme, as we have here, does not constitute a prior restraint within the constitutional meaning as that phrase is applied to the question of freedom of speech.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible) that before we ever got to those questions, we've got to find that you came and that the State did come into possession of these things under a lawful warrant gauged by the command of the First Amendment, do we not?

    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="6219.205" stopTime="6274.682">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    -- that -- first place, as I have mentioned a minute ago, I submit that this is a lawful warrant subject to the questions and criticisms that has been raised here today. 
    I believe they are with -- without sufficient force to declare it to be void. 
    Second, I believe that after these hearing has been held and a determination has been made that these matters now before the Court, these 100 exhibits are, in fact, obscene and without the protection of the First Amendment, that if you say now, "Well, do you made a mistake back there somewhere?" 
    That does not necessarily mean, first, the statute is unconstitutional or second, that the defendant is entitled to the return of these particular matters.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    For you're in an action in rem on the particular item itself, yes, Your Honor. 
    In other words, we are not dealing here with an action in personam and the use of a search warrant to bring evidence against the person to be used in court or do something against the person. 
    We are dealing here with an action directing at the objects themselves at the disposition of what, in effect, is contraband. 
    And while there may be remedies to the person because those are seized, I do not think that the fact that the search warrant may have been too broad in this instance would necessarily entitle the individual to the return of the contraband.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Oh, wouldn't that be then to judge the validity of the search warrant by the results of the search?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="6343.009" stopTime="6425.859">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    No, I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    I think that it would be to say that even though you judge the search warrant and find it bad that as when you do, in effect, have contraband before the Court that you do not have a right to the return of such contraband. 
    There's a difference there. 
    I may not be making myself clear on the difference, but I believe there is a difference. 
    And I think that that question is not necessarily concluded by the determination of whether or not the search warrant in this case is held good or bad. 
    But, I would want to add that if the search warrant is held bad and whether the consequences this Court holds flow from that, that does not, of course, mean that there is any infirmity in the Missouri statutory scheme. 
    It merely means the execution of that part of it which provides for the initial search warrant was erroneous. 
    And I don't think that issue on the propriety of the wording of the search warrant is determinative of the constitutionality of the Missouri statutory scheme at issue here. 
    There are two separate questions, I believe. 
    And if we assume for the purpose of argument that search warrant was bad that it is -- does not follow that the statutory scheme of Missouri should fall therewith.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    You would not need to reach the latter, and I say it does not follow that the statute is bad. 
    It just means somebody, if you pardon the expression, somebody goofed when they issued the search warrant.

    Isn't it true, as a matter of practice, when these officers went out to execute this warrant and they go to the trial jurors, they take some, they fill out of it, just like sorting apples, isn't it? 
    Now, aren't -- isn't that police officer then operating as his own censor board? 
    What controls him?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="6464.981" stopTime="6478.032">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    What controls him? 
    His knowledge of the English language and what is and is it not within the wording of the warrant which, as I have said, is in the words of obscene, lewd, lascivious etcetera and so forth.

    Now, is that what the law contemplates when it says the warrant shall specifically describe the thing to be seized?
speaker="fred_l_howard" startTime="6494.595" stopTime="6539.668">
    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    I think that that count was in it because the difficulty here is not, to my mind, the lack of description. 
    The difficulty is the fact that the words of the English language convey different meaning to different people. 
    And when you're dealing with the English language and dealing with people, you are subject to that. 
    And either, you are going to say that you must limit the search warrant to a specific item as contrasted to a class of items to be described. 
    I submit that the description -- the words used in this description are within the constitutional limits.

    Mr. Fred L. Howard 
    Your Honor, as to the exhibits that are before the Court, I will urge very strongly that those exhibits are obscene without question. 
    Now, I didn't see the other 180 exhibits that were returned, so I have no comment to make.I can't say anything about those others. 
    Some of them, I understand, were pretty borderline, but the decision was, shall we say, leaned over backwards in favor of being sure that they did not err against the individual, what they erred against the state of the err in that determination at all.

    I believe there was -- I can't remember, Your Honor. 
    There were two or three that did, I think, out of the hundred that did have those stories in them. 
    And of course, I could tell you, Your Honor, if I remember there were other things besides articles by those two authors that were very questionable in those magazines, and I would say whether the article by de Maupassant, for instance, was the cause of what have been declared obscene or whether it was other contents of the magazine. 
    That would be my judgment that that issue was resolved on the basis of the entire content of the magazine not of -- and of course rather than on anyone particular article therein. 
    I have lost complete track of time, Your Honor, but I believe I have covered enough of the points which the State wishes to present. 
    And I submit that there has been no violation of the constitutional rights of the appellants in this case.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Now, just to clear up certain misimpressions that I think appellees' argument might lead to, the Missouri Supreme Court actually did not determine that these magazines were obscene. 
    This can be seen from page 127 of the brief. 
    All the Missouri -- Missouri Supreme Court said is, "The judgment shall not be set aside unless clearly -- clearly erroneous," and then they said, "We do not find the judgment of the trial court to be clearly erroneous in any respect."
