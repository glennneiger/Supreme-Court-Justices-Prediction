Horton v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Emmett Horton, Petitioner, versus Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. 
    Mr. Tonahill.

    Mr. Joe H. Tonahill 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The question involved here is whether the amount of an Industrial Accident Board's award of $1050 which the respondent appeal fixes jurisdiction under the diversity of jurisdiction statute. 
    This case arose in Texas under the Workmen's Compensation Law of Texas. 
    The injured workman Horton filed his claim before the Board and the Board ruled and entered to file award allowing him 30 weeks at $35 a week.He claimed the maximum of 401 weeks but the Board allowed him 30 weeks. 
    On the day of the award, the respondent filed it directly in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas seeking to set aside the Board's award of $1050 and vacating it and holding it for note, claiming jurisdiction under the diversity statute. 
    The petitioner Horton filed a motion to dismiss on the ground the jurisdiction was not present because the amount that the respondent sought to relieve itself of liability for was only $1050 and did not meet the requisite jurisdictional requirement of $10,000 exclusive of interest and cost. 
    Subject to the motion to dismiss, the petitioner Horton filed a counterclaim, a compulsory counterclaim subject to its motion.The trial court dismissed both the main action of respondent and the counterclaim as well on the ground that no jurisdiction attached. 
    Under the Workmen's Compensation Law of Texas Article 8307, Section 5, a party who is dissatisfied with the ruling of the Board has a right to appeal from that award to set that award aside. 
    That's as far as it goes.

    May I ask you, sir? 
    Under your state law on such a proceeding whether it be called an appeal or a plenary suit, what determines the amount in controversy, is it the amount awarded by the Commission or the amount claimed by the employee?

    It should -- it should be the amount awarded by the Commission. 
    They would base their suit on an appeal to the court as to the amount of the Board's award. 
    However, to eliminate two suits, if the Board should award more than $500, they would go ahead into the District Court because the claimant would very likely go into the District Court too. 
    But otherwise, if the Board allowed $200 and the -- and the claimant was willing to be satisfied of that, he wouldn't have to appeal at all.

    The insurer can go the justice court or to the county court or to the District Court because under the state rule -- under the state rule, jurisdiction can be fixed in the highest court because of the highest amount claimed to the highest amount awarded. 
    If the claimant claims more than $1000 or more than $500, the insurance company has the right to go the District Court, that's under the state rule. 
    And -- or they can go into the court where the amount of the award is -- is determined for the -- either the county, the -- the justice, the county or the District Court. 
    But the rule under -- on the federal jurisdiction is not the same because it determined the -- the amount of the award. 
    And that's what they're seeking. 
    That's the pecuniary object of the respondent's suit in coming into the District -- Federal District Court is to relieve itself of that liability. 
    But what the respondent seeks to do is to engraft on the claimant's claim for the maximum benefits before the administrative board. 
    They're seeking to say, "Well, because he had a claim before the Board of $14,035 that gives the federal court jurisdiction under the $10,000 statute."

    Mr. William Vandercreek 
    The diversity court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000 exclusive of interest and cost. 
    Our position is, under federal law, that the matter in controversy in this suit does not exceed more than $10,000. 
    The court below in finding greater jurisdictional amount applied state law. 
    The only cause of action that is possessed by the plaintiff insurer is the right to set aside $1050 award. 
    Under the federal rule, as we understand decisions of this Court, the amount in controversy is said to be the direct and immediate object of the plaintiff's claim for relief.

    I can assure you, I'm not thinking because I'm right in the case. 
    I'm just thinking. 
    That's all.
speaker="william_vandercreek" startTime="1415.211" stopTime="1653.403">
    Mr. William Vandercreek 
    Beg the Court's apology. 
    We claim that the court below, the Fifth Circuit erred in applying a state rule for determining jurisdictional amount rather than a federal rule for determining jurisdictional amount. 
    As I stated, our position is a federal rule is a key to the insurer's cause of action. 
    In this connection, I would like to draw the Court's attention to the case of Booth versus Texas Employers' Insurance Association. 
    This is a state case which the Fifth Circuit said was controlling. 
    Our reason for referring to this case is to show that they apply the mere rule for determining jurisdictional amount which is not based upon the claim for relief asserted by the insurance company in their complaint. 
    But first of all, the record at page 43 of the Fifth Circuit's opinion, they misstate the holding of the Booth case. 
    At page 43 of the record, the Fifth Circuit states that regardless of who brings the suit that the Supreme Court in Texas quite logically held that the amount in controversy is the amount of the claim. 
    With deference to the Fifth Circuit, this statement is totally incorrect, with one exception, I should add. 
    Booth held that the amount in controversy in a suit by employee that says that Board's award was amount as presented in this Court petition without reference to what he had claimed before the Board. 
    Moreover, in suits by the insurance company says that the Board's award where the employee has not claimed a fixed amount before the Industrial Accident Board, the amount in controversy under the state law is the amount of the Board's award. 
    The Booth case at 132 Tex. 252 commented on and said their state rule for determining jurisdictional amount to rule it was implied in this case was mere logical rule in view of the other holdings that the amount in controversy is determined by a plan of court's petition. 
    Now, again, considering what we consider to be the crux of the case upon the object of insurer's claim for relief, the respondent, in his brief, takes the position at page 1, they're seeking to be relieved of a claim liability of $14,035 asserted by court. 
    In a case, as he cites on page 89 are Declaratory Judgement Act cases. 
    We feel that the respondent's position is basically trying to convert his action into a form of declaratory relief saying that he's seeking to get rid of a $14,000 claim. 
    Our position and the reasons why we feel the plaintiff's claim in this suit only involves $1050 or as follows. 
    First of all, the very statute which creates the state cause of action, Texas statute Article 8307, Section 5 gives the party a right to set aside the Board's award. 
    It is not authorized declaratory relief. 
    Secondly, under the Texas statute case as construing the statute, the amount in controversy is not key to the claim before the Board with one exception with the amount involved in the court petition. 
    Moreover, the respondent's pleadings in this very case, he asked if the Board's award would be set aside. 
    He does not seek declaratory relief to avoid paying of $14,035 potential claim. 
    Moreover, the final reason why we feel that his claim only involves $1050 because it's necessary for the employee to come in and counterclaim and when he comes in and counterclaims, the amount that he will recover will depend upon his counterclaim and not what he claimed before the Board.

    I'm afraid it has to go behind the record to explain what's going on in those situations but their suit to set aside, the Board's award was filed in federal court the same day that the Industrial Accident Board came down. 
    We then wanted the state court to file an action in state court. 
    We came back and file a motion to dismiss in federal court or subject to counterclaim. 
    The respondent also filed a plea in abatement to our state court action. 
    The plea in abatement is set out in Appendix C to our main brief. 
    His plea in abatement to prevent the workman from trying his case in state court was based on the fact that their prior filing of a suit in federal court, as this is going a turn into a raise to the courthouse.

    The trouble is the uncertainty at least rises, does it not, from the fact that those references were all to the congestions caused by removals? 
    And Congress dealt in the 1958th Act only with the prohibition of the removal of such cases and did not close the gate against the bringing of plenary suits.

    Mr. William Vandercreek 
    That is true, Your Honor. 
    But Congress also increased the jurisdictional amount, as you recall, from $3000 to $10,000 in an effort to reduce diversity jurisdiction. 
    They prohibit removal expressly according to Senate Report to give the employee a choice. 
    But we oppose as insurance company coming in federal court basing the amount in controversy now upon the right to set aside $1000 award that fits to the potential counterclaim which the employee inserted against them. 
    They're preventing the employee from going into state court which we feel the Senate Report clearly and expressly indicated.

    The Herd case is held because they did not make that request before the Board, that, therefore, it should not raise it for the first time on the appeal de novo because you were dealing with an appeal and is not purely a trial de novo.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I would like to ask you a few questions to -- to disentangled things that I think are being mixed up. 
    No secret that I -- I'm not a hot part of the diversity jurisdiction. 
    But while we've got it, I don't think we can play ducks and drakes with them. 
    In the first place, when you say where you argue abstain that although their jurisdiction should have abstained, you must have in mind that this Court in Winter Haven decided just the opposite but the Court can't refuse to entertain diversity jurisdiction because it seems desirable not to entertain it. 
    So, what you're asking us if you talk about abstention would be to overrule Winter Haven. 
    That's number one. 
    Number two, what I'd like to know is that when Congress talked about original suits in its report, withdrawing removal, did it mean by original suits, a suit like this in which there is a de novo proceeding, but in fact, you're reviewing or going over the ground and indeed, could not begin a suit unless you first went to your Board? 
    I don't know. 
    And that's what I want to know both from you and from respondent's counsel is whether on this Senate Committee, was there a Texas lawyer on the Senate Committee who knew the nice distinction that has been elucidated here, namely, that if a suit de novo in the sense that you can try out everything in the District Court but if the suit de novo which is conditioned on a prior administrative proceeding. 
    Now, all those things have been taken into account not all mixed up like a collage.
speaker="william_vandercreek" startTime="2335.343" stopTime="2416.217">
    Mr. William Vandercreek 
    With reference to your first question on the Winter Haven case, the only case which I could cite back would be Louisiana Power and Light Company versus City of Thibodaux, I certainly grant, Your Honor, that case can be distinguished from the facts in this particular proceeding. 
    So, it won't be any doubt that our position is that there is no federal jurisdiction that the federal jurisdiction will now -- is not present in this controversy. 
    And our abstention theory is purely an alternative and infringement fact, the position, Your Honor. 
    In the Senate Report, as I recall it, there was some comments on Workmen's Compensation Act in which they point that in most States, it is so connected up with the administrative action that the courts do not have original jurisdiction. 
    In the Senate Report, there's -- we're aware of the fact that they didn't have an Industrial Accident Board in Texas, I believe, but they consider it to be an original civil action. 
    There has been no federal case to my knowledge which is expressly considered a problem of whether or not an appeal from the Texas Industrial Accident Board even though it'd be a trial de novo is an original action for purposes of federal jurisdiction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2416.217" stopTime="2447.133">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But what you are really urging, as I understand it, is although Congress specifically used the word "removal", even what is normally so technical term as removed may, in the context of the whole history of this legislation on the report, have a broader meaning, namely, anything that get to the court after it had a beginning in the Workmen's Compensation Board.

    As I've mentioned, I'm sure without going to court, our position is that the respondent is going in -- in federal court.

    That is the workman has asked and filed his case in either federal court or state court. 
    If he files in the state court, it is not removal to the federal court. 
    Now, if the respondent can come into federal court upon the cause of actions, the way he has asserted, it makes a complete nullity of this particular provision.

    We feel that the employee may go into federal court because his cause of action besides being right merely says, "I have Board's award." 
    He could state a claim for $14,035. 
    On the other hand, we say that the only thing facing the insurance company is the $1050 award.Unless, he brings suit to set aside the Board's award that $1050 award becomes binding upon both parties and then the next procedure is, no one gives notice of dissatisfaction within 20 days, the employee can then bring suit on $1050 award for penalty and for attorney's fees but --

    No, I think there could be any -- any removal in reference to your question, Mr. Justice Black. 
    I would take this position on jurisdictional amount. 
    If the Board awards more than $10,000, then for purposes of jurisdictional amount when the insurance company brings the motion to set aside the Board's award, the jurisdictional amount will be present. 
    On the other hand, any time the Board issues an award for less than $10,000, it is our position the suit to set aside the Board's award which is the only right created under state statute possessed by insurance company.

   Argument of Howell Cobb
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="3151.769" stopTime="3272.394">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    May it please the Court. 
    The contention of the respondent here is that when Horton filed his claim before the -- before the Industrial Accident Board of Texas, he claimed that the respondent owed him $14,035. 
    The Board did not agree with it. 
    The Texas Supreme Court has held that when a -- injured workman may -- what would -- would ordinarily call a plaintiff with the employee claims that the insurance company owes him compensation, if the amount he claims before that Board sets the pecuniary value of the matter at issue. 
    That was squarely held in this Booth versus Texas Employers. 
    It -- it held there that the amount -- when the claim with the Board shows the amount claimed in dollars and cents or by a statement or facts which the amount can definitely be determined in the award of the Board is less than the amount of the claim, then the amount shown by the claim is the amount in controversy. 
    As Booth versus Texas Employers, it's a Supreme Court of Texas case, our position is that Horton's rights such he has to compensation are set up by the Texas -- the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act and what the Supreme Court says he is entitled to is what the value in controversy or the -- subject to controversy here. 
    That because the Supreme Court of Texas holds this $14,000, that is the liability that we are being exposed to. 
    That when the Board awards any award against us, that the amount of our potential liability is that $14,000 and our suit to set aside the award is what it's called. 
    It's not an appeal. 
    The statutes call it a suit to set aside the award. 
    But what is really involved is what Horton is claiming.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, that's -- that's the -- that's the point that remained.

    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    Alright, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3610.371" stopTime="3619.895">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The court wouldn't have jurisdiction if all he was seeking in -- in that court was less than $10,000 and that court would not have jurisdiction.
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="3619.895" stopTime="3632.955">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    But the -- at -- at that time yes, sir. 
    But when it was originally brought and when the liability was in excess of $10,000, I think that they had jurisdiction up until the time the counterclaim for less than that was filed.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3632.955" stopTime="3636.011">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But that would divest the -- the court of jurisdiction.
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="3636.011" stopTime="3644.236">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    I think it would be a judicial mission that he wouldn't entitle to more than the -- the Supreme -- than the jurisdictional amount.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3644.236" stopTime="3663.394">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Alright. 
    Now, let me ask you one other question please. 
    Suppose that the petitioner have -- have beat the respondent to the courts, I suppose you've gotten to the county courthouse before you got to the federal court, would your -- would the District Court have any jurisdiction then?
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="3663.394" stopTime="3664.834">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    The -- the United States District Court?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3664.834" stopTime="3665.231">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="3665.231" stopTime="3668.149">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    No, sir. 
    We -- we could not remove the case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3668.149" stopTime="3668.633">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You couldn't remove.
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="3668.633" stopTime="3682.958">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    And -- and second reason is that when the award is appealed from, it's vacated and then there's nothing left for us to find and file a lawsuit in the federal court. 
    He is there -- he is there, and we've prevented from removal, and there is no award to appeal from.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3682.958" stopTime="3692.432">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So the -- so you think it's just a question of -- of a race between the courthouse and the federal courts to determine jurisdiction in this manner?

    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    No, I don't think it's necessarily a race, Your Honor.

    Well, yes, sir.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Alright.[Laughter] 
    Now -- now, let me ask you -- let me ask you this. 
    Do you think that Congress when it passed the 1958 law intended to create a situation of that kind?
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="3720.899" stopTime="3726.776">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    They could have prevented it, and I don't -- I don't feel that they did prevent it. 
    They could have said or file.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3726.776" stopTime="3734.807">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But you -- would you say that -- that the intention of Congress was, at that condition, should prevail?
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="3734.807" stopTime="3763.913">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    I do not know, sir. 
    I doubt that they would want to create a situation where there would be races to the courthouse. 
    However -- nevertheless, if we are entitled to file a direct action in the -- in the federal court regardless of whether they are entitled to file one in the state court, I don't think the time element is necessarily controlling if we are, in fact, entitled under the diversity jurisdiction to file a lawsuit.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3763.913" stopTime="3772.013">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, but we are -- we are, are we not, trying to find out what the intention of Congress was in that 1958 Act?
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="3772.013" stopTime="3792.135">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    Yes, sir. 
    And I believe that they knew at the time that it was enacted that they were about 1100 of these lawsuits removed every year and about 900 of them file directly. 
    And they did not bar the filing of any of them. 
    And the employee can still, if he desires to, file 900 of these cases in Texas every year.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3792.135" stopTime="3796.099">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How many of those 900 were filed by the insurance companies?

    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    I think 28.

    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    Yes, sir, but -- yes, sir.

    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    No, sir. 
    They didn't say that they should but they recognized that they did previously have the right and then they didn't subsequently bar them by saying, "A defendant or an insurer cannot remove a case" and they could have said, "or filed." 
    But they knew at same time that 25 out of these 2000 lawsuits were being filled as plaintiffs by -- directed by insurance companies. 
    The -- the award of the Board or to talk about an appeal this is, in fact, a -- a new lawsuit, it's an original action.

    Of course, it's --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4001.996" stopTime="4004.976">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So it is an item that cannot be made part of the litigation --

    That --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- for which -- for which the suit is brought, is that right?
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="4008.193" stopTime="4013.349">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    That is right. 
    And yet, it is a necessary step in the bringing of this suit. 
    In other words, it has to be an award until there is no award --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4013.349" stopTime="4017.564">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It has to be an award but it can be $5 or $15 or $14,000.
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="4017.564" stopTime="4018.567">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4018.567" stopTime="4024.359">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    No, sir.

speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="4027.473" stopTime="4043.198">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    No, sir. 
    The amount of the award is neither pled nor approved. 
    The only thing that's pled or approved is an award was made. 
    The amount of it is not admissible in evidence and if the -- if one party or the other files a pleading, it can be stating that the award was zero or $14,000.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4043.198" stopTime="4050.078">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Where is -- where is your pleading by which you began the suit in the federal court? 
    What did you say about the addendum of the award?
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="4050.078" stopTime="4085.943">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    I said that -- that he was asserting a claim against us that we desired to set aside -- it was a formal as -- its on page 1 of the record. 
    In page 3, in -- at paragraph (4), I say that the amount of -- in controversy as claimed by the defendant in which the defendant, which was the employee, claimed before the Board was $14,000 which is a claimed liability against us.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4085.943" stopTime="4092.802">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that on your -- on your complaint, you simply said this is a suit under Texas statute and diversity jurisdiction.
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="4092.802" stopTime="4093.252">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    Yes sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4093.252" stopTime="4100.854">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And the Texas statute allows a recovery of $14,000 on concept that the jury would bring in $14,000.
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="4100.854" stopTime="4118.383">
    Mr. Howell Cobb 
    Yes, sir. 
    Because when -- when I appealed, the burden of proof is still on him and he is allowed to -- I mean he has burden of going forward and he is still allowed to recover anything that he is claiming. 
    And the award is not even admissible, it's not -- if it's pled, it can be stricken.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4118.383" stopTime="4143.669">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if the Chief Justice's supposition were then taking up by the motion to dismiss or whatever it is in which they say we disavow an amount beyond $9,000, then on the face of the pleading, and you don't contradict -- you -- whether -- that would be controlling, wouldn't be? 
    That'd be a judicial admission.
speaker="howell_cobb" startTime="4143.669" stopTime="4146.942">
    Mr. Howell Cobb

    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    I think --

    And the defendant said, "I now solemnly say that the outmost of any jury could be simply be fined as $9000 and that's all I'm going to ask the jury." 
    Of course, he'd be thrown out, wouldn't it?

    The burden of proof is on the claimant to assert and prove his claim. 
    And as the Supreme Court of Texas has stated, the amount of the claim go on the compensation that he is entitled to in such a suit regardless of who files the suit is how much he claim before that Board. 
    If he claimed it less, then he would be entitled to less in such a suit.

    And the award never thereafter enters to it. 
    That's why I feel that the petitioner's position that -- that we're merely seeking to escape liability of $1050 award is -- is not true because we are seeking to escape responsibility for the claim or so much is he entitled to $14,000 because once this suit is brought, that award has no place in it.

    Mr. William Vandercreek 
    We have just one comment to make and reply, Your Honor. 
    You ask where there are any cases where the employee did not file a counterclaim. 
    There's one cited in our brief, in our reply brief on page 2. 
    It is Morris versus Maryland Casualty Company 130 S.W.2d 1080. 
    In that case, the employee did not file a counterclaim, he claimed that the court didn't have -- didn't have -- state court did not have jurisdiction. 
    The court held that jurisdiction was present and he loss out entirely because it's necessary for the employee to come in and counterclaim. 
    The mere filing of the suit by insurance company to set aside the award has the effect of terminating that award. 
    He must appeal from the final award.

    It's Morris versus Maryland Casualty Company, 130 S.W.2d 1080.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I ask you, Mr. VanDercreek, before you sit down? 
    I understood Mr. Cobb to say that the number of -- of petitions, if that's the right style for compensation in which something in excess of $10,000 is sought is a small portion of the total number compensation claims, this is -- excluding death actions.
speaker="william_vandercreek" startTime="5259.194" stopTime="5301.482">
    Mr. William Vandercreek 
    No, I was -- as a matter of fact, I would say that most of the petitions filed with the Board would probably be for -- well, let me say I don't know first of all. 
    But by and large, the attorneys who practice in the workmen's comp -- in Texas usually are trying to file an action for total and permanent disability. 
    Now, even though the person just lost his little finger, he can say besides claiming for loss of the finger, which is specified amount, he can also say that the loss of his finger affected his entire body and now he's totally and permanently disabled. 
    To protect themselves, they were quite often automatically file a maximum, they don't -- total and permanent. 
    They don't have to claim permanent and partial.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5301.482" stopTime="5306.357">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now, is there also a practice in that stating any amount in the petition?
speaker="william_vandercreek" startTime="5306.357" stopTime="5345.217">
    Mr. William Vandercreek 
    Yes, there is. 
    Sometimes the workman will just write in a letter requesting a claim where he does not specify any amount before the Board. 
    The Texas rule for the term jurisdiction and a suit by insurance company is the amount of the Board's award. 
    This is all -- I mean, all the Texas rules are summarized in the Booth case. 
    The Fifth Circuit made, in this representation saying regardless who brings a suit, it's the amount in controversy, it's the amount employee claim before the Board. 
    That is not what the Booth case held. 
    It held in a suit by employee to set aside the Board's award. 
    It was not his claim to avoid a privilege in his court petition.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5345.217" stopTime="5368.891">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, then, in the Texas -- in the Texas courts, could a man say, "I -- I lost my finger, and I'm therefore permanently and entirely incapacitated," and -- without -- without specifying any amount of -- of damages can then get an award?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And as I understood Mr. Cobb that in those circumstances, if the award was less than the $10,000, the federal court would not have jurisdiction.
