Lott v. United States
speaker="c_w_wellen" startTime="0.000" stopTime="130.229">
    Mr. C. W. Wellen 
    It is the contention of the Government that Rule 34 obviously applies here to prevent the timeliness of this appeal. 
    However, this is not so. 
    It was not obviously applicable to us and apparently, in the Sullivan case, Rule 34 was not obviously applicable to this Honorable Court. 
    If the Government's contention is adopted, it would create a track for those who follow us to fall into. 
    Their construction of these rules is a strained and torturous construction. 
    It is contrary to the plain mandate of Rule 2 that the rules be construed in a simple and logical manner to promote justice. 
    Further, if the appeal in this case is not timely under Rule 34 and Rule 37, then we submit that it was timely under Rule 12 (b), which permits a court to notice the invalidity of an indictment at any stage of the proceeding. 
    And also, timely, under Section 2255 of the judicial code which permits a court to vacate any judgment where the indictment is insufficient. 
    I turn now to the sufficiency of the indictment. 
    This is an extremely important problem. 
    It is grey -- a grave problem not only for these petitioners but for the country as a whole. 
    Last year alone, 15,000 tax evasion cases either actual or threatened were handled by the Treasury Department and there is reason to believe that this number will increase as time goes on. 
    All it takes to make a tax evasion or a fraud cage is a determination by the revenue service that a tax deficiency exists and that such deficiency was due to willfulness.

    Mr. C. W. Wellen 
    Yes, Sir. 
    It is a deterrent effect but there are many millions more taxpayers to be considered and thousands more of revenue agents. 
    I think that alone will cause the increase. 
    We hired 2000 more revenue agents just the other day.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You make no allowance or people to tell you what they meant on just how we do it. 
    (Inaudible) I don't meant to take your time, proceed.
speaker="c_w_wellen" startTime="182.200" stopTime="393.631">
    Mr. C. W. Wellen 
    Well that -- that's the problem (Voice Overlap). 
    An agent determines the deficiency, says, it's due to willfulness and then we have a tax evasion case. 
    At that point, records and information are withheld from the taxpayers as was done here. 
    When it was determined that this was a potential tax evasion case, the corporate records were seized, virtually, all the corporate records were taken to the courthouse. 
    And when we sought a bill of particulars, the assistant US attorney in charge of this proceeding referring to the literally thousands of papers in this room, said, “Here's your bill of particulars. 
    Our case will be made from these documents.” 
    For this reason, it is essential. 
    Your Honors, it is essential that this Court lay down reasonable rules for the conduct of these proceedings. 
    Since there will be so many indictments, the rules must be made clear. 
    Coming to the heart of the Government's argument on the indictment, the Government contends that an indictment in the mere wording of the statute is adequate. 
    However, this statute merely provides that any person who knowingly attempts to evade or decrees any tax is guilty of a felony. 
    That's all the statute says. 
    It's about as vague as a statute can be. 
    However, a number of lower courts have upheld indictments in the language of the statute. 
    This is on the theory that when an individual is indicted for evading his own tax, that individual is presumed to have a greater knowledge of his affairs than anybody else. 
    He has presumed or known what he did wrong and can conduct his defense accordingly. 
    That observation could not be applicable here. 
    Here, we have a huge corporation and we have employees of that huge corporation accused of aiding the corporation to evade its tax. 
    Two of these petitioners were job superintendents, they were outside men. 
    I doubt if they ever saw the books and records or the tax returns of this company and if they had seen them, they wouldn't understand what they meant. 
    It would be a mystery to them. 
    Therefore, when an indictment in the mere language of the statute is returned against these men, it is meaningless to them. 
    The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution provides that an accused shall be informed of the cause and nature of the charge against him. 
    This was not done here. 
    When measured by the Sixth Amendment, this indictment was absolutely insufficient. 
    These men do not know with what they were charged. 
    They didn't know then and they still don't know. 
    In addition to the vagueness and insufficiency of this indictment, two essentials elements of the purported crime were missing. 
    The indictment did not allege that there was a tax deficiency in the income taxes of the Farnsworth &amp; Chambers Company for the years in question, nor did the indictment allege that the individuals had knowledge of any such tax deficiency. 
    The indictment did not say that all of the taxes, owed by this corporation were not paid when such taxes were due. 
    Indeed, the indictment did not even say that there was an underpayment of taxes during the years in question.

    First, the Government doesn't intend to retry Mr. Farnsworth Sr. 
    but that the retrial date has been delayed by the District Court until the disposition of this case.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Not if -- no, Your Honor. 
    Determination of guilt is at the time of verdict. 
    The Courts of Appeals which have dealt with this issue, the meaning of Rule 34, and they have not dealt with it in the terms of a -- a plea of nolo contendere. 
    They dealt with it in -- after a judgment by a jury or after a plea of guilty. 
    In those instances, they -- they have clearly stated that the time under Rule 34 runs from the determination of guilt as the -- as the verdict or as the plea of guilty.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right. 
    That -- that is correct. 
    It's not historically been to set aside a judgment. 
    Now, the rules -- obviously, Rule 34 does not -- does not confine motions in arrest of judgment just before judgment. 
    There maybe times when the time -- five-day period runs until after judgment. 
    But the main purpose of rules in arrest of motion, there -- the arrest of judgment, the usual motion in arrest of judgment will be before judgment. 
    As I -- as petitioners' counsel has indicated, his -- his jurisdictional contentions have -- have two -- really two separate bases. 
    First of all, he claims that his notices of appeal were timely filed. 
    And second of all, he claims that even if they weren't timely filed, that his motions in arrest of judgment should be considered as if they were motions, either under Rule 12 (b) or under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255. 
    And that their appeals which were in fact taken from the judgments in the criminal case should be treated as if they were taken from the denial of the motions either under Rule 12 (b) or Section 2255. 
    Now, Rule 37 provides two separate periods for filing notices of appeal. 
    First of all, it states that “The notices of appeal maybe filed within 10 days of judgment.” 
    Concededly, petitioners did not file their notices of appeal within 10 days of judgment, but Rule 37 alternatively states that notices of appeal maybe filed within 10 days of denial of a motion in arrest of judgment or a motion for a new trial when such a motion has been made within 10 days of judgment and petitioners claim that they come within this tolling provision. 
    Petitioners say and that this is conceded that they filed their motions in arrest of judgment within 10 days of judgment and within 10 days of the denial of their motions in arrest of judgment, they filed their notices of appeal. 
    Therefore, they say that their notices of appeal were timely filed whether or not their motions in arrest of judgment were timely filed. 
    And then in addition, they claim that their motions in arrest of judgment were timely filed within the meaning of Rule 34. 
    That is within five days after determination of guilt. 
    Now, we -- we disagree with both halves of this -- of petitioners' contention. 
    We believe that petitioners' motions in arrest of judgment were not timely that they were not within five days after determination of guilt. 
    The determination of guilt in this case occurred on March 17 and 20th, 1959 for it was on those dates that the District Court accepted petitioners' pleas of nolo and the motions in arrest of judgment were not filed until over three months later.

    The judgment -- the written judgment was on the 22nd of June and the oral sentence was on the 19th of June but that -- that distinction doesn't matter because -- in any case it was within five days if that was the -- if the judgment is the crucial date for Rule 34. 
    Now, we rest our contention in this matter, largely on this Court's decision in the Hudson and Norris cases. 
    The Hudson case in 272 U.S. and the Norris case in 281 U.S. 
    In those cases, this Court held that a plea of nolo contendere is as conclusive in the particular case before the Court as a plea of guilty. 
    In the Norris case, this Court said that after a plea of nolo contendere, the Court is no longer concerned with the question of guilt but only with the character and extent of the punishment.

    Well, after determination of guilt but we don't think in the normal case, they contemplate being filed after judgment. 
    Normally, judgment is separated from determination of guilt by more than five days. 
    Now, there are instances when that is not true, although I take it, the better practice is to make that kind of separation, so that there's time for a pre-sentence report. 
    But normally, there will be a separation and normally then, motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment will be considered prior to the sentence.

    Rule 37, as petitioners themselves emphasize, is a rule for -- for filing notices of appeal.

    Well -- now, we're back to the first half of the petitioners [Attempt to Laughter] -- I was -- I'm -- At this point, I am assuming that the -- that the Government is correct that determination of guilt in this case was that at the time of plea of nolo contendere, at the time it was accepted. 
    Now petitioners go beyond that and they rely on this wording in Rule 37. 
    And they say even if it was out of time under Rule 34, even so, that the tolling provision of Rule 37 means that they have 10 days from the denial of these motions. 
    Now we say that this makes a -- a perfectly ridiculous situation. 
    It means -- first of all, the District Court can't consider these motions. 
    In fact, in the reply brief, petitioners say that the only purpose of Rule 37 is for purposes of appeal. 
    It doesn't mean -- it doesn't -- it doesn't go even to the question of what the District Court can consider.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    No, no, within five days thereafter, in five days thereafter. 
    The safe -- and we think that motion in arrest of judgment Rule 34 is -- means the same as Rule 33, although the wording is slightly different. 
    In Rule 33, the wording is verdict for a finding of guilty. 
    Here it's determination of guilt, but we think there's no -- there's no difference between that so as to both Rule of 33 and 34, there is a five-day time limit. 
    Then he has 10 days -- if that's denied before sentence, he has 10 days after judgment in which to appeal. 
    If it is not denied before judgment then he has 10 days from whenever it is denied. 
    But we -- and this is of course the majority -- the holding of the majority Courts of Appeals. 
    It's the holding of the Third, Fifth and Ninth Circuits. 
    The Tenth Circuit is the only Circuit which agrees with petitioners. 
    And even that circuit indicates that petitioners' argue -- they'd say that the Government -- the Tenth Circuit says in holding in amount -- what amounts the petitioners' argument that the Government's view tends to harmonize the two rules, they are 33 and 37. 
    And the petitioners' argument creates an anomalous situation. 
    Well, of course it does because it means that Rule 34, the time limit and it is virtually read of the rules. 
    It means that instead of five days after arrest of -- after determination of guilt, it means that in addition, you get 10 days after judgment. 
    There could be no possible usefulness remaining for Rule 34 except for the -- you don't get a tolling, you don't get -- you may not get a tolling with the same tolling effect, but there -- in -- in our view, the -- what -- what petitioners are in -- in essence arguing is that Rule of 37 supersedes Rule 34. 
    There's nothing left of Rule 34 except for -- I take it, you can't make a motion in arrest of judgment from the time that the five days have elapsed to judgment. 
    That time you can't make a motion in arrest of judgment.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Third, Fifth and Ninth. 
    The Smith case of the Tenth Circuit indicates that its view although it -- it believes it's -- it's required by the literal language of Rule 37 completely fails to harmonize Rules 34 and 37. 
    In the little time I have left, I'd like to turn briefly to petitioners' alternative argument that if his direct appeals weren't timely, that his motions in arrest of judgment should be considered as if they were motions under Rule 12 (b) or under Section 2255. 
    And that their appeal should be considered as if they were taken from the denial of these motions. 
    The petitioners' motions in arrest of judgment which were filed by able counsel were -- were denominated, were named to be motions in arrest of judgment and the District Court denied them on this basis. 
    Petitioners can't now ask to the Court of Appeals, initially in this Court to then search out other -- any other remedy which maybe -- maybe possible and to reverse the District Court on a ground which the District Court didn't even have before it. 
    And then petitioners own notices of appeal were not -- did not specify the appeal was to be taken from the denial of their motions, rather it was from the -- it was from the judgment in the criminal case. 
    And beyond this, even if petitioners were correct, the only grounds which would be retained in the case were those which were in the motion in arrest of judgment. 
    And the only -- the only one of the three substantive contentions which was included in their motions in arrest of judgment were those which attacked the indictment. 
    The other two grounds were not included.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    We -- we think it would be, Your Honor if it -- if it comes following -- following the judgment in the -- in the main case. 
    But -- see, their -- their argument is it isn't part of the main case at all. 
    That the District Court and this Court should consider it as if it were -- if its out of time, then it has nothing to do with the -- at least their Section 2255 argument that its just like another motion to vacate and their Rule 12 (b) claim I take it is that you can make it anytime during the proceeding. 
    Now, the short answer to their Section 2255 argument is that there weren't in custody, either -- either then when they made their motions or are their in custody today. 
    Now they argue that some sort of constructive custodies involved since that their direct appeals were untimely, then they should've been -- been bail was improper and therefore, they should've been in jail but it seems clear that the Heflin case holds that 2255 is available only when a person is in custody and is entitled to be released from custody. 
    And as to Rule 12 (b), we think that the history of that rule shows that the phrase “at anytime during dependency of the proceeding” does not include the period after determination of guilt.” 
    For that rule was promulgated under the Act of June 29th, 1940 which provides only for the promulgation of rules with respect to proceedings before verdict, plea of guilty or finding of guilty. 
    And Rule 34 on the other hand was promulgated under the earlier Criminal Appeals Rules Act of 1933 which provides for rules after verdict, plea of guilty or finding of guilty.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Mr. Terris, suppose that these two rules, 37 and 34, are not reconciled then would it not be true that in the interest of allowing an appeal, the ambiguity ought to be construed in favor of the appellant?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="2428.251" stopTime="2455.191">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, first of all, we think they're very easily reconciled but the Government's position under -- in both the view with the Tenth Circuit which agrees with petitioners and in a view with the three circuits with -- which agreed but the Government all think that the Government's view reconciles the two rules. 
    But beyond that, we think that the Robinson case made clear that there isn't a -- that this was not an area in which reasonable excuses came into play.

    We think that the Robinson case applies now I quite agree. 
    The factual -- the justification given in the Robinson case would not be the same here. 
    Here, they claim that they were entrapped by the language.

   Rebuttal of C. W. Wellen
speaker="c_w_wellen" startTime="2499.435" stopTime="2550.109">
    Mr. C. W. Wellen 
    I think the very complexity of the Government's argument conclusively demonstrates that their position violates Rule 2, that these rules should be simple of application for the interest of justice. 
    The Rule 37, Mr. Justice Brennan, I think is exactly as you say, yet on its face says that if a motion in arrest of judgment be filed within 10 days after judgment, then that prolongs the time for appeal. 
    There is no reference in there to Rule 34 nor is there any requirement there that the motion in arrest of judgment have any other quality. 
    And that's the only rule, when you read the rules, that's the only one applicable here that's over under the Section denominated appeal. 
    Rule 34 is not there. 
    It was only --

    -- either by a judge without a jury or by a jury and then generally within five days thereafter, the defendant's counsel files a motion in arrest of judgment.

    Mr. C. W. Wellen 
    Yes, sir, before he's entered judgment. 
    Now, there's one other very important point here too. 
    In the -- under the peculiar facts of this case, we think judgment here was not addressed to the nolo contendere plea, but was based upon what this judge heard during the ten-week trial of the Farnsworth case. 
    We think it was the evidence adduced there that was the basis for this judgment. 
    Therefore, even if the nolo contendere plea be considered a determination of guilt, which we don't see how it could be. 
    We think guilt here was determined from the facts heard in this case where we had no opportunity of cross examination or to put on rebuttal testimony. 
    So we would feel here that judgment was a determination of guilt. 
    Even if under other circumstances, a nolo contendere plea might be so considered.

    Mr. C. W. Wellen 
    Yes sir and contrary to the Tucker case and the Norris case, he did so. 
    Under those decisions when a judge does that then he loses jurisdiction to impose sentence under the nolo contendere plea and that's one of the points in our brief that here since we were in effect tried in absentia by facts heard during this trial, then the judgment itself is illegal and cannot stand.

    There, you're represented or on the pre-sentence report, you don't have advocates presenting an unlimited amount of testimony against you with no opportunity to rebut it. 
    You have an impartial investigator who was investigating facts.
