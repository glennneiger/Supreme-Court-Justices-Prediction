Campbell v. United States

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 53, Alvin R. Campbell, Arnold S. Campbell and Donald Lester, Petitioners, versus United States. 
    Mr. Louison, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="15.746" stopTime="152.967">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case arises out of the so-called Jencks statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 3500, and actually presents what we submit to be a novel question, partially perhaps due to the newness of the statute. 
    The question presented, may it please the Court, is whether or not, after a foundation for the admission of a statement as defined by the statute is laid on cross-examination, is the production of that statement thereby excused when the prosecutor states that the original document is no longer in existence and cannot be produced. 
    And further, that the only statement in the possession of the Government is a report of the FBI agent in charge of the interview which does not meet the definition of the -- of a statement within the statute as laid down by this Court in the Palermo decision. 
    Now, actually, this case arises out of indictments for bank robbery -- for violation of the Federal Bank Robbery Act and resulted in convictions of the three petitioners and maximum sentences of 25 years each were imposed by the District Judge. 
    The decision of the Court of Appeals, actually, does not help us in any respect on the question presented to this Court at this time for the reason that, as shown in the record, the Court of Appeals said that the pretrial report, I refer to page 6 -- 216 of the record, the pretrial report does -- the question concerning the pretrial report does not warrant extended discussion in view of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Palermo versus United States and that was the subtle substance of what the Court of Appeals in the First Circuit had to say about this point before the Court today.

speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="172.069" stopTime="224.777">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    The Court of Appeals actually took the principle of Palermo out of context and applied it in its naked existence to a -- an entirely different factual situation and they did that in this manner. 
    In the Palermo case, you had, of course, the situation of a statement which was demanded among others and which did not meet the definition of a statement, as outlined by the statute and ruled on by this Court. 
    In our case, we have the situation where we submit to the Court, there was a statement in existence and that statement was no longer in existence and this report now was the only, if not the best, available evidence of what had formally been the statement of the witness which had been reduced to writing and approved and adopted by him.

    How about the agent himself (Inaudible)
speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="229.989" stopTime="331.478">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    Well, if Your Honor please, we felt that we did not -- we were not in a position where we should have been required to call the agent as our witness and -- because the witness testified in this case that the agent summary was not precisely as he had stated it. 
    He said, and I think the Government quotes it in their brief and saying there were things in there which were turned around. 
    I refer to page 23 of the Government's brief in which they said they knew that the report contained something different from Staula's testimony since Staula said it was not verbatim. 
    It was turned around and it was not written up just the way the story is, and they refer to their own pages 11 and 12 which sets out excerpts from the record. 
    But if I may -- I didn't want to reach that point at this time but if I may, I will. 
    That imposes upon the petitioners a double burden of proof. 
    Number one, the burden of proof is upon the petitioners to establish that they come within this statute, that so-called Jencks statute. 
    And upon establishing that foundation, as the court referred to it in our present case, upon establishing that foundation, it then becomes incumbent upon the petitioners, if that were so, to show that the Government has no excuse for not producing it and actually, exculpation if the defense would be -- the burden of it would be upon the proponent of the defense or the excused.

speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="1071.874" stopTime="1103.087">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    No, I do not.I just take the position that if the Government removes the situation from the confines or the four corners of the statute, then we go back to the common law and find ourselves back into the Jencks case. 
    May I refer now, Mr. Justice, to page 210 of the record, the -- where it says "Mr. Louison," about a third of the way down, it says "the record is completely without explanation as to the original document."W
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1103.087" stopTime="1104.145">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    hat page is that?
speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="1104.145" stopTime="1234.969">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    On page 210 of the printed record, about one-third of the way down. 
    Now, if it please the Court, if the petitioners contend that if such a situation as this is permitted to exist and be approved then, actually, we have now found a way for the Government to eliminate all discovery of such documents which, we submit, was neither the intent of the Congress in the passage of this statute nor the intent of this Court, obviously, in the Jencks case and certainly not so in the Palermo case which followed the Jencks case. 
    And we earnestly submit that imposing a double standard -- a double burden of proof upon the petitioners in that regard is equally as bad as the -- giving the Government the power to avoid discovery by destroying the original document or -- when I say original document, I mean the document that would meet the definition of the word "statement" within the statute. 
    In that regard, I might say that, though the witness said he thought he had signed the statement, there is actually no requirement in the statute that he had -- that he sign the statement. 
    This is one form of adoption of it but if he read or had it read to him and approved and adopted it, then it is certainly a statement within Section 3500 just as much as if would have signed it. 
    And therefore, the fact that it does not appear, let's say, conclusively in the record that it was signed by the witness does not preclude us from obtaining it.

speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="1288.093" stopTime="1365.321">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    -- 26 of the Government's brief in a footnote in which they say that the final testimony of the witness was that he thought it was read back to him. 
    But if you notice, the witness also said, "I think they wrote down what I said and I think they gave it back to me to read over to make sure that it was right and I think had to sign it. 
    Now, I am not sure. 
    I couldn't remember before." 
    Well, that does not actually show the entire nature of the record because, on page 201 of the record from which this excerpt was taken, the very next sentence by the court is -- that's about all the way down the bottom, about six or eight lines up. 
    The court said, "And he said it was read back to him. 
    So, if that," referring to the FBI summary, "if that is a transcript." 
    Now -- actually I can actually remember this witness as if it were yesterday. 
    He was saying "I think they wrote it down and I think they read it back to me to make sure that it was correct and right," but he was actually stating a fact. 
    I would say it's uncontraverted that he gave a statement to the FBI which they wrote down.

    -- unfair summary of it happened.
speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="1434.732" stopTime="1435.599">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1435.599" stopTime="1435.771">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Alright.
speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="1435.771" stopTime="1686.885">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    Certainly. 
    Now, the Government has also said by way of excusing the situation, and they seem to rely on various actual situations in an attempt to excuse it, that the trial judge saw the document in camera and did not see fit to cross-examine the witness on the basis of it and he, being the impartial master of the trial, could have done so if he were disturbed by any apparent or alleged inconsistency. 
    And the short answer to that, I think, was spelled out in the Rosenberg case where it said that it's within the realm of counsel's discretion to determine whether or not there would be any useful matter contained in the -- in the statement for cross-examination and it would not be the province of the court to second-guess counsel in that regard. 
    And of course, they state that -- I want to reach this point rather quickly, they state that if error appears in this trial, it pertains only to the petitioner Lester because he was the one who was named by this witness or identified by this witness. 
    Now, I say this. 
    Where the original document, assuming that it should have been produced if it had been in existence, where the original document is no longer in existence and cannot and has not been preserved for review by any appellate court, we are unable to determine whether or not there is any prejudice to any of the other petitioners. 
    And therefore, it must be held to be prejudicial to all if it is prejudicial to any, and this occurs because of the fact that -- this occurs because of the fact that a statement might contain things that the witness did not testify to in his examination which might be the subject of cross-examination as to "why didn't you say this, Mr. Witness, when back, so close to the time of the event, you did say this?" 
    And of course, the statute there, again, does not say that the statement to be producible must relate only to what the witness stated on his direct examination. 
    It states that it must be related to the subject matter and therefore, matters contained in the statement to which he did not testify to, provided they related to the subject matter, would be the proper subject of production and subject to cross-examination. 
    So -- and of course, there is also the position in the Jencks case that inconsistency is not a prerequisite to production and of course, the statute does not make any such requirement that there'd be a preliminary showing of inconsistency. 
    So, without the necessity of showing inconsistency, as well as the situation where the nonexistent document cannot tell you -- you, Members of the Court, what was contained there in its original form. 
    The prejudice, if there would be any, is to all the petitioners and not to any one particular petitioner because this man merely stated his name on the direct testimony. 
    Now, there is one other point which I think is essential and that is the Government has stated that when must they have it in their possession if it is called for, and they say it must be in their possession at the time production is demanded. 
    And I submit to the Court that that is untenable and we have included in our brief reasons showing that it must be held to be at any time. 
    If the statement were in existence and in the possession of the United States at any time, then it is -- comes under the purview of the statute and the petitioners are entitled to protection from it, from the destruction thereof at any time after.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1686.885" stopTime="1707.448">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let's see if I -- if I understand your argument. 
    I thought, at least it seemed to me clear, that your argument could be -- proceed on the assumption that if the nonexistent documents were in existence, they -- a call for them would have -- would have had -- would have had to be honored.

    Mr. Lawrence F. O'donnell 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the Court. 
    I would like to devote my attention to the following question. 
    If the Government fails to produce a prior written statement of a government witness who has testified, which statement qualifies under the Jencks Act because of a government agent's destruction of said statement, ought the witness' testimony be stricken from the record. 
    This, in substance, is the question raised by parts one and two of the petitioner's brief. 
    The Court of Appeals did not face this question but rather, dismissed the petitioner's contention perfunctorily by citing the Palermo decision which, of course, dealt with a question totally unrelated to the question I have just posed. 
    Section (d) states that if the U.S. elects not to comply with a not up or a producible statement under (b) and (c), then the court shall strike the testimony of the witness from the record. 
    If we look at Sections (b) and (c), and also (a), we say that they refer to statements in the possession of the United States. 
    The Government says that this necessarily means in the possession of the United States at the time production is called on and, in addition, claims that this position is self-evident. 
    The petitioners do not claim the halo of self-evidence for the Government's position.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2154.507" stopTime="2162.582">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In your position -- your position would be the same, would it not, if there had been no other statement?

    Mr. Lawrence F. O'donnell 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I -- I would like to say this, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that, of course, this entire notion of destruction -- alleged destruction which appeal -- appeared for the first time in the Government's brief in opposition to our petition for certiorari and representing these petitioners, I don't embrace the notion of destruction. 
    I think the entire lack of production of the statement runs in with -- I would make the suggestion that they were attempting to insulate this witness and that the trouble and difficulty surrounding getting at this statement was the obvious fact that it had impeachment material in it. 
    Now --

    -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that this particular agency, the FBI and the little expression that has crept into this case, the word "knows" as though someone was scribbling in a dress or a shopping list on the back of an envelope or a telephone number, this particular agency houses all sorts of records, millions, I would bet, of fingerprints. 
    And I would say that a well-paid FBI agent, competent, out investigating a bank robbery, interviewing an allegedly eyewitness of said bank robbery wouldn't long be tolerated if he didn't take careful notes of what had happened. 
    And I might add that when the summary of the Interview Report which has been stated doesn't come within the purview of the Act, I had objected to the fact when the judge took that summary in camera that in order to make his judgment, he decided he should show it to the witness who had just testified on direct examination, may it please the Court, and also was placed under cross-examination. 
    So, the very obvious thing to me, as trial counsel in that courtroom, was "Gosh! 
    This fellow is going to notice the minute he looks at this that it's not consonant what he testified to on direct." 
    I implore the Court to look at the summary of FBI Agent Toomey. 
    Dominic Staula went in that courtroom and identified three defendants, positive and partial. 
    The summary of Toomey, the FBI agent, he said, "I never saw a third person in the bank." 
    He gave one description and there was clearly impeachment material in that summary.

    Could I go back to your basic position which, as I understand it, is that once -- once you've laid a foundation by showing that there was a statement then, as a matter of law, the Government doesn't produce it, you are entitled to have his testimony stricken.

    All he said in response certainly to my question was that for want of information, for want of knowledge on the subject, as disclosed in this record, he made no charge of -- of wrongdoing.

    In this case, where the Government has come here before the United States Supreme Court and introduced a transcript that wasn't before the Circuit Court of Appeals and wasn't in the trial court, I'll take this position. 
    We filed affidavit of -- affidavits of bias in this case. 
    I can't just -- I don't like to raise and the -- we asked for severance in this case as against including these three defendants. 
    It was denied. 
    Now, the Government in its brief is talking about, well, if there's reversible error, it might apply to one and not to the other. 
    Well, I say that's a late date and the -- going further on the concurring opinion of the Palermo case, it was said Congress made crystal clear its purpose only to check extravagant interpretations of Jencks while reaffirming the basic holding that the defendant in trial be entitled to statements helpful in cross-examination of government witnesses who testify against him. 
    Petitioner submit that "entitled" means to have a right to and if the petitioners have a right, then the Government has a corresponding obligation to comply with that right. 
    If there is no obligation, there is no right. 
    Now, if this obligation can be abrogated by the mere act of an investigative agent destroying a statement, even if in good faith, then the right is, in reality, no right at all. 
    If the principles set forth in the Jencks case are subject to whims, caprice or even negligence and carelessness of government agents, then the spirit of Jencks is dead and we are left with the clops.

    The Government contends, as it's been brought up, since the petitioners did not attempt to call the agent who took the statement, there was no reason to strike the testimony. 
    This is the most tenuous of the Government's contentions. 
    Petitioners had a right to the statement signed and adopted by the witness and to say that the testimony of the agent was a sufficient surrogate is to ask this Court to take up precedence in the fragile house of mechanical jurisprudence. 
    To attempt to equate the written statement of the witness, given a short time after the robbery with the memory of a government agent months later, is to engage in a flagrantly vacuous pleading and it's to proceed as if the Jencks decision had never been handed down and as if the Jencks statute never became law.

    And I would say that the Government adopts the petitioners' contentions. 
    Of course, it would just notice on government agencies that they shall take care, especially when we think of the multitudeness record year in and year out that are maintained by the Government, that it will maintain these records in accordance with the war of the land and have them producible at a later trial. 
    Now, the Government also contends that when I spoke about the act of God, we're, of course, on the fire. 
    We're talking about the act of an agent and also, with that thought in mind, the protection of the Government, it seems that this statute clearly indicates that in the event of a producible statement not being produced, that the testimony of the witness will be stricken. 
    And I say that, in summation, that the petitioner submit that the failure of the Government to produce the statement of the witness in compliance with the order of the court because of the destruction of that statement by a government agent, is the equivalent of an election not to produce and hence, the testimony of the witness, Staula, ought to have been stricken from the record. 
    To hold otherwise would be to stultify the decision of this Court handed down in the Jencks case and to proclaim the inability of the Jencks Act to carry out the legislative intent.

    Your Honor, I have consulted with the officials of the FBI in preparation for this argument. 
    I also know of my own knowledge from the past practices and I would like to say this. 
    That since the Jencks decision, there has been no changes in FBI procedures. 
    Procedures were changed somewhat in June, just after the Jencks decision. 
    Although, even there, there was not a great alteration of technique and since then, they haven't been changed at all in this respect.

    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Well, Your Honor, I think there -- there's been a misconception of just what did happen there or what Staula's testimony on this point is and our brief develops it. 
    In the opening part of our brief, we start on page 4 to describe the testimony of Staula on this point and it will be seen that, at one point, Staula said that -- first of all, he told his story and then the man asked him a few questions, that is the FBI man and then he -- he wasn't too sure whether he signed it. 
    And on page 9 of our brief, we quote from the record --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3499.670" stopTime="3505.543">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was he sure that he'd been -- it had been shown to him and that he had approved it?
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="3505.543" stopTime="3617.724">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    No, no. 
    He -- I think he's highly equivocal on this point. 
    He thought, at one stage, that he had signed something and there is one portion of the record where he says that when he went down to the police station the day after the robbery, he thought he signed something saying he was in the bank. 
    "But I didn't sign any statement," he said or he didn't sign any lengthy document. 
    Now, on page 8 and 9 of our brief, we've set out one portion of the testimony on this. 
    Down at the bottom of page 8, we've quoted. 
    The court, "Now, Mr. Witness, you testified here on cross-examination that you talked to the FBI agent and that he asked you questions, as I remember it, and that you didn't know what he had written down because it was not read back to you. 
    Didn't you testify that way?" 
    The witness, "I didn't remember. 
    Since then, I have recollected. 
    He didn't actually ask me questions. 
    I mean, at first, I told him the story and then, when I got through, he asked me a few questions." 
    Now, at this point, the court cuts him off by saying, the court, "Well, did he read it back to you?" 
    The witness, "I believe he did." 
    The court, "What is your best memory of it?" 
    The witness, "I am pretty sure he did." 
    Well, now, if I could stop there for a moment, it's customary in FBI interviews to read back to -- to a person from the notes that the agent has taken to confirm and verify the facts that the agent understands he's just been told, so there won't be any mistake about it. 
    That doesn't mean that the agent, at that time, has in his hand a complete elaborate written statement. 
    The agent's notes may be nothing more than hieroglyphics or personal shorthand, which they frequently are, and I think that this is what is involved here. 
    I think this is --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3617.724" stopTime="3618.350">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But whether it's --
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="3618.350" stopTime="3619.121">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    -- the best inference to be drawn.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3619.121" stopTime="3640.277">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- whether it's hieroglyphics or -- or whether it's in English, if -- if it is recorded, it might be shorthand. 
    But if it is recorded and it is acknowledged by the witness to have been what he stated, is it not -- does it not then come under the Jencks Act?
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="3640.277" stopTime="3666.721">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    No, Your Honor, because these notes have never been considered to be a statement in the sense of a -- a written statement signed by the witness nor are they a recording of -- are they a verbatim transcription of any kind or a verbatim statement and they have never been thought by us to have any value as -- as a producible statement under the Jencks Act.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3666.721" stopTime="3670.013">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why does the agent asked him then if that's what he stated?
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="3670.013" stopTime="3693.461">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Because in the process of interviewing a witness, the agent wants to make sure that he understands the story correctly and he may confirm certain points with him. 
    Now, he may not necessarily read back to him what's in his notes. 
    He may just clarify a few points. 
    Maybe his notes will be more elaborate than this. 
    Maybe they will be less so. 
    This, we don't know from the state of the record here.

    Am I wrong in -- in having inferred from your -- what you regard as the -- the correct question before the Court that the -- the assumption of that question, presupposition is that the Government assumed that if the notes had been in existence that Staula gave, they were produced. 
    They would have been produced.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3728.315" stopTime="3783.452">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I don't understand your questioning. 
    I must say, it doesn't mean -- it isn't -- if I can read English, to say the question is whether the notes of an interview which the witness testified had been read back to him and might have been signed by him were not in existence at the time they filed, the Court should have directed that they'll be turned over to defend for later report by the government agent which the witness testified was not a substantially verbatim account. 
    Now, on the context of the subject matter, there is a differentiation, just the position between notes that have been read back to him, which might have been signed by him and a document, a later document, not being a substantially verbatim account of what he had told. 
    I don't see why the Government doesn't start out with the first point then. 
    Number one, the notes originally were not producible because they were not subject to the Jencks statute.

    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    That is right, Your Honor --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, the summary --
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="3913.881" stopTime="3914.451">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    -- but that is --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3914.451" stopTime="3918.176">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    It's clear from Palermo that the summary never does come within.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="3918.176" stopTime="4015.965">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    That is correct, Your Honor, but the FBI has not stopped taken written statements where it's appropriate. 
    Now, how they determine this hinges on -- on the -- the reality's investigative light and -- and what the agent sees at the moment. 
    It also hinges on whether the witness is willing to give a statement on how crucial his testimony is likely to become in an -- a number of other things. 
    In this case, at the time that they interviewed Staula, it was the day after the robbery and they still didn't even know who the -- the suspects were. 
    They were looking for general information about the robbery. 
    And on this point, it's important to point out that Staula, this same day after he talked to the FBI agent, was taken by the city police down to a service station where he looked at an individual and he said he couldn't positively identify that man. 
    He then, in the police car, was shown a number of photographs and out of these photos, he picked Lester as being the man who told him to get back against the wall in the bank. 
    And that is how Staula perfected his identification of Lester. 
    The FBI man never talked to Staula again. 
    This -- this is -- is, I think, a partial explanation of what happened here. 
    When the FBI man talked to Staula, he was interested in the general picture and we don't know what kinds of notes the FBI man took. 
    But whatever he took, he wrote up this interview, which is in the record, this Interview Report which is in the record.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4015.965" stopTime="4021.908">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, of course, the word "notes" and the conception of notes is itself a very ambiguous term --
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="4021.908" stopTime="4021.931">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4021.931" stopTime="4036.640">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- from the record that has come before this Court entirely here. 
    There are any number of instances where the FBI takes a coherent consecutive statement and the man is trying to draw an issue of it. 
    I wouldn't call those notes.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="4036.640" stopTime="4104.606">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    No, and we don't call them notes, Your Honor. 
    We call that a written statement. 
    The FBI is very careful that when it gets a statement, it is an ample one and there is very little doubt about it because it -- it always contains a prelude about the individual being advised of his rights and it ends up with who the agents were and the date of the statement. 
    The statement usually covers the subject involved quite -- quite amply and it's something that's almost instantly recognizable. 
    Now, the other kind of report, the report of an interview of a witness, runs somewhat in the form of the one that's in the record here. 
    And this is a very usual procedure because the agents, in the course of the day in having to interview many witnesses or here, trying to discover who did this robbery, may not have time to get a complete written statement from every person that they talked to and in this case, they apparently didn't. 
    They were, apparently, scores of witnesses to this robbery who testified at the trial. 
    Staula was just one of many.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4104.606" stopTime="4112.432">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, they're not only -- these notes often are also interluded with comment by the agent. 
    How (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="4112.432" stopTime="4114.586">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Yes, indeed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4114.586" stopTime="4118.964">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They -- they make comments that this fellow, "I don't believe him" and so on, all sorts of things.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="4118.964" stopTime="4140.751">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Oh, the agent might note that the witness is nervous or any number of things like that. 
    This would hardly be a statement of the person and under the Jencks concept. 
    It would be unfair to confront the witness with this when he was called to the stand to try to impeach him with this kind of material.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4140.751" stopTime="4147.238">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, he'd hardly -- hardly show the witness that kind of notes and ask him to sign up though, would he?
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="4147.238" stopTime="4160.179">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    No, he wouldn't and I don't know of any FBI practice of a witness signing notes. 
    I -- I really don't, Your Honor. 
    They have no -- no established procedure of -- of having witnesses sign notes.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="4160.179" stopTime="4161.536">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, that was just Staula.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4161.536" stopTime="4161.582">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do they have any --
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="4161.582" stopTime="4169.161">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Except where -- where a witness might draw a sketch or something like that. 
    They might have him sign it in that circumstance. 
    Excuse me, Your Honor?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4169.161" stopTime="4176.638">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So if Staula's recollection that he did sign this is correct, then it would follow that these things were more than just simply notes.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="4176.638" stopTime="4191.594">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    That is correct. 
    And under established procedures, clear procedures, if he had signed those notes, they would be retained. 
    That is, unless the agent violated his duty here, those notes would have been retained and kept in an envelope in the case file.

    No, Your Honor, because we didn't know the -- the existence of this transcript until after the petition for certiorari had been granted here. 
    On page 10 of our brief, we refer to this transcript in a footnote. 
    The transcript itself or the -- the conference in chambers is referred to by the judge on page 211 of -- of this record, at the top of the page. 
    He speaks of a one and a half hour conference that he had wherein he listened to arguments and we had a full discussion of the briefs and where I finally decided and made a conditional decision. 
    Now, in this conference, I have the pages of the -- the typewritten transcript where this appears. 
    On pages 1831 and 1832, the judge finally decided to follow this homely procedure of -- of showing the Interview Report to the witness which he apparently had done with other witnesses in this trial to see whether he -- he agreed with this and adopted it as a statement. 
    And at that point, Mr. Louison said, "Your Honor, I think we should have Special Agent Toomey in here to explain where he got the document." 
    The Court, "No, listen. 
    Special Agent Toomey is a witness you have a right to subpoena and bring in here. 
    Obviously -- let me tell you something, now, Mr. Louison, I'm glad you spoke of that and I'm glad Mr. O'Donnell has been over it.

    No, Mr. Louison suggested that the Government call him and Judge McCarthy pointed out that the Government couldn't do that. 
    It would probably be reversible error because to put the agent on the stand as a government witness --

    One would have to read, at least I would have to read, what's repeated, what -- how this conference to which footnote on this page occurs, what it was about and what it is that Judge McCarthy had in mind when he said, "You couldn't call the agent to give evidence." 
    Of course, you couldn't call him up to give evidence as to what, what's his name? 
    It's all about said but -- but what we're concerned with here is the circumstances that brought the original writings of the agent into light and secondly, what kind of things they were, whether they were within the -- the Jencks Act or not. 
    And assuming they were within the Jencks statute and they're not being forthcoming, whether you could then -- whether the defendant could then call for the report of the interview. 
    It was a very different question. 
    They can't be all mixed up that you could ask about it.

    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Well, I -- I think that if Your Honor reads that transcript, you will see that the court was trying to apply the statute, struggling for an interpretation of it in applying it in this case and perhaps, it didn't occur to him to call Agent Toomey in. 
    He felt that -- that absent a sufficient showing by the defense counsel, that there -- there was some kind of a statement that had been destroyed that -- that he need not act further. 
    He was satisfied when the Government told him that he didn't have the statement in its possession and -- and he indicated that -- that it was up to them to call.

    What we are urging is that this was not reversible error because the defendants were given an opportunity to call to me.

    I think he was available because, in reading the entire transcript of the record, I think only one-ninth of it is before you.

    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Well, when the -- when the court called on the Assistant U.S. Attorney to produce any documents he had, he gave them this.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Where is that page?

    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    It's -- it's here.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5437.361" stopTime="5456.801">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I think that answers the Chief Justice's question and mine. 
    I don't think it ever came out explicitly that the original so-called note was not available, except he clearly hasn't got them but he produces this. 
    And that's why I say the presupposition is the assumption of everybody was that they weren't in existence.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5456.801" stopTime="5480.043">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Your -- Your Honor, on page 201, at the bottom, the court says "Have you got in your possession any statement that was copied by an FBI agent which, in any way, would reflect a statement that this witness made? 
    Which would in any way," he says. 
    And Mr. Hobley, his clerk, says "No, Your Honor, we don't."

    He's an Assistant -- he's an Assistant US Attorney of a lower rank.

speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5514.924" stopTime="5517.832">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    I think there was at an earlier time.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5517.832" stopTime="5539.374">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    "You see, Mr. Hurly," and he said he was a -- so that, it was -- if that is the transcript on page 201, Mr. Hurly, "It isn't. 
    It is a report for an FBI agent which is a summary of the result of the interview. 
    It is his interpretation of what happened." 
    In other words, that's the second document.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5539.374" stopTime="5543.045">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    That is correct. 
    This -- this is --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5543.045" stopTime="5548.131">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That would be the present controversy that's involved. 
    They wanted -- no, no.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5548.131" stopTime="5548.252">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    No.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5548.252" stopTime="5551.968">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They wanted this produced or the evidence stricken.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5551.968" stopTime="5553.156">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    That is correct. 
    They say that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5553.156" stopTime="5564.371">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now -- but -- but there must have been -- wasn't there earlier a number that it was said to the judge that "No, we can't produce that but we can produce this," wasn't there anything like that?
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5564.371" stopTime="5566.470">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    I think, at some point back, they were told that they had --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5566.470" stopTime="5567.019">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's what I thought.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5567.019" stopTime="5573.959">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    -- they had a report that bore on it but they had no statement producible within the statute.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5573.959" stopTime="5591.118">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And that is why I said, for me, throughout this proceeding, there was an assumption by everybody that the original documentation by Toomey was not available but they then offered this subsequent reporting, isn't that right?
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5591.118" stopTime="5611.847">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    That is correct. 
    The -- the Government gave that to the court and the court looked at it and saw the nature of it and then, after this conference in chambers which went on for a long time, he went back into the courtroom and gave this to the witness to see whether he would adopt it as a state, which the witness did not do.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5611.847" stopTime="5613.999">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Then what happened?
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5613.999" stopTime="5630.430">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Then, as far as the court was concerned, that concluded it, that is, the witness wouldn't adopt it, so it certainly was not producible in -- in the way that the court saw the situation and the case proceeded.

    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    That's right. 
    In fact, Your Honor, on page 204 where the asterisks appear near the top of the page, this is the end of the court day. 
    And the judge stayed up until one in the morning, he said, looking for the Holy Grail, that is, the interpretation of the Jencks Act and the next day, this conference occurred in chambers. 
    I believe it consumed a good part of the morning. 
    It was after that that the court resumed trial and that's where Dominic Staula resumed testimony, as appears on this page. 
    This gap is confusing otherwise but those asterisks really represent conference in chambers which is covered by that transcript which we have filed here. 
    And in that transcript, somewhere, as my recollection, that the Assistant U.S. Attorney said that he checked with the FBI and that there were no such notes in existence. 
    Now, exactly what --

    No, I don't believe he did.

    The judge, in this conference in his chambers, spoke of knowing about the FBI practices and how they go about interviewing witnesses and he knew that they often took written statements --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible)

    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    No, I don't think he -- he talked about them writing down what he told them.

    (Inaudible) notes.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="5922.155" stopTime="5938.202">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor

    Well, but you do have the man who -- who should have a very accurate knowledge of it and you could produce him for this record if you had wanted to do it. 
    You could have produced the agent who -- who had said, "I just took a few desultory notes and -- and I -- I said, generally speaking, is this what you told me? 
    And -- and then, I went back and made a summary." 
    He could have said that very easily and cleared up a lot of these matters if that was the fact but you didn't choose to do that or to use him for that purpose.

    Now, if you were pursuing it to find out why -- why wouldn't you pursue that when you talked to your agent? 
    "Are there such notes in existence as far as you know?" 
    "No. 
    There are none." 
    "Were there any?

    No.

    Now, that was what the -- the dispute is partly about here.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I understand that, but the only thing you argue in your brief is, number one, that since the original statement, notes, whatever you want to call it, were destroyed, therefore, you couldn't be required to produce this secondary thing as a substitute because the Agent -- because Staula has repudiated the secondary notes of the agent.

    Mr. Roger G. Connor

    And that the Government would have been in a difficult position to do this, at least in open court. 
    Now, it's also been raised here that the judge could have done it in camera. 
    He didn't do it. 
    But that still leaves us with a problem of whether that is reversible error. 
    The judge here selected one method of dealing with this problem and we don't think that it was erroneous.

    Two things that are clear, two things about which they ought not to be a dispute in anybody's mind when we arrive here tonight is, one, there was an original writing by Toomey which was, when asked to be produced, non-existent.

    And you -- then, the doubts that are raised is not the doubts, but you say that since the defendant was asked for the production of a document, it was incumbent upon them to come within the condition for the production laid down by the Jencks statute. 
    And you say further that those -- that they have not made good that requirement of them to -- to have that document produced were it in existence --
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="6645.613" stopTime="6645.778">

    -- which is essential before they come to the next point, namely since it isn't in existence, the next best thing should be given to them or at least, if not, the evidence of the witness' about and this controversy struggles should be stricken.
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="6662.352" stopTime="6663.081">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    Yes, and --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6663.081" stopTime="6665.144">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's the -- that sums it all up, doesn't it?
speaker="roger_g_connor" startTime="6665.144" stopTime="6815.722">
    Mr. Roger G. Connor 
    That -- that essentially states our position, Your Honor. 
    I see I only have a few minutes and I would like to briefly talk on another point that we haven't been able to develop and that is, this question may arise that if the witness rejected this Interview Report as being his statement, was it inaccurate? 
    And was it so inaccurate that maybe it should have been made available? 
    And our answer to that is no. 
    In our brief, we have analyzed some of these discrepancies between the Interview Report and what Staula testified to on the stand and shown that they are not substantial and that the judge who saw this report and who heard the testimony of the witness didn't think they were substantial enough either that it should result in turning over this FBI report to the defense counsel. 
    For a -- one of the points was how many men were in the bank according to Staula. 
    He said on the stand there were three men. 
    He told the agent -- well, at least according to the Interview Report, he didn't observe a third man in the bank. 
    That could mean that there was a third man that he didn't see very well or that he didn't see anybody. 
    And of course, this illustrates the equivocality that sometimes creeps into reports of an interview and why witnesses should not be confronted with them on the stand. 
    This goes back to the congressional purpose behind the statute, fairness to the witness in the process of impeaching him at trial. 
    I'd like to point out that no bad faith on the part of the Government has been demonstrated below and I don't believe was claimed in the briefs submitted here and that we do have the court and government counsel below trying to do what they thought was the right thing in complying with the statute. 
    And that the procedures open to the defense were not completely used. 
    If they had any doubts about this problem, they could have pursued it further but did not. 
    And the record is, therefore, somewhat equivocal on this point. 
    We submit that no injustice has been done in this case and a complete reading of the briefs will disclose that this is true. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Louison, before you start, would you mind just clearing up in my mind. 
    There was some -- some little question as to whether you and your -- your counsel agreed on -- on the situation or disagreed. 
    And I -- I would just like to pursue the one question that I asked you.Do you vouch for the fact that the Government did not do anything irregular or do you say that, for want of the information, you do not -- you do not contend that the Government did anything wrong?
speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="6857.675" stopTime="6857.696">

speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="6859.276" stopTime="6878.068">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    That's precisely what I intended. 
    I think I used the words to Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    I do not suggest any wrongdoing and of course, that was based on the fact that I had no evidence of it and as you sated about the same way you just did now to Mr. O'Donnell was precisely, as I understood, what I had said.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6878.068" stopTime="6900.792">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did you ever suggest anywhere, anywhere before this answer, not that you suggested now, did you ever suggest anywhere either, one, that there might have been wrongdoing or two, that this is a nice way for the Government to get out of the Jencks case? 
    Did you ever suggest that anywhere? 
    Could I find it in your brief in the Court of Appeals?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, I know, but it's my belief to that.

    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    No. 
    I had no evidence of it and I wasn't to suggest it, and I did not --

    Your point was that it was immaterial --

speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="6929.078" stopTime="6935.502">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    That's right, that there must be compliance with the statute or there's a vacuum. 
    I do have my rights and I don't have my rights.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6935.502" stopTime="6936.877">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand that.

    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    And if I may, if -- if it please the Court, read at this time, Judge McCarthy did say "I have a great-- " page 1806 of their transcript, "I have a great deal of confidence in this Bureau. 
    I know how this Bureau operates." 
    From -- there's an old accent Latin maxim, "ex nihilo nihil fit" from nothing -- nothing comes.If the original notes were destroyed, how, in the name of God, could a defendant bring in and have available for him that which a witness will say, "That was what he read back to me and I adopted it as the statement he made." 
    "How are you going to show it?" 
    In addressing the U.S. Attorney, he said, "All you've got to do if that's the case and defeat this Act by making copies and tearing up the originals." 
    So, that point which you suggested as point two in which we impress upon the Court, it would happen way back at the time of the trial and was suggested in the Court of Appeals and it's pressed here in this Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6990.246" stopTime="6994.840">

    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    I don't wish to engage in quarrel with His Honor. 
    All I say is that I have no evidence of wrongdoing and as the Chief Justice heard from what I said, it was what I intended to say and what I understood in my mind. 
    I had no evidence of it and I was not about to suggest it because I do not consider it important to the outcome of this case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="7021.216" stopTime="7021.375">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But your associate had suggested that --

    You do have two or three minutes more, I think, if you wish to use it.
speaker="melvin_s_louison" startTime="7056.635" stopTime="7205.741">
    Mr. Melvin S. Louison 
    Then I wish to say this, Your Honor please. 
    As the various Justices and yourself has interpreted this matter, it comes down to the point where assuming, now, all the best in favor of the Government but taking the position, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated, that there was a statement in existence at one time which was producible. 
    Now, if that be so, now take the evidence in favor of the Government that it was either lost, destroyed or misplaced for nothing but the very best of reasons on behalf of the Government. 
    What happens to -- to the defendants who have the protection of the statute and therefore, the statute was passed to limit the right to discovery after Jencks, and what -- what do we have now? 
    The Government now says, "Well, we don't have it in our possession." 
    And by the way, the statute says "in the possession of the United States". 
    It does not limit it to the prosecuting attorney or any branch of the Government "in the possession of the United States." 
    What do we have? 
    The statute was passed to limit our demands. 
    Now, we come within the limitations and we're left hanging in the air. 
    And -- and I say that is -- that cannot be the intent of the Congress and as I read the prior cases in -- in the Rosenberg, Palermo, Jencks and what inferences you can take from all of them in the various opinions in them, there must be a solution and there must be an alternative. 
    There must be a sanction, as I stated in my original argument. 
    If the requirements of the statute are not complied with, then what happens? 
    Now, true, the secondary evidence may be given to us or it may be stricken but there must be something. 
    It can't be left hanging. 
    You -- Your Honors will notice, when the time comes, that -- in studying the record, that it does appear in the record that Judge McCarthy ordered production of the statement. 
    He says, "I will order it produced." 
    There's been a foundation here. 
    And then, he never referred to it again. 
    It was left in a state of a suspended animation. 
    Why? 
    Because we're left with the same vacuum we're left here -- with here this afternoon. 
    There seems to be no solution, unless our position is adopted that the solution as we -- the evidence is either stricken as is required by the statute or in the alternative, we get the secondary evidence. 
    But I submit in closing that there must be a solution. 
    The law wasn't intended to leave a vacuum.
