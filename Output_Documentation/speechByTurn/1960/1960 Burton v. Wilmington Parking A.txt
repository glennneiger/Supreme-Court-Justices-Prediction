    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    William H. Burton, appellant versus Wilmington Parking Authority, et al. 
    Mr. Solicitor General, you may continue your argument.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9.770" stopTime="247.079">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    May it please the Court? 
    Towards the close of the argument on Tuesday, I was beginning to develop those points of state participation or contact which lead us to the conclusion that it is fair to describe this case as one in which the State is operating a single, self-sustaining governmental unit in which the petitioners were denied equality of treatment, and which therefore violated the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    I mentioned as the first of those factors, the circumstance that this is state-owned land, that the State retains a connection with it as lessor, and indeed we think that that would be ground enough to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The second significant circumstance is that these leased premises are physically an integral part of the building which is currently operated by the State and currently used by the State for a governmental purpose. 
    This circumstance seems to me to distinguish all those cases where you have an isolated piece of property which the State may own and lease, and then ceases to have any contact with. 
    Now I'd like to take a minute to describe in somewhat more detail, since the court below said it could take judicial notice of this building, just what the physical arrangements are. 
    The parking facility is a building. 
    It occupies all of one block on the street which it fronts principally, and it reaches back a good two-thirds of the normal block on each of the two streets running at right angles. 
    On the front, it apparently is about three stories high, and the ground, I think, slopes down behind. 
    So there are about three stories and a roof available for parking. 
    On the front of the building, the upper portion is vertical with the street; that is, it reaches right out to the travel portion of the street and the stores which are along the front, with the coffee shop right in the middle, are recessed back in, so as to form sort of an arcade over the sidewalk. 
    At either end of this arcade, anyone walking along the sidewalk to get to the coffee shop would see immediately over him, on the upper part of the building, "Wilmington Parking Authority," thus emphasizing that the whole building was a state building and this is true at either end. 
    Then on the front of the building, directly over the coffee shop appears, "Mid-Town Parking Center," identifying this facility and separating it out from what I understand are some other parking lots owned by the Wilmington Parking Authority. 
    On the front of the building, on the roof over the coffee shop, are two flagpoles, which on the ordinary days of the week fly the United States flag and the flag of Delaware. 
    I emphasize these points for two reasons. 
    In the first place, it does seem to me to underscore the integrity, the unity, of this building, and therefore of all the activities which take place in it. 
    And second, it seems to me that it makes very plain a point which I mentioned Tuesday, towards anyone who was the victim of discrimination in this coffee shop could not escape the fact that the discrimination took place in a public building and literally, here, under the flag of the United States and of Delaware, and I think that --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I didn't meant to interrupt you –
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="247.881" stopTime="253.470">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    -- I just wanted to say I thought that distinguished this case from many others which might be put.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="253.470" stopTime="266.196">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    The question I wanted to ask you was, is the restaurant itself, either on its menus or its advertising literature, carry any notation that it's identified in any way with the Delaware --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="266.196" stopTime="352.452">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    None that I know of. 
    It would be identified only by the physical appearance, but I think -- I do want to say, I think anyone who saw this would realize, as I certainly did when I went to see it, that this was truly part of one building, and that, while the architecture is quite different, it was in a public building, almost as obviously as in the restaurant facilities in this Court or in another courthouse. 
    The third point to emphasize is that, just as the building is structurally a unit, so is the entire enterprise bound up financially into a single project. 
    The Supreme Court of Delaware, when it sustained the constitutionality of this statute against the charge that this was leasing for a private commercial purpose, and therefore not within the power of the State, ruled that the leases could be permitted only to the extent that such leasing is necessary and feasible to enable the Authority to finance the project. 
    In other words, this isn't separate or surplus or extra property, of the kind of property mentioned in Derrington and Plumber. 
    This property is essential to the conduct of this state enterprise. 
    The fourth thing that I would call to your attention --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="352.452" stopTime="390.785">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, may I ask you -- may I break in? 
    That third fact would apply to every leasing because whether the State leases in order to derive money from the leasing or part of the money for maintaining the state enterprise, or whether it's to go into the fisc of the State, into the treasury generally, or whether any deficit is to be covered by taxation or unidentified state funds for purposes of the State Constitution, it seems to be immaterial. 
    That's merely a choice of how the State does the financing, isn't it?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="390.785" stopTime="394.240">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That isn't the view that the Supreme Court of Delaware took of it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="394.240" stopTime="411.797">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand that, but isn't that true, as a matter of -- as a significant factor, that it's merely an expression or a formulation or an exercise of a financial choice by the State in financing the enterprise.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="411.797" stopTime="445.722">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    It's an exercise of financial choice, and I think that I might well be making the same contention, but the fact that this is bound together and is viewed, whereas this would not have been permitted by Delaware had it been leasing of a separate property just to get revenues, whereas it was regarded that it'd be essentially by the State, that it be an essential part of one single enterprise, does seem to me to be another circumstance, perhaps not an essential one, binding it all into a unit.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="445.722" stopTime="461.785">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You're not foreclosing, or you don't you want the Court to foreclose, assuming they're with you on these confirming or strengthening items, they're not confirming that any lease of state property is a mode by which the State exercises its power?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="461.785" stopTime="514.611">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    No, quite the contrary and perhaps I should say now something that applies not only to this point, but to a number of distinctions that I shall draw, that I think in this field it is important to consider how this case relates to others that it suggests, and that the Court might wish to satisfy itself that there were administrable and rational distinctions between this case and, for example, Justice Harlan's suggestion that this might have been leased for a private park, in all those cases, I think it s important for us to put them to one side. 
    It's equally important not to prejudge them. 
    In this field under the Fourteenth Amendment, we really can't foretell it's complete application, or even entirely know our own meanings, until experience and time have given us a greater insight.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="514.611" stopTime="526.948">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The implicit starting point, the implicit premise of your argument I take it is that this is precisely a field where case-by-case unfolding becomes not only relevant but essential?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="526.948" stopTime="594.692">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That's correct. 
    Three other points deserve somewhat brief mention. 
    The first is that this property was acquired by a state agency with the power of eminent domain. 
    It in fact was all negotiated private sale, but the agency did have the power of eminent domain. 
    And it seems o me that that fact, taken with the financial necessity for these leases, goes far to destroy the argument that's presented here by he appellees to the effect that this is extra property or surplus property. 
    Indeed, the Supreme Court of Delaware, in passing upon the constitutionality of this statute, said of these leases, or one of these leases, “Clearly it does not fall within the scope of the rule permitting temporary commercial leasing of public facilities not immediately needed for public purposes” and then went on and said that this, all of this property, was being used for public purposes.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="594.692" stopTime="607.118">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Mr. Solicitor General, supposing this space had been sold, although physically remaining in the same way in which you have described it, instead of leased, would that make any difference in your opinion?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="607.118" stopTime="656.333">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I think we'd have a very different case. 
    What I said to Justice Frankfurter I think would be pertinent here, but in the law the lessor has long been regarded, as the Court knows, as having a continuing relation to the property that he leases, and certain responsibilities in connection with property that he leases. 
    And therefore I would distinguish this case from all those cases in which there is, if I may be colloquial, a one-shot proposition. 
    The State sells the land, the State grants a subsidy, or disposes of the chattel. 
    Here there is, through this relation of lessor and lessee, a continuing tie, which fits in with these other bonds that I've mentioned.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="656.333" stopTime="660.534">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Of course, you are going to say you would have the same continuing -- these same factors that you emphasize —
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="660.534" stopTime="694.729">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    You'd have the same physical tie, but you'd have a relationship that the law had long regarded differently and it might be thought that physical tie was not enough to impose the obligation whereas the relationship of the lessor, who had convented to keep part of this premises in repair is one which frequently carried affirmative duties in relation to the land. 
    So I would say that was another of these cases which can be logically distinguished in that we shouldn't undertake to decide them now because they are different case.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    These revenue bonds, these bonds from which these premises were built are to paid only out of the revenues from the profit.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Including both –
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="723.098" stopTime="746.040">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Including the parking charges and the lease. 
    The difficulty which the State faced in setting this up was that to finance such a building without leasing some of it for commercial purposes, would have required parking charges so large couldn't have been erected, the bonds wouldn't sell as revenue bonds.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="746.040" stopTime="749.981">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But it wasn't entirely financed by revenue bonds, was it? 
    There was no public --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="749.981" stopTime="774.882">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    No, that was – there were two additional points of public involvement that I was going to mention. 
    One is the fact that record isn't entirely clear but at least a $10,800,000 of taxpayers' money went into this building and the second point is that this building is wholly tax exempt.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="774.882" stopTime="777.167">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    What was the face amount of the bonds?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="777.167" stopTime="888.904">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    The record, according to my best recollection, doesn't show Mr. Justice Clark. 
    Taking these facts all together it seems to us that two conclusions follow. 
    First, that this project is bound together as a unit so that each part of it is colored by the characteristics of the other part and the second that the hole is infused with a public or governmental quality. 
    In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that this is a view of the project, curiously, which the Supreme Court of Delaware took when it was passing upon the constitutionality of the statute. 
    The challenge to the statute was very similar to the argument which is made here, to wit, that these would be private commercial leases and not a state activity and the argument that was made was that the State can't go into the business of leasing its property for private commercial purposes because this would enable it to go into every kind of private enterprise. 
    The Supreme Court of Delaware rejected that argument, using the phrase that I have quoted so often, to wit, that this was not simply an ordinary commercial leasing, but that it was a single self-sustaining governmental unit. 
    And one of the questions that was put to the court was whether it was proper to grant a tax exemption, or to give this Authority the power of eminent domain, and the court answered that question saying, “Since we have held the purpose of the project as a whole to be a public one, the answer must be in the affirmative.”

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What's the citation? 
    Is that in your brief?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="891.658" stopTime="988.757">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I think it's in a footnote, but the case is Wilmington Parking against Rankin. 
    It's 34 Delaware Chancery, page 439, 105 Atlantic Second 614. 
    In conclusion, I would like to emphasize two observations. 
    The first is that when the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment sought to assure equality for all men in relation to the State, they plainly meant a State in all its activities and all its aspects. 
    Similarly this Court has never been grudging in its interpretation of state action. 
    It's not strained, as I read the decisions, for fine distinctions concerning the degree of state involvement necessary to call forth the guarantee of racial equality. 
    Quite the contrary, it has struck down every form of discrimination that affected a man in his relation to his government, every form of discrimination between the citizen and his government. 
    Since there was unquestionably such a relation here, since this project was one, and a project where the petitioners when they requested service in this restaurant, could not help knowing that they were on the property of the State, we submit that the Fourteenth Amendment is called into play, and that the judgment below should be reversed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="988.757" stopTime="1001.497">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't want to go beyond the circumference of this case in all events, but is it within the circumference to ask whether the jewelry shop, is one of these things a jewelry shop?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1001.497" stopTime="1098.517">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    There's a jewelry shop and a bookstore, and I had promised to comment on that and then forgot with the passage of time. 
    May I comment on that somewhat obliquely? 
    It seems to me that the central fact here is that this is a restaurant open to the general public, for which the proprietor has shown no interest in the selection of his customers except for this bit of racial discrimination. 
    That kind of case seems to me to stand at one end of a rather broad range. 
    At the other end would go a lease for an apartment or a social club, possibly a lawyer's office or a doctor's office, of state property in this building. 
    In those situations, clearly there must be taken into account the interest in the private choice of friends, associates, possibly of his clients. 
    Now, the restaurant is a place of public accommodation, in the Nineteenth Century language of William Sumner and others, I'm not quite clear whether the jewelry store or the bookstore belongs in the first category or in the same category as a restaurant. 
    It seems to me that in most of our eyes a restaurant has a somewhat different characteristic from other shops and we must also recognize that there are certainly some stores which do make a choice among customers on non-invidious grounds.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1098.517" stopTime="1129.485">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You spoke at the outset, you said that this restaurant, as it were, invited everyone. 
    As you well know, at the common law every business engaged in business was called a common calling and then that conception shrunk so far as there was a mandatory duty to serve everybody. 
    But I should think the bookstore or the jewelry shop in this building are no less inviting Tom, Dick, and Harry, than this restaurant.

   Argument of Clair John Killoran
speaker="clair_john_killoran" startTime="1142.112" stopTime="1528.065">
    Mr. Clair John Killoran 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors. 
    The Wilmington Parking Authority, the appellee that I represent, respectfully submit that there's only one question in this case, that is on the merits and that is whether the action or the conduct of Eagle can fairly be said to be the conduct of the Authority, and thus state action inhibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    As we know, the courts have held on numerous occasions that private acts of discrimination are not as such illegal. 
    When, however, governmental discrimination as opposed to private discrimination is charged, it then becomes the duty of the court to examine the facts, and if the facts support the charge, to prevent the discrimination and, of course, the Authority subscribes to those principles. 
    The cases cited by all the parties in this case are rested on various grounds, but I think it is generally agreed that general definitions of state action are not apt in all factual contexts. 
    Therefore, it would seem appropriate that we examine the pertinent facts, the real facts in this case, to see if those facts support the charge made by Mr. Burton, the appellant. 
    After the Wilmington Parking Authority acquired the land at Ninth and Shipley Streets in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, on which the subject facility and subject restaurant are located, it retained experts to advise it on what type of structure should be erected to accommodate parking. 
    The Authority was advised that the streets in this area would only accommodate a certain given number of motor vehicles, and that a multi-level masonry building should be constructed to accommodate that number of cars. 
    The financial forecasts were prepared, and on the basis of those forecasts the underwriters concluded that the parking facility as planned could not be financed from parking revenue alone. 
    So then the Authority elected to exercise a right granted to it under the Enabling Act and provide space for commercial leasing in addition to the parking space that was required and recommended by the consulting engineers. 
    The parking space itself was not curtailed or diminished. 
    The building was redesigned to provide for additional space which would be commercial space. 
    With the anticipated revenue from rentals as well as the parking revenues, the underwriters purchased the bonds in the aggregate amount of 2.5 million dollars. 
    Even though the City of Wilmington paid all the consideration for the land, the facility itself was constructed from the proceeds of the revenue bonds, with one exception. 
    In respect to the commercial space, only roofs and walls and basements were constructed. 
    In all the commercial space the tenants had to construct their own facilities, own finishings, own furnishings, own decorations, own air conditioning, at their own cost, without any right of reimbursement from the Authority. 
    We advertised for public bids for commercial space, and prior to the closing date for the bids a Mr. Rankin, a taxpayer of the City of Wilmington, threatened to attempt to enjoin the Authority from entering the field of private enterprise by leasing commercial space. 
    The Authority immediately filed a declaratory judgment action in our Court of Chancery, and under a provision of our State Constitution it was certified directly to our Supreme Court, which is our court of last resort. 
    The Supreme Court sustained the right of the Authority to lease commercial space, to the extent but only to the extent that it was necessary and feasible to help finance the contemplated project. 
    Now the Supreme Court ruled that we did not comply with the requirements of competitive bidding and that we had to request bids again. 
    Now, after the Rankin case, the Enabling Act was amended in order to permit the Authority to negotiate the leases if after requests for competitive bids were made and none received, or if received, if rejected by the Authority, then the Authority could negotiate leases for this commercial space. 
    After we requested competitive bids and none were received, over a period of time, and a substantial period of time, we finally negotiated four leases for the commercial space, one such being that of Eagle which is being discussed here. 
    The Eagle lease appears in the record beginning on page 13. 
    And if you'll examine the lease you will note, few minor items, with the exception of a few minor items that the Authority is to provide, Eagle at its own sole cost expense is responsible for constructing a restaurant, all finishings, all decorations, all fixtures, all air conditioning and Eagle retained its own architect, its own engineers, its own contractors, and paid for the construction of the facility out of its own funds without right of any reimbursement from the City, State, or the Authority. 
    It's submitted, Your Honors, that the Authority in reality leased four unfinished masonry walls, an unfinished roof, an unfinished floor, and basement to Eagle, and Eagle constructed a restaurant, bars, cocktail lounges, and banquet rooms in and on the property of the facility. 
    Now, Mr. Cox has mentioned about our signs --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Could I, before you leave that subject, could you tell us briefly in what respects the Authority does contain control?
speaker="clair_john_killoran" startTime="1539.164" stopTime="1561.998">
    Mr. Clair John Killoran 
    The Authority provides heat only, and it only retains control in the event of default under the lease, whether through bankruptcy or any other manner of default, it can evict. 
    It has no control over the restaurant as such and its operations, its policies or whatnot.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1561.998" stopTime="1568.767">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Has it control over whether it remains a restaurant or goes into the shoe business, for instance?
speaker="clair_john_killoran" startTime="1568.767" stopTime="1661.167">
    Mr. Clair John Killoran 
    Yes, it does have that control, Chief Justice, because in negotiating leases we couldn't have negotiated successfully with Eagle if we're going to have another restaurant right next to it. 
    So in the lease itself, it restricts the use to the restaurant purposes, including bars and banquet rooms. 
    The lease so provides and provides they can only use it for that purpose. 
    Now, when this restaurant was completed, the construction of it was completed, it was not provided, nor is there provided today any public entrance from the parking facility itself to the restaurant, or as a matter of fact, to any of the tenants are there public entrances from the parking facility to the tenant. 
    The pubic entrance to the Eagle is on the street level on Ninth Street, and you enter directly into Eagle, and on the first floor level it has three large beautiful dining rooms, with a bar and cocktail lounge. 
    You go to the basement level, it has banquet rooms and accommodations for upwards of 300 people. 
    I bring this out at this time with the purpose of attempting to illustrate that it was not the intent of the Parking Authority to provide service for the benefit of the patrons of the Authority It had only one sole purpose, as expressed in the Enabling Act itself to obtain revenues, rental income. 
    That was the only purpose.

    Mr. Clair John Killoran 
    It does not have a thing to do with segregation, but the Authority negotiated in good faith with these various tenants on the basis that it'd be a private use and not a public use, such as we're referring to. 
    I think, in fairness to the tenants, in fairness to the people we negotiated with, they demand our support in this.

    Suppose one of these petitioners here owned a portion of that property as his home, and it was condemned from him, taken away from him by power of eminent domain and then you built this establishment on there. 
    You believe that it's a duty of the Authority to maintain the position which would exclude that man from equal treatment in that property?

    But I think it's a matter of common knowledge that these parking facilities are very often developed in places where the buildings are substandard and where they want to get rid of the buildings and make a better use of the property and it's not at all uncommon to dispossess these very kind of people in order to have a public facility of that kind and where that is the situation I'm still wondering why the Authority feels it incumbent on them to take the position that these people have the right to segregate when it's their problem and not the part of the Authority.
speaker="clair_john_killoran" startTime="2013.997" stopTime="2082.735">
    Mr. Clair John Killoran 
    I think, Chief Justice, philosophically I would agree with you. 
    However, we feel, on I think good grounds that I think I can still demonstrate, that there are two uses in this property. 
    One is a private use and one is a public use, and our Supreme Court in the Rankin case so held. 
    It expressly held that the commercial leasing was absolutely unrelated to the public use of parking and it permitted the Authority, the state agency, to trespass upon private enterprise slightly, because the dominant and underlying purpose of the Authority was to be subservient to a public use. 
    I think the facts in the case are such that, from an attorney's point of view, at least mine in studying it, I feel that I should take the position that it's private use and not public use.

speaker="clair_john_killoran" startTime="2117.798" stopTime="2217.542">
    Mr. Clair John Killoran 
    I think for this reason. 
    I think we've got to look at two or three different facets. 
    One, the purpose of the commercial leasing was for revenue, and it's our position, and I think it's a fairly sound position, that merely because Eagle pays rent to the Authority, its private use as a restaurant does not change to a public one any more than a governing body exacting revenue through taxation from a private corporation places that private corporation in the category of a public corporation and also, if we keep these facts in mind, and the tests that have been laid down in the various cases, Eagle constructed its restaurant on this public property. 
    Eagle spent over 240,000 dollars on this restaurant. 
    That's not in the record, but that's a fact. 
    Eagle was not invited there; it's a happenstance it's there, but when it did negotiate this lease, there was no thought or no intent on the part of either party that it should serve a public purpose, namely, serve the patrons of the Authority. 
    And also there is, I would think, that if those facts are accepted, and the only reason is that income only was required, and there's no factual situation that indicates that it's being used for public use, I don't see how the Fourteenth Amendment applies.

speaker="clair_john_killoran" startTime="2288.928" stopTime="2391.929">
    Mr. Clair John Killoran 
    Our Supreme Court in the Rankin case answered that question in this manner - It said that -- it held that the Authority could condemn. 
    It also held that it could enter private enterprise to the extent, but only to the extent, that it was feasible for financial purposes. 
    Our Supreme Court in that case followed the New York Authority case. 
    You'll recall in that case the New York Port Authority was to exercise certain obligations under a compact with New Jersey relating to transportation. 
    It built a 14-story building, and it only utilized the first two floors and basement for the purpose of the Port Authority. 
    The rest was rented, one, two, three floors rented to the New York Life Insurance Company and various ones. 
    Ninety-eight percent of the income from that building was from private tenants. 
    Now, in that case the Court of Appeals of New York held that the primary purpose was transportation, a public purpose; they sustained the right of the Authority to build this large building and to rent it for private uses, private purposes. 
    Now, our court followed mainly that decision. 
    But, answering your question one step further, I think that we got to distinguish between public purpose and a public building. 
    Now, this was condemned for a public building; but it wasn't all to be utilized for a public purpose.

    But it appears to us Your Honor that this lease was not used for purpose of discriminating and under the lease itself there's no joinder in the enterprise on the part of the Authority or no reservation of control on the part of the Authority and the record discloses that the Authority has never even suggested or advised the Eagle on any policy of admission or exclusion. 
    It seems to us that this – that the act of leasing here and the lease or the lease, does not belong to long series of strategems that governing bodies had employed in attempt to deprive the Negro of his birth right, namely, equal protection of the laws. 
    There's only one single purpose here and that was revenue. 
    It's a form of taxation. 
    It's a form of obtaining revenue and that the Eagle was permitted to come in and on the property, public property, and to construct there on its facility at a great cost.

    He doesn't even know, but in this case, the taxpayer did know and tried to sue them. 
    He threatened the Authority, he tried to enjoin the Authority because they were going into private enterprise by commercial leasing and the Supreme Court said no. 
    The state legislature has declared policy that off-street parking is required, and in connection with the financing only now, you can't do this, you can't lease to a service station; you can't lease to certain things, but otherwise, and on competitive bidding, you can lease to private enterprise to assist you in obtaining the funds. 
    I would like to make one final remark. 
    As before stated, we do not feel that this lease is one of those strategems that's been used by the Authority, or Eagle either, to deprive anybody of any rights. 
    In other words, we feel this lease does not fall within the category of the leases described and referred to in the decisions cited by the Government and by the appellant, for the reason that in those leases, all involved either a technique to evade state responsibility or that the property, though privately operated, was being used for public purposes.

   Argument of Thomas Herlihy, Jr.
speaker="thomas_herlihy_jr" startTime="2821.653" stopTime="3475.578">
    Mr. Thomas Herlihy, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court? 
    In order to present the legal argument for the Eagle, it is necessary that I implement and restate certain facts which have already been made. 
    These facts are essential to my legal argument. 
    The Eagle was incorporated in 1934 and has conducted a restaurant business in the City of Wilmington, with the exception of few months, since that date. 
    Now, the statute creating the Parking Authority provides power to lease a space in the facility, or spaces. 
    The leases under such provision fall into, and under the statutory provisions, fall into two categories, where the lessee may carry on the sale of gasoline and accessories, and provide service to motorists, that's the first category, as the statute sets it out. 
    Now, the second is where the lease may be for any commercial use and where the leasing is necessary and feasible for financing the operation of the facility. 
    The statute provides for public notice, for invitations to bid for leasing space. 
    Neither the legislative act nor the notice for the bids say anything as to what use is to be made of the space leased; nor is it stated anywhere in the statute or the bidding proposal procedure that the space was to be leased primarily to serve patrons of the parking facility. 
    As was stated, it's by mere chance that the space was awarded to a restaurant. 
    It could have been awarded to any other type of business. 
    And at no time, either in the legislative history or bidding or negotiating procedure was it stated that the Authority would provide a restaurant for the parking facility patrons. 
    The Eagle lease, as well as the leases of its neighbors, a bookshop, a camera shop, a retail food store, and a jewelry store fall into this category; that is, the second category of commercial leasing as provided for in this act. 
    The main and only public entrance to the Eagle and these stores is on the street on which these lessees front. 
    There are, as the law provides, fire exits. 
    Now the street on which these stores front, is basically a street, where shops -- where business of a retail nature is carried on. 
    The other two streets that are referred to by Mr. Cox are basically streets with the rear of buildings fronting on another main street, where they have other retail business shops and I pointed that out so that the Court would have that picture, that these are ordinary commercial businesses. 
    The Eagle was awarded the space it occupied because it submitted a successful proposal and negotiated for the space. 
    The public advertisement for the bid and the negotiations for this space put no restrictions upon the Eagle as to the patrons it would serve. 
    The Authority granted the Eagle a lease for twenty years, and this lease, as well as all other documents, puts no restriction on the Eagle as to what patrons it will serve. 
    The Authority at no time has made a statement of policy in this respect, nor has it attempted to dictate Eagle's policies. 
    As was stated, the Eagle through its own capital furnished substantially all of the furnishings and fixtures, including the air conditioning, to enable it to carry on the business of a restaurant, cocktail lounge, and banquet rooms. 
    In other words, the Eagle leased floor space and bare walls. 
    Now, considering these facts, it is my opinion that the legal issue is, whether the Eagle as a lessee of the Parking Authority, performing a function not related to the parking services of the facility, has violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Our position is that it has not been -- that there has not been a violation and in sustaining our position, we submit a two-fold approach which is in the alternative. 
    One, there was no state action in this case because Eagle's function as a restaurant, which is unrelated to the function of the Parking Authority, excludes it from the concept of state action. 
    Two, if it is established that there was state action in this case, then there is no violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because of the particular factual situation, because of the particular factual situation of this case. 
    Now, as to the first proposition, we submit that there is no integral relationship between the activities of Eagle and activities of the Parking Authority. 
    The respondent Eagle contends that the best method to determine whether or not a lessee of a state agency is part of state action is to analyze the functions of the state lessor and its private lessee and in this particular phase of the case, legal argument, developing what may be considered the functional answer in reply to the statements made by the Solicitor General. 
    The statute creating the Authority states that the purpose of the Authority is to provide off-street parking for the general public. 
    This legislative act further provides that the Authority may enter into a lease when the lessee may carry on the sale of gasoline, motor accessories, and services and again, let me say that this particular service would be part of the function of the Parking Authority, but there is no provision which directed the Authority to provide for any other particular service for its parking patrons, and there is nothing which states that it would provide a restaurant. 
    As already indicated, it happens that Eagle occupies a space in the facility not because it serves food but because it was a successful bidder for that space. 
    The area where the Eagle located is a prime area for a restaurant business, which was the situation there before the Parking Authority facility was constructed. 
    All of the businesses occupying space in the facility including the restaurant, front as I've already stated, on a main business street. 
    There is no public entrance from the parking area to the businesses. 
    The bidding and negotiations, of course, put no restrictions on the Eagle. 
    It was a bona fide landlord-tenant relationship. 
    The lease contains no provision whereby the Authority would be able to control the policies of the Eagle as to what patrons will or will not be served. 
    Nor does the record show that there was any subterfuge in the execution of this lease to control the Eagle's customer policies. 
    There were no collusive practices here in order to carry on discriminatory activities. 
    In the Wilmington area there is an atmosphere of racial tolerance and the motives of the Authority and the Eagle were to enter into a straight landlord and tenant relationship without any attempt to circumvent the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It is our position that the mere fact that rental income from the Eagle is necessary to finance the parking facility is not sufficient to bring a lessee within the sphere of state action. 
    To say that it is a controlling factor is to blow up that fact beyond its true proportions and in my opinion, to torture a landlord-tenant relationship into a possible principal-agent relationship when the principal is an instrumentality of the State, by making; the tenant an agent because the rental income there from is necessary for the landlord's continuance, is an arbitrary breakdown of legal relationships. 
    In the Derrington case there was a bona fide lease, but the function of the lessee was to cater to the patrons of the courthouse and that part of the courthouse which the restaurant occupied was planned, equipped, and furnished by the county. 
    The space that the Eagle occupies in this facility was neither planned equipped or furnished by the Parking Authority as a restaurant. 
    To state that rental income alone is the determining factor will lead to the clear conclusion that every necessary business transaction between the State and any private business which furnishes income or service to the State would immediately bring the private business involved within the scope of state action. 
    Let me take several examples. 
    Suppose that a CPA firm is called upon to audit the accounts of the Parking Authority. 
    This CPA firm comes on the premises. 
    It begins its audit. 
    It's a known fact that it's auditing the books and this firm has a record of discrimination, engaging in racial discrimination. 
    Now, obviously its participating, it's providing services to the State. 
    Is the Court going to say that this state action theory will reach out and say to that auditing firm, you are engaged in the discriminatory practices, you cannot carry on this work on the parking facility? 
    Now let's take for example, suppose that they have a breakdown in the plumbing system and the plumber comes along and he puts up his sign that he's doing the plumbing work there. 
    He is rendering services to the State and they find that the plumber was engaged in discriminatory practices, is the arm of the State to reach out and say, no you can't do this work with the Parking Authority because you engage in discriminatory practices? 
    In other words, what I am saying is that to rest this case on rental income is to lead to such absurdities as I just indicated and furthermore, suppose you had an instrumentality of the State which took some funds put it in a certificate of deposit in a bank, and drew income, interest income from that, is that very fact alone to say, well, this now makes that bank –

    He bases his argument, the Solicitor General bases his argument on what is considered more or less, if I may state it, the functional theory. 
    That is, we look at the functions. 
    The function of the Eagle, according to the Solicitor General, was to provide income to the Parking Authority so that it could carry on its enterprise. 
    I say you would have to break down the functions of the government lessor and the function of the private lessee. 
    I think you have to separate them. 
    That's where I take issue with it, and I had planned to just develop that right now, if you'll permit me to.

    What do you do with the Boynton case?
speaker="thomas_herlihy_jr" startTime="3685.321" stopTime="3911.984">
    Mr. Thomas Herlihy, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I think that the Boynton case is well put and I think that when you analyze the facts of the Boynton case I think that you can see that what I'm trying to reach here is applicable. 
    Now in the Boynton case the Court cut through all the legal relationships. 
    It ignored the fact that there was an attempt just to overcome the restaurant-keepers' nonlease situation. 
    It went back and stated; One, there was an agreement between the Trailways, the transit company or the carrier, and the terminal people. 
    The restaurant, the keeper in that particular instance had no connection by lease or otherwise, with the facility, that is, the bus terminal and what the Court did, the Court looked at the function of the lessee, if I may make my point now, Mr. Justice Harlan, it looked at the function of the lessee, and it saw that the function of the lessee was to serve those persons who were in travel in transit. 
    Now, we look at the function of the Eagle in this situation and ask ourselves, what is the function of the lessee in this case? 
    The function of the lessee is to serve the general public, not just merely the patrons of the Parking Authority, but to serve the general public. 
    And when you follow this functional theory to its natural conclusion, you can see very well, and to point this out I'd like to give you just a few of the tests that I would examine these situations on and I'm sure the Court must have examined them when they considered the Boynton case. 
    I ask myself, in the analysis of these cases, in determining to see whether or not there were any standards by which you could evaluate these cases? 
    Was there a bona fide transaction as a result of arm's-length negotiation? 
    That was the first one. 
    Then I took, was there any evidence of subterfuge in order to evade the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment? 
    And the third thing, is the lessee an integral part of the functions of the governmental lessor and fourth - Is there any statutory or administrative control of the lessee? 
    And when I applied these standards to this situation, it was my opinion that the Eagle should not be brought within the orbit of state action. 
    Now, if you take this case and the Boynton case, you'll see very well that it was rightly brought within the sphere of state action. 
    In furtherance of our contention that there was no state action here, we should like to suggest to the Court that prior definitions of state action should be re-examined. 
    Some modification 0f the approach to the solution of situation similar to our present case may be necessary. 
    With the permission of the Court, I have a statement here I'd like to read, that Mr. Justice Frankfurter made in the Gomillion case, “Particularly in dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution which derive content by an interpretative process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations based on and qualified by concrete situations which gave rise to them must not be applied out of context, in disregard of the variant controlling facts.” 
    And I say, Your Honors, that there are variant controlling facts in this case which should be examined in this particular situation.

speaker="thomas_herlihy_jr" startTime="3922.809" stopTime="3933.418">
    Mr. Thomas Herlihy, Jr. 
    I think that it is germane, and I think it has to be taken into account and Mr. Justice Harlan, I would like to also state that in the course and I will develop it right now --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3933.418" stopTime="3935.006">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How do you take that into account?
speaker="thomas_herlihy_jr" startTime="3935.006" stopTime="4300.432">
    Mr. Thomas Herlihy, Jr. 
    Well, I take it into account in this way. 
    Of course, there the private trust was administered by the Board of City Trustees of Philadelphia. 
    The Court stated that was improper because of the fact that Mr. Girard in his will had provided only for the education of white male children. 
    They removed the -- the Court stated that that was improper and that that was an exertion of a state power and when the case was remanded to the lower court, they were removed. 
    Now then, what happened? 
    The Orphan's Court in Philadelphia turned around and then appointed private trustees and there that was held to be a proper, although I say that was basically an exertion of state power, yet in that particular instance, when it remanded back to the Orphan's Court in Philadelphia, they turned around and substitute private trustees for public trustees and then subsequently the Supreme Court in Philadelphia held that that was not violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    So I say that basically that was an exertion when they got back to private trustees. 
    Then you had a matter of a private business and I state that it is difficult for me to really -- to challenge the holding, in one respect, but by the same time and I cite in my brief the Girard Trust Company case to show you that, in examining this whole principle of the matter of the exertion of state power, you've got to look at all aspects of it. 
    With that principle in mind, let us review the cases. 
    Usually the state action has been broadly and generally defined as an exertion of state power. 
    This definition has been paraphrased to mean a touch of the government's thumb on the scale. 
    Now, I develop from that to Berman versus Parker, in which the Court held that private property could be taken and then resold for a public purpose to private individuals and that's the starting point. 
    Now, in the Dorsey case, which was a situation where the property was taken by a governmental agency, resold to a private developer who practiced a discriminatory practices. 
    Now, these are designated as the blighted area cases. 
    Now, they certainly indicate the power of the government was used to acquire a blighted area, clear the site, and then negotiate a resale of the land to private redevelopers. 
    In this process of governmental action, it no doubt happened that the homes of Negroes were taken, as in the Dorsey case, which was a discrimination against Negroes by private developers. 
    Yet, the Court was not concerned with violations of the Fourteenth Amendment when it was obvious that, in the Berman and Dorsey cases, there was an exertion of state power. 
    Now, in the Derrington, the Derrington and Ashwander cases, now the Derrington case, of course, is the courthouse space where the space in the courthouse was leased, and the Ashwander case was where the Supreme Court upheld the right of the TVA to sell surplus electricity or to lease surplus electricity to private individuals. 
    Now, these cases are labeled by us as the surplus property cases in our brief, and in developing this, I say that I am not drawing a direct analogy between the surplus cases or do I want to be taken as to say that this extra space that was set up in the Eagle for business purposes is to be considered surplus. 
    I'm only trying to show to what extent the exertion of state power has gone without being considered as being violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    These cases indicate that once surplus property is leased, the lessee is free to deal with its property almost without any possibility of being charged with a Fourteenth Amendment violation. 
    And I argue by analogy that here we have a private lessee now in charge of the space that has been leased to it by the lessor, the governmental lessor, it is now in the category of a private lessee and has the right to enjoy all the privileges of a private lessee. 
    Just to show you to what extent, in trying to determine the boundaries of what is meant by an exertion of state power, look at the licensing cases, where there has obviously been an exertion of state power in granting an individual the right to carry on a business. 
    And in many instances the licensing may be in a discriminatory practice -- the licensee may engage in discriminatory practices. 
    For example, we have a theater in Wilmington called the Ri-llto Theatre. 
    Now, the State granted to that theater the license to carry on a theater. 
    It censors the films that go on in that -- are carried on in that theater. 
    Obviously, in my opinion that s an exertion of state power and yet, that theater engages in discnminatory practices. 
    So I state that -- also I've now covered the Girard Trust use, but I would like to restate that certainly the acts of the Orphan s Court in removing the public trustees and substituting private trustees was an exercise of governmental power. 
    And yet, that act, or that substitution was not considered violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.

    I don't think the Dorsey case, I don't recall whether that got into court or not, but the Dorsey case certainly has to be examined because right there is where there was an exercise of state power by the State of New York. 
    It acquired the land and sold it to the Stuyvesant Corporation, who turned around and practiced racial discrimination. 
    Now, I say that that in itself demonstrates that in one instance the court will say, all right, that is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in other instances it will. 
    Now, I think there has to be some determining factor, and I think that when a business is basically a private business and can he put in that category, as I feel the Eagle should, then I think that we have to state that we cannot interfere in that type of business.

    But that for me is a very different question as to what consequences follow by virtue of the relationship of the so called private enterprise to the State in regard to the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Yes, but I'm saying that there was an exertion of state power, and when the private lessee as a result of, maybe, using his electricity, was discriminated in any way, there is no question that that private lessee has a right to discriminate.

    We haven't got -- the discriminatory aspect which you draw from the Ashwander case was not before the Court in the Ashwander case and hasn't been before the Court since and so we're not concerned about whether the TVA could, or its trustees, discriminatorily serve the farmers in that region.

    Then I take and move onto what I call the blighted property area cases, that is the Dorsey case and the Parker versus Berman, and I come down than and state, well what does this all add up to and as I have already indicated it, and you may say, well where is this analysis getting us and that's where you came in on me with this question. 
    Well, even though the decision in the Boynton case, as I indicated to Mr. Justice Clark, is not entirely in our favor. 
    I do think that you do have to take the -- and use the analysis of the Boynton case, the Court in that case, and try to -- let's look at the relationship of the parties and see what functions that they perform and that basically is what I designate as the functional theory of my case.

    Mr. Thomas Herlihy, Jr. 
    Oh, yes indeed. 
    But let me say this -- if I may take that point, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and use it insofar as Mr. Justice Black is concerned I would say this that if you have a business that has been induced to come into a community and it's held out to them that, here, you come in here and we'll permit you to be tax exempt for five to ten years or whatever it may be. 
    To me that's an exertion of state power and in the definitions, it's the thumb on the scale.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You may be referring further than the Solicitor General?
speaker="thomas_herlihy_jr" startTime="5344.292" stopTime="5468.764">
    Mr. Thomas Herlihy, Jr. 
    Well no, but what I'm coming about to, I'm going to bring it back to my particular position, in this respect. 
    Now, it may be necessary for that community to do just that to induce that business to come there, so that the general welfare of the community is as necessary. 
    What I'm pointing out is this, that in these cases we have got to consider the general welfare of the entire community. 
    All right, a particular group may suffer as a result of this taking or this exertion of state power, as the case may be, but by and large the downtown business area is saved, the community is saved from the usual decadence that goes with downtown business areas. 
    It's improved. 
    It means that the general welfare is in a much better position as a result of that and just before I close, I would like to call the Court's attention to one matter. 
    This case started in equity. 
    It's a chancery proceeding and I want to say this, that in the Jones versus Marva case, Marva Theater case, the Court considered an angle which I think merits attention. 
    In that case the court stated, “Let's balance the equities in this situation.” 
    Now, Marva Theaters in that particular situation had expended a lot of money in the theater. 
    They stated they tried to work out some arrangement through his actions they weren't able to complete what was the suggested procedure. 
    Now, here is Eagle. 
    It expended a lot of money. 
    The record shows that back in 1957 the class of which the plaintiff, the appellant in this case, is a part, could have very well come in and asked for a declaratory judgment and had this matter stated. 
    But no, this matter goes on for all these years, and suddenly we're met, after the Eagle has been in business for a period of time. 
    I think that that's inherent in this case, and I think that it's inherent in any court of equity to consider and balance these equities.

    And nothing was done, nothing went beyond the grievance. 
    The answer of the president of the Parking Authority at that point was, the contract has already been let and there's no doubt that that would and it did happen.

    Now, if the Eagle had been part and parcel of a scheme to defeat the ends of the Fourteenth Amendment, I would look at it differently.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your time is up, but there is one question I wish you would answer (Inaudible). 
    As I understand it, you've argued this case, the case has been argued on the basis that the power and rights of the State in leasing property owned by all of your people of the State is no greater and no less with reference to the obligations imposed on it in leasing and though the State were a private human being. 
    Your whole argument is on that basis.
speaker="thomas_herlihy_jr" startTime="5714.685" stopTime="5717.060">
    Mr. Thomas Herlihy, Jr. 
    It's a private business.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5717.060" stopTime="5744.981">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So that when the State owns property which it decides to use and lease, not sell, but lease, all the rights that a private person would have in making that lease the State must have although it can or could use that method of regulating the use of the property, instead of passing laws --

    Mr. Thomas Herlihy, Jr. 
    It could very well --

speaker="thomas_herlihy_jr" startTime="5746.479" stopTime="5769.333">
    Mr. Thomas Herlihy, Jr. 
    It could very well, because what happens in many government contracts Mr. Justice Black is there are specific provisions written right into the contract. 
    And I brought along that, I'm not going to take the time to quote that to you, but in many government enterprises it's specifically stated that there shall be no discrimination and that would solve the question right here. 
    If that had been in this lease, none of us would be here.

   Argument of Louis L. Redding
speaker="louis_l_redding" startTime="5779.833" stopTime="5963.731">
    Mr. Louis L. Redding 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    I would briefly like to summarize the position of the appellant here. 
    However, before I do that I hope the Court will permit me to make one digression which is not in the record, and I would assume to do that only because there have been a number of references made to facts which are not in the record. 
    Your Honor, the Chief Justice presumed a hypothetical case in which the land on which the facility is now erected had been occupied by disadvantaged members of a minority. 
    This was not the situation in this case. 
    This land was extremely valuable land in the center city which was then used for a commercial purpose. 
    So that the plaintiff here was not disadvantaged in that manner, but the fact outside the record I'd like to mention is the fact that the plaintiff is a member of the City Council of the City of Wilmington, Delaware, a fact which is well known to all the parties in this matter, and was well known to the courts. 
    Now, I mention that not as giving him any rights superior to the rights of any members of the class whom he represents, but as indicating that as a member of City Council, which under the statute which creates this Authority, has the right to confirm persons appointed to the Authority, he did have intimate knowledge of the operation of this parking facility. 
    He brought his action merely as a member of the minority group, and the basis of his claim was that this was state property. 
    Now, we've set forth in our brief all of the indicia of state property which associate with this particular facility. 
    The most important aspect of the relationship of the lessee to the lessor here is that the legislature prohibits leasing except insofar as leasing is necessary to carry out a governmental function. 
    To that extent, the lessee is an instrumentality of the public lessor for the purpose of carrying out a public function. 
    And it is the position of the appellant here that this instrumentality of the public lessor should be affected by the same constitutional restraints that the public lessor is.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5963.731" stopTime="5973.266">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But as you indicate, does it make any difference to you that Mr. Chapman occupies the public position that he did? 
    Does it make any difference to you?
speaker="louis_l_redding" startTime="5973.266" stopTime="5974.747">
    Mr. Louis L. Redding 
    I said, sir, I tried to indicate that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5974.747" stopTime="5987.361">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does it make any difference to you that people may have known that this was a restaurant in a public building? 
    Does it make any difference whether people did know or didn't know, to the legal question? 
    Does it make the slightest difference?
speaker="louis_l_redding" startTime="5987.361" stopTime="6161.637">
    Mr. Louis L. Redding 
    It does not, sir. 
    It does not. 
    Now, may I say – may I go -- however, that is one aspect, that is the fact that this is a public property, was the fact that brought him was the legal basis, that brought him in the court originally, After he got into the Court of chancery, he was furnished a second legal basis to oppose this discrimination. 
    The defendants defended on the basis of a state statute, and they said that this state statute gave them the right to discriminate against this individual because of his association with the particular ethnic minority. 
    Now, this was state action. 
    That is, the interpretation by the court that this meaning which the defendants ascribed to the statute was a valid meaning, made the statute mean exactly what the defendants said it meant and so by state judicial action giving legal force and effect to a racially discriminatory statute, the defendant brings his appeal, and he bases his appeal on that. 
    And we ask the Court not only to declare that there is state action here because of the fact that the private lessee is an instrumentality of the public lessor in effectuating the public purpose, but also because here is a statute of the State of Delaware which the highest court of the State of Delaware says may be used to discriminate against people because of an extraneous fact like their ancestry. 
    And we say that time after time this Court has held that this is a violation of the Equal Protection of the laws. 
    So for these -- on these two grounds, not only is the defendant in court, but on these two grounds it is our belief that the judgment below should be reversed and we respectfully request such a reversal.
