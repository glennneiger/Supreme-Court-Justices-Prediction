United States v. Hougham

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 24, United States, Petitioner, versus E. B. Hougham et al. 
    Mr. Barnett.
speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="15.070" stopTime="167.883">
    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on certiorari, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to review its judgment in the civil action brought by the United States to recover statutory damages for the fraudulent purchases of government property. 
    Respondent Hougham is a used car dealer, the other three respondents are veterans, who had been found fraudulently obtained veteran's priorities certificates and used them to purchase for Hougham some $79,500 worth of surplus trucks and trailers. 
    The fraud consisted of misrepresentations and their applications for these certificates that the property was to be used by them in their own businesses whereas in fact they had no businesses in purchasing the property for Hougham. 
    Those findings were affirmed on appeal and they are not an issue here. 
    The only question here is the measure of recovery to which the United States is entitled. 
    The statute, Section 26 (b) of the Surplus Properly Act of 1944, which is set forth in our main brief at pages 2 and 3, provides three alternative measures of recovery. 
    The defrauder is required to pay either $2,000 for each fraudulent act plus double damages or if the United States shall so elect, a sum equal to twice the consideration agreed to be given to the property. 
    Or again, if United States shall so elect to restore the property itself and forfeit you on this page. 
    Now, neither the last option nor actual damages under the first option are involved here. 
    And the choice here is narrowed to recovery of either $2,000 for each act or double consideration damages under the second option. 
    The Government's claim is that it is entitled to recover under the second option 26 (b) (2) that is twice the $79,500 paid for the property or a total of a $159,000. 
    The District Court affirmed by the Court of Appeals held that we were entitled to recover only under the first option that is $2,000 for each act.

    There were only four applications producing a -- a judgment.

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Well, we -- they argued it that each purchase was an accessible act. 
    We did not appeal on that ground and do not raise it here. 
    Our only argument here is that we're entitled to recover under the second option rather than the first that is double consideration damages instead of $2,000 assessments.

    Yes.

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Now, in its original complaint, the Government asked for $2,000 assessments under the first option on the basis of the 150 items purchased as we asked it initially for $2,000 on 150 purchases. 
    However, we thereafter file the motion to file a Second Amended Complaint in which in addition to making various corrections in factual allegations, we change the prayer for relief and ask instead for double consideration damages that is twice the $79,000 or $159,000. 
    Respondents opposed the amendment and in the conferences with the Judge-In-Chambers, the trial judge indicated that he thought the original complaint was an irrevocable election and we couldn't change the prayer for relief to ask a double consideration damages. 
    Government counsel thereupon withdrew that motion to file the First Amended Complaint and with this Court did file a Second Amended Complaint making only the changes to the factual allegations and keeping the original prayer for relief.

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    What then happened was after further pretrial proceedings, the District Court entered a formal pretrial order under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules. 
    The crucial paragraph of that order appears at page 101 of the record, that's paragraph (b) there. 
    That recites the trial court's previously indicated view that the original complaint was an irrevocable election and that we couldn't change it. 
    It states the Government's contention that the original complaint was not irrevocable and the Government's election if not barred by the original complaint of double consideration damages under the second option.

speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="920.665" stopTime="1227.234">
    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    It was on the -- it was pending in the Court of Appeals as I remember it. 
    At that time, the notes were given and final payments on the notes actually were not until after the Court of Appeals' decision but I don't think that makes any difference. 
    On -- getting to the grounds for the Court of Appeals' decision, which as we understand it is -- it's just that the District Court is not bound by our election. 
    I would like to say, first and which I think is a complete answer is that the District Court never made the finding for the Court of Appeals' reports to affirm. 
    The District Court's conclusions of law explicitly and exclusively are based upon the ground that the original election was irrevocable as a matter of law, not an exercise of discretion by the District Court to choose for itself among the remedies. 
    It just held that we were bound by our first election. 
    But passing -- passing that difficulty, we think it's equally clear that the District Court does not have the discretion to choose among the remedies. 
    The statute on that question is as ex -- as explicit as it is possible seems to us first statute to be. 
    It says that the defaulter shall pay $2,000 or, if the United States shall so elect, shall pay twice the consideration agree could be given. 
    Or, if the United States shall so elect, return the property and forfeit the amount of pay. 
    Now, if the Court of Appeals suggested that the reason for the words at the election of the Government was to make it clear that the remedies were not accumulated, but not -- we think obviously is not an explanation because the disjunctive or by itself makes them alternative instead of cumulative. 
    And the only possible function for the words, if United States shall so elect, is to make clear who it is and how the choice is to be made, namely is to be made by the Government. 
    Now, since the statutory expressly gives United States the right to recover whichever of the three alternatives it elects. 
    We think it's clear that upon a timely and proper election, there's no function that the District Court other than the traditional one of determining whether the Government has proved its case and established the amount to which it is entitled under the election. 
    Now in particular, I would like to say that respondent's suggestion that -- and this maybe behind the Court of Appeals' decision that the Government's election should be disallowed unless the Government affirmatively proves actual damages proportionate to the recovery, which simply defeat the purpose statute which as this Court acknowledge in the Rex Trailer case and through 50 U.S. was to provide a -- a liquidated measure of recovery for damages which are in their very nature difficult or even impossible to prove. 
    Now, I don't want to be understood of saying that there are no judicially and forcible limits on what the Government elects. 
    We can acknowledge this -- the possibility at least of the case arising in which a literal application of one of the remedies would produce a -- a -- recovery so grossly disproportionate to any possible remedial purpose that it might by the constitutional limitations or possibly limitations implicit in the statute. 
    But, all that mean is that when that happens in any given case, the Court properly can and should disallow the recovery. 
    It doesn't mean that the Court has general discretion in all cases to choose among the three alternatives, so long as the Government's choice does not produce an unconstitutionally excessive result or otherwise illegal result if we submit must be given effect. 
    I would like also to answer the other arguments on which the respondent seeks to sustain the judgment, which were not adapted by the Court of Appeals. 
    I've dealt already with the argument that we didn't raise the issue in the trial court. 
    We did make our election in pretrial order and that was the controlling order under a new case and the Court ruled them. 
    He makes also another argument which depends upon that one. 
    He argues that the election should not be allowed because the change of election should not be allowed, because of the prejudicial. 
    The prejudice that he claims is that the case was tried on the -- under the first option of the $2,000 pack assessment theory and he says that he would therefore be prejudiced if he now apply a different measure. 
    But the fact is that he made the election before the trial and not after the trial. 
    He made it --

speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="1355.274" stopTime="1375.812">
    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Well, there was a constitutional issue involved in Rex Trailer. 
    And the kind of situation I have in mind will be more likely to arise into the first option, the $2,000 assessments. 
    Say for a hundred desk papers, if we try to assess $2,000 for each desk paper regarding a recovery of $200,000, I think that might be this --

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Yes -- well -- I, I don't -- I don't want to resolve what the constitutional limits might be. 
    I'm only -- I only wish to acknowledge that there might be some. 
    The -- the other argument which respondents make here in defense of their judgment again not relied upon by the Court of Appeals is that, 26 (b) (2) the double consideration measure is inapplicable to the transactions involved here as a matter of law, that has two aspects. 
    Well, the first of which is suggested by the Court of Appeals, so I don't think that is it's holding. 
    The Court of Appeals suggests that it may not be applicable at all to executed transactions only to a transaction where there has been an agreement to purchase which has never been executed. 
    Now, there's nothing in the language of the Section to suggest that distinction and we do not understand why it would ever be more posit in one case that the other. 
    If anything, it's a less burdensome recovery in an executed transaction than in an unexecuted one. 
    In the executed transaction, the defaulter does end up paying three times instead of twice the price for the goods. 
    But, for the third payment, he got the goods and he's entitled to keep them. 
    And therefore, he got the benefit of his bargain and pays his damages only the same amount that the -- that he would in an unexecuted transaction. 
    And certainly, there's no reason to prefer the one who gets the fruit to this bargain over the one who discovered before he's able to do so. 
    The respondent's argument here is slightly different. 
    He agrees that it applies generally to execute transactions, but contends that the transaction must, at one point, or a (Inaudible) in time have been executory. 
    He distinguishes between a bid and award with a high max before payment and an over-the-counter sale with simultaneous payment. 
    Presumably on the ground that the statute refers to consideration agreed to be given and an over-counter -- over-the-counter sale, there's consideration given but none agreed to be given. 
    Well, first the record does not support his characterization of these transactions, but more than that the -- the distinction we think is of no substance in over-the-counters -- even in over -- over-the-counter sale, the parties necessarily agreed on the price to be paid. 
    And there is an agreement which would in fact support a maximum contract if by miscounting the change or otherwise, it turned out to be not paid to full price. 
    And finally, we think, there is no possible reason to distinguish the measure of recovery on the basis of whether or not there was a measurable (Inaudible) or time between the agreement and the payment. 
    I would like if I may to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Calvin H. Conron, Jr.
speaker="calvin_h_conron" startTime="1582.911" stopTime="1746.779">
    Mr. Calvin H. Conron, Jr. 
    May it please the Court, counsel for the Government. 
    First, in answer to Justice Frankfurter's inquiry with respect to the record as to the contents of the prayer in the first complaint, the prayer asked for a monetary amount in damage of each defendant and I'll name only one. 
    They are all typical. 
    Against the defendant, Owen Dailey had asked for $138,000. 
    That figure is right there on the basis of $2,000, a purchase as alleged in the complaint. 
    In other words, $2,000 an act and the material part of what you inquired about says this, "Plus double the amount of damages which this Court may deem together with cost and interest in cost of this suit". 
    The complaint in no respect, in any place alleges that the Government suffered any monetary damage of any kind or damage of any character except a so-called benefit that it might have been deprived of by having one otherwise not entitled to purchase of product at a fair price, in other words, the selection of the customer. 
    It is our position, if the Court please, that this problem that the Government poses has never been properly presented to this Court to the Circuit Court of Appeals or to the Federal District Court. 
    As counsel says, "It came into the case at a time not when the Government had indicated that -- the Court had indicated possibly that $2,000 per act was -- was improper because an election is made. 
    It came before the Court at a time when the Government was arguing $2,000 an act in response to a motion for summary judgment and the point was made that the allegation -- did -- the complaint would not support a prayer for damages for double consideration. 
    Now, that is the status of the case and in the heat of that argument, the Government voluntarily withdrew its motion to file this First Amended Complaint never did present it or any other complaint in which any prayer for damages other than $2,000 per act was sought for by the Government.

    Mr. Calvin H. Conron, Jr. 
    I don't think they did, Your Honor. 
    And my reason for that is -- is two-fold. 
    In the first place, the pretrial order does not say that the Government wanted a ruling of the trial court. 
    It abstractly, and as I put it in my brief, out of thin air brought out the assertion that the Government contends that it's entitled to claim $2,000 per act but they never asked the District Court for a ruling. 
    It is inserted in that pretrial order out of thin air. 
    It's not contained in any of the proceedings of the pretrial, there was no request made. 
    The purpose of pretrial is to consider the advisability, the important purpose. 
    A pretrial is to consider the advisability of amendment to the pleadings, had the Government chosen at that time to make the contention, rather than at the time it had previously withdrawn, it should have said, "I want to file the minute it complained here."

    Why isn't that conclusive?
speaker="calvin_h_conron" startTime="2003.263" stopTime="2207.926">
    Mr. Calvin H. Conron, Jr. 
    Alright, then let's -- let us supplement the pleadings. 
    The pretrial order still says that the Government is contending $2,000 per act. 
    The Government has only mentioned part of its pretrial order and I refer you to page 94 of the pretrial order in the record. 
    So what do we have here? 
    Taking it in the position, the most favorable to the Government. 
    The Government is asking the pretrial court to make a selection between $2,000 per act and doubled consideration. 
    It's leaving it still up to the discretion of the Court, while the Government's voluntary action taken at the pretrial order. 
    Now, I seek further, the point is not properly before this Court because why? 
    The Government elected to go trial, on the second demand and complaint, well-knowing that it sought $2,000 per act. 
    And incidentally, I forget just which one of you gentlemen inquired about -- about the number and the size of this so-called fraud and it's -- it's rather important here, in consideration of these acts and so forth and whether double consideration would be appropriate. 
    As the trial court found, there were only four activities or actions taken by all of these gentlemen that had anything questionable about it. 
    They signed this application for the right to later purchase if they wanted to surplus property. 
    Now, the question was asked by some of you gentlemen, how many items were involved and what was the size of them? 
    And counsel replied about 150 trucks. 
    Actually, the record I -- no, he didn't intentionally misquote it. 
    But actually, the record will show that only about 11 sizeable articles in value of over $2,000 were involved and a 150 or 60 or 70 may be even more that he mentioned than that were articles of -- of insignificant value or small monetary value. 
    I have in mind an order of 60 or 70 trailers, mount trailers. 
    I have in mind an order of tires, many items of tires. 
    Let's say worth, $7 and $14 and they started out asking for $2,000 tires. 
    $2,000 for $27 bomb shelters and they had only about a dozen, and I'm speaking at round figures, articles of substantial value that embraced the total of $2,000 per act figure. 
    I brought up this rather stupendous amount in the prayer because of the -- of the numerical largeness of the number of a great many articles of insignificant value, rather than -- than a terrific amount of -- of big articles. 
    Now, that has a bearing on -- on whether or not when you have your -- your remedy whether it's going to be as was suggested by Justice Frankfurter to be a deprivation of property without due process or severe -- so severe as to be penal.

    Well Mr. Conron, to get back to the pretrial motion and the procedure during the trial, and the actions of the Court and its conclusions of law didn't -- on page 116, the last paragraph on that page, doesn't it -- it says there, "This Court allowed the filing of said Second Amended Complaint in paragraph 75 of the pretrial conference order. 
    It is recorded that the plaintiff contends that it is entitled to double the amount for the sales price of the vehicles described in the Amended Complaint -- Second Amended Complaint, namely twice the sum of $13,000 some dollars for Count I, prices sum of $38,000 for Count II, and twice the sum of $27,000 for Count III." 
    That plaintiff contended that it is entitled to make it selection at anytime prior to judgment and that plaintiff selects in the event of judgment in his favor to receive his liquidated damages of a sum equal to quite -- twice consideration agreed to be given by the United States. 
    And then it goes on to -- to say that the -- that the Government made its selection in the first place and that it could not maintain that.

    Mr. Calvin H. Conron, Jr. 
    Now, Your Honor. 
    I am right or wrong depending upon whether the pretrial order properly presented the issue. 
    If it did, I would concede that that would perhaps be a proper finding.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2341.273" stopTime="2341.859">

    But I contend that there never was a proper pretrial order. 
    It never was before the Court or raised it all of the trial. 
    We went to trial on the Second Amended Complaint, asking for $2,000 per act. 
    And therefore, the finding that you quote, "I contend to be surplus, each being outside of the issues presented to the Court." 
    Re-finding of the Court is on findings 3, 9, and 11, which appear in transcripts at page 107 through 113.

    Mr. Calvin H. Conron, Jr. 
    And there, the Court finds that the sum of $2,000 per act is not appropriate not because the Government had made an election but because the evidence wouldn't support that there have ever been any money as agreed to be paid. 
    That is the basis of the trial court's judgment and it sound -- it's the trial court's -- it was determination that Section 26 (b) (2) in the Surplus Act was improper to the facts and appropriate to the facts in this case because the trick did not involve a monetary scheme. 
    This trick was a representation as to quality or -- or to timeliness only. 
    The dollar part of the transaction was fair and honest to everybody. 
    There was no deception or advantage gain or loss by the Government monetary wise and that was a consideration that the Court found to support the judgment and necessarily the conclusion that was inserted in the findings out of thin air which was never before the Court had initiated that they have made an election.

    Mr. Calvin H. Conron, Jr. 
    My -- [Laughter] my final point I see the white light is on me and I'll have to be rather rapid, is that I don't agree with the Government's contention as to the proper and meaning of the Surplus Act. 
    In other words, as I read the Act, if this word alternative that the Government uses time and time again, you won't find it in the Act. 
    The Government says, "We are entitled after proving fraud of any kind to fit a thin air anyone with three remedy." 
    I contend that is not a proper construction of the Act, that a proper construction of the Act shows that it was made purposely broad to fit very factual situations. 
    In other words, a $2000 an act could be appropriate remedy for some situation, double consideration might considerably be appropriate to some situations such as excecutory contracts. 
    The policy of the war Surplus Act was to get rid of surplus property. 
    It contemplated the -- the channeling of large volumes of property not only by slots sale but by contracts, by -- by conditional sales contracts, by executory contracts, by signed payment contracts. 
    And as I read the Act, it was put in to meet that sort of a situation, not a situation where there's no monetary fraud involved.

    What you're saying is that when the statute pass these three choices shall pay or shall pay the Government elect and shall pay the United States so -- so elect, the Government had these modes of seeking relief but it's still left for the Court to decide whether they elected properly.

    But it's important to say what the case is. 
    That's your point, is it?
speaker="calvin_h_conron" startTime="3296.976" stopTime="3411.845">
    Mr. Calvin H. Conron, Jr. 
    That's right. 
    They have the right in the first instance to select which of those remedies is appropriate according to their opinion. 
    But whether the -- whether the remedy is appropriate to the occasion, I say it's within the power of the Court in the last analysis to determine. 
    I say that in the other construction of the statute would -- would lead you right into -- you might say chaos. 
    It would strip the power of the Court of all this discretion. 
    It would make the trial court a mere chairman of a -- of a proceeding and it would leave the judge and the justice of the Justice Department in the role of prosecutor judge, jury and executioner. 
    And that form of -- of statutory interpretation has not been are off for many, many years. 
    We got away from that. 
    We will -- discarded absolute monarchy. 
    Now, one final word in -- in reference to that line, it has always been a practice in the interpretation of the so-called penal damage statutes and I say that. 
    Of course, when the Court is considering whether the statute limitation is run then they say it's compensatory. 
    But when -- but now, here is the Government turning right around and asking double the consideration when it's already been fully and fairly paid. 
    And -- and I -- I cite Your Honors' attention merely to this -- to the -- to the False Claims Act, the Copyright Laws Act, the Patent Laws Act as waste laws, all of which have these penal provisions, all of which leaves the determination of reasonable is -- in the final analysis to the Court. 
    I see my time is up.

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Mr. Chief Justice, my first care of the number of trucks involved a quick count, comes to 46 trucks out of 149 items. 
    The others were all trailers. 
    There were not tires or inner tubes in the Second Amended Complaint. 
    Something -- there were (Inaudible) First Complaint but they were going down. 
    As to the pretrial order who wrote the order, it is my understanding that the Government counsel did prepare the order. 
    Since writing the -- filing our brief, I've checked the rules of the Court in -- in the Southern District of New York, which restitute an earlier, and it may cleared up to say that those rules provide that the plaintiff, whatever happens to the plaintiff, shall submit the order and it shall be approved as to form and substance by both parties. 
    I hear it literally says form and context, trying to suggest from this print of content though we don't think it may make something difference. 
    Now, as to the rule of the Court, this -- just that we're depriving the Court of any rule seems to us the Court has precisely the same rule in this case that has any other to determine whether the party claiming the right has that right. 
    And the statute gives us three rights among which we make elect and we elect then we are claiming that right and the Court can determine whether we have approved our case, whether it established fraud and in this case, whether we have established the consideration agreed to be paid. 
    Nothing more remains to be found and that we submit is in the end of the case. 
    Thank you very much.
