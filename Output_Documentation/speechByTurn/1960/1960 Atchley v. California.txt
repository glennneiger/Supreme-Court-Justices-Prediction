Atchley v. California

    -- you may continue your argument.

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    At this point we have reached the scene of the shooting which was 3:07 a.m. 
    Petitioner was contacted by the police at his home in Palermo at approximately 4 a.m. and brought to the County Jail. 
    He was first questioned in the County Jail by one officer for a period of approximately two and a half hours. 
    At that time, petitioner denied being in Gridley having any gun and gave a statement that perhaps someone else had threatened his wife and may have shot her. 
    Petitioner was not again questioned until 11:30 p.m. on that night August the 3rd.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="48.460" stopTime="50.198">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    11:30 p.m. at night?
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="50.198" stopTime="169.930">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    At night. 
    At that time, an investigator for the State Department of Justice arrived in Oroville. 
    He introduced himself to the petitioner who knew he was booked for investigation of murder. 
    There were -- the record shows that there were no promises, threats or inducements made by this officer to the petitioner. 
    Petitioner told the officer the same story that he had told Mr. Anderson, the first person that had questioned him. 
    He, however, did admit in this statement that at sometime he had previously threatened his wife. 
    A subsequent conversation was held with the petitioner by three other officers and the questioning lasted until about 5 a.m. when petitioner went to his cell to sleep. 
    His story was the same as to the second officer. 
    At noon on August the 4th after the police had located the gun and holster on the petitioner's premises, they returned to the jail and confronted him with these articles. 
    They made no threats or promises to him. 
    And on the contrary when petitioners saw him with these articles, he stated, "I heard you had located the gun." 
    He then changed his story to the officers, admitted that his first story was false. 
    He admitted then that he had been in Gridley on the night in question that the gun had gone off as a result of a struggle with his wife for this gun but he's dead at that time that she was in possession of the gun and when she was lying in the ground after having been shot, he took the gun and drove back to Palermo where he buried the gun and concealed the holster. 
    We would like to call the Court's attention to the fact that petitioner sometime on the day of August 4th was arraigned in the Justice Court at 6 p.m on that day.

    Ms. Maier, may I just follow this, I have just more? 
    We were talking about the arraignment. 
    I happen to be familiar with it where some of the others do not. 
    But at the arraignment, they do not determine whether there is probable cause.
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="459.119" stopTime="464.965">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    No, not at the arraignment. 
    They -- they sent a date for a subsequent preliminary examination.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="464.965" stopTime="465.225">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="465.225" stopTime="474.152">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I -- I do want to know whether that initial arraignment on the 4th, he was told of his right to including you may have lawyer you wanted?
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="474.152" stopTime="475.737">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Yes Your honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="475.737" stopTime="484.549">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now was -- what -- did he express a desire to have one or would this being a capital case, would one be assigned to him?
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="484.549" stopTime="502.931">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Your Honor if he expressed a desire that time for an attorney and he had no funds to secure attorney, then one would have been appointed to represent him. 
    However, this petitioner as reflected by the record did have funds to hire and did engage his own counsel.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="502.931" stopTime="507.853">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So there is no and -- were you in the proceedings before the State Supreme Court Ms. Maier?
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="507.853" stopTime="509.053">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="509.053" stopTime="525.680">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What was the question -- what was the question -- the issue raised for your Supreme Court that he didn't have a lawyer and that he wasn't properly advised to respond to whatever the extent of the proceedings before the Justices' Court?
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="525.680" stopTime="564.603">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    No, Your Honor, not that. 
    The question was raised, if I may explain to you, Your Honor. 
    The question was raised before the California Supreme Court as to the admissibility of the confession whether his statement that he was in the in this record that I want an attorney and that he didn't get an attorney at that time, whether that affected the introduction of the statement in evidence. 
    It was not -- no question was raised either in his motion to set aside the information in the California Court or the Supreme Court. 
    I'm trying.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="564.603" stopTime="605.288">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm a little -- I'm a little confused. 
    If he was -- if he appeared, if he was arraigned before your Justices' Court on August 4 and that told that he may have a lawyer of his choice and if he doesn't have any fund with which to select the lawyer of his choice, the statement provide to him. 
    If all of that was made clear to him, then I do not understand why he didn't have a lawyer, select a lawyer or express a desire to have the State select one before him if he was indigent before he ever made the statement to action, to Travers?
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="605.288" stopTime="626.508">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Your Honor, the only thing we could infer from the record in this case including his statement to Mr. Travers was that petitioner at that time through his brother was negotiating for various counsel. 
    You will see in the statement to Travers that he says he is endeavoring to secure a counsel and he's been trying to get several people.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="626.508" stopTime="634.048">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well then, would you be good enough to turn as to page 382 of the record?

    Well, from Saturday all day, no sleep, Saturday night, no sleep, Sunday, no sleep, Sunday night, no sleep until about 4 o'clock. 
    I presume I went to a pretty good examination. 
    Am I to infer from that that he was continued -- continuously under interrogation by enforcing officials of California no sleep, is that it? 
    Am I to infer that that means they kept him from sleep?

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    No, Your Honor. 
    In the first place may I explain? 
    The shooting took place in the early hours of Sunday morning.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes. 
    But -- but the answer is responsive to the question and you went to an examination for several hours. 
    Did he go through an examination before the shooting?

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    No.

    What are you talking about?

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Well, he is talking about the fact that on the Saturday, in reading the entire transcript, you will see on the Saturday in question he -- he didn't sleep and he didn't sleep that Saturday night.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="726.627" stopTime="727.572">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Before the shooting.

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Before the shooting.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="728.846" stopTime="748.421">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it doesn't tie it up with an examination, does that? 
    Alright, now go on to the next question. 
    How many times did you ask for a lawyer, would you say? 
    I would say I asked for a lawyer 10 times. 
    And you asked, how many people, well everyone that I've talked to, I'm asking for a lawyer? 
    Now, would you please comment on that Ms. Maier's?
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="748.421" stopTime="763.273">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Yes, I would say he probably -- he may have asked a week. 
    There is nothing in the record that conflicts with that except his own statement to Travers when he shows he was negotiating through his brother for an attorney.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="763.273" stopTime="772.703">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it isn't -- it isn't the claim and is the claim made that he asked public authorities to be allowed to get a lawyer and maybe they blocked him from doing that.
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="772.703" stopTime="777.874">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Your Honor, there is nothing in this record that shows that any public authorities blocked him from getting an attorney.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="777.874" stopTime="779.361">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Alright.
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="779.361" stopTime="796.988">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    There is no affirmative act disclosed there. 
    The -- there is no duty on the police to provide counsel with an attorney. 
    And if he is not indigent and has funds to maintain or update his own counsel, the state court could not appoint counsel to represent him.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="796.988" stopTime="814.103">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So can we say then that there is out of this case any claim or basis for regret, that here was the defendant unable to apply -- supply himself with a lawyer, frustrated in the desire to do so by officials of the State.
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="814.103" stopTime="816.656">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    I don't think the facts in this case support that.

    Alright.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mrs. Maier, may I get back to the crinology again? 
    You told us that -- that the petitioner was arraigned before he saw this man Travers. 
    Now, he made a statement to the authorities before that in which he admitted being at the scene of the crime and saying that he had a scuffle and wife was accidently shot.

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Your Honor, we might explain it. 
    Justice Traynor in his opinion and the question presented to the California Supreme Court was whether these statements were admissible in evidence. 
    The position of the prosecution at that time was that the statements that no proper foundation would have too, would have been light, to admit them because under California up to that law and up to that time, there was no requirement that a statement be voluntary. 
    We took the position at that time that these statements were not confessions even though we did urge this point that in this particular record, a full and compete foundation was laid as to their voluntary character and it was. 
    California Court and in Mr. Justice Traynor's opinion found that both whether it was an admission or confession, would have to be voluntary.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1411.545" stopTime="1418.632">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well three years, I think we -- the opinion of this Court would have to sustain it with that conclusion.
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="1418.632" stopTime="1438.937">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    However, we would call this Court's attention to the fact that in this -- at all statements made by this petitioner, the petitioner's statements were attempt, all of them to be exculpatory. 
    Now, we would --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1438.937" stopTime="1466.377">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I'm sorry you have to pursue this. 
    But what I am trying to get at is, you said that if the Justices Court arraignment, the defendant is advised that he has a right to have counsel and he has the right to remain silent, not to make any incriminatory statement. 
    Now, are there minutes that reflect that kind of advice being given to this man in this case?
speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="1466.377" stopTime="1514.918">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    Your normal statement in the court, if I may state -- reads as follows Your Honor, this is a normal procedure there. 
    "Complaint sign, defendant in custody, arraignment held informed of his legal rights." 
    Now, that's a minute order that you have in most Justices Courts because there are very few of them that have reported transcript of that or reported at that point. 
    Now, if I may return to the question of why we believe this record shows that the petitioners will to resist, was not over borne in this case. 
    We have these facts. 
    Petitioner was 42 years of age. 
    He was of average intelligence. 
    He has nothing --

speaker="doris_h_maier" startTime="1522.743" stopTime="1539.189">
    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    That is a little difficult Your Honor because we do not believe that the statements were coerced from him. 
    We believe that statement he made to Mr. Travers, the first statement was completely voluntary as the record reflects and the second statement, the only difference was the fact that it was taped recorded.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1539.189" stopTime="1540.356">

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    If I may -- in this case, in these facts in which we would say the case is definitely differentiated between Spano versus New York and Leyra versus Denno. 
    In this, the questioning that was continued with prior to Mr. Travers' statement, we have a 20-hour space in which petitioner was not questioned by any police officers before he first spoke to Mr. Travers. 
    At that time, petitioner, according to Mr. Travers' testimony, petitioner volunteered to him the statements of the shooting, the facts arising. 
    It was only after Mr. Travers left the conversation with petitioner, he'd finished and he was leaving the jail, that he stopped and spoke to the deputy sheriff or into sheriff and they requested that he repeat the statement and have it so that it could be taped. 
    This, they did. 
    Now, in most of the cases, previously considered by this Court, we have a situation where the first confessions have been held coerced and/or not presented and a subsequent confession has been later attacked as on the ground that the coercive influences had carried through in effected. 
    In this case, we have no first confession or incriminating statement. 
    The first statement made introduce to Travers admittedly is a voluntary one. 
    Petitioner himself had requested Mr. Travers to come to the jail. 
    He asked him to come and discussed the question of insurance with him and also to bring him some cigarettes. 
    Mr. Travers went there in accordance with that request. 
    We would also note that the record fully support the fact that petitioner at this time apprised thereto was not held incommunicado since the -- the record reflects that his brother had contact with him and did discuss the matter with him.

    He said in this statement where Mr. Travers asked him about counsel, that he was endeavoring to obtain a person by the name Bocardo in San Jose.

    Then the further quest -- point should be noted that petitioner two days later after the statement to Travers, gave another statement to the police officers which was exactly the same as the statement to Travers. 
    He did not -- this statement was also a free and voluntary on.

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    That was given on August the 7th. 
    Then the petitioner -- well, we must also note this point that at the time of trial in this case, petitioner took the stand and testified. 
    His statement at that time was virtually identical, his testimonies at that time with the contents of the statements made to Mr. Travers and to the officers.

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    No, Your Honor but petitioner had full opportunity prior to trial to review his statements and also to hear the tape recording, went to Mr. Travers because it was avoided him prior to trial.

    Ms. Doris H. Maier 
    We would say that in this case, we differentiated from Watts versus Indiana, Leyra versus Denno and all the others in the ground that we do not have a situation of a defendant of a minority, read -- race kept incommunicado or threatened with physical violence. 
    There is no question raised that are mapped violence or fought. 
    We submit that this record shows that the petitioner asked for an attorney. 
    It shows no affirmative act of the police in refusing to permit an attorney to see him. 
    There was no evidence that an attorney was turned away. 
    It is petitioner's statement that I told him I wanted to get me an attorney, through the record, page 382, that they asked for one and ten times. 
    On page 354 and 355 of this record, it shows that petitioner's brother was attempting to secure counsel for him. 
    And we submit that this case is even a stronger case that the police acted properly, then Cicenia versus Lagay or Crooker versus California. 
    Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no requirement that the police refrain from questioning a suspect until he secures an attorney. 
    Such policy would be a detriment to the innocent. 
    It would require the police to keep these people until such time as they had an attorney prior to being -- the individuals being able explain satisfactorily to the police and to obtain their release. 
    Also if a particular suspect were innocent, he might never to less be able to avoid the police a valuable clue to the guilty culprit which delay might render unavailable. 
    We submit that the record in this particular case does not show that the petitioner was questioned by continuous relays of officers until he confessed. 
    On the contrary, his alleged incriminating statements were given to his own accord to Mr. Travers. 
    The tape recorded statement here attacked, was the same as the first one which is admittedly voluntarily given in neither these statements that this petitioner admit all of the elements of the offense. 
    He admitted various incriminating statements. 
    We say, therefore, that petitioner's will to resist in entire confession was certain not broken at that point because at all times, petitioner did not admit each and all of the elements of the offense. 
    And we maintain that in the light of the entire records in this case that the State of California has not denied petitioner that due process of law that were required reversal by this Court under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Thank you.

   Rebuttal of Rosalie S. Asher
speaker="rosalie_s_asher" startTime="2138.774" stopTime="2144.856">
    Mr. Rosalie S. Asher 
    The Court permission Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I have just one or two very brief things to say in reply tonight.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2144.856" stopTime="2146.637">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, take your time.
speaker="rosalie_s_asher" startTime="2146.637" stopTime="2465.769">
    Mr. Rosalie S. Asher 
    Thank you sir. 
    My worthy opponent and I are agreed on the issues here before this Court and they need not to further be discussed. 
    It resolves itself into perhaps a rather simple, factual question. 
    However, I do wish to apologize for the statement I made this morning to secure from colleague as to the time of arraignment with regard to the statement. 
    I don't wish to get involved in this arraignment thing again but counsel and I were thinking of arraignment in the Superior Court and that would explain the wrong -- factually incorrect statement I made. 
    I think it begs the question to say that there is no affirmative act by the police to show him. 
    It's true they have no duty to provide a man with a lawyer. 
    An indigent is afforded a lawyer by the courts of California in the courts. 
    However, we do maintain that if a man in police custody, unable accepting with the indulgence of the police to contact counsel, asks to do so, then this is his right. 
    I have rather briefly reviewed the record being at the same disadvantage as Mrs.Maier and I having been at the trial of the case. 
    However, I don't find that record so clearly shows that this matter regarding counsel in actually a statement to Travers, the tape recorded statement appearing at page 201. 
    Travers says, the question, “Well, that's about all I can there, when you get your attorney.” 
    I don't know who your attorney is. 
    What was that fellow's name? 
    Answer, “I was trying to get (Inaudible) as it appears in the record. 
    (Inaudible) 
    "Yes." 
    San Jose." 
    San Jose is the question. 
    And then Travers says, “There is nothing we can do. 
    All we can do is what your request to the company, going back again to the question of insurance." 
    Then at the section with which Mrs. Maier referred to regarding the testimony of the -- I take it this is -- yes, this is the defendant's brother's testimony at page 354 and 355. 
    We are handicapped here by again the limited education of both defendant and his brother because the question was put to him, to the brother on cross examination by the prosecution. 
    "You have been in this particular matter. 
    Has been associated with your brother trying to help him out in your defense have you not?” 
    Answer, “In his defense, I just sat and heard it the same as anybody else.” 
    Question, "Well, you have conferred with him at various times over in the jail working out matters of his defense, didn't you?” 
    Answer, “Well, I just conceded for his lawyer.” 
    Now, I submitted, he probably -- I would assume he meant but still the time of this intercession does not appear from the statement although the brother goes on to testify, “Yes, we discussed about my other brother. 
    We talked about that a whole lot down in the jail." 
    Oh yes, the question was asked this morning as to the reference, in the record to actually request for counsel and that appears as is mentioned in our opening brief at page -- in the record, pages 382 and 436. 
    I think the later statement -- the statement made to police officers, after the statement made to Travers actually is a bit beyond the orbit of the question here. 
    Attention should be focused it seems to me on this one question. 
    Did actually, at any time before his interview with Travers tells the story that he then told and the answer is that he did not. 
    This was the first time that he had admitted coming in -- coming to the scene in possession of the gun. 
    The affect of the -- this whole tape being played to the jury heard by their ears, I think cannot be minimized. 
    If nothing else but for this tape which we still perfectly maintain was the result of coercion in a manner argued this morning. 
    If defendant had not been acquitted outright, there is a reasonable possibility I think that he would have received a lesser penalty. 
    California as so many other States has varying degree of homicide and but for the damning tape confession, it -- I think cannot be said be on certainty that he might not have been found guilty of manslaughter or of second degree murder or indeed if he were still found guilty of first degree murder. 
    But for the fact that this tape having been played, it will might be that the jury would have brought in a recommendation with leniency as in this case, they did not do it.

    Mr. Travers, I will -- and I -- I corrected and my recollection that some place in the record, it's stated that the petitioner's counsel argued to the jury that if this statement to Travers had not been put in by the prosecution, he would've put it in himself?
speaker="rosalie_s_asher" startTime="2488.248" stopTime="2492.864">
    Mr. Rosalie S. Asher 
    Mr. Chief Justice, that does appear in the argument. 
    We have answered that in our reply brief.

speaker="rosalie_s_asher" startTime="2494.550" stopTime="2503.412">
    Mr. Rosalie S. Asher 
    Our contention is that he has no choice. 
    That this was just a matter of defense strategy, virtually imposed upon him by the methods of the prosecution.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2503.412" stopTime="2503.839">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I see.
speaker="rosalie_s_asher" startTime="2503.839" stopTime="2527.905">
    Mr. Rosalie S. Asher 
    And I would like to further point out because there maybe some further confusions in the record. 
    The record will show that as the arraignment in the Superior Court, the defendant was represented by Mr. King, however, that is not this Mr. King. 
    Mr. Joseph R. King represented him at the time of the trial, Mr. Albert King, my associate's brother is the one mentioned at the Superior Court arraignment.
