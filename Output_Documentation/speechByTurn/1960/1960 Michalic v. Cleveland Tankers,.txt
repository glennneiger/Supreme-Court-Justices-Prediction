    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of this Court. 
    This is a case concerning a seaman suing under the provisions of the Jones Act and for the unseaworthiness of the vessel upon which he was employed under the general maritime law. 
    A jury trial was held and after the plaintiff's case was ended, a motion for a directed verdict was denied in informal language by the trial judge in saying “let's go ahead”. 
    The motion for the directed verdict was again renewed at the end of the entire case, and it was granted. 
    The decision was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit and of course, we are here on a petition for writ of certiorari. 
    I don't believe there's any point in belaboring what must be well-known to all of us, and that is that, in cases of this type, when we are here to determine whether a district judge was correct in granting a directed verdict that the only question that should arise to that District Court Judge is whether or not there is a material issue of fact, upon which, the jury could have found in favor of the plaintiff. 
    All of the evidence, that is, both the plaintiff's and in this particular case, because the directed verdict was granted at the end of the entire case, also the defendant's evidence must be considered by the District Judge. 
    That evidence must also be considered in a light most favorable to the plaintiff and in addition, all inferences which may be reasonably drawn from that evidence must be considered in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. 
    And so, the situation becomes a comparatively easy one, and that is whether or not, considering all the evidence in this case, there was a material issue of fact which should have caused the District Judge to submit this case to the jury for its consideration. 
    There is no question but that this case concerned conflicting testimony. 
    I am not here to state that the plaintiff would have won his case had the case been submitted to the jury. 
    The only question here is whether or not it should have been submitted for the jury's consideration rather than the District Judge's consideration. 
    Michalic was a fireman. 
    He had worked for three years prior to the date of the accident for the very, very same shipping company. 
    He had had Buerger's disease but for that three-year period, he claim that he was in good health, that he was able to work and in fact, some of the defendant's witnesses testified that his work was good, that he completed his work without any particular difficulty. 
    In addition, testimony showed that the officers of the vessel knew that he had the Buerger's disease condition and that they employed him in spite of that fact evidently because, and certainly we could draw the inference that he was a good workman and able to do his duties. 
    The lay-up period had just started. 
    This was a ship on the Great Lakes and as Your Honors well know, ships in the beginning of the winter season, that is the end of December, are laid up for the entire winter season to start their sailing again in the spring. 
    Michalic was a fireman and his area of duty was in the fire hole. 
    But during this lay-up period, he was ordered by his superior officer to go for the first time, he said, into the pumproom in order to help the pumpman do some work that was involved in the lay-up period. 
    He went into the pumproom. 
    He said that he was given a wrench, and I will go into the description of the wrench in a moment, a wrench and a mallet and was told what to do. 
    The pumpman testified pointblank that he never showed Michalic how to do the work nor did he watch him do the work, but he told him about the casing. 
    The casing was the machinery. 
    The particular pump covering that was to be taken off by Michalic loosening these 20 or so nuts from the casing itself. 
    Michalic stated that he worked for about an hour. 
    That the pumpman later came back or came back at that point from another job which he was doing and that Michalic told and complained to the pumpman about the condition of the mallet -- I'm sorry, about the condition of the wrench. 
    And the pumpman told him, "Never mind that. 
    Go ahead and complete the job. 
    Do the best you can," I believe were his exact words. 
    And Michalic did continue the job and finally completed the job. 
    At that point, the pumpman came out --

    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    On page 10, I believe, sir, of the record.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="358.908" stopTime="368.108">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Oh yes, I have it. 
    Thank you. 
    And now, all of this testimony on which you relied on raise the jury questions in the petitioner's testimony, is it?
speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="368.108" stopTime="590.356">
    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    The petitioner's testimony and one witness by the petitioner, and I will get to that witness' testimony in a moment. 
    We believe that all of that descriptive testimony concerning the condition of the wrench was sufficient to permit a submission of the case to the jury for its consideration. 
    May I point out the similarity of the language used by the petitioner and by his witness to the language used in the Jacob case by this Court. 
    In the Jacob case, in which this Court stated that there was sufficient evidence to permit submission of the case to the jury, there is this language “Petitioner used an S-shaped end wrench of the proper size which was “well-worn,” had seen a lot of service, “was a loose fit,” had a lot of play on it. 
    “It was worn.” 
    The play at the end was about an inch.” 
    And I think that our language is very similar. 
    In addition, there was a question of a safe place to work. 
    Michalic testified that in order to get down to the area of the pump he had to climb down from a catwalk which was at thwart ship, placed the thwart ship through the pumproom and “in between four beams which held this pump in order to stop it from vibrating and they work in an area of approximately six inches." 
    Other witnesses testified that it might have been as much as 16 inches, but in no case did any witness testify either less than 6 or more than 16. 
    In addition to that, the defendant put into evidence three exhibits showing the entire pumproom area and certainly, the particular pump itself. 
    The third question of course is whether or not there was sufficient instruction or, in fact, any instruction on the use of the method to be used by Michalic in taking the nuts off the casing and also whether or not there should've been supervision in asking a man, concededly inexperienced, to do work with special tools which he had never done before and in an area which he had never worked in before. 
    We state, and it is our belief, that the evidence is at least sufficient to have submitted this matter to the jury for its consideration. 
    The District Judge, in denying the case, stated simply that he had seen the area in which Michalic had to work from the pictures. 
    And he stated, as the reason for his conclusion of fact, and I state that it was his conclusion of fact, that Michalic was, in fact, given a safe place to work was that “Well, the pumpman did similar work on another pump. 
    If he could've gotten to his pump, why couldn't Michalic get to his?" 
    Of course, there was no evidence in the record that the pumps were in the same or in any similar place in the pumproom itself. 
    This was simply a statement by a judge going completely outside the record to assume that two men were doing similar work when, in fact, there was no evidence of that type in the record itself. 
    As far as the question of instruction and supervision of Michalic, the judge said, the District Court Judge that is, said that this isn't necessary. 
    He might not have been experienced, but experience isn't needed here. 
    Now, I submit that that question is, again, a question of fact which should have been submitted to the jury for its consideration and not by the District Court judge.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    What was he to understand that what happened is that the petitioner, while attempting to lose these nuts with this wrench, pounding against the handle with a mallet, knocked it out off his hands, it slipped off the nut and fell on his toe, is that it?
speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="607.618" stopTime="610.728">

    Yes.

    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    He doesn't -- he does not claim that the hitting of the mallet against the wrench knocked the wrench out of his hand. 
    He claims that, because the wrench could not hold against the nut, it slipped.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    It was against the nut and it slipped.
speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="633.456" stopTime="634.996">

    That caused the wrench to slip.

    Had slipped off the nut, as in here, it was knocked out off his hands, at the same time, it fell on his toe.

    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    That is correct, but it was the -- he claims that it was the slipping of the wrench off the nut that caused the wrench to slip out of his hand not the mere fact that he simply let go of the wrench. 
    There is no claim of that sort in the case. 
    I -- I wish to make that distinction, sir. 
    Now, in addition to the other three questions as to whether or not the tool was in fact effective, whether or not Michalic was given a safe place to work, and whether or not there should have been some instruction and supervision of the work, there is the question of a witness and the witness was the second mate aboard the vessel who testified for the plaintiff. 
    He was also the master of the vessel the year after or two years after. 
    And the witness on direct testimony stated, in similar terms, his conclusions that the wrench was defective in the sense of describing the wrench as beaten and battered as usual. 
    He stated that he knew the pumproom area. 
    He stated that he knew the tools.

    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    Thank you, sir, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    To continue, the witness involved was the second mate of the ship involved in this accident. 
    He stated that he knew the pumproom area, that he knew the tools, and that they were battered and beaten as usual, they were old, and they were worn, and that they had been in that condition for sometime. 
    Now, on the cross-examination, one of the first questions put to that witness was whether or not he was on the ship on the date of the accident itself and he stated that he had left the ship some-nine days before. 
    Because he was not on the ship on that particular day, all of his testimony was stricken, although there was quite obviously a presumption of continuation of condition in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, evidence which would show that there might have been a change in the condition of the various tools. 
    Now, it is our opinion that the rejection of that testimony, in it of itself, was sufficient to have caused -- to have called for a reversal in this particular case because that one witness who was of prime importance, being an officer of the vessel itself, and stating that he had knowledge of the tools and of the pumproom itself certainly should have been allowed to continue and testify in full concerning the conditions of the tools itself. 
    The fact that he had finished his direct testimony had no bearing on the subject because further testimony could have been brought out on cross-examination and certainly, further testimony could have been brought out on rebuttal or on redirect examination of the witness.

    I state, "The court below apparently and correctly reversed the trial court's exclusion of the testimony of Eisenbach, who was the witness." 
    In so doing, it seems clear that petitioner was, even then, denied the right of rebuttal testimony. 
    At which time, perhaps, the court's belief as the cause of elation could have been established. 
    It's not the reversal alone that's so important to witness, sufficient to have called for a reversal of the dismissal.

    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    No, sir. 
    I don't state it in so many words but it is, of course, raised as part of the whole question as to whether or not there should have been submission of the evidence to the jury for its consideration in the sense that the witness itself -- the witness himself stated or gave a further description of the tool which was then rejected in whole by the District Court. 
    And as I said on page 12, I stated the question at length, I believe, on the question of the exclusion of the testimony of that particular witness. 
    That was part of my argument in my petition and of course, the question was raised in my brief at this time and it was also raised in the Circuit Court. 
    Now, as I have read the Circuit Court's opinion, they used some of the testimony of the particular witness and in so doing, I would assume that they must have considered that there should have been a reversal or at least -- if not a reversal, at least that the witness' testimony should have been accepted by the District Court in deciding this -- the question of as to whether or not there should have been a directed verdict. 
    However, I would assume that, since the Circuit Court affirmed the District Court's dismissal, what they were saying in fact was that the other, if any, was harmless. 
    I suggest of course that it was not harmless but that this witness was a prime witness and that his testimony went to the very, very core of the entire argument.

    4 (a). 
    Yes, and it said a former mate and captain of the vessel who had been discharged by defendant described the tools as being in the pumproom, in December 1955, as being "beaten and battered condition." 
    They had very beaten and battered. 
    And then, of course, they referred to him again in his testimony about the lighting conditions in the pumproom on 5 (a), "Very poor in this lower level at all times," etcetera. 
    So that they evidently used his testimony but they must have come to the conclusion that the rejection of the entire testimony was harmless. 
    I -- I suggest that it was not because he was of prime concern, prime importance, and went to the very, very core of the case. 
    If there is to be a presumption of continuation of condition, the mere fact that he left the vessel nine days before could certainly not strike his testimony if there was, in fact, no evidence that there was any change in the condition of the tools or in the pumproom during that nine-day period. 
    Certainly, his evidence was entitled to some way even though he was not on the vessel the very moment of the accident itself, and that weight should have gone to the jury for its consideration. 
    Now, my last point, it seemed evident or may I -- may I go back for a moment. 
    The complaint was framed with the use of the word "teeth" in the wrench -- in the description of the wrench in the -- in the sense that it was stated in the complaint that the teeth of the wrench were defective and that the grip of the wrench was defective. 
    The Circuit Court, in dismissing the case, referred time after time to the teeth of the wrench and saying that “the plaintiff has not proved his case. 
    He says that the teeth of the wrench are defective and we now find that there were no teeth in the wrench. 
    He claims that the grip of the wrench was defective and we now find that there was no grip.” 
    There was no question but that there were no teeth of the wrench. 
    It was never asserted that there were any teeth on the wrench, except in the complaint itself. 
    There was a tremendous amount of pretrial preparation in the case and Mr. Ray, during the discussion of the argument of the opinion of the District Judge, conceded that he was not surprised in any way that there was no teeth on the wrench. 
    In short, the entire case was predicated to an open-end wrench which did not have any teeth but were, in fact, used by the plaintiff, as we said, in a defective condition.

   Argument of Lucian Y. Ray
speaker="lucian_y_ray" startTime="1368.438" stopTime="1684.703">
    Mr. Lucian Y. Ray 
    Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    The determination of the existence or nonexistence of negligence in a personal injury case, we suggest, Your Honors, involves, initially, the exercise of judicial judgment. 
    The petitioner in this case is asking this Court to substitute his judgment in that particular for the judgment of the two courts, both of which considered that -- those questions very exhaustibly - the trial court in hearing the testimony, the Circuit Court in reading the record, and the Circuit Court filed, as this Court knows, having examine the record, a seven-page per curiam opinion in which nearly -- in which all, I would say after an examination of the record carefully, in which all of the testimony upon which the petitioner relies is set forth in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    And the Circuit Court has said that, considering that testimony in its most favorable light to the petitioner, it found no evidence of negligence or unseaworthiness which was approximate cause of the man's accident. 
    Now, we agree with my friend here that the sole issue before this Court is whether the petitioner's testimony considered in his most favorable light presented the jury question. 
    We say to Your Honors that it's not a question of the weighing of conflicting testimony. 
    It's not a question of the balancing of testimony. 
    It's simply a question of taking his testimony and saying whether a jury question is presented. 
    Before -- before adverting to the three faults which were alleged in the complaint, I'd like to bring these two facts to the attention of the Court so that the Court may understand the background of the situation. 
    This man had been not only a seaman for three years on the vessels owned by this respondent which were tankers, all of them are tankers, but he had had prior experience. 
    He was a fireman but the uncontradicted testimony in the trial court was that, during the lay-up -- lay-out -- the lay-up and fill-up of these vessels, it was part of the fireman's duties to work in the pumproom and to work on the pumps. 
    So, he was not unpermitted with the task that he had and may I suggest to -- may I suggest to the Court that on the question of instruction, which apparently was an afterthought because it was not a charged fault in the complaint, lack of instruction, that he admitted -- he admitted that the -- in his testimony, you will find it on page 10 of the record, that the pumpman had instructed him how to remove these knots. 
    And I say to this Court that whether the pumpman had instructed him or not, certainly, the putting of a wrench -- an open-faced wrench on these 20 nuts on the casing of a centrifugal pump, hitting them -- hitting the handle or the grip of that wrench with a mallet is a rather simple operation and wouldn't require instruction or supervision. 
    Now, there are -- there are three faults. 
    One was the allege lack of proper light, one, the alleged lack of proper space and the third, the alleged defective wrench. 
    Now, I'd like to consider the testimony relative to the first two and consider the wrench last because, apparently, that's the most important. 
    Now, there's a -- there's a rather substantial amount of testimony in the record with respect to the lighting situation, but it consisted principally of the wattage, the amount of the globes, how much wattage they had, the distance from the pump, and the deadlights, where they were located, whether the deadlights were clean or whether they were not. 
    But the Court will find, upon examination of this record, that there is not iota of testimony in which this petitioner suggested that the light affected in any way his ability to do the job that he was doing. 
    And I ask him on cross examination whether he had any difficulty seeing those nuts and he said, “I did not have any difficulty,” and I say to Your Honors that, that -- on that issue, that laid that issue at rest. 
    There is no affirmative testimony on his part that he was having any difficulty because of the lighting situation and seeing the casing, the nuts, the mallet, and the wrench and he admitted affirmatively, in response to my question, that he had no difficulty.

    What page is that on?
speaker="lucian_y_ray" startTime="1689.772" stopTime="1787.405">
    Mr. Lucian Y. Ray 
    That, Your Honor, is on page 26 of the record. 
    I asked him, “You had no difficulty seeing the bolts, did you?” 
    Answer, “No, sir.” 
    Now, in respect to the lack of working space, here, again, there was a great deal of testimony relating to the measurements in the pumproom -- of the pumproom, the location of the bulkheads in the pumproom, the fact that there were pipes in the pumproom, and that there were girders in the pumproom. 
    There was -- there was some testimony as to measurements. 
    There is not one -- there is that kind of statistical testimony that there is not one iota of testimony in which it can even been be inferred that he was being hampered in any way in caring out this job. 
    And he was asked -- he was asked to explain how he did the job and he said he put -- he put the wrench on -- he put the wrench on the nuts and then he -- then, he hit the wrench with the mallet. 
    And in answer to Justice Brennan's question, while it isn't entirely clear in the record, I think it can be assumed that it was done horizontally because if you'll examine the -- you'll examine the photographs that appear in the back of the record as to the -- as to the pumps and the casing, that's the only way it could be done.

    There were 20 bolts and nuts on this -- on this pump casing.

    He was either on the 16th bolt or the 16th nut at the time when this occurred. 
    In other words, he'd taken off 15 or 16 of those nuts. 
    And it's -- when he got to this 17th, let's -- let's say, and was probably going through the same operation that he had on the other thing that something happened. 
    Now, he said that -- he said that the wrench slipped. 
    I say to this Court that the fact that the wrench slipped is not significant and doesn't -- and doesn't establish negligence. 
    And there's no evidence of negligence because it could -- it could slip for several reasons. 
    It could slip from the -- from -- as a result of the position on which he -- on which he -- which he had the wrench on that nut. 
    That's one thing it could slip off. 
    It could slip from the way he hit the -- the handle with a mallet.

    Well, I can't answer that, Your Honor, whether it stayed up or it's down or fall off. 
    I mean, what if -- what if I should -- I mean, it would depend on how it was placed on there. 
    I would say this, that this man, using this wrench that he described after this has occurred and that he didn't report to even a man who was in the pumproom with him, didn't report this accident and didn't report to any officer for three months later, I would say that he got 16 of these nuts off using this all beat-up decrepit wrench and after all, the thing I -- it seems to me that the issue in this case is whether that wrench that he used was able to perform the function for which it was being used, and that was to take those nuts off. 
    And I think the court below was 100% correct in saying that you -- that you do not get to the question of negligence in this case by simply saying that something is defective, something is old, something is decrepit. 
    You've got to -- you've got to pinpoint this proposition.You've got to -- let's refer to the Jacob's case. 
    I'd say this, that if there would have been the proof in this case than there was in the Jacob's case, that you had a lot of play in the jaw of that wrench like there was in the Jacob's case, I'd say -- I would say that the court probably should have sent that -- let that case go to the jury.

    wI mean, I am a defense lawyer entirely but it seems to me that there is still some obligation on the part of a seaman to establish fault, and this Court has not ruled otherwise.

    It appears on page 3 (a) of the opinion of the Court of Appeals, where the petitioner testified he told the pumpman, "This tool is not very good, kind of beat-up. 
    This wrench keeps slipping off." 
    Now, in tying those two things together, the fact that this -- this tool is not very good means, for the purpose he has it, and this "kind of beat-up" would mean some material part of it and the fact that “the wrench keeps slipping off,” aren't those things, when combined, some evidence that the -- that the tool is not sufficient for the task?

    My friend has adverted to the testimony of the second mate. 
    At the -- at the conclusion of his testimony, a motion to strike was made and the court did not strike all of his testimony.

    And certainly, if this Court would find that that wrench was defective, that, in it of itself, I believe would compel a decision that the vessel was unseaworthy.

    This is all tied up in one cause of action in your complaint.

    No.

    May I --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're right.
speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="3139.577" stopTime="3181.140">
    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    Go through a certain testimony very quickly. 
    On the motion to strike the witness' testimony, may I respectfully direct the Court's attention to page 47 of the record. 
    Mr. Ray, “I move that the witness' testimony be stricken.” 
    The Court, “Ladies and gentlemen, everything this man said about what he had seen on or about that day in his previous testimony, all of which relating to December 28th when this plaintiff was heard and date immediately around it has to go out," so that his testimony was stricken in its entirety. 
    Whether or not a question, perhaps, about his prior service on the ship was stricken is unimportant. 
    The important thing is that all testimony concerning the condition of the tools was stricken.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3181.140" stopTime="3196.958">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The Court of Appeals did consider it and still affirmed the judgment and thereby, you implicitly say that they -- that -- or you say that their implicit ruling was that it should have been admitted rather than excluded, don't you?
speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="3196.958" stopTime="3198.980">
    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    That is correct, that is correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3198.980" stopTime="3207.581">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But what they are saying, in effect, isn't it, that even if it had been admitted, they were still no -- there was still not enough evidence to take a case to the jury.
speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="3207.581" stopTime="3362.994">
    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    That -- that is correct and my claim, of course, is that they were wrong in that statement. 
    Evidently, they're assuming that the order, if any, was harmless or some such intent, and I say that the loss of further cross-examination and the loss of further redirect examination could have brought out facts in this case which would have satisfied any District Court judge if that man had been further allowed to testify. 
    On page 10, we have stated of course that the tool was chewed up. 
    Now, if Your Honors will see these two questions and two answers on the top, "Can you describe this wrench?” 
    “It is about one foot long.” 
    “Was it an adjustable end or open-end wrench?” 
    “It was an open-end wrench. 
    It was an all -- it was an old wrench, all chewed up on the end.” 
    Now, can we possibly say that he was not talking about the jure end of the wrench? 
    This isn't a matter of simply saying, "Well, the wrench was all chewed up." 
    He is specifically pointing to the open-end part of the wrench and saying that the wrench was all chewed up on the end. 
    There can be no other assumption in this matter. 
    Now, as to the question of instruction and supervision, the pumpman himself admittedly -- admitted that he -- that he showed him nothing about the wrench. 
    He told him nothing about the job itself. 
    I direct your attention to page 72 of the record. 
    Did you show -- question, “Did you show him the nuts he had to knock off?” 
    Answer, “No, I told him the casing. 
    There was only one pump there on that side, centrifugal pump.” 
    “When that -- when that happened, did he have to leave the catwalk and get down to a lower level?” 
    “Yes, sir.” 
    “Did you watch him work?” 
    “No, sir.” 
    So that, there is specific testimony by the pumpman himself that he gave him neither instruction nor supervision. 
    And certainly, if the -- as I know the Court will, when you read the District Court's decision -- opinion granting the directed verdict, you will see that the court itself stated that this man was given no instruction and then the court went on to say “Well, of course he didn't need instruction because it was such a simple job.” 
    Certainly, as to whether or not the job was simple enough when it had to be handled with special non-sparking tools, hit in such a way by an experienced man in an area that he claims he had never been in before in his entire life, was certainly a question for the jury.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3362.994" stopTime="3364.638">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Who was the trial judge?
speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="3364.638" stopTime="3366.726">
    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    Judge Cannel, I believe.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3366.726" stopTime="3366.842">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Cannel.
speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="3366.842" stopTime="3464.094">
    Mr. Harvey Goldstein 
    James Cannel. 
    Then, on the question of safe place to work, as to whether or not the corridors were, in fact, too close, on page 22 of the record. 
    Question, “Was there any catwalk in the area of that pump you talked about?” 
    “Yes, sir”. 
    “Where was that located?” 
    “It goes across the ship.” 
    “But is it right over the casing or to the side?” 
    “Halfway over. 
    It is halfway over the casing.” 
    “Now, when you were taking the bolts and nuts off, how many of those nuts had you taken off at the time the wrench slipped?” 
    “I had taken them all off but about five or six.” 
    “You took those off without difficulty?” 
    “I had a hard time loosening them off.” 
    “But you got them off?” 
    “Yes.” 
    “In other words, you put the wrench on them and tapped it with the mallet and loosen them, and then you turned the nuts off?” 
    Answer, “I had a hard time taking them off.” 
    Now, whether or not this man was talking about the tightness of the nuts or the closeness of the corridors is something that I cannot state. 
    I look at the record and I say that, from this record, it could have easily been inferred that what he was talking about was the closeness of the corridors rather than the hardness of the nut, and I suggest that that, in it of itself, would be a submissible issue to the jury for its consideration and not the courts. 
    Thank you, sir.
