United States v. Neustadt

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- United States, Petitioner, versus Stanley S. Neustadt et al. 
    Mr. Orrick.
speaker="william_h_orrick" startTime="8.731" stopTime="249.297">
    Mr. William H. Orrick, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In this case, the respondent's attempt to establish a principle which could subject the United States to an enormous liability, this principle is based on the theory that the insurer of a mortgage who has appraised for insurance purposes the property constituting the security for the mortgage, is liable to a purchaser of that property, unknown at the time of the appraisal, for the difference between the purchase price and the fair market value of the property. 
    The cases here on writ of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit, which is in effect to establish that principle by affirming the trial court. 
    Now, the facts in the case are simply stated under the -- to take advantage of the National Housing Act, one who intends to sell a house that is eligible for FHA mortgage insurance, they generally do some work quickly, if he knows the amount for which the FHA would appraise his house in the maximum amount, up to which, it will insure any mortgage on the house. 
    To obtain this information, he must have a financial institution approved by the FHA as a mortgagee. 
    Make an application to the FHA for a so-called, "conditional commitment." 
    When the FHA receives such an application, it sends an appraiser to appraise the property to determine whether it meets the standards of eligibility and to fix evaluation for insurance purposes. 
    If the property is found eligible, the Commissioner in this so-called, conditional commitment, to insure mortgage on the house, is bound to insure it an amount computed on the appraised value of the property, subject to the condition that the mortgagor when he comes along is found financially able to carry the mortgage. 
    Now, upon issuing the conditional commitment to a proposed mortgagee, the Commissioner also issues a separate document entitled, Statement of FHA Appraisal, which sets forth the written -- the appraised value of the property as determined by the Commissioner. 
    And under the statute, the seller is bound to deliver a copy of this appraisal to the buyer prior to the sale. 
    In the case at bar, Colonel Almquist in March of 1957, followed the procedure I have mentioned above and had an approved institution, make application for a conditional commitment. 
    In following the procedure, an appraiser was sent out to his house, by some time prior to March 14th of that year. 
    Now, on March 14th, Mr. Stanley Neustadt, the respondent here, the plaintiff below, was a Washington lawyer, was looking for a house and he and his wife looked at Colonel Almquist's house, after the appraiser had made his inspection. 
    Mr. Neustadt, the -- the house suited Mr. and Mrs. Neustadt and they considered the possibility of hiring someone to inspect the house, but it was his understanding that the FHA appraisal would disclose any matters of structural defects or matters as to which he had any concern. 
    He was informed as to that, by his real estate agent and that was his understanding.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="william_h_orrick" startTime="294.946" stopTime="803.462">
    Mr. William H. Orrick, Jr. 
    The -- Mr. Neustadt then made an offer on this house for the sum of $24,500. 
    The offer was conditioned, expressly conditioned on receiving an appraisal in that same amount, an FHA appraisal of $24,500. 
    The appraiser who had been out there and now made his report and he reported that the house was worth only $22,750. 
    So the condition of the contract was not met and this backed the fact that the house was appraised and a lower figure caused Mr. Neustadt -- that he testified grave concern. 
    He then satisfied himself that the reason the house was appraised at a lesser value was not because there was no structural defect in the house. 
    That was his major concern. 
    He was relying in short on that appraisal. 
    Now, having the information that the house is appraised for $22,750, he then made another offer in a contract dated April 9th, 1957. 
    And this time, the offer was conditioned upon receiving an appraisal for the property at $22,750. 
    The condition was met. 
    The -- the closing and the -- and the transaction took place on July 2nd. 
    He moved into the property on July 10th and on July 11th, he noted some -- the house began to settle, cracks began to appear in the plaster. 
    He had the damage investigated by drilling a hole in the -- through the cement floor in the basement. 
    It was discovered that some water had collected under there. 
    And he then -- six months later, brought the instant case. 
    Now, the position of the United States is first that there is no duty running from the FHA to an unknown purchaser of the property to appraise that separately. 
    Second, that even if such a duty is found that the United States is not liable for negligent misrepresentation which is the essence of this case whether -- and third that the term misrepresentation as it is set forth in the Federal Tort Claims Act and is the section from which the United States excludes itself form liability for then the torts set forth in Section 2880 (h) of that Act includes negligent misrepresentation. 
    And on this point, I am not going to take the time of the Court to argue because on eight different occasions, in six different circuits, including the Fourth Circuit in the case at bar, it has been held unanimously each time that the word misrepresentation included in Section 2680 (h) of the statute means and includes negligent misrepresentation. 
    But if the Court please, I would like to consider our second point very briefly which is that the gravamen of this action is the communication by an agent of the Federal Government to the -- Mr. Neustadt of a fact upon which he relied, which turned out to be untrue, namely that this house which he purchased had -- contains structural defects. 
    Mr. Neustadt in his complaint which is reprinted in the printed record on page 2 in paragraph 6, states that he relied upon that provision of the contract of sale that the -- any defect in the property would be disclosed in the appraisal. 
    He testified and his testimony is contained on page 15 that he understood the FHA appraisal would disclose matters of the kind about which he had any concern, so he wouldn't have to hire an expert to look at the property. 
    He testified that on page 17 of the printed record that he established to his satisfaction that the lower appraisal did not and could not in fact represent the difference in an appraisal -- represent the existence of a defect. 
    And on page 18, he testified that once he and his wife were convinced that the appraisal did not indicate any unsoundness in the home, he made another offer for the property. 
    Now, this was the -- a communication made to him through this appraisal, which as it turned out, was erroneous and upon which he relied to purchase this property and it was this communication that's the very essence of the common law tort of misrepresentation. 
    Mr. Neustadt also wrote a letter to the FHA which is in the record on file before this Court. 
    It's not reprinted in the record, but stating in effect that he -- the same terms of reliance. 
    Now, the position of the respondents with which we take issue, is that the appraisers, they're not -- they say they're complaining that the appraiser's negligence resulted in the issuance of mortgage insurance and consequently, in their purchase of a defective structure and that it was the availability of this insurance and not the receipt of the appraisal report, which in -- in effect that caused them to purchase the house. 
    And it's our position that this house -- that that is simply begging the question. 
    It's an -- an attempt to escape this misrepresent -- an attempt to escape liability on the ground that there was no communication to them. 
    Once the house was appraised at $22,750, all the parties concerned knew what the FHA would -- the amount for which it would insure the mortgage. 
    And thus of the time this contract was complete, the damage had in effect be done -- been done. 
    The only way that Mr. Neustadt could then have gotten out of his bargain was if he were deemed a poor credit risk, not if he were -- if the house were found to be structurally defective.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    His appraisal was a statutory obligation of the FHA.

    Mr. William H. Orrick, Jr. 
    Yes, sir.

speaker="william_h_orrick" startTime="813.913" stopTime="845.531">
    Mr. William H. Orrick, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    The FHA appraises the properties, which it is going to insure to determine the amount of the mortgage which it will insure. 
    And this is all in -- within the structure of the basic philosophy of the National Housing Act, which is to encourage private capital to lend money so that much needed housing can be constructed.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="845.531" stopTime="854.502">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was that requirement in any way, for the benefit of the purchaser or is it just for the Government's own information?
speaker="william_h_orrick" startTime="854.502" stopTime="995.090">
    Mr. William H. Orrick, Jr. 
    Under Section 226 and 1954, Mr. Chief Justice, the Congress imposed upon the seller, the duty of transmitting to the perspective purchaser a written copy, a written statement of the amount of the FHA appraisal. 
    And the form of that statement is set forth in the record at page 53, it's Government's Exhibit No. 2. 
    Now, the purpose of the Congress in making that condition was to put the purchaser on an equal footing with the seller. 
    The seller already had that information. 
    And it was not as -- has been claimed to make the United States liable to the purchaser for the amount of the difference between the amount of the appraisal and his purchase price. 
    And if the Court please, if there was -- any doubt on that, I would refer to an exert from the hearings that the -- held by the Congress at that time which appears on page 28 of the Government's brief in which Senator Bennett asks the Nuestadt case that in effect, he send and a question whereto Mr. Cole then the Commissioner. 
    But in the last analysis, the property owner cannot say to the Federal Government, well, your inspector inspected my house and now look what's happened therefore, you're responsible, therefore, you must come down here and fix it up. 
    Isn't that a correct statement of the limitation, Mr. Cole? 
    I think so.

    The statute Mr. Justice Harlan was enacted for an entirely different purpose. 
    The -- and the -- in the Government's reply brief on page 7, the purposes step is set out. 
    It's to help protect the buyer from artificially inflated prices, perhaps beyond the replacement cost and caused by these easy mortgage terms which then became available.

    They said that they wanted to protect the buyer from this artificially inflated prices and -- but this it's secondary purpose of the Act. 
    I do not think that the -- as Senator Bennett's statement there and it's borne out in the balance of the hearings at that time. 
    I do not think that the Congress intended to impose a primary duty on the FHA running to a purchaser unknown at the time that it appraised the house, to appraise the house that carefully for that purchaser's benefit.

    In this case, the communication -- he was injured solely by the communication and that is the very essence of the tort of misrepresentation, as it's set out in Glanzer against Shepard and the Erie Railroad case and the other cases cited in our brief. 
    It's a very different situation from of the situation as in the (Inaudible) case where the United States undertook a duty to clear the channel and failed to clear it properly and then told people that it had cleared it properly. 
    And then the ship runs a ground. 
    That is not the concept of the tort of misrepresentation.

   Argument of Lawrence J. Latto
speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="1902.480" stopTime="2373.580">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    As Mr. Orrick has pointed out, there are three issues in this case, two of which I think it's fair to say or not of the con which ordinarily reached this Court, when it's the ordinary question of whether there was a duty of care, whether there's an action and negligence. 
    Another is what is the nature of this case? 
    We assert that it is the common law action of negligence. 
    The Government asserts that it's a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. 
    The third question as the one just averted to and that is I think an important question of interpretation of a provision of the Tort Claims Act. 
    Does the exception for misrepresentation in 28 U.S.C. 2680 (h) cover deliberate misrepresentation or does it include negligent misrepresentation as well? 
    I should point out briefly in respond to Justice Frankfurter's question that the common element of all of the torts accepted in 2680 (h) is deliberateness. 
    There's no element of conscious false in assault and in libel and in slander and then the other torts included in that section. 
    But there is a common element of deliberateness and I hope to return to this question at the latter part of my argument. 
    I would like to return to the question raised by Justice Whittaker and Justice Frankfurter and that is the question whether there was a duty of care owed to these respondents by the Government, in connection with the inspection and appraisal functions under the National Housing Act. 
    We are in agreement with the Government that the purpose or the purposes of the National Housing Act in -- in particular of these functions under the National Housing Act, is a matter of critical importance. 
    We don't think it is the only relevant factor, but certainly it is one that's entitled to very great weight. 
    And Mr. Orrick said in the course of his argument that this -- there was a secondary purpose to protect the prospective purchaser of a home. 
    My difficulty with the argument is that Congress said otherwise and said so quite unmistakably. 
    Now, I go back to the initial enactment of the National Housing Act when this procedure for inspection and appraisal was first instituted. 
    And in the very first report of the Federal Housing Administration, it was explained that the existence of this function provided a purchaser of a home with the benefit which was not available to the purchaser of a home which would be financed through a conventional mortgage. 
    They wanted to say that the purchaser will have what probably only a small percentage of home buyers have ever had in the past. 
    The benefit of knowing that the appraised value set upon the property, which he intends to buy or build by a trained evaluator acting in accordance with the procedure designed to reduce to a minimum errors that might result in casual or hasty conclusions. 
    And in the subsequent year, the FHA explained that the valuation and inspections made by trained staff members of the administration tends to ensure that the dwelling is in a good physical condition. 
    Similarly a few years later, the FHA explains, tends to ensure that the dwelling is in good physical condition. 
    Now, this will become less equivocal as I go on. 
    Two or three years later, the 5th Annual Report explained, The Administration aims that no homeowner or home seeker should through ignorance of the insured mortgage plan, enter into a transaction without having the benefit of a careful disinterested examination of the property, which is the examination that is made by the FHA inspector." 
    We now move over to 1954 when the rather thorough going revision and amendment of the National Housing Act was made. 
    And in the course of that revision, attention was given to the program under which homes or mortgages insuring single family homes are issued by the Federal Housing Administration. 
    The Congress indicated a -- a considerable dissatisfaction with an attitude that had developed within the FHA. 
    The agency had been regarding itself more or less, as the hand making of the mortgage lending industry and of the construction industry. 
    And Congress took some paying to ensure that this would not be the approach that it brought to the performance of its functions under the Act. 
    Congress provided that for the first time in 1954, that a written statement of the appraised value would have to be furnished to a perspective purchaser of the property. 
    And the legislative history is very clear as to what Congress had in mind. 
    Congress explained that well, to be sure, the FHA should be concerned with protecting its insurance fund, the builder and the mortgagee against loss. 
    It said that it feel that there is a need for change in the approach or philosophy of -- of administration that the Federal Housing Administration appears to have manifested that thus far. 
    Your Committee fully appreciates the importance of maintaining a high level of housing production. 
    But these objectives should not obscure the fact the that first responsibility of Congress and they emphasized first and that of any agency administrating -- administering part or all of the housing program, is to protect and preserve the public interest in general and the rights of homeowners in particular, then the report went on. 
    It is your Commit -- Committee's considered opinion and unless contrary views are expressed or amendments are offered and there were no contrary views expressed and no amendments offered, it is the intent of Congress that the HHFA and its constituent agencies one of which is the FHA, in their administration of the program which they are authorized to carry out, shall at all times regard as a primary responsibility -- as a primary responsibility, their duty to act in the interest of the individual home purchaser. 
    Now, this same Act provided an additional protection to home buyers, those persons who were buying new homes, this was not a new home, this home had been built some time in the past before it would have been purchased. 
    In connection with the new home program, Congress provided that the builder was required to issue a certification to the purchaser that his home had been built in accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the FHA based its appraisal. 
    Congress went onto explain, however, this is still in the Senate Report, While this affords a measure of protection to the purchaser, it does not protect him against all structural defects, poor materials or poor workmanship. 
    Basically, the homeowner is dependent upon sound underwriting by the FHA and VA and -- and effective inspection on compliance program and your Committee would like to direct the attention of the FHA to the importance that attaches to them. 
    And a later point in the same report, the Committee said, It should be noted as was discussed earlier in the report that the requirement of certification is only supplemental to the compliance and inspection systems of the FHA and VA which are the primary means of insuring the construction of sound homes.

    The Tort Claims Act provides that were a governmental function is carried out there is an obligation to carry out this function with care.

    I agree that if this is held to be the tort of negligent misrepresentation and if the Court aggressed with the Courts of Appeals that the term misrepresentation in 2680 (h) is to be read to include negligent misrepresentation, then we lose our case. 
    I argue first that this is not the tort of negligent misrepresentation, but the tort of negligence, so that 2680 (h) is not applicable at all. 
    I argue second, that if this is considered to be the tort of negligent misrepresentation, then 2680 (h) is inapplicable because it was not intended to include negligent misrepresentations, the claims arising out of negligent misrepresentations, but only claims arising out of deliberate misrepresentation.

    They said that in each case, you have to examine the facts and see what the gravamen of the action is.

    I -- I -- as I say, I -- I misspoke before and I think that's -- that the correct answer to Your Honor's question is that it would be decided by state law. 
    Unfortunately, this is the problem that we have here with the introduction of fact and notice pleading in this century. 
    The courts have been little concerned with this particular issue. 
    They haven't attempted to decide whether your cause of action is negligence or whether your cause of action is negligent misrepresentation. 
    Indeed, there are some question in my mind as to whether there is a tort of negligent misrepresentation, because recovery on these set of facts only began within the last 50 or 60 years and this parallel, the situation in which the causes of action were at the same time being abandoned. 
    So that there's very little authority on this point that can be gleaned that's helpful, certainly, there's nothing in Virginia.

    And if I may, I will turn that now.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I apologize to how to this (Inaudible)
speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="2994.535" stopTime="3127.166">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    You have not, sir. 
    I -- I'm content that I think to rest upon the line of inquiries suggested by the Government in its brief. 
    In its summary of argument, it says, "It is clear that this exception from misrepresentation bars negligent as well as willful misrepresentation." 
    They point out that Five Circuits have so held and then say, "This interpretation is supported by the structure of the Tort Claims Act, by its history and by the general principles of tort law." 
    I think the Government is wrong on all three counts. 
    If I can turn first to the structure of the Tort Claims Act, the Government's argument essentially, is the 2680 (h) excludes misrepresentation and deceit and they rely essentially on the cannon of construction that says that you must strive to give meaning to every word in a statute and since deceit already covers false -- knowingly false misrepresentations -- misrepresentation must be read to mean negligent misrepresentations as well. 
    I certainly don't deny that there are times when the cannons of construction are usual. 
    If the hazard has enterprise even in this case, I should point out that if you give misrepresentation, the meaning urged by the Government or indeed the meaning which we urge that be no need for the word deceit in the statute, so that one or the other word is going to be superfluous here. 
    We also rely on an equally vulnerable cannon of construction and that is that words should be given meaning in accordance with the context in which they're found. 
    And if 2680 (h) is read in its entirety rather than just selecting these two words from the statute, you find that it represents an intention on the part of Congress to exclude virtually all of the deliberate torts known to the common law, assault, battery, false imprisonment and the like. 
    And at least one can start with the assumption that it may will be that deliberate torts were intended to be excluded and nothing more. 
    If we turn to the legislative history and I'll come back --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3127.166" stopTime="3128.841">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Before you move on, may I ask you this question?

    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    Yes, you may.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3129.433" stopTime="3137.978">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Suppose this appraisal as for reason for its own, purposefully put in a line of appraisal, will that be excluded on the Tort Act?
speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="3137.978" stopTime="3204.408">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    It certainly would and there is some sense in this, if Your Honor please. 
    And this involves the structure of the Tort Claims Act which I'll come [Laughs] back to before going to the legislative history. 
    As this Court well knows, this Act took about 30 years of congressional consideration before it was adopted. 
    And Congress was plagued throughout this period by private acts and they were concerned about the kind of (Inaudible) of justice that was rendered by this group. 
    When the Act was adopted, the underlying premise involved the recognition of the fact that with the Government increasingly involved in large scale enterprises, mistakes were going to be made. 
    People are going to be injured because of the negligence of Government employees. 
    The feeling was that the damage when it occurred ought not to be visited upon the individuals who happened to be concerned, but ought to be shared by the country generally. 
    And so essentially, what we have is an act which makes the Government liable for the negligence of its service. 
    Now --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3204.408" stopTime="3220.704">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible) I'm having trouble getting to my mind, doesn't (Inaudible) right that when a person files an FHA insures a house, not only gets and insured mortgage, but he gets an insurance against defect.
speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="3220.704" stopTime="3241.018">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    He gets no insurance at all, because if the inspection has been properly conducted. 
    But the man is in error, he even makes a -- the mistake of judgment. 
    There's no cause of action here at all. 
    It's -- it's necessary that you prove that he was negligent when he made the appraisal. 
    (Voice Overlap) -- this is not a guarantee or an insurance to the purchaser at all.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3241.018" stopTime="3249.690">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    The negligence here seems to be established on the mere existence of the facts that the house did crack.
speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="3249.690" stopTime="3254.444">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    Oh, that's -- that is not the case at all. 
    I mean, I -- I -- this has not been an issue in this case.

    I understood him to say, counsel, Mr. Orrick, to say that the time amount was appraised at a perfectly (Inaudible)

    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    The petitioner does not say that and the record does not say that. 
    There was overwhelming proof in this case that any competent appraiser would have found very serious structural defects that existed in this house at the time his inspection was made. 
    This is a very difficult matter to establish and it will be established in very few cases I may say, but it happened to be established in this case. 
    Negligence was not inferred from the fact the damage at all. 
    There was a specific proof on this Court. 
    If I may return to this question of the meaning of misrepresentation in 2680 (h), if -- if in truth that the -- the broad and just purpose of the Tort Claims Act is to make the Government liable for the negligence of its employees and this Court in Indian Towing said that this was a purpose of the Act. 
    I see no reason for this very grudging and niggardly interpretation that the Government seeks to give to the word in this representation. 
    It detracts from rather than further, is the central purpose of the Act. 
    It results in denying recovery in many cases where there plainly should be recovery, in some of the cases in the Courts of Appeals that Government relies upon, were such cases. 
    It has almost nothing to commend it, except for these cannon of construction upon which they rely. 
    And if I have sometime, I'd like to turn to the legislative history. 
    Here, we're something of a disadvantage.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3360.708" stopTime="3393.247">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I hope I don't reduce your time that you've left if I ask you whether there's any explicit reference in the legislative history to the meaning that was in the mind with the draft which they explicitly in words as to what misrepresentation of purposes of age was intended to cover. 
    Is there any explicit -- I don't -- I -- await your argumentation. 
    But is there anything which tells me that Congressman Jones said misrepresentation means thus himself?
speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="3393.247" stopTime="3441.770">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    The reference is to 2680 (h), the explicit reference is where to the statute -- where through that section as a whole, not 2680, but 2680 (h) and to the exception of assault and battery. 
    There were no explicit references to misrepresentation and deceit. 
    There were several references I should say, to 2680 (h), the section which had all 11 torts. 
    And these references are perfectly clear. 
    The Department of Justice which had hand in drafting the bill, sent a formal memorandum to the Congress and it explained that these were deliberate torts. 
    The Assistant Attorney General testified in connection with the legislation and he informed the Committee that these were deliberate torts. 
    The Senate reports on --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3441.770" stopTime="3445.433">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That couldn't be slander and libel and not deliberate torts?
speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="3445.433" stopTime="3450.387">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    Well, they are certainly commonly thought of as deliberate torts.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3450.387" stopTime="3460.463">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But really, well, the most of the (Inaudible) and slander and libel, except when it purposefully done and (Inaudible) non-deliberative forms.
speaker="lawrence_j_latto" startTime="3460.463" stopTime="3785.552">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Latto 
    Well, it is true and the Government has relied very heavily on this that there are occasions on which these torts can be committed negligently. 
    But I think in trying to ascertain the intent of Congress, it's fair to assume that we're dealing with a number of lawyers and other laymen and the common understanding of these torts is that they are deliberate. 
    For example, there were several law review articles written shortly after the enactment of the Tort Claims Act by scholars in the law, Professor Gilhorn at Columbia, Professor Davis who's written so much in the administration of law field, and Mr. Gately who was in the Tort Claim Section of the Department of Justice at the time. 
    All of these men referred naturally and without further consideration to the exception for deliberate torts included in 2680 (h). 
    Now, it maybe their refined analysis will find in occasional case in which these torts are not committed deliberately. 
    But certainly, the common understanding, the explanation by the framers of the bill to the Congress was that 2680 (h) included deliberate torts alone. 
    I'd like to say a word about the question suggested by Justice Whittaker, which related to the fact that if this -- if a -- if a deliberate misstatement had been made by an inspector, I agree that there would be no liability and it seems initially odd that there should be liability for a -- in effect, a lesser tort. 
    But if one looks to the structure of the Act, it seems fairly plain that libel, slander, conscious misrepresentation, this is the kind of activity which is not ordinarily engaged in by a government employee as part of his governmental functions. 
    If a man slanders someone, perhaps in law, he would be regarded as acting within the scope of his employment, but as a practical matter, he's not engaged in carrying out a governmental function. 
    On the other hand, if he is carrying out this inspection function and negligently performs it to someone's injury, then we have a case which falls within the classic pattern of the Tort Claims Act. 
    So that isn't at least bit hard that Congress might have decided that were a government employee strays off the reservation as it were and access an individual that there should be no governmental liability, except for the unusual case where they would still be the private bill available. 
    This seems to me a perfectly sensible reason for 2680 (h). 
    Now finally, Mr. Orrick opened his argument by pointing out that if this case were affirmed, there would be vast liability visited upon the United States. 
    I think I have two brief answers to this. 
    First if it were true, his argument would be addressed to the Congress and not to this Court as this Court pointed out in (Inaudible). 
    More important perhaps is the fact that it is not true. 
    Under the Tort Claims Act, the United States is liable only in circumstances were a private person would be liable in like circumstances to a private individual. 
    Under the common law, as it has been generally recognized throughout the United States, they had been limitations imposed upon the kind of widespread liability that Mr. Orrick is talking about, where a single negligent act is likely to give rise to very widespread liability. 
    Courts have uniformly held that there is no duty of care, the classic case in this area is the Cardozo -- Judge Cardozo's opinion in Ultramares against Touche where an accountant's certificate which might be sent very widely abroad, was held not to give -- not to give rise to a duty of care in favor to anyone that might read and rely upon it. 
    This is to be compared with his same opinion in Glanzer against Shepard, where a public weigher was held liable to a third party who relied upon his certificate of weight, because he had reason to expect that such reliance will be given and where the extent of the liability would be limited. 
    So long as -- as in this case, the total damage which could be inflicted upon the United States is the value of this house, the damage contented for the Government simply would not result.
