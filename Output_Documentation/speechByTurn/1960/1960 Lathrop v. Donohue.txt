Lathrop v. Donohue
speaker="gordon_sinykin" startTime="0.000" stopTime="180.107">
    Mr. Gordon Sinykin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The argument on behalf of the appellee will be divided between myself and the Attorney General of Wisconsin. 
    And I will try to deal with the questions of jurisdiction and First Amendment freedoms and my associate will discuss the proposition that integration of the Bar is a reasonable form and means of regulating the profession. 
    With respect to the jurisdictional question of whether an appeal lies in this case under subsection 2 of Section 1257, there is no doubt that the word statute of any state mean legislative action of some kind whether it is direct action by the legislature or -- or by delegated authority to a Commissioner of board or a municipality in the form of municipal ordinances. 
    Likewise, there is no doubt that the integration orders here in question, orders promulgated by the Wisconsin Supreme Court constitute judicial action. 
    The only question then, the only possible issue is whether such judicial action can be equated to legislative action under the word statute of any State as it appears in the appeal statute. 
    And we think clearly not because of the traditional distinction between legislative and judicial functions of the Government which would be obliterated if judicial action was said to be the same for the purposes of the appeal statute as legislative action. 
    As far as appellant's argument is concerned that if the orders have the effect of law, that is true of all judicial acts. 
    Orders and judgments of courts have the effect and force of law as in the case of enactments of a legislature that no one would contend that thereby, they are state statutes under subsection 2 of 1257. 
    If Congress had intended the words statute of any state to apply to judicial action, it certainly as Mr. -- as it has been said by Mr. Justice Brandeis in a dissenting opinion, it could've made its intent and meaning clearer in the wording of the statute.

    And the statute directed the Supreme Court to implement it by proper rules, but the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in the first, what I call four integration cases, said that that statute was not binding upon it that integration of the bar was a judicial function and not a legislative function. 
    And that this statute merely declared the -- was a declaration by the legislature that it would serve the public interest to have an integrated bar. 
    And the Court thereupon in this first integration case which we have cited several times in our brief declined to integrate the Bar. 
    Its reason at that time was that there were so many lawyers in the military service that it thought that this matter ought to be deferred.

   Rebuttal of Leon E. Isaksen
speaker="leon_e_isaksen" startTime="567.379" stopTime="879.240">
    Mr. Leon E. Isaksen 
    This Court? 
    Yes, sir. 
    In that connection Your Honor, in 1946, and all this impetus, all this effort to create the State Bar, it's interesting to note, came from the leaders of the voluntary bar association for the obvious reason that they were having trouble and they were ineffectual and unable to do and accomplish the aims and goals they had set forth before them. 
    In 1946, they came to the Court again and asked that the Bar be integration -- be integrated. 
    They came at that time with some form of petition signed by a lot of lawyers. 
    The Court indicated it wasn't interested in what the lawyers felt about integration and it decided not to integrate the Bar. 
    Then, in 1956, these Bar leaders again petitioned the Court to integrate it. 
    This time, the Court said, "Well, it's been tried in a number of States. 
    We'll try it in Wisconsin for a test period of two years." 
    At the end of that two-year period, the Wisconsin Court reviewed the situation in a very fine opinion in 5 Wisconsin. 
    2d 618, the Wisconsin Court pointed out that all of the objections that had been raised by integration had not materialized. 
    None of them had materialized. 
    It pointed out that under the two-year experiment with integration it had been demonstrated that the integrated bar had increased its services to the profession and had increased its contributions to the administration of justice. 
    It went on to point out the close relationship in the judicial process between the lawyer and the Courts, but the Courts depend upon the lawyers and their scholarship and their aid in assistance in the functioning of the judicial process in that, it is not undemocratic to require those who are privileged to practice law and are entrusted with the duty to secure or protect the property, rights, and liberties of others to become bound together in a united effort to increase their own capabilities to maintain the high-standards of the group and to increase the effectiveness of their service to the public. 
    The integrated bar said it has been defined as a process by which every member of the Bar is given an opportunity to do his share in carrying out the public service of the Bar and oblige to bear his portion of the responsibility. 
    And it added, most objections have centered round the obligation to bear a portion of the responsibility, but in the nature of things, every privilege has a correlative obligation. 
    Now, the counsel for the appellant here has stated that in the opinion of the court below that the Court justified or grounded the need for integration on the basis of the public be entitled to the views of the lawyers and legislative matters. 
    Now, I think that that gives undue emphasis to the State and the Court, but the Court merely said in that case was that appellant's argument as to unconstitutionality is grounded upon the proposition that the State Bar expresses opinions on legislative matters. 
    And then it went on to say that this was a -- this serve the public purpose, that this was in the public interest and that the public was entitled to know it how these experts what their opinions were on legislative matters within a narrow restricted field.

   Rebuttal of Gordon Sinykin
speaker="gordon_sinykin" startTime="893.795" stopTime="1034.772">
    Mr. Gordon Sinykin 
    Sir, I think that this case presents with respect to the integrated bar really only the issue decided in Hanson with respect to labor organizations namely the question whether lawyers can be compelled to belong and pay dues to the State Bar in the exercise of the State's power to regulate the Bar. 
    Appellant has made it clear here and it certainly clear from his complaint and from the record that his objection as to the general proposition of having to belong to the Bar. 
    His second objection is to the Bar rendering any legislative services, giving any legislative opinions regardless of whether he agrees or disagrees. 
    In fact, in his complaint, he doesn't allege any disagreement except in one instance. 
    He says that the State Bar opposed some legislation which he favored but he doesn't say what it is, but going through the few bills up to the time of the complaint, and going through the few bills in which the State Bar took the position in the period of a two and a half years of its existence there were about 13 or 14 bills on which the State Bar took a position. 
    The only bill which he had opposed that I can see during that time is the bill to repeal the Integrated Bar Act and the position that we took on that was merely to write a letter to the Assembly Judiciary Committee which I wrote merely stating that under the decisions of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the responsibility for continuing or discontinuing integration was with it as a matter of law and not with the legislature and that its repeal would be ineffective for the purpose of disintegrating the State Bar.

    Mr. Gordon Sinykin 
    I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    So, we have these general contentions. 
    He hasn't shown how he has been hurt or injured. 
    His contention is, even if I agree with every view expressed by the State Bar, as a constitutional matter, you can express views. 
    Now first, as to his contention, that his freedom of association is violated by being required to be a member of the integrated bar. 
    As to that, his objection is the same as in Hanson bear membership is a ground for his objection. 
    As he stated here, he admits the power of the State to require a license fee of lawyers for regulatory purposes. 
    So, his objection is not to the annual dues. 
    His objection runs to being compelled to belong to an organization of lawyers. 
    But he was required to belong to the bar before integration when he of his own free will decided to become a lawyer and qualify himself to become a lawyer, he had to be admitted to the Bar, he had to become a member of that Bar and in order to practice law, he had to remain a member in good standing. 
    And as such a member, he accepted all the conditions and burdens and restraints which go at the pre -- prerogatives.

    Mr. Gordon Sinykin 
    He didn't object to that. 
    But, with respect to association, he isn't compelled now to associate with anybody anymore than before integration. 
    He doesn't have to attend a single one of the meetings of the Bar. 
    If he wants to forego the benefits of those meetings, he is a free citizen to forego then. 
    He doesn't have to associate with anybody. 
    He doesn't have to vote in any elections we have under the State Bar rules, a democratic self governing form of organization with the right which includes every single lawyer in the State and there is no distinction as to class or creed, religion or race. 
    It represents everybody and everybody is given an opportunity to vote. 
    Everybody is given an opportunity to make his voice heard in the self-government of this organization, but he was compelled before integration to submit the certain restraints. 
    As a lawyer, he does not have the full freedom of any other citizen. 
    He is subject to the control and the discipline and the supervision of the Court because he is a part of that primary function of Government, the administration of justice. 
    He, the lawyer is the moving and advising officer of the Court and as such, he is always subject to the discipline and the regulation of the Court. 
    What integration did was simply to take this body of court officers, called the Bar, and give it a constitution in the form of rules and bylaws under which the profession could operate with the form of self-government. 
    All was subject to the continuing supervision of the Court and the Court has said in these integration cases, they said in this case the court below and in 5 Wisconsin, “We stand here ready to take any remedial action if the integrated bar should abuse its powers or step beyond the lines we had delineated or otherwise, do anything which is not in keeping with the public purposes which the integrated bar is suppose to serve.” 
    But the Supreme --

    (Inaudible) with respect of controlling what they say and do and that then the limits of that charter that he spoke of as I understood the counsel to the Supreme Court made in the charter stating what the -- the jurisdiction was.

    Well, the question I was getting at was this. 
    It seems to be that in both of these cases, other groups like this, the question ultimately gets down to whether the Government has the power to divide citizens into groups or segments according to, we'll say vocations or professions or what not, somehow and provide that all of them have pay funds to run their association and that it can propagandize for the views if the majority approved.

    That's rather a political thing that amounts to and quite and also the question of how much judges should be paid is more or less a political thing and I would think just as much as a minimum wage law, but in that case, they contended that the fact should then go beyond the -- the right to impose on the proponents.

    Mr. Gordon Sinykin 
    Yes, sir. 
    We will do that. 
    On this question of discipline, a statement was made here by counsel that our disciplinary procedure is the same under the integrated bar as it was under the voluntary bar and I just beg to differ with them that we have an entirely different procedure under the full voluntary bar. 
    We really didn't have any grievance procedure. 
    We had a little grievance committee and that it would pass the complaints on to the local bar associations and more serious ones would go up to the State Board of Bar commissioners. 
    Now, we have a very extensive set up whereby the State is divided into nine districts and there are grievance committees of at least five lawyers in each district where a regular procedure that they follow for handling these things and for investigating them and for holding hearings and for passing on their recommendations. 
    They also have the right to investigate misconduct -- judicial misconduct I noticed in the rules. 
    They also have the function and duty of investigating the reinstatement of disbarred or suspended lawyers who are petitioning for reinstatement and make recommendations to the Board of Bar Governors and to the Supreme Court with respect to those things. 
    And I think that the report will show that within the last year and quarter or so, last two years I think it is, they handled around 232 grievance complaints as against 17 that were handled in the year before integration and eight that were handled in the second year before integration. 
    I just want to point out that this had been due to the fact that when you got price and much money, you can do a lot of things you can employ personnel. 
    They have a paid investigator who is full time working on investigation of grievances, the unauthorized practice of the law and assisting the professional ethics committee in interpreting its rules.

   Argument of John W. Reynolds
speaker="john_w_reynolds" startTime="2905.386" stopTime="3036.528">
    Mr. John W. Reynolds 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    In the next few moments, I would like to address myself to the issue of the -- whether or not the regulations of the Court to the integrated bar and in the State of Wisconsin violates the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We believe that the regulation is reasonable. 
    The points I would like to discuss at the authority of the Court and briefly, I don't know if we have that in throughout the history of the -- this integrated bar in Wisconsin and the record. 
    The integration of the State Bar of the State of Wisconsin we believe is a reasonable method of regulating the practice of the law. 
    I think that it is quite clear from the pronouncements of this Court and on the history of jurisprudence that the Courts have an obligation to control the practice of law. 
    In England, they did it through the courts, didn't do it but the ends of Court did it, and this Court in several cases has been pointed out such as in the Thread case by Justice Frankfurter, the Court's control over a lawyer's professional life derives from his relation to the responsibilities of the Court. 
    In our briefs, we have cited several other authorities for this. 
    This has been recognized in the State of Wisconsin in our four integration cases where the Supreme Court of our State has indicated that they have a -- they have a responsibility to the practice of law. 
    The -- in addition to that, our state legislature passed the law Section 256.30 which stated as a misdemeanor can practice law without a license and furthermore that you could be held in contempt of Court can practice law without a license which infer -- which indicates the legislature recognized the inherent power of the Court to control the practice of law.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3036.528" stopTime="3038.337">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That law is enforced at present time.
speaker="john_w_reynolds" startTime="3038.337" stopTime="3286.162">
    Mr. John W. Reynolds 
    That law is enforced at present time. 
    I think that of course it's not only based on historical precedent but it's based upon practical necessity. 
    It starts out with the practice of law when you are admitted to the Bar, and you are given a monopoly over a certain field of activity and this monopoly, like all monopolies, I believe, have to regulated or at least to this public has to be protected from the abuse of the people who control the monopoly. 
    The Court in Wisconsin felt that it was very important that the Bar association, or the lawyers of the State be conscious of their responsibility to the Court in the administration of justice and to society. 
    In other words, that we rise above mediocrity and the history of the integrated bar in Wisconsin I think indicates that this is a reasonable approach and it has not been something that's rash. 
    Now I'd like to just quickly go through the history. 
    In 1935, the State Legislature of the State of Wisconsin passed a law authorizing the Court to establish the integrated bar. 
    This law was vetoed by the acting governor at the time. 
    In 1943, the state legislature, that is the people of Wisconsin through their legislature, passed another law and directing the Court to integrate the Bar. 
    And to the end, and I quote from the statute “that such association shall promote the public interest by maintaining high standards of conduct in the legal profession and by aiding in the efficient administration of justice”. 
    In other words, the people of the State of Wisconsin were literally crying out to their Court, "Why don't you supervise these lawyers?" 
    And the leading members of the Bar also cried out to the Court for that and their cries fell fortunately on deaf ears. 
    In 1946, the Court again refused to integrate the Bar and on the theory to quote them, that the price and I quote is the 46 decision, the phrase of integration that is supervision or policing by the Court by the activities of lawyers and it would be much greater than the Court or any lawyer ought to be willing to pay. 
    That was the logic of the 46 decision. 
    In my judgment, I think the Court misconceived its role because actually, the fact that you have a Laissez-Faire system doesn't mean that you necessarily have -- have freedom. 
    I think the Court has an obligation and they seem to recognize that to prevent things from happening. 
    In 1956, the Court ordered the integration of the Bar on the theory that they are -- that the lawyers are entitled to the supervision and control of the Court. 
    This Court here sitting here today admitted a group of lawyers to the Bar of the United States Supreme Court, you did this on the assumption that the States are assuming their responsibilities to supervise these lawyers. 
    They see to it the lawyers are following the -- the ethics of the profession by carrying out their duties. 
    I think that the record in this case in the case that there have been no violations of any of the freedoms of the appellant is, and there has been no violation of his freedom of speech or his freedom of association. 
    The appellant as my colleague, Mr. Sinykin pointed out the appellant when he became a lawyer, he joined the Bar of the Court. 
    And the integrated bar is merely a mechanism for the Court to supervise its own Bar. 
    And it's up to the State to determine which method of supervision, granting they have the authority to supervise it and it's reasonable as to which method they -- they should use.

    Mr. John W. Reynolds 
    The -- the State I believe that -- yes.

    That's -- that's a different thing.

    Mr. John W. Reynolds 
    It is my opinion that this could only be done provided that there is a State agency that represents the whole State or society at large such as the Court or some other agency appointed by the governor to supervise the -- say the integrated medical profession.

    Mr. John W. Reynolds 
    Well, I think that the problem that Justice Black is referring to is the unlawful delegation of authority, in other words, if you don't have a State agency, if you -- I don't believe you can delegate governmental authorities to a completely private agency.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I understood your associate to say that within the limits of this charter so-called that the -- that the Supreme Court gave to the legal profession that they had autonomy and that they have absolute independence to act as they see fit and that is to those manners the Court -- the Court did not supervise that.

    And that those are the things that are complained of. 
    Those -- those so-called political activities are the things that are being complained of. 
    Now, my question is, could they do the same thing with every other profession that the State regulates them and I think most States do regulate or --
speaker="john_w_reynolds" startTime="3433.530" stopTime="3443.313">
    Mr. John W. Reynolds 
    I don't think it presents a constitutional problem. 
    The question is wise policy but I think their association is different that you're dealing with officers of the Court to start out with.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3443.313" stopTime="3461.051">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They're not officers of the -- they're officers of the Court when it comes to employing a -- a lobbyist that the legislature to -- to represent views of the majority against the minority? 
    That that isn't practiced at all, is it for regulating their activities?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, yes. 
    I don't doubt that at all. 
    But what I'm trying to find out General, is it -- if there's any distinction, legal -- constitutional distinction between such activities of the State Bar and such activities of any other profession or business or employment?
speaker="john_w_reynolds" startTime="3486.618" stopTime="3505.547">
    Mr. John W. Reynolds 
    I would -- I don't think so. 
    In other words, I think if you took the medical society and have an interfering medical society and they want to express their views on health problem, there's no reason why they couldn't express their views. 
    At the same time, we're going to keep in mind they were not the same as the minority in that association could not express its views too.

    This is the Government which as through your judges has set up a system under which a man to get the right to practice law has to belong to the Bar association. 
    And he's complaining not that he has to be a lawyer, it maybe that they are raising here the question they can't do that at all, but they're certainly raising the distinct question that you cannot require them to belong to association and pay their dues and then use them to propagate ideas that they're against.

    Well, that's quite a different thing. 
    I -- I presume that nobody has ever raised any question, whether the associate people who belong to a voluntary association somehow I think we have a case on that several years ago. 
    Some others (Inaudible) and some are not, that a voluntary association could spend its own money is it saw fit and they couldn't bar that -- that's a different thing.
