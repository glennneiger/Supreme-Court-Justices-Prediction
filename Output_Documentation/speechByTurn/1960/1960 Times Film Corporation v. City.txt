Times Film Corporation v. City of Chicago

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Times Film Corporation, Petitioner, versus City of Chicago et al. 
    Mr. Bilgrey, you may continue your argument.

    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would like to take up the question that was presented -- posed yesterday as to whether the presumption can be indulged in that the petitioner's motion picture, "Don Juan," is obscene or whether it runs afoul any or all of the other standards of this particular ordinance because we have refused to submit the motion picture to the police commissioner in Chicago for censorship.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="49.485" stopTime="55.832">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think we have to presume either way on the legal question you've presented? 
    I don't know why.
speaker="felix_j_bilgrey" startTime="55.832" stopTime="84.000">
    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    I don't -- I don't think we have. 
    I think, Mr. Justice Black, that if this Court were to indulge in the presumption that this motion picture runs afoul the standards of the statute, the ordinance, that it requires the indulgence of a further presumption, namely that the motion picture as a form of speech is an evil per se. 
    And I believe that that is a presumption --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="84.000" stopTime="84.389">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But that wouldn't be a --
speaker="felix_j_bilgrey" startTime="84.389" stopTime="85.674">
    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    -- that has never been made.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="85.674" stopTime="88.334">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- that wouldn't be a presumption, would it?
speaker="felix_j_bilgrey" startTime="88.334" stopTime="127.942">
    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    It will be a conclusion, Mr. Justice Black that has never been made with regard to any form of speech. 
    And I think that that would be twisting the First Amendment. 
    I think that the very least that the First Amendment stands for is that the speech is innocent and this is the Blackstonean concept that at the very least that the speech may be initially made without any presumption either way and that the State then has a burden and that is a heavy burden to come forth and to prove that the speech does not have the First and Fourteenth Amendment protection.

    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    That is not the -- what I concede this question to be, Mr. Justice Whittaker. 
    I don't think that the question before this Court is that if we were to concede that this motion picture is obscene, whether we would have the right to initially show it. 
    I think that that is a completely different question which -- I don't know if it has ever been decided or come up in that the precise posture. 
    I think the --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="162.366" stopTime="167.552">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

    I'm not. 
    I think that there maybe obscene motion pictures and obscene forms of speech.

    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    I don't think you would know it, Mr. Justice Whittaker, but it is our contention that the question is not here whether we would have the right to initially show the motion picture if we were to concede that introduction. 
    I think the question is as presented in our petition and that is that these respondents that the municipality does not have the right initially to require the submission of the speech and I don't think that they can have that right with regard to any form of communication.

    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    I think that the very least that the First Amendment stands for is that everyone has the right to initially communicate with the public that there can be no censors wall. 
    And if -- if I may amplify that answer, I think that the Kingsley Books case points out two important distinctions between that -- the -- the statute in that case and the ordinance in this case. 
    In Kingsley Books, this Court upheld a limited injunctive scheme, whereby the State can enjoin a -- a speech or book and afterwards, determine that it does not enjoin the First Amendment protection. 
    I think that the first distinction to be made is that New York did not require that every speech has to be submitted to a censor first.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="270.886" stopTime="300.192">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You keep on saying speech because you think that speech or because a movie or films are a mode of communication that is something that one sees or hears, therefore, as a general concept called speech which covers everything, political utterance, an editorial in newspaper, a book, discs, music, movies, is that right?

    So that you --
speaker="felix_j_bilgrey" startTime="303.136" stopTime="303.282">
    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    That is correct, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="303.282" stopTime="312.356">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- you don't make any differentiation and you just say the question before this Court is abstractly considered where the speech may ever be enjoined, is that right?
speaker="felix_j_bilgrey" startTime="312.356" stopTime="337.369">
    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    No, I don't conceive that to be the question, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    I conceive the question as formulated in our petition, that the State has no right to require the prior submission to a censor for the examination of contents of this particular speech. 
    And I think that no court, after Burstyn, except perhaps for the Circuit Court of Appeals below, has intimated that motion pictures are not a form of speech.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="337.369" stopTime="375.591">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, then, I do not understand why you did not agree with the question of the Court or the inquiries made to you by Justice Whittaker, namely, you contend that no matter what this film, if seen, would show, no matter what its contents, no matter what it depicts, doesn't matter, vicious, good, bad, neutral, it doesn't make any difference. 
    The State is powerless in view of the Fourteenth Amendment to ask that it be seen before it can exhibit. 
    Isn't that the correct statement of your position?
speaker="felix_j_bilgrey" startTime="375.591" stopTime="383.317">
    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    Well, again, Your Honor, I don't -- if it -- if that involves a concession that the motion -- that this motion picture is obscene, I would not be willing to concede that.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="392.046" stopTime="399.250">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    You're not called upon to show that it isn't good.
speaker="felix_j_bilgrey" startTime="399.250" stopTime="425.747">
    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    I don't think, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that the presumption can be made or conclusion can be made either way and I think that the -- the presumption that has to made before we could concede. 
    And that's why I don't think it's -- that that is the question that whether we had have the initial right to show this motion picture, if it were any -- runs -- to run afoul of any of the statutory standards. 
    I don't believe that question is before the Court. 
    I think --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="425.747" stopTime="425.939">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not suggesting --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not suggesting any presumption regarding this particular undisclosed film. 
    What I am suggesting is a legal proposition if I follow your argument at all. 
    That for purposes of the question before the Court, it is a matter of indifference, what the character or quality or methods or whatever you may say about a film, it's a matter of indifference. 
    It maybe at once the most notable and noble depiction or it maybe the violent depiction from the point of view of the question before the Court, that is a matter of indifference.

    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    I think the substance of the issue is, as you stated, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that the speech, and I would like to word it this way, that the speech is -- that there's no presumption either way that the -- the person who makes the speech has a right to initially communicate with the public without coming across a censor's wall. 
    I don't think the State has any business to know beforehand --

    I think that the State has the burden, then to come forth. 
    And this Court in Kingsley Books, and that is as far as this Court has ever gone in upholding a state method of control, has appeared to that view and the way I read Your Honors' opinion in that --

    Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey 
    Well, there are alternative methods of control that this Court has upheld. 
    And I would like to -- to mention that some of these methods of control have been upheld in cases like Chaplinsky and Alberts and Kingsley Books and that these methods accomplish everything that the State can accomplish, that they are much less invasive. 
    They are much less costly to the First Amendment, to our liberties, pursuant to that First Amendment than the prior restraint. 
    What I'm saying is that I think that the citizens of the District of Columbia and all the other States and cities that do not require that all motion pictures be submitted to a board that these citizens are just as moral as Chicagoans would be if they could just see every motion picture first without and having been submitted. 
    I would like to leave some time in rebuttal, Your Honors, but I would -- I would like to close off in this point. 
    I think that the decisions in this -- of this Court in the area of the First Amendment, establish crystal -- in a crystal clear manner that whatever else the First Amendment may mean, it cannot mean and does not mean that there can be a censor's wall between any form of speech in the public. 
    I think the motion picture has all the attributes of speech. 
    And I think that that same law must apply to the motion picture as a form of speech as well. 
    If it does not, then tomorrow, these respondents or someone else will raise the same issue with regard to some other form of speech and before you know it, there wouldn't be anymore First Amendment.

    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The petitioner here and these respondents have stipulated to the facts in the court below and I assume there was no factual issue here at all. 
    Counsel has hesitated to say that this movie might be pornographic, although yesterday, he did say that it might be Pollyanna. 
    I presume from that, he means that it is innocuous, harmless. 
    He made a statement yesterday that I wrote down because it sounded so strange. 
    Counsel said yesterday to this Court that he was perfectly willing to show the picture to the respondents privately if they wish. 
    I -- I cannot reconcile that statement with our being here today. 
    The ordinance requires that this picture or any picture in our municipality be shown to the respondents who is the city, its mayor and police commissioner, privately, and so Mr. Bilgrey, if that is your intention, we can dispose of this lawsuit now if you will submit it too as private.

    Now, this ordinance is not confined, although the Court has mentioned pornography or obscenity to that question. 
    The ordinance before this Court as you well know prohibits movies that would lead to riots or breaches of the peace. 
    It may be difficult to determine what they are but until we see the movie, we cannot possibly answer that question. 
    It is one of the great problems with this case.

    When you read a book or a newspaper or a magazine in the privacy of your home or when you turn on the television set in your home or the radio, that is a different thing. 
    If we are dealing with an obscene pornographic movie, then going into a darkened theater with 500 or 1000 or 2000 people in close proximity and observing it, we feel that's --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1057.797" stopTime="1060.318">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Newspapers have comic strips these days, don't they?
speaker="robert_j_collins" startTime="1060.318" stopTime="1334.596">
    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    They certainly do, sir. 
    And the problem on -- on comic strips and comic books is something that has so occupied the nation that as you know, the Congress has appointed a commission some -- up to many years ago to look into it. 
    We recognize the -- the constitutional problem but that does not take our eyes away from the problem itself. 
    You see the -- the municipalities under several States have a social problem or an economic problem or a problem of some kind and you immediate -- they enact legislation. 
    You are not concerned with that problem, we are. 
    You are concerned only with whether or not that legislation fits within the framework of the Constitution. 
    When you strike it down, the problem, it does not disappear, we still have it. 
    We tried to change the legislation. 
    We tried another admin of approach. 
    Yesterday, Mr. Bilgrey said to this Court, "If you strike down legislation, it has no effect." 
    Now, that is a statement he made here yesterday. 
    Now, of course, he is concerned. 
    He is an interested party. 
    His word may be like mine, prejudice, but two members of this Court, at least, in the most recent motion picture case, the Kingsley Pictures case made a statement that -- to the effect that each time a statute is struck down, the State is left in more confusion. 
    The Court recognizes what happens when legislation is stricken down but Mr. Bilgrey said yesterday, "They are not -- have you have no problems at all." 
    I -- I cannot agree with that. 
    And to answer you, Mr. Justice Douglas, I feel that there is a vast difference between movies and the Chicago Tribune. 
    I wanted to say the -- the Gitlow case. 
    The Gitlow case is a landmark decision of this Court. 
    The Gitlow case stands with the proposition that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State from abridging the freedom of speech of the press. 
    Up until that time, this Court have never so held. 
    But what else was said in the Gitlow case? 
    And incidentally in that case, as the Court knows, the legislation there with which the Court was concerned was upheld. 
    Its validity was sustained. 
    And incidentally, it concerned anarchist, people intending to overthrow the Government, which takes us back to the comment that the Court of Appeals made in this case. 
    But in the Gitlow case, the -- this Court said, in substance that it cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonable when in the exercise of its judgment as to measures necessary to the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the spark, extinguish it before it has enkindled the flame or blazed into conflagration. 
    What do they mean? 
    They mean what we're trying to do here, we have a problem. 
    Now, if this was a Pollyanna type movie, as Mr. Bilgrey has intimated, then first of all, he is committed to fraud upon this Court in going through this procedure. 
    I'm assuming this is a type of a movie that we would reject and that's the reason he would not bring it into us. 
    The movie industry is not here today for the purpose of protecting the freedom of speech of the individuals of this country, that maybe the result if you agree with them. 
    They are here today for the right to exhibit a movie called "Don Juan". 
    That's what they want. 
    And more importantly, they want the right. 
    If you agree with them in the future to exhibit any -- anyway, pornographic or other one, there is great profit in movies which are obscene or pornographic. 
    There's no doubt about that. 
    And the movie industry, I -- I don't mean to condemn the industry. 
    God, the America needs that industry. 
    It's a great industry but there are people in the industry as there are in every business who maybe attempting to force upon the public obscene, pornographic movies. 
    We know that -- that there are pornographic pictures around that are surreptitiously handed from man then sold. 
    There's a great profit in it. 
    And that is what we're fearful of here.

    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    Under the ordinance, yes. 
    And the police commissioner is charged with the original responsibility, and from there to the court. 
    And the -- the -- although it is not an issue here, the State of Illinois has a statute that empowers municipalities to enact ordinances of this type which will permit them the license or regulate or tax or even prohibit motion picture or theatrical. 
    That statute is not here involved. 
    It is not challenged by the petitioner but it was pursuant to that statute. 
    That this ordinance was passed over 50 years ago in the City of Chicago and it is -- it administered without any difficulty, I should say with very little difficulty, for over 50 years. 
    The -- the decision of this Court in the Burstyn case, I'm sure affecting many communities as it did in Chicago. 
    We were not certain what we knew what the Court meant there, but we were not certain whether that doctrine would be extended. 
    We knew in the Burstyn case and in subsequent cases that the language employed and the New York statute was found to be offensive here and called it was vague and indefinite and that they employed standards that could not properly be invoked in enforcement.

    In those other cases, movies were tendered for the granting of a permit and the permit was refused because the authorities thought that they violated the ordinance and they then said that they didn't violate the ordinance, they should have granted on the merits. 
    He had challenged the power to require submission -- he had challenged the power to not to call for a permit but to submit the movie in order to justify the granting of it. 
    Is that right?

   Argument of Sydney R. Drebin
speaker="sydney_r_drebin" startTime="3102.210" stopTime="3235.766">
    Mr. Sydney R. Drebin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    I think there -- there's a serious question that must be decided by this Court before they get to the merits of this case namely, whether or not the ordinance is constitutional in regard to prior restraint. 
    Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that there was no justiciable controversy. 
    The District Court proceeded on the theory that the petitioner should submit the film to the commissioner of police because otherwise -- or if he did and if it was found not objectionable, the license would have issued and then there would have been no litigation. 
    The Circuit Court of Appeals took a slightly different slant. 
    Circuit Court of Appeals said, "We cannot decide this case in the vacuum. 
    We must see the movie to determine whether or not it is obscene." 
    Counsel for the petitioner attempts to answer these contentions and I say that the ordinance is unconstitutional especially that portion of the ordinance that requires him to submit the movie prior to the time of showing that. 
    And his basis seems to be limited to the contention that the ordinance is unconstitutional. 
    In my opinion, he is predetermining the very issue that is before this Court today.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3235.766" stopTime="3238.170">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean he's predetermined it or he's raised it?

    I cannot hear you.

speaker="sydney_r_drebin" startTime="3242.808" stopTime="3293.747">
    Mr. Sydney R. Drebin 
    He has raised the question. 
    In my opinion, at the present time, the municipal ordinance say censorship ordinance of the City of Chicago is constitutional. 
    And until this Court or some other court of competent jurisdiction determines that it is unconstitutional, then this petitioner must comply with the provisions thereof including the submission of this motion picture to the commissioner of police prior to actual showing it.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3293.747" stopTime="3303.509">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I don't quite understand that argument. 
    You mean in order to raise the question of whether the act is unconstitutional in requiring him to present it, he must present it?

    Mr. Sydney R. Drebin 
    Yes sir.

    Mr. Sydney R. Drebin 
    That's right. 
    And I think that the array -- the way that he should raise the issue is to submit through the commissioner of police a pornographic picture. 
    Then the issue would be definitely raised. 
    Then, of course, the commissioner would -- the police commissioner would deny the permit.

    Mr. Sydney R. Drebin 
    That is not the way I understand the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals.

    That before we are going to decide whether or not --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3477.308" stopTime="3487.084">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Why is it abstract if as he says that the State has no right irrespective of the character of the picture to require a license?
speaker="sydney_r_drebin" startTime="3487.084" stopTime="3487.147">
    Mr. Sydney R. Drebin

speaker="sydney_r_drebin" startTime="3490.470" stopTime="3546.550">
    Mr. Sydney R. Drebin 
    Because if the picture is not obscene and if he submits that picture to the local police commissioner, he will get a license. 
    Now, I -- the Circuit Court of Appeals held that they wanted to see the picture because if the picture was not obscene, they would order the permit to issue. 
    If they ordered the permit to issue, then the question would not be before this Court today. 
    So therefore, in my opinion, it is necessary for the plaintiff to hurdle this first obstacle and that is that he did not present a justiciable controversy in the trial court or in the Circuit Court of Appeals.

    Mr. Abner J. Mikva 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    Let me first address myself to this procedural question that has arisen which I think is best exemplified by Justice Stewart's question as to what would have been the easiest way to raise this question. 
    It would not have been possible in our opinion to go ahead and show the movie and then defend against the prosecution under this ordinance on the ground that we will deny the movie -- we were denied the permit because of obscenity because that kind of a defense ignores two other sections of this ordinance which we think or at least we're not prepared to challenge. 
    One is a revenue section. 
    The city gets quite a bit of revenue out of this ordinance, 1553 provides for permit fees and transfer permit fees. 
    And the second is a registration section of this ordinance which we are not challenged which requires each subsequent transferee to advise the city as to what theater the picture is playing it. 
    Now, as far as I can see, either of those or both of those are perfectly, constitutionally valid so that if we came in and tried to defend against a prosecution for refusing to have a permit, a court, whether it was state or federal, would be perfectly justified in saying to us, "Look here, you may be right but you have no right to ignore these other constitutional sections of the ordinance and therefore, you cannot ignore the licensing procedure."

    Our first count asked this city to -- that a mandatory injunction be issued directing the city to issue a permit. 
    Now, that was the second reason for this procedure. 
    This is the judicial gloss that was placed up in this ordinance by Illinois' Highest Court, the Illinois Supreme Court in the American Civil Liberties Union where these issues were squarely raised where the constitutional question was decided adversely to our position. 
    We freely admit that. 
    And there, the Illinois Supreme Court said that were the petitioner has a complaint to make about some section of the ordinance, he can come in by way of injunction proceedings seeking to enjoin the Mayor or mandamus, they said either one, seeking to enjoin the Mayor and the police commissioner to issue them the permit that they request.

    It's the American Civil Liberties Union versus City of Chicago, 3 Illinois 2nd 334 page 352, it's quoted on page 11 of our brief."

    Whether a complaint alleging only that a motion picture is not obscene would state a ground for equitable relief, we need not decide."

    No, but they -- they denied our federal ground and this Court denied to review that case, therefore, one of our final judgment because there were both grounds involved there. 
    Maybe I can explain at this way, Your Honor. 
    The state court acted exactly contrary to the way the federal court would act in the similar situation. 
    The federal court would say if there is a non-constitutional question to be reached and decided and that disposes of the case, we will not decide the constitutional question, if I understand my legal precedence correct. 
    And therefore, once the non-constitutional question is decided, that's the end of the case. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court did not act that way, they decided both questions. 
    They decided the non -- both the constitutional question and then send it back for a finding on the non-constitutional question.

    Mr. Abner J. Mikva 
    I suppose at that point, you might be able to raise the same defense. 
    I think the question is, is there something magical over that method of procedure over the one we did which is almost like years except that at the point where they said, "You can't have the permit because you won't show us the picture," instead of going ahead and showing the film, we then took the further review that the ordinance authorizes under the interpretation of the Illinois Supreme Court and they further review, there has been authorized by this Court in other cases. 
    We cited the Cargill case in our brief wherein a non-First Amendment kind of a case where the person was entitled to come up and appeal after it offered to comply with the constitutional portions, refused to comply with the unconstitutional portions, it was then permitted to -- to prosecute its appeal to have the unconstitutional portion declared invalid.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4616.935" stopTime="4659.834">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The question isn't what the Supreme Court of Illinois would be, the question is whether this Court with the case that you came here on a prosecution in which you tendered the $3 over $30 and they said, "We want to see the film" and you said, "I have nothing to do with it." 
    You then showed it in a prosecutor, the first thing that this one I'm considering, the presence is whether it would be -- whether this Court was conceivably vague, that if you satisfied your portions of the ordinance that had nothing to do with the free speech trade that you couldn't come up here to raise the free speech trade. 
    It's just not conceivable.
speaker="abner_j_mikva" startTime="4659.834" stopTime="4692.995">
    Mr. Abner J. Mikva 
    Can I answer this way, Your Honor, that I'm not sure that it would be any clearer case than this. 
    And again, I wanted to cite this -- this Cargill case. 
    Well, that it exactly what the petitioners did. 
    And this Court said if the commission refused to grant a license because the applicant in the one case refused to comply with statutory provisions or with rules or regulations inconsistent with the Constitution of United States, the rights of the applicant or the license could be protected and enforced by appropriate judicial proceedings. 
    It didn't say only in criminal proceedings for proceeding without a license, it said appropriate judicial proceeding.

    Mr. Abner J. Mikva 
    Well, the Illinois Supreme Court had already ruled again on this very question. 
    Now, I'd like to address myself to what I think is the other central issue here that's been raised. 
    Discontinue referring to the idea that this picture must be presumed obscene. 
    And there's a syllogism there that's very important because without the major premise that the city and the court below adapts that this picture must be presumed obscene simply because we didn't submit it. 
    There is no basis for upholding the interference. 
    This Court has said there are some cases where interference with speech is permitted and it has detailed the kinds of speech and kinds of situation in which such interference is tolerating such as using Kingsley books as the best example. 
    Obscene speech is not protected by the First Amendment. 
    Well, therefore, for them to bring themselves within the exception of the Kingsley case, they must say that this film has been presumed to be obscene. 
    There's no finding of obscenity. 
    Nobody ever said it was obscene except all that was before the city was the title of the movie. 
    So then unless they say the whole art is presumed to be obscene, unless and until it's brought to -- to review and it's proven innocent --

    Mr. Abner J. Mikva 
    It would not be this case. 
    I know that'd be decided the same as this case or not. 
    But I'd like to say the reasons, if I may, Your Honor, why we think that this refusal to submit is important. 
    All that the city has come up with and all that the court below has come up with is that somehow movies are different than newspaper. 
    No, the Chicago Tribune can't be submitted -- required to submit to this requirement but motion pictures can. 
    Why? 
    And all we get -- come up with -- and I kept writing down the different answers that the city gave to these questions both here and of the Court of Appeals, the only one I finally distilled out is that it's shown in the dark. 
    Well, it seems to me that they're using a pretty big shotgun because of their fear of the dark. 
    The fact of the matter is that a motion picture is a communication at least it has to be presumed to be one.

    Mr. Abner J. Mikva 
    Your Honor, in Kingsley books, which is the furthest this Court has ever gone, the Court relied on a specific finding indeed I think an admission of pornography to justify the extraordinary interference with freedom of speech. 
    We say there must be something comparable to that. 
    I'd like to hope, Your Honor, that it will be at very -- the very least that requirement. 
    But we're saying that at least there must be something comparable to that requirement met in a case before the interference can be justified. 
    Just at what point the Court is going to draw that line is a hard question for me to answer, Your Honor. 
    As I say, I hope it would not go beyond the point it was drawn in the Kingsley Books case. 
    But certainly, even in that case which drew the line further than it had ever been drawn before, there was a firm and positive finding by a court that the matter was obscene.

    The second thing I'd like to make is the difference between and perhaps this answers your question, Justice Whittaker. 
    The difference between this kind of proceeding, which I might add has hearing procedure, has none of the due process safeguards that a criminal proceeding would have. 
    There's no presumption of innocence. 
    As I've indicated the presumption rather it's one of guilt. 
    Prove your pictures clean or else you can't get a permit. 
    So the contrary, its the criminal procedure where it's up to the prosecutor to prove to a trial court and perhaps even a grand jury in the first place and a judge, that this is obscene literature. 
    It was said best I might add.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="5585.926" stopTime="5588.262">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Are you done by due process now?
speaker="abner_j_mikva" startTime="5588.262" stopTime="5689.781">
    Mr. Abner J. Mikva 
    Due process in the sense of the kinds of protections that are afforded to speech rather than due process in the kinds of protection that are afforded the individual. 
    I think it was best said by this very Court of Appeals, Your Honor, sitting with a different panel in a case called Capital Enterprises versus the City of Chicago, in which the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit said there is a wide difference between censoring motion pictures before deciding that they can be publicly exhibited and exhibiting a picture to the public for which criminal punishment might be imposed. 
    In the latter situation, all the familiar procedural safeguards come in to play while in the other instance, there are no procedural safeguards and communication is choked off at the threshold. 
    Now, I'm quoting from page 37 of our brief. 
    As I say this was a case where they reversed the censor board. 
    Significantly, I might add, the other function, the demonstrations of the functions of the censors is indicated from our appendix where every single decision of there banning a picture since Burstyn has been reversed if the -- the Senate were to be alarmed. 
    Now, the other point I'd like to make is the timeliness of the speech. 
    Would the Declaration of Independence or the Gettysburg Address have been as effective if it has been made five years later? 
    With the great debates that are going on right now, these are effective if they were made after November 8th, as they are right now. 
    This case has been going on two and a half year, Your Honor. 
    The subject matter of American Civil Liberties Union versus City of Chicago was the miracle, the same picture involved in the Burstyn case. 
    It took five years to clear that picture under this ordinance. 
    And significantly, it never did show in the City of Chicago. 
    This is the kind of concern that this priority restraint brings about.
