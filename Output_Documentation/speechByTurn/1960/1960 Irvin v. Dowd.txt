    Mr. Theodore Lockyear, Jr. 
    The Court of Appeals conceded that it was a serious misconduct on the part of the attorney. 
    It's found on page 50 -- 51 of the transcript, a form where the ethics of Mr. Weaver's conduct is directly brought and issued by the State of Indiana. 
    It is apparent that a charge of unethical conduct on the foregoing facts would be serious. 
    However in this case, we cannot adjudicate a question of that. 
    Certainly, the testimony he gave was relevant to the case on trial and he was a competent witness. 
    As a factual matter, the defense offered near evidence to contradict Weaver's statement then defense went to see Mr. Weaver. 
    Therefore, in view of all these circumstance, it is entirely a manner of surmise whether Weaver's conduct had a harmful effect upon the defendant in the minds of the jury.

    Mr. Theodore Lockyear, Jr. 
    There's more reason to conclude that the jurors would react against the statement in view of such conduct by his legal representative. 
    However, that maybe the most that can be said is that this conduct was error which did not have such a substantial effect upon the outcome as to strip the trial of due process. 
    And Judge Duffy, on page 53, in dissenting, said another reason for the failure of due process in the instant case is the one that -- is that one of the two state prosecuting attorneys who tried the case also acted as a witness on the trial. 
    The majority opinion while conceding this was error seem to brush it aside saying, "However in this case, we cannot adjudicate a question of ethics." 
    Prosecutor Weaver participating, examining prospect of jurors interposed objection to testimony otherwise, actively participating in the trial. 
    He then took the stand as a witness and testified concerning the confession made to him or objection he made opposing argument to the jury commenting on the evidence including his own testimony. 
    Such conduct was in violation of Canon 19 of Canon for Professional Ethics.

    Mr. Theodore Lockyear, Jr. 
    There is that question also presented and that we objected to his testimony as a -- as well as the witness Hudson on the ground that this man had been held from August -- from April the 8th, 1955 up until this purported confession was made on the 14th and then a purported confession made on the 15th and then it was a 16th before he was ever arraigned. 
    And we made the objection as to the admissibility of that confession under the Watts case. 
    And the Court, we say, denied us a hearing on that question. 
    They say otherwise but that was also an objection to the admissibility of that testimony by the witness whether it was the prosecutor or Chief Detective Hudson.

    If we believe in other witness, he was on burglary. 
    The question was asked, what was he arrested for?

    A man read in a paper where he had been arrested and says, "I've got to check from you. 
    And I -- I went down to the police station and showed them and talked to them about it."

   Argument of Richard M. Givan
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="1982.086" stopTime="2233.231">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court. 
    I would like to clear up a question or two here that has been raised by Mr. Lockyear's argument. 
    First of all, his contention here that the things are in somewhat a state of confusion in the record as to what Irvin was arrested for and how he was held in the early part of his incarceration. 
    And I would like to refer the Court to this trial transcript that you have before you in this case at Volume 2 of that transcript, if the Court recall it it's in six volumes and in Volume 2, at page 1180, you will find there a testimony by Evansville Detective Cornett or -- I beg your pardon, State Police Detective Cornett to the express effect and it is not contradicted that he approached Leslie Irvin on April the 11th -- April the 8th at 11 a.m. and that he questioned Irvin at that time concerning the passing of some bad checks. 
    And that at that time Irvin admitted to him that he had done such a thing and that upon his admission, he took Irvin into custody as a parole violator. 
    Irvin was at that time on parole from the Indiana State Prison. 
    And it was while Irvin was being held pursuant to this arrest as a parole violator that he was then examined and questioned concerning the murder for which he was later tried. 
    I just wanted to clear up that point. 
    I -- I think that the Court should know that it is the State's position that Irvin was under lawful arrest on an entirely separate matter at the time of his holding and that therefore, he does not come under the rule that has been set out by this Court previously. 
    I think we might -- I think it's been referred to as the McNabb rule of the admissibility of confessions in -- in the case of United States versus Carrington, the Court expressly stated that a person who was being lawfully held in the custody of another would not be subject to the McNabb rule and that confession that he gave under such incarceration would be admissible. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Black, I believe, asked the question as to whether the same question would be presented here if this was a trial by a -- the Court rather than by the jury. 
    And it is the State's position that we are in the same set of circumstances, Mr. Justice Black, that we take the position that this jury properly qualified under the Indiana statute and therefore, having properly qualified under the Indiana statute, we are faced with this -- precisely the same question as to whether or not the newspaper publicity rendered the situation such that the defendant could not have a fair trial. 
    Now, if the Court would find that the newspaper publicity was of such a nature that the defendant could not have a fair trial, under the circumstances, I think, it would be of a little moment whether or not it was the trial judge who was influenced by those newspaper reports or whether it was a juror who was influenced by the reports if it was demonstrated by the petitioner that such influence did in fact exist.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    No, it certainly would not and I would say that the statute of that nature would not afford due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment if such a statute existed.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    Not precisely, Your Honor. 
    I think this. 
    We can't look to the trial to see whether the jury was in fact biased or prejudice. 
    We have no action from -- by the jury, any comments for any members of the jury from which we could draw any conclusions after the clause of the voir dire examination until we come to the verdict itself. 
    And of course, I think we must immediately say that the -- the existence of a guilty verdict doesn't impute any --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I didn't make -- it was my fault.

    Now, I submit to the Court that that is no different than any criminal prosecution that we ever have on an infamous crime of this order, a crime that gains a great deal of notoriety and the Court can call on its own knowledge of the Lindbergh kidnapping, Bruno Richard Hauptmann and the -- the statements that were attributed to him. 
    Of course, any criminal is in the custody of the custodial officer and it is not the custom, of course, to allow them to hold press conferences of -- on their own and they -- the matters which they state to the custodial officers if they get in the newspaper at all come through the custodial officer in some manner.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    No. 
    I don't -- I don't think they did it all, Your Honor. 
    In fact to the matter is I have no question but what the state officers did in fact answer questions which were presented to them by the newspaper authorities. 
    They naturally congregated it to jail when the news was out that these -- that these crimes -- I might say this Your Honor, that the crimes had received extreme and extensive publicity prior to the arrest of Irvin. 
    This -- this was a great news story in this area before they knew who did it. 
    And there were severe criticism of the police officers because they hadn't apprehended anybody yet.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- think -- would you think it was suggesting an unattainable standard for American criminal justice that when a sensational -- when sensational crimes like this occur and naturally there's great publicity about the occurrence that when the authority eventually find the culprit and feeling in the community had run high regarding the crime that then it's almost the duty to take great care not to continue this feeling against the particular defendant. 
    Would you think that was too high a standard to set?
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="2811.395" stopTime="2828.964">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    I -- I think this, Your Honor, that we have had no -- no case yet in American jurisprudence or any other jurisdiction that I know of where the custodial authorities are absolutely bound to silence.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2828.964" stopTime="2838.513">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But between binding them to silence and actually having him take affirmative steps to feed stuff to the press as a rather long distance, isn't it?
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="2838.513" stopTime="2848.210">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    It's -- it is, sir, and I -- I submit to you that an examination of this entire record will show an absence of an actual feeding of stuff to the press as -- as you --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2848.210" stopTime="2873.918">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I mean -- alright, the word feeding carries a whole salient implications but wasn't it a fact -- isn't it a fact that both the police authorities and the prosecutors did give statements to the press regarding matters that they didn't and one can say, in many instances, that couldn't have introduced before the jury?
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="2873.918" stopTime="2874.961">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    No, I wouldn't say that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2874.961" stopTime="2875.699">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You wouldn't say that.
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="2875.699" stopTime="2963.746">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    I wouldn't say that. 
    Now, if we say that the matter of his insanity, for instance, whether -- that he was sane or insane. 
    Now, obviously, the newspapers got hold of the fact that there had been an examination of Irvin and that the doctor said that he was sane and that he must stand trial. 
    Now, of course, you don't put evidence of that into the trial but it goes without that saying that he is standing trial and he is sane or he wouldn't be standing trial. 
    It's -- it's very difficult to -- to thrash out these things in separate one from the other and say what the newspapers may publish or what the prosecutor or what the police chief or whoever it maybe may say concerning the incarceration concerning the crime itself. 
    And I think it's not a proper standard to say that everything that is released must be something that is admissible in evidence. 
    Now, I think everything that would tend to influence a jury as to his guilt or innocence such as how the crime was committed, the content of the confession, all of those things, of course, as a matter of fact, were introduced in evidence in the Irvin trial. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2963.746" stopTime="2977.402">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is it -- but what about the giving to the press matters as to other crime which could not be introduced in the prosecution of this crime?Were there such instances?
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="2977.402" stopTime="2991.392">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    There were. 
    The -- the confession that Irvin made including the other crimes and that was part of the newspaper publicity that he was to confess slayer as to these other crimes.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    Well, that's -- that's what the newspaper say. 
    I might say to uphold the newspaper statement to that effect, you will find in the record the testimony of Paul Weaver himself and incidentally, I think I can give you a citation in Volume 3, again, of this trial transcript that you have here. 
    In Volume 3, at page 1834 to 1846, I have that in my brief as a citation to a portion of Paul Weaver's testimony and I submit that his testimony is found in the -- starting immediately before that and ending immediately after those pages and these -- within those pages in Volume 3, 1834 and 1846, you will find the testimony of Paul Weaver and in that testimony, you will find that the -- according to Paul Weaver, and I'm quoting him expressly because the question was asked is what he did testify to, and I answered the two things at once. 
    That -- Paul Weaver said that Leslie Irvin specifically called for him to come to his cell in the jail and asked that he be permitted to talk to Paul Weaver. 
    He did talk to Paul Weaver, told him some of the manner in which this thing occurred and he asked him if he could be tried in Indiana or would he be turned back to Kentucky. 
    And Weaver said, "Well, we don't have enough yet to try you hearing." 
    Leslie Irvin says, "What more do you need?" 
    And he said, "We need the gun that you committed these crimes with." 
    And Leslie Irvin said, "That's easy. 
    I know where I put it." 
    And he took them out and after a couple of day search, they found the gun in the stream where Leslie Irvin indicated it would be. 
    Now, this testimony must hasten on and say that this was not Paul Weaver's testimony alone but also the testimony of the police officers involved in the investigation including -- I mean especially including Detective Hudson who had talked to Irvin, who had gone to obtain Paul Weaver to comment, Irvin's be -- request and who had been present when Irvin indicated where the gun would be found and then testified concerning the finding of the gun and the identification of the gun. 
    Now, all of these goes to demonstrate, I think, in addition of Paul Weaver's testimony was merely cumulative although he did testify to these things as a prosecutor. 
    His testimony was cumulative, he did not testify to a single thing that was not testified too by others in the trial and that nothing was proven by Paul Weaver's testimony that was not independently proven.

    And the -- the interpretation of freedom of the press that has been given by this Court gives the newspapers pretty much carte blanche as far as their activities are concerned and so we -- we accept that law but I'm not being critical with this Court in any fashion, I'm just -- I'm stating a fact and we must accept that fact and work with it.

    I would like to answer one question here of Mr. Justice Whittaker -- Mr. Justice Whittaker had asked during Mr. Lockyear's statement here that if any juror failed to qualify under the Indiana statute and my answer to that, sir, is no. 
    No juror failed to qualify under the Indiana statute.We have set out what we feel to be pertinent excerpts from the transcript in our brief wherein the questions asked of the various jurors who in fact served on this jury, we feel clearly show that these jurors did qualify expressly under the statute. 
    Now, I think that we have here, gentlemen, a question --

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    This is an old statute, Your Honor. 
    Actually, we had some -- a statute prior to our 1905 code. 
    In 1905, Indiana recodified is the criminal law in that State. 
    Prior to that time, we had a statute very similar to this and some of the cases which we have cited to the Court, Indiana cases, are discussing the old statute. 
    But this statute, as it now exists, in its present language was a part of the criminal code in the recodification in 1905.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3566.379" stopTime="3569.242">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, this is not an unusual statute (Inaudible) any phrase of it.
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="3569.242" stopTime="3700.251">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    Not by any means, Your Honor. 
    In fact, this Court, before 1900, used almost exactly the same language as our statute uses and I have cited that case to the Court in the Reynolds case, Reynolds versus United States, cited in our brief, page 16 -- quoted page 16 and cited page 17, holds that express thing. 
    I think it's a statute that is absolutely essentially. 
    So we are faced with this simple situation. 
    We know from the cases handed down by this Court where we stand so far as newspaper publicity is concerned. 
    We know that we priced highly the freedom of the press and we permit them under their constitutional right to say many things. 
    And we do not quarrel with their right to publish these various news happenings. 
    Now, we must say how are we going to try a man who is accused of a crime in a jurisdiction where this publicity is permitted. 
    Now, how they acquire the publicity, I think, does figure into the picture.We have some cases. 
    But I would urge the Court to read those cases pretty, the cases cited by the petitioner here wherein it was held that the manner of releasing the news and so forth was a -- amounted to a denial of due process in the trial court. 
    But I submit that each of those -- in each of those cases, the share for the prosecuting attorney or someone in authority gave news releases as to purported facts that actually pointed to the -- directly to the guilt or innocence of the man but which facts were never introduced into evidence at the trial.

    But as to the crime itself, what I'm getting at, is the crime itself with the murder of Whitney Wesley Kerr.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    -- pretty broad question, Your Honor. 
    A lot of things can happen in -- in a jail and a lot -- a lot of information gets out.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    But whether we can say that that was an act of an official acting in his official capacity which would bind the State is a different story. 
    And I couldn't make the broad statement that this couldn't happen unless an official authorized it. 
    I think many newspaper men are quite resourceful as Your Honor well knows I'm sure, and they will get the story one way or another, I can't say that here -- in every instance. 
    And the -- in fact in this particular case, that every instance of news release was done through the cooperation of the sheriff and the press --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4023.758" stopTime="4037.507">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I quite appreciate your difficulty. 
    Newspaper people constitutionally allowed -- newspaper is constitutionally allowed to publish stuff and you're not up here defending as his -- having to defend a claim that you're not allowed to give it to them. 
    That's the situation here.
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="4037.507" stopTime="4189.323">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    That's -- that's right. 
    Right. 
    Now, I would like to just -- just a few remarks to Paul Weaver's testimony and the State's position there. 
    The State takes the position as I've previously stated that Paul Weaver's testimony was merely cumulative. 
    It added nothing to the evidence that was already in as far as his comments on the final argument. 
    There is no verbatim transcript of that argument as it has been pointed out by counsel for the petitioner. 
    There is only a bystander's bill of exceptions which purports to say what Paul Weaver did and the most that we can find in that bystander's bill of exceptions is the statement that Paul Weaver made that you heard me testify, you heard yourself what I testified to you, words to that effect. 
    There is no statement in there that he reviewed each individual fact and retestified or that he added anything to what he had previously said. 
    Nothing of that sort appears in this bystander's bill of exceptions. 
    Now, there -- there can be no argument. 
    The language of Canon 19 is clear and there can be no argument about its language and its content. 
    What we are saying is that Judge Schnackenberg was correct in the Circuit Court of Appeals when he stated that this was not a question to say that -- that to demonstrate that the man did not have due process of law, this was in our situation, demonstrate the man did not have due process of law at the trial level. 
    There is nothing concerning his testimony that would indicate such and we submit that to this Court. 
    If the Court has no further question, although my time is not up why, I -- I feel that I've covered this thing from the State's point of view. 
    The Court well knows we argued this thing once before on these same grounds quite extensively. 
    We -- the Court has the record before of the opinions of the judges, the various judges that have participated in this from the Indiana Supreme Court to Judge Parkinson, Judge Schnackenberg the first time, Judge Schnackenberg the second time and the dissenting opinions of Judge Duffy. 
    I -- I even feel that it's presumptuous of me to address the Court in the first place here. 
    It seems that it's quite well covered. 
    I would be happy if this --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4189.323" stopTime="4209.327">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Can you give us -- if I may ask you. 
    Can you give us any of the light on why it was that the Court of Appeals made an order on one day electing to repeat the case rather than the Circuit -- the District Court and in the next day, decided it without giving the opportunity for argument to this?
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="4209.327" stopTime="4293.480">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    I -- I can only say this, Your Honor, that they, likewise, like yourselves, had been subjected to a full-dress argument in the complete briefs in this matter previously. 
    And the -- although they had decided the question eventually in the Circuit Court of Appeals that -- the first time on the procedural question of the escape, which you will probably recall, but they did nevertheless hear a full-dress argument on the entire question of whether or not he had been afforded his constitutional right in -- under the Fourteenth Amendment from the state court. 
    Now, in addition to that, Judge Parkinson who at the time this was heard in the Federal District Court had also conducted a full-scale hearing in the matter, in fact, it was through his hearing that this bill of exceptions arrive -- arrives here as part of the evidence. 
    Judge Parkinson gave that a full treatment and wrote a complete opinion which has been cited to this Court of course. 
    And I think that it was a -- simply a question that they felt that they were fully informed that there was no use to send it back to the District Court that he had dealt with it in every possible aspect and so that the -- therefore, the decision was up to them. 
    They had heard full argument and full brief and we made no complaint and I don't believe the petitioner here through his attorneys made any complaint.

    They had the briefs before them and they could decide it upon the briefs if they saw fit. 
    And as I say there was no objections raised and there has been none raised here by a counsel for the petitioner that they were deprived with anything in the Circuit Court of Appeals by the action of the Court in that -- acting in that fashion.

   Argument of James D. Lopp
speaker="james_d_lopp" startTime="4378.031" stopTime="4604.243">
    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen. 
    It is the petition -- position here that we do feel that we would start a short change and not being purported this argument in Chicago for the Court of Appeals. 
    We feel that the -- Judge Castle, with all sincerity on his part, should have -- had the opportunity to let us present our position in this matter. 
    We've had a lot of time and effort given to this case. 
    And this is a proper case. 
    And I think the purpose of it is, is for a complete hearing. 
    Now, gentlemen, I'd like to get one thing straight. 
    Maybe you understand, I don't know. 
    These exhibits here, these newspaper in exhibits, those were attached to our motions for continuances, for changes of venues. 
    They were not newspaper items that was presented and shown to a jury at all during the course of this trial. 
    During the course of this trial, Mr. Lockyear and I used these newspapers for the purpose of -- of a continuance and for the change of venue. 
    "Mr. In-the-Newspapers" probably would say here that Mr. Irvin want to change the story, wanted this way or that way or he made an oral statement and such. 
    Now, it's just like this. 
    They -- we were being tried to this Court right today here and there's somebody out here on the street here saw the newspapers that we've made a -- a confession to this thing or we want to change our story, why, and these jurors were passing through the courtroom here and read those things is going to have an effect upon their judgment. 
    Now, that's what we were trying to avoid. 
    Our client has denied those statements. 
    He's denied a confession of this matter. 
    He's denied that he made a statement that the -- to the newspaper reporter that he wanted to change the context of the story or such as that. 
    We had made an offer to prove here during the course of this trial when Paul Weaver took that witness stand and when each one of those witnesses took that witness stand. 
    We objected and made an offer to prove that what they've obtained and what they've learned was illegal because of the length of time that this man was in this jail. 
    He hurry the time when he was arrested on April the 8th and so the purported confession of April the 12th, he was without counsel and we alleged in our -- our objections here. 
    During that period of time, before Mr. Weaver want to testify and before all these witnesses (Inaudible) altered wanted to testify, we made a -- an objection to that and the Court overruled our objection. 
    And that objection was in -- in substance, it's found on page 60 of our brief here. 
    Now, the police officers inflicted physical violence. 
    It points for the defendant that the -- the said admission, confession has stated before if any may were under duress and fraud, coercion, that's on page 60. 
    On page 60, this is a long objection we've made. 
    This objection here contained about 10 pages objection. 
    We further object that the -- the defendant here was then -- and then on the sole and absolute (Inaudible) control of the police officers and had been with up -- the street and rest for 24 hours. 
    And it -- and it continues to enter -- enter question at any statement so made by the defendant whether oral or written was involuntary given and was made given under inducement and under influenced of fear produced by threat, intimidations and (Inaudible) fraud. 
    And we further proceeded here.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did you -- did you anywhere at any stage of this proceeding contend or offer to prove that the claim that Irvin wanted to get his side of the story out is false?
speaker="james_d_lopp" startTime="4617.682" stopTime="4790.133">
    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    That's exactly what I did, is try to find cause for the Court, Your Honor. 
    Everyone of those witnesses, those police officers have testified. 
    We made our objection to them and an offer to prove that -- that very thing that I was reading to the Court this and this and saw these objections. 
    And it's found on page 60 of our brief -- on our brief and it continues my objections here. 
    And the further, the illegal in this that upon arresting the defendant, the police officer put the defendant in a barring cell at the police headquarter at the City of Evansville and a sweatbox room and kept him there incommunicado for a period of seven days and submitted him to every unrelating question without proper rules seeking the rest and still taking the defendant more equipped to adjust the fees or the Court having proper jurisdiction. 
    On page 66, we continue that he was denied the right to be advised of his legal rights by a counsel -- a counsel or a lawyer appointed by the Court of law to represent him at any time -- the -- at any time. 
    The said defendant was never brought before any magistrate or a court of law and advised of his rights to counsel and have counsel appointed to him or represent him during those seven long days he was held in a city jail at the City of Evansville. 
    And that is the truth that speaks the record that this defendant was held in the City of Evansville for that length of time. 
    I want to call your attention whether he was eventually called by the city court just what the judge said. 
    Now, I find within the city court there where they had Irvin was downstairs below, right up above, there's a city judge, the city -- the city court of the City of Evansville. 
    They have all this time locked up in a cell where you could open the door and walk around to the city courtroom for a purpose of arraignment. 
    He was finally brought in there and hear on Judge (Inaudible) was the judge. 
    And we asked Judge (Inaudible) there just one time. 
    Was the defendant represented by an attorney at that time? 
    No. 
    He was in the custody of the police officer of the City of Evansville at that time. 
    Question, "Did you advise him at that time he was entitled to be represented by an attorney?" 
    Answer, "I don't think so," and so many words. 
    He was just asked whether he weighed a hearing on a preliminary charge. 
    Question, "And that was all that was said?" 
    Answer, "That's right." 
    Now, that's what Judge (Inaudible) says. 
    That's found on this record here and this man was never afforded a counsel. 
    And each time these witnesses who testified, we made our proper objection and an offer to prove all that is set out in our brief here beginning on page 16 and ending on page 67.

    The defendant was arrested on the 8th day of April, 1955 and the said newspapers carry press releases from the Evansville Police Department in whose custody this defendant was then in there concerning this defendant's connection where they said six murders in Evansville and its surrounding area. 
    And at this defiant had confessed to the said six murders in the Evansville area. 
    That said press release were given to the newspapers of the presence of this defendant that said releases were unsworn to, never seen by this defendant that no time was he or his counsel gave him the opportunity to cross-examine those who release that statements to the newspapers and radio stations in Evansville, Indiana. 
    That at no time has this defendant been given the opportunity by the press to deny or contradict said press releases -- said press releases are untrue.

    He was working at -- in Warrick County, steam city man a -- in project there, building some kind of a car plant, and he had been gainfully employed for a number -- well, since he's been out, and he -- he was a regular employee at that time. 
    And they took -- they arrest him up there in this Warrick County which he joins Vanderburgh County. 
    As they take him to the sheriff of that county or whatnot, they brought him back to the City of Evansville and he brought -- took him to the city police station. 
    They did not take him to the sheriff of Vanderburgh County at all. 
    They kept him there from April the 8th to April 14th and finally on April the 12th, was when the alleged confession was proof to have been given but he was not taken to the state judge until by April 14th. 
    And then he was not appointed an attorney in this matter until April the -- on April 21st, he was indicted and rain -- arraigned, April 21st, he was arraigned and the Court on the April 22nd asked Irvin if he had an attorney, he said, no. 
    And then the matter of arraignment was continued until April 28th when the Court appointed Attorney Robert Hay to represent him. 
    So you've been readily see there a period of about 20 days there that he was not represented.

speaker="james_d_lopp" startTime="5701.933" stopTime="5735.668">
    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    Yes. 
    During the period of the voir dire examination here, Mr. Lockyear and I made a motion for this Court separating the jurors as they took the stand. 
    And that is found on page 2399 of this transcript where we move the Court to separate these prospective jurors so that when they were in the jury box, they wouldn't be carrying up one or the other had to say. 
    Court overruled our objection and refused to do that.

    What prejudice is subject to that?

    What's your point, yes. 
    I didn't understand --
speaker="james_d_lopp" startTime="5739.834" stopTime="5776.994">
    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    Our point is that is here, jury after jury and have a jury sitting in the jury box and jury after juror would come in, prejudice I think he's guilty. 
    He might be related, he might be an aunt, uncle or brother or some -- one of the jurors already on there. 
    There is one juror who thinks, "Well now, wait if John Jones thinks he's guilty, I know John Jones, why, maybe -- I'm thinking wrong here." 
    And after so long of time, that's going to build us in your mind if you keep saying somebody is guilty, somebody is guilty 431 times you're almost, why, you're going to be -- it's not too hard to confess somebody that -- not just party on you.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    What did you want? 
    Did you want for me to -- as soon as jurors would qualify, take them separately.
speaker="james_d_lopp" startTime="5782.380" stopTime="5783.725">
    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    Take them, put them into another room.

    And keep also prospective jurors out and only the one being examined the presence tribunal.

    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5791.329" stopTime="5830.878">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But your -- your -- the core of your case is that there are set on this jury X number of jurors, I don't know how many, three maybe. 
    But there were at least three men on that jury, proved on detail examination, indicated that they had a settled conviction that this man was guilty but when taking in hand by the judge, and ask whether they could, despite that fact, render a verdict on the evidence, they said they thought they could. 
    And your point is that that is -- that adds up to a humanly impossible undertaking, is that your case?
speaker="james_d_lopp" startTime="5830.878" stopTime="5834.878">
    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    That's right. 
    In other words, the judge might --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No matter how this thing got into the papers, no matter how wise or unwise it is to allow papers to be printed, no matter who is responsible for it, the effect on the minds of those jurors were such that they couldn't rub it out. 
    No matter what honest, self-deluding protestations they made or the assurance since they gave what they could.

    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    Well, I -- on that Spies case, what you said and I remembered also, the jurors had not expressed their opinions. 
    Now, in this case, these jurors had expressed their opinions and some of them, to the extent of everything except fixed stability.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I thought --

    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    They couldn't make up their minds whether they want to give him death or life.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5896.157" stopTime="5922.407">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I thought some of these have gone along way in the Spies. 
    I'm not meaning to say that Spies covers your case or that it should cover it but some of the jurors went a long way with reference to the statement that they were conveyed. 
    And it was only by much finding of the Court with a number of instances that there could be urged to say that they did not have a (Inaudible) opinion.
speaker="james_d_lopp" startTime="5922.407" stopTime="5926.555">

    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    Yes. 
    But I think irrespective or as far as our Constitution comes first, the question is whether the due process, not a matter of qualifying him under some particular statute. 
    It's qualifying him under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. 
    That's our position in this manner.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="5950.880" stopTime="5968.247">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, (Inaudible) it's -- if the qualification and not the statute, then it becomes a question of whether the statute itself is constitutionally valid for due process reasons, isn't that right?
