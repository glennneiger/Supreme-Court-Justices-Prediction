McPhaul v. United States

    Mr. Ernest Goodman 
    At the recess, I was indicating the nature of the evidence introduced by the Government on the separate record dealing with pertinency. 
    And the question was raised as to whether any of this evidence was used by the Government in asserting in its provision here that it has established its claim of possession and existence. 
    I call the court's attention to the argument of the Government on page 16 of its brief under which it argued that it had established a prima facie case where it says that when the committee subpoenaed petitioner to produce certain designated records of the Civil Rights Congress, it "had the information that Mr. Mcphaul was the executive director or Executive Secretary of the Civil Rights Congress." 
    And it cites from the record, pages17 and 21, now those two pages of the record which it cites support of this legal proposition are parts of the separate record dealing only with pertinency. 
    I -- I point that out to indicate that apparently the Government does rely on the separate record for proof of a -- in support of its argument that it had established a prima facie case.

    Mr. Ernest Goodman 
    It does not. 
    There's no indication on the subpoena that McPhaul has any relationship with the organization through records he is directed to produce. 
    And I -- in my brief, I point to many other cases that have come up in this Court before where the subpoenas have been directed either to the individual in his descriptive capacity as an officer or to the organizations served upon him in his official capacity. 
    This is apparently the usual way in which such subpoenas are issued if they're -- it's intended to bring in that person as -- in a representative capacity for the organization. 
    This case, that was not done and the Government in absence of this kind of procedure relies again upon this statement apparently on the separate record of pertinency that where Senator Potter testifies that they had evidence that he had and that is McPhaul as the Executive Secretary of the Civil Rights Congress. 
    Now, he was asked by the way by his own -- by the District Attorney to whether there is anything that he could show or any basis upon which he could support his statement that Arthur McPhaul had any relationship or was a member of the Civil Rights Congress. 
    And that question directed by the Government to Senator Potter appears on page 18 of the record. 
    I will ask you whether or not either the so-called the Executive or Closed Sessions or the public hearings, Mr. McPhaul was ever identified as a member of the Civil Rights Congress. 
    That question was never answered and no proof was presented to show that McPhaul, who -- the defendant in this case was ever identified in any capacity a member or otherwise of the Civil Rights Congress other than this conclusory statement by Potter -- on a separate record that they had evidence that he was an Executive Secretary so that --

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="ernest_goodman" startTime="265.706" stopTime="383.112">
    Mr. Ernest Goodman 
    That he at one time, yes. 
    The record is not clear even on the separate record because there Senator Potter says that in 1947, or thereabout, they had several letterheads to indicate that McPhaul was Executive Secretary. 
    That of course, even if they had such evidence would have been five years before he was subpoenaed. 
    So, in so far as the Government can rely upon this separate record dealing with pertinency, which they -- it was -- it was had outside the presence of a jury and I don't see how they can rely upon that to establish their claim that they proved the elements of the crime before the jury, but even if they were permitted to do it on the reasoning which they present here, it seemed to me that that is hardly a proof of the kind that would be required in any circumstances to show that the defendant here was in a representative capacity of the organization or that there were such records. 
    On the two other questions search and seizure and pertinency, I'm only going to make one comment. 
    I think I'll read that as it covers the subject and that is that on reflection, it seems to me that really both of these matters can be covered under the Fourth Amendment search and seizure rather than separate. 
    Both the Government and ourselves deal with them separately but further study of the case has seemed to indicate that under the Fourth Amendment, all issues relating to pertinency can be as readily raised with respect to the reasonableness of the subpoenaing as by trying to bring it under one of the other amendments so that pertinency and the scope read from the subpoenaing I think can more properly and clearly be considered as a argument dealing with the same problem.

   Argument of Daniel M. Friedman
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="449.983" stopTime="765.209">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would like at the outset summarize what the Government's position in this case is. 
    The petitioner was convicted of willfully refusing to produce documents before the House of Subcommittee. 
    It's admitted he didn't produce it. 
    So the whole question in each case is whether this failure to produce is refusal to produce was a willful one. 
    We think that the Government establishes a showing of willfulness when it proves first that the subcommittee had a reasonable basis upon which to subpoena these records from this individual. 
    And second that when this individual appeared in response to the subpoena, he offered no justification or explanation or excuse for his non-production of the documents, but merely said, "I will not." 
    And therefore, we think in these circumstances in the absence of any explanation, it was a reasonable inference by the jury that this was a willful refusal to produce. 
    That is, it was a deliberate and intentional clouting of the Commission's authority. 
    And we think that in these circumstances, where there is no questions raised, and I want to emphasize that at no time either before the Subcommittee, before the District Court, before the Court of Appeals or before this Court has petitioner ever suggested that he had any excuse for non-production. 
    He's never claimed that he doesn't have the documents. 
    He couldn't have produced it. 
    He was not connected with the association. 
    The whole argument is that it was incumbent on the Government as part of its affirmative case to prove that he had capacity to produce. 
    And our basic position is that I'm showing that we may, it was incumbent upon the petitioner to come forward with some explanation. 
    And I will develop that in the course of my argument. 
    Now, I would first like to turn to the question of the -- whether the subcommittee had a reasonable basis for issuing this subpoena to this petitioner to call upon him to produce this record. 
    Now, the evidence on this which Mr. Goodman keep referring to as a separate record was in fact taken before the judge out of the presence of the jury because the judge held in accordance with the decision of this Court that pertinency is a matter for the court not for the jury. 
    And similarly we think the question of the pertinency of the reasonableness of the Commission's committee seeking to obtain the records from this man is comparable perhaps in many ways different but fundamentally comparable to the showing of probable cause to the issuance of a warrant. 
    We know it is a question of law whether the Committee had any basis in seeking the records from this man. 
    Now what has the record shown us? 
    The record on this is based on the testimony of then Senator Potter who was then member of the Committee. 
    To begin with, at pages 17 and 22 of the record, Senator Potter testified that the Civil Rights Congress had been declared a subversive organization both by the Attorney General and by the Committee itself. 
    Now we're contending Mr. Justice Black in answer to a question that this evidence is sufficient to prove that the Civil Rights Congress was or was not some subversive organization. 
    All that we say is the Committee on the basis of this information was justified in saying it wanted to have a look at these records. 
    That's all it was asking the man to do and have a look at them. 
    Now the Committee also, the testimony by Senator Potter particularly at page 22 -- sorry, page 21 and also at page 17, Senator Potter stated, "The committee had information that Mr. McPhaul was Executive Director or Executive Secretary for Civil Rights Congress." 
    Now one basis for this information was the letterhead in the Committee files showing that in 1947, this man was the Executive Secretary of the association. 
    There is nothing in this statement that limits this statement, this testimony indicating that was the only thing. 
    And significantly I think when Mr. Goodman read to the Court this question that Senator Potter where there was any evidence taken at the executive hearing whether Mr. McPhaul was ever identified as the member of the Civil Rights Congress. 
    Mr. Goodman neglected to read the very next sentence on page 18 which is Mr. Goodman's statement, "I will object to that on the ground of that it constitutes hearsay." 
    Now, if the petitioner question the basis of the Committee for subpoenaing Mr. McPhaul, I petition the question that the Committee had any basis for taking this man was in fact connected with the organization, he could have cross-examined Senator Potter at this hearing before the judge, cross-examine on one peripheral issue. 
    At no point did he-cross examine Senator Potter on this issue. 
    Now as I shall indicate briefly later in my argument.

    This is when he appeared, accompanied by counsel before he was sworn and about half way down, Mr. Wood, Congressman Wood, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, "Are you prepared to produce the documents and papers that have been called upon for you to produce under the subpoena?" 
    The witness answered, "Mr. Wood I refuse to answer this or any question which deals with the possession or custodies of the books and records called for in the subpoena. 
    I claim my privilege under the Fifth Amendment of the constitution."

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    But Mr. Justice my point is, I will come to in a moment he did not refuse to produce the documents under any claim of self-incrimination. 
    I'd like to read to the Court at page 34, in the middle of the page the circumstances under which he actually refused to do it. 
    Mr. Tavenner: The question is as to whether or not you were refusing to produce the records directly to be produced on this subpoena. 
    Mr. McPhaul: My answer for that is, I refuse to answer this or any questions which deal with possessions or custody of the books and records called for in the subpoena. 
    And again he claimed his privilege under the Fifth Amendment. 
    Mr. Tavenner says, "My question to you was not answered. 
    My question is whether or not you are refusing to produce the record." 
    And Mr. McPhaul said, "I have answered." 
    Mr. Tavenner said, "No sir. 
    You have stated that you refused to answer any questions pertaining to that. 
    I have not asked you a question that pertains to that. 
    I have asked you to produce the record. 
    Now will you produce it?" 
    Answer by Mr. McPhaul, "I will not." 
    Mr. McPhaul did not say I will not produce these records because their production I tend to incriminate it. 
    Mr. McPhaul specifically put his claim of privilege on the refusal to answer questions with respect to the possession and custody of the record. 
    His answer to the question will you produce and was I will not.

    It wasn't read in the courts. 
    The Subcommittee also indicate to us that when a demand is made on a person who for whom there was a reasonable basis to believe that he has the record, that is obligatory on him to come forward and to state either that he doesn't have or he can't.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    I want to emphasize that if this man had the records, one of two possibilities. 
    One, he had the records, he could've produce it. 
    If he had the records, he could've produced. 
    It seems to us he clearly was in contempt when he stated, "I will not." 
    Number two, let's assume for the sake of argument this organization had no records or this man could not have produced them. 
    If that were the facts, we don't see any basis on which he could possibly claim that he will be incriminated if he told the Committee, "I'm sorry, I can't produce them, I don't have it." 
    Now he doesn't deny that. 
    He says, if he came before the Committee and told the Committee, "I don't have them." 
    That wouldn't be the end of it. 
    The Committee will say, well then, who has it? 
    Why don't you have it? 
    And so on. 
    We think a line can be drawn. 
    We think he could fairly claim a privilege once he has told the Committee that he does not have the books and records. 
    He -- the privilege under the decision in the (Inaudible) case to refuse to answer questions, any questions with respect to the possession or custody of the record. 
    But we don't think when he is subpoenaed to produce the records, he has any claims to say under the claim of privilege. 
    I'm not even going to tell you that I don't have them. 
    We think if he doesn't have them, he has got a burden at least to tell that to the Committee.

    He doesn't indicate whether it's because he doesn't have them, because he's not connected with this association, because for all we know, whatever happened. 
    All we're saying is that it was the burden on him to come forward and state the simple fact if he did not have the record, that he could not produce them, that he could not without any explanation as to why not. 
    The statement of that fact would be sufficient we think to bring it to the Committee's contention that a man that they believe could've produced the record said he couldn't do it.

    The only thing I think we have to show beyond the reasonable doubt in terms of the statute to say willful refusal to produce.

    And they didn't.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    I -- I -- Mr. Justice, I think that the latter two elements that the documents are in existence that he had them that the burden was shifted to him to come forward with some explanations to why he didn't produce. 
    That those -- in other words that absent any challenge by him and absent -- then he raised -- by him of these questions. 
    Those are not essential elements to prove a willful refusal to produce, that's our basis --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You -- there'd been a lot of talk about shifting the burden specifically so that the plaintiff (Inaudible) to say the least of it, the courts have been rather weary haven't they about adopting the rule of shifting the burden of proof from the Government to defendant charged with a crime?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="2567.082" stopTime="2645.888">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    They have were but there are cases which have indicated that in situations where certain facts had shown justify the inference of certain conclusion and where the rebuttal of those fact lies peculiarly within the control of the defendant, that's not unreasonable act of the Government puts forward it's affirmative case to ask the defendant if he has an explanation or excuse to come forward. 
    I think the Rossi case which we've cited with the prosecution for operating this still without a bond. 
    And I said that where the Government to prove the operation but still but it was not necessary for the Government to prove affirmatively that the man had not obtained a bond. 
    That was something within his knowledge that if in fact he hadn't obtained the bond, he should come forward. 
    Mr. -- Mr. Justice, if I may suggest another example of a hypothetical case which I think is somewhat akin to this. 
    Suppose for the sake of argument a witness was summoned to appear before a congressional committee and testified, to testify that's all. 
    The day of his appearance goes by and he doesn't even show up. 
    Now I think that of itself ordinarily would be a clear contempt of the committee. 
    He doesn't show up at all. 
    Now in fact he may have a valid excuse. 
    He may have been sick on his bed in a hospital on the day of the --

    Now the statute may cover that but it -- you'd have to look at the statute.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="2666.813" stopTime="2723.599">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    The statute specifically says every person having been summoned as a witness by any committee willfully makes default, Section I, Title 2, Section 192 covers both failing to produce documents and records for failing to appear the summon. 
    But my suggestion was that in that case the Government prosecuted this man under this statute for failing to appear. 
    I would think the burden would be on the defendant to come forward with the excuse that he was sick in the hospital on the day that he was subpoenaed to appear before the committee. 
    And yet in that situation too I suppose, you could say it's an essential element of the offense that he had the ability to comply with the subpoena. 
    Yet, I wouldn't think the Government was required as part of this affirmative case to show that the man was healthy. 
    I think this is the kind of thing that is peculiarly within the control of the defendant and that if he can explain it away he is obligated to do so.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2723.599" stopTime="2747.545">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And you are saying that even if you cannot draw the inference which Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggested, you could be wrong in making that I refuse on the ground of self-incrimination. 
    You're saying -- and even if he couldn't draw that, it wouldn't be necessary because the burden is on him to show that there were no papers and that -- and that he was not connected with somebody that he couldn't (Inaudible)

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That's correct.

    Mr. Justice, I suggest that in the ordinary situation, if someone is subpoenaed to produce books and records before a committee or any tribunal and he is unable to do so, he would normally come forward and state so. 
    I would -- if I were subpoenaed into one of the House Committee to produce some books and records of some organization that I either had no connection or that I didn't have, I would tell them that. 
    I wouldn't --

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well he would -- if Mr. Chief Justice, I think so because if he had them, he didn't have to say you had them, it seems to me, just produce them. 
    If he didn't have them, a simple statement that he didn't have them would go to the question whether he could have complied with the subpoena.

    Do you know who has them? 
    Did you have them yesterday? 
    Will you have them tomorrow?" 
    A whole series of questions as to that, I think he could properly claim this privilege. 
    Our point is that the mere statement that he didn't have them, the mere inability to comply but not possibly incriminate him and that would have given the Committee an opportunity to take whatever steps was necessary.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well then, if he said he didn't, he is then injected into the case on a question whether he can or cannot comply, whether he had power to comply with the subpoena.

    He raised no such issue.

    Well that seems to be what the trial court was stating but that statement was made after the defendant rested without introducing any evidence. 
    So that the practical matter, he had not attempted to introduce any evidence. 
    There's nothing to indicate that if he had sought to justify it on a claim of incapacity to do it, the trail court would have not permitted him.

    Let me think candidly Mr. Justice, that I think is a harder question. 
    There is language certainly in the Fleischman case which suggest that at the trial of the case, the defendant may introduce evidence showing a ground for noncompliant with the subpoena. 
    But in this case, there was no attempt made to introduce that evidence, I suppose if I were pressed, I would probably concede that he could in that situation to introduce evidence.

    No, but that I don't think is this case. 
    I think the -- the argument that we make with respect to the need for bringing these matters to the attention of the Committee permeates this whole case. 
    The issue with respect the pertinency, the scope of the subpoena similarly if in fact this man had any objection that he claims the subpoena was unduly broad. 
    If he claimed that the material sought was not pertinent, again, he should have given the Committee an opportunity to pass on these things. 
    The same basic problems we think exist with respect to whether in fact he does or does not have possession or custody of the documents. 
    I won't burden the court with that. 
    We've argued at length in our brief despite it to say that if he thought this was too burdensome, if he thought the subpoena was too broad, again, he should've brought it --

    If he claimed the subpoena was not -- the documents were not pertinent, he could have then brought it before the Committee and given the Committee a chance to explain to him. 
    He didn't do either. 
    We think this Court's decision in the Barenblatt case indicates quite clearly that when you object to pertinency, and that of course too is an element of defense. 
    If it's just the pertinency, you got to make the objection before the Committee. 
    And that when you raise no objection before the Committee on these particular grounds, in effect you're telling the Committee you're not really very concerned about this. 
    And then as we go on to prove it in any event the subpoena in this case was not unduly broad and the documents in view of the broad scope that the Commission's inquiry were pertinent to the investigation.

    That when he does not raise any issue in the case and he's never raised any issue as to whether he did or did not have the power to produce these documents. 
    That when that issue is not tendered, that its never been tendered in this case, that there's no need for the Government to (Inaudible) this thing. 
    I want -- I'd like to close on this note if I may Mr. Chief Justice. 
    There's never been any contention in this case by the petitioner that he did not have the document whether the documents had not existed. 
    He's never made that contention at any point in this proceeding. 
    This whole contention has been that even though he refused to produce the documents without any explanation, the burden was upon the Government to affirmatively establish that he could've produced. 
    Now we thinking in the normal situation when someone is subpoenaed to produce documents, it's a reasonable inference that if he had an excuse for not producing, he would have said so. 
    And in these circumstances, we don't think the Government was required to affirmatively establish that policy.

    He of course, if he has the documents in a representative capacity and does not produce them, he will be found guilty of contempt once the Government establishes that.
