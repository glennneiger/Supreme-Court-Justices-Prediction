Rogers v. Richmond
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="13.402">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- Harold D. Rogers, Petitioner, versus Mark S. Richmond, Warden. 
    Mr. Pollak, you may continue your arguments.
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="13.402" stopTime="190.329">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    May it please the Court. 
    When I left this building yesterday evening, after we have just begun this argument, I must confess that for a moment I felt a little disjointed, as if living somewhat of an island. 
    I was moving back into the mainstream of a nation which was concerned, not with problems of this kind, but with a national election. 
    And -- and then as I thought about it a little more, I thought, "Well, perhaps that isn't so." 
    Perhaps, the two hallmarks of a free nation are the exercise of the ballot, freely and secretly, and a fair trial, and of indication of the rights of every man to equal justice before the law for which this Court sits. 
    And so I returned today thinking that our mission here is perhaps more important than it was than I thought it was even yesterday. 
    I indicated yesterday that it was my purpose to direct myself to the dominant issue of the scope of the inquiry which the federal judge sitting in habeas corpus is to make when he is faced with an application for the writ and the issue. 
    The constitutional issues are issues which have been at least inquired into to some extent in the state courts. 
    And that my colleague, Mr. Zeldes, will address himself to the somewhat separable issue of access to counsel as a constitutional right by itself, perhaps as separate from the coercive character of the incriminating statements submitted against petitioner in the state murder trial. 
    I am not going to -- of necessity, as I describe the events in this case, I will be describing how the incriminating statements were elicited, but I do want to make it clear that it is not my purpose so much to be arguing that constitutional issues of coercion as to make it plain, how they arose and who considered those issues so that this Court can best be acquainted with what bears on the inquiry, which the habeas corpus court should be making and this I hope will in part be responsive to Justice Frankfurter's very proper inquiry yesterday as to just who said what, to what tribunal, when and what did the State Supreme Court and subsequently, Federal Judge Smith sitting in the District Court have before him.

    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    I -- I don't believe there is, Justice Frankfurter. 
    I think the issue could be reached in several ways. 
    The issue could be reached on the basis of the record which Judge Smith on the Court of Appeals have held that they are limited to at this phase of the case. 
    It could be reached on the basis of the record which Judge Smith addressed himself to at the first habeas corpus hearing, or indeed as Judge Clark dealt with the merits in his dissenting opinion below. 
    It seems to me this Court could if it wished, though I don't urge one course rather than the other on this Court. 
    It seems to me this Court could address itself to the merits of the coercion issue on the basis of the state transcript itself. 
    But, I --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't know why we get into the difficulties? 
    Maybe I should get into them myself. 
    But you'll get into the federal court on a claim of a denial of a constitutional -- federal constitutional right. 
    Is it not the way -- that -- is it not the only basis of getting into the federal court? 
    Is it not the only issue that was decided --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, whether the -- the decision was rendered on an adequate basis is a different question, but that is the issue. 
    The issue isn't what -- what the scope of judicial review is. 
    That may be relevant to determining whether you affirm or reverse or remand what the District Court has now sustained by the Court of Appeals has done. 
    But the issue is whether there is a denial of due process.
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="325.213" stopTime="326.683">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    I -- I agree.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="326.683" stopTime="350.368">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, I didn't intend to stir up a collateral issue, but I prompted my question to this. 
    Judge Smith, as I understand it, contrary to what he did at the first hearing, said that he would discharge the writ in this case before us, because he found himself constricted in making findings that he -- if free, he would have otherwise made.
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="350.368" stopTime="350.540">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak

    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    Yes, that is correct. 
    Now, if I may take the liberty in response to Justice Frankfurter's question yesterday afternoon, Mr. Zeldes and I have attempted to facilitate this Court's understanding of this very confusing record for which I make no apologies. 
    It's an amalgam of Connecticut procedure and the handy work of other attorneys and this is the printed record we have. 
    To thread our way through it, Mr. Zeldes has prepared a compilation of what witnesses testified before the state trial judge, what before the jury, which of that testimony went to the State Supreme Court and what are that came before Judge Smith at which phase of the habeas corpus proceeding. 
    Necessarily, this has been done in haste and we have only just had opportunity to give a copy to Mr. Ullmann and Mr. Zampano. 
    This -- this document in -- in duplicate form is available. 
    If it will be of service to the Court, I would offer it to the Court either now or at the conclusion of the argument that is simply a tabular indication of what witnesses' testimony was disposed of, in what fashion before, what tribunal at what phase of the case.

    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    Four days later, having hired an attorney of the late Thomas Robinson, public defender of New Haven, but hire -- having hired Mr. Robinson in his private capacity, petitioner appeared before the City Court waived examination when it was bound over to the April term for trial on a robbery charge. 
    He remained in custody and two weeks thereafter on January 30th, he was suddenly, on a Saturday, taken without any court order, which would be required under the Connecticut procedure, taken from the county jail to the State Attorney's Office, Mr. Ullmann's office, where he was interrogated from approximately noon or 1 o'clock to the completion of the interrogation after midnight. 
    Very briefly, he found himself of being interrogated about a charge of murder which related to a murder which had taken place some three months before, two or three months before. 
    He found himself at the outset confronted by a gun, which allegedly had been in his custody when arrested and which was now sought to be linked to that murder. 
    He at once, according to his testimony before the state trial judge, the preliminary hearing on the admissibility of his statement, at once asked to see his counsel, his already retained lawyer and there is no contradiction by any witness that he did -- no contradiction by any witness in the state court proceeding that he did make such a request at once.

    Where is that in the record?
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="611.736" stopTime="708.628">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    That is the testimony of petitioner Rogers which begins at page 239 and on 241 if you -- Your Honor please. 
    In the middle of the page, petitioner testified -- I said I wanted -- the question, "Who was your lawyer at that time? 
    Mr. Robinson and you." 
    Mr. Corsi was doing the examining before the trial Judge Maletz. 
    Did you tell Sergeant Mullhern that Mr. Robinson was your lawyer? 
    No, he didn't answer me. 
    I didn't name him. 
    I said I wanted to see my lawyer. 
    That's all." 
    And more of the same. 
    This is at page 241 of the state record. 
    Now, this was testimony to the trial judge. 
    This testimony was before the Supreme Court of errors. 
    Rogers did not testify before the jury, nor did Rogers testify -- I beg your pardon. 
    Rogers of course testified before Judge Smith on habeas corpus into the same effect. 
    Before Judge Smith, that testimony was contradicted by police officers who were present at that state of the interrogation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="708.628" stopTime="716.247">

    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    There was no contradiction of that, Your Honor. 
    There was contradiction by Chief Eagan, a detective who was present from eight in the evening on who denied that -- at that subsequent time, the petitioner asked for his lawyer. 
    But there was no contradiction on the state record even though the officers were available in the state trial during the trial. 
    There was no contradiction before Judge Maletz of the testimony to which I refer to you.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    One other question and perhaps you've answered this, so I missed it. 
    You began by telling us that at the state proceeding, there was no -- no -- not of this statement by the petitioner that he had asked to see his lawyer. 
    Was there any corroboration on that?
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="859.956" stopTime="923.309">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    There was no corroboration, no, Mr. Justice. 
    I don't know in the nature of things how it could have been obtained as the issue was tried out before Judge Smith. 
    As I say there, there was denial in the sense that at last the state called the policemen who were interrogating at the time and they denied it and Judge Smith recognized the conflict and said, "It seems to me enormously probable that a man who had retained a lawyer would have asked for him and I tend to believe -- I do believe the petitioner. 
    I may say, Mr. Justice, that at the trial of the issue before Judge Maletz in the state court at petitioners' counsel said having elicited Rogers' testimony and the fact that Chief Eagan could only dispute it with respect to a much later period, said, "I assume that the State will want to introduce witnesses." 
    And the patrolmen were sitting -- the officers were sitting in the courtroom, will want to produce witnesses with respect to this proof of period of time and no such witnesses were brought forward.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="923.309" stopTime="947.600">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, am I right that the Connecticut Supreme Court did state explicitly that he didn't ask that his -- his then counsel be called to the jail, but it -- but there's no -- but -- but it did not reject his testimony to a jury referred on page 241 that he asked for his counsel.

speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="969.904" stopTime="1012.503">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    That is correct and it seems to me, if I may say so, especially taking in context with Justice O'Sullivan's dissent that the State Supreme Court assumed that he had in fact asked for his lawyer notwithstanding the one so-called finding which has assumed such enormous importance in this case. 
    Judge Maletz says finding to the contrary or finding -- we say unsupported by evidence and a finding which, if the Court please, was merely represented the judge's subscription five months later of an assertion, a summation made to him and submitted to him by the State's Attorney as part of the appellate process.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1012.503" stopTime="1027.910">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Judge O'Sullivan in his dissent accepts his evidence since there was no contradiction of it.

    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    This is a most puzzling question, Mr. Justice. 
    I think the answer is -- I'm sure the answer is that in many circumstances, they can go to the evidence if the findings are in one sense or another insufficient or inadequate. 
    I refer the Court to the primer on appellate procedure in Connecticut, Chief Justice Motley, his work on the subject, Sections 130 and 131 in the case of State versus McCarthy, a capital case some years ago in Connecticut. 
    The Connecticut Supreme Court did take occasion to go back to the evidence when troubled by finding and pointed out that it was entitled to do so and should do so especially in a capital case to assure itself for the protection of the interest of the accused in a capital case
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1175.751" stopTime="1201.041">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, my question was to be -- to be made more specific. 
    If there is no finding, not that the finding is ambiguous or capable of -- of one or another interpretation, but if there is no finding and there is evidence uncontradicted, may this -- is the Supreme Court precluded from going to the evidence because there was no finding.

    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    Mr. Justice, among the other findings, there isn't is a case which I can give you on that point in Connecticut, but I'm -- to the extent that I can understand the Connecticut cases, they would all be consistent with the answer that you would expect that, but of course they could go --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1216.880" stopTime="1223.510">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It should be great if it surprises of any -- the Supreme Court made their findings. 
    They can't go to the evidence because there is finding.
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="1223.510" stopTime="1236.445">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    Well, I -- I think that's plain on -- well, on the face of Judge Motley excellent summation in his volume on appellate procedure, but I don't want to mislead you as to saying that I can provide you with a holding of that effect.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1236.445" stopTime="1239.361">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, Mr. Ullman will touch the light on that.
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="1239.361" stopTime="1431.438">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    Now, I seem to have -- I only have five minutes before I yield to my colleague Mr. Zeldes, so if I may very much compress what comes hereafter. 
    Let me merely remind you that before the end of -- of the interrogation in the State's Attorney's Office, the decisive moment was after Chief Eagan entered, he placed -- he -- he warned petitioner that he was going to call in petitioner's wife and put his foster children in custody and preceded to make a phone call directing his -- his subordinates to get ready to apprehend Mrs. Rogers and that phone call concededly by his own statement was on a dead telephone. 
    It was a fake. 
    He said to the judge it was done for the sake -- he agreed that it was to make it plain to Rogers the advisability of making a statement. 
    To the jury, Chief Eagan went further. 
    He acknowledged that it was -- that he told Rogers you would be "less than half a man." 
    You let us bring in your wife. 
    And an hour went by, the chief began to move as if to phone again and petitioner then began the first incriminating statement. 
    The second statement came a day later in the Coroner's office after the Coroner had made sure, after the Coroner, one, had issued a -- his own form of warrant to detain Rogers as a suspect for murder and two, had accompanied that with an order that no one be allowed to see Rogers, and immediately that had impact in the sense of barring Rogers' attorney who at noon on Sunday came to see Rogers at the jail and was denied admission, a denial confirmed on a phone call by the jailer to Mr. Ullman's office and the jailer recalled to Mr. Ullman. 
    And five hours later, Rogers was taken to the Coroner's office, interrogated. 
    The Coroner says he warned him of his right, assured him of his right to have assistance of counsel. 
    He agreed in testimony before the trial court that this was a stop warning. 
    The Coroner apparently was free to give that assurance of right to counsel having already taken steps to see to it, steps which had to take an effect that counsel would not get to see petitioner. 
    Now, these were the statements that were admitted in evidence against Rogers, which led to his conviction, a conviction sustained by the State Supreme Court. 
    The further steps, I think this Court knows, that Judge Smith granted the writ, having before him -- taking testimony, both offered by petitioner and by the State without objection on either side and taking all the documentary evidence of the state proceedings that was submitted to him and --

   Argument of Jacob D. Zeldes
speaker="jacob_d_zeldes" startTime="1846.690" stopTime="1879.019">
    Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes 
    Mr. Chief Justice, in the present posture of this case, great emphasis has been placed on the so-called state court findings of fact. 
    Mr. Pollak has already addressed himself to these findings somewhat and I want to add a few comments, if I may. 
    I want to emphasize of the outset that these are verbatim adaptions supplied to the trial court in Connecticut under the Connecticut procedure by the State's Attorney and were filed five months after the trial. 
    They are set --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1879.019" stopTime="1885.741">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did you have -- did you have opportunity to comment or propose counter findings?
speaker="jacob_d_zeldes" startTime="1885.741" stopTime="1958.027">
    Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Under the Connecticut procedure which is outlined in our brief at page 25 in a lengthy footnote, the appellant first files a draft finding. 
    The appellee then files a counter finding and the judge takes which portions of these two documents he thinks applicable and prepares a finding for appellate purposes. 
    In response to your previous inquiry directed to Professor Pollak that procedure for the correction of the finding in the Supreme Court of Errors is such that one of the standard means for correction is failure to make a finding on material evidence. 
    This was not raised in the usual case in Connecticut because the finding with which we are concerned, that so-called findings of underlying facts, what the lower courts consider that to be, were made in the course of a ruling on evidence before the jury. 
    And I think, if Your Honor would refer to the footnote of page 25, you would see the basic structure of the Connecticut appellate system, which I don't feel that we have adequate time to explain the detail at this point.

    Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes 
    I do want to emphasize, however, that under the decisions of all the courts below, the exclusive determination of the constitutional issue must be made on these finding and I think it's important to emphasize that the -- the Court of Appeals has not said that Judge Smith must confine himself to the state court transcript, which was created at the time these confessions were admitted, but he must confine himself exclusively to the findings of facts filed five months after the confessions were admitted.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2001.463" stopTime="2029.246">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, if I may interrupt you, because the details of -- of what's happened here, it seems to me vide of any proper disposition of this case by this Court,(Inaudible) the case is very important one on that question. 
    How did the fact that the findings made by the trial judge had not been before Judge Smith on the first ground come before the Court of Appeals?
speaker="jacob_d_zeldes" startTime="2029.246" stopTime="2049.293">
    Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes 
    In this fashion, Your Honor, the findings of the state trial judge were never offered by either party at -- at the original habeas corpus hearing of August 31st, 1956. 
    Neither side offered it. 
    I might say that Judge Smith accepted every bit of documentary evidence offered by either party.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2049.293" stopTime="2055.674">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You see I'd find it very difficult to understand why those findings were not in the first instance before Judge Smith.

    Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes 
    Well, as Your Honor has pointed out in -- in Brown against Allen, the crucial findings we're dealing with, when we're dealing with the delicate balance of federal-state relations is the findings relating to historical facts.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2069.922" stopTime="2100.368">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, how do the -- how do I know I've looked at this finding? 
    How do I know what these findings contained unless they are before me? 
    And how could Judge Smith know what those findings were unless they were before him? 
    And as I understand the Court of Appeals if they -- you would correct me, if I'm wrong, they thought that he was an important part of the matter out of which the conviction arose, the evidentiary matter, that was not before the habeas corpus judge, isn't that right?
speaker="jacob_d_zeldes" startTime="2100.368" stopTime="2116.689">
    Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes 
    That is correct, Your Honor, but that I think is important that that is not the sole basis of their remand instructions. 
    If that were so, we might not be here today, but they said, "Examine the transcript" and then, "Conclude yourself." 
    And this is under the interpretations of the Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2116.689" stopTime="2152.499">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand what they did and that's why we -- that's why we didn't deny without comment. 
    That's why we interpret it, if you please, what then the duty of Judge Smith was. 
    That's the whole point and that's why a reference was made as to what a habeas corpus judge is to consider so that what the Court of Appeals did isn't the definitive or the final thing with reference to the remand, the notation by this Court is denying the Court of Appeals' decision, is the binding thing.
speaker="jacob_d_zeldes" startTime="2152.499" stopTime="2161.985">
    Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes 
    We concur, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, but we feel that both Judge Smith on remand and the Court of Appeals in their second opinion have ignored the command of this Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2161.985" stopTime="2203.931">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You may well be right. 
    I'm not addressing myself with that. 
    The point on which I would like to put emphasis is that in a habeas corpus proceeding in which they were available as what not to in the many instances in the appendix of Brown and Allen, where there were these formal documents, part of the structure you call it of the Connecticut appellate procedure in criminal cases. 
    It seems to me difficult to understand why that was not before Judge Smith and I don't mind expressing the opinion. 
    It probably should've been and should be before Judge Smith and the other habeas corpus judge.
speaker="jacob_d_zeldes" startTime="2203.931" stopTime="2214.012">
    Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes 
    I may say this directly to that point, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it was never offered by the respondent. 
    There is no indication whatsoever that Judge Smith would have rejected and I might add also --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There is -- isn't it the respondents, you -- you make this case -- the petitioner or whatever you call him, the habeas corpus applicant is the pillar upon whom rest the responsibility of making out a case.

    Justice William O. Douglas

speaker="jacob_d_zeldes" startTime="2358.636" stopTime="2552.777">
    Mr. Jacob D. Zeldes 
    The two issues which have been raised throughout this proceeding at all stages are the coercive nature of the confessions and whether or not the denial of counsel in itself, regardless of the voluntary nature of the confession renders the confessions inadmissible. 
    My time is somewhat limited. 
    I had prepared to -- to discuss the right to counsel as it's affected here. 
    I see Mr. Justice Douglas' interest in the compilation which we have set forth in some reform for this purpose. 
    There has been considerable discussion over the last four years since this case has been in the federal court over what testimony Judge Smith heard and what he did not hear and what he should have heard. 
    It is our position, if Your Honor please, that the tribunal on August 31st held a habeas corpus hearing. 
    Petitioner had requested a hearing, respondent did not object to a hearing. 
    Petitioner offered witnesses and respondent offered witnesses. 
    The issues were fully litigated before Judge Smith. 
    At that point, respondent filed a lengthy affidavit asking Judge Smith to reconsider his opinion that both of these confessions were coerced and I might interject for just a moment to say that this was the first such opinion rendered by Judge Smith in 17 years as a district judge in the district -- in the section of the State in which he hears virtually all habeas corpus petitions from the state prison. 
    Yet, even when respondent filed his affidavit for rehearing, he never objected to the propriety of the hearing. 
    And on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the fist time, respondent objected to this hearing and said Judge Smith should not have heard all of these testimony and the conclusion that both of these confessions were bad on the basis of what Judge Smith heard and saw himself in the federal plenary hearing cannot be considered by the court below. 
    And instead, the Court of Appeals went on to shackle Judge Smith to findings filed by the state trial court for appellate purposes. 
    I think, Your Honor, that I would urge this Court on the right to counsel point to keep in mind that it's relevant in two respects, as one of the totality of circumstances surrounding the exaction of the confessions. 
    In a long line of cases starting with Brown against Allen which will I -- I will not repeat now, this Court had set out the due process limits on the use of challenged confession. 
    I urge this Court to consider the denial of counsel also in regard to what five justices of this Court in separate opinions seem to indicate, renders the confessions inadmissible on the basis of the denial of counsel in itself. 
    I think that since charges were filed against petitioner, although they were charges on another crime, that he is entitled to his absolute right to counsel in a capital case, and that the resulting confession should be held a denial of due process of law.

    Your Honor, there are five Justices in this Court who have accepted that position, if not, in one opinion. 
    Your Honor is correct in saying that it has been rejected by the majority the Court in the Crooker case and in Cicenia versus Lagay. 
    But I feel that -- reading the opinions of this Court, the Spano concurrence might -- Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Douglas' dissent in Crooker indicates that five Justices now feel that the effective way to protect the right to counsel is to invalidate a resulting confession whether or not it is voluntary under the traditional principle set forth in the Spano case.

   Argument of Abraham S. Ullman
speaker="abraham_s_ullman" startTime="2683.147" stopTime="2838.477">
    Mr. Abraham S. Ullman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I should like to address myself to the facts went before the state trial court, and the record that was before the Supreme Court of Errors as well as to some of the facts before the District Court in the first hearing. 
    I'd like to say at the outset that Judge Smith, in the first decision, determined that the proceedings in the Connecticut trial court and in the Supreme Court were tainted with a lack of due -- with a lack of due process. 
    He made that finding without ever having looked at the proceedings. 
    He did not have before him the transcript testimony nor did he have the findings made by the trial court on these confessions. 
    He didn't have the plaintiffs' counsel and he didn't have the confessions themselves, which are most illuminating, in my opinion, as to the condition of the accused when he gave it. 
    And when I learned that he hadn't looked at this record and that was at the conclusion of the hearing, I moot to present all of that before you. 
    He did not accept them as counsel plan. 
    He did not accept everything. 
    He rejected it (Inaudible) and they remarked merely as exhibits for identification. 
    Now, what were some of these facts before the trial court? 
    We start off by having as a fact that Rogers was 46 years old, highly intelligent, a brother of a police officer who had have vast experience with the police by reason of that fact as well as by reason of his four previous arrests. 
    He had been questioned by police on a number of cases as recently as three weeks prior to this confession. 
    He had been arrested on the -- January on charges of a contested robbery, breaking and entering and theft. 
    And on that date, the murder gun was found in his possession. 
    He was questioned and in his first statement to the police, he stated that he wanted that afternoon in a cracking.

    Was it known at that time that this was the murder gun?

    Mr. Abraham S. Ullman 
    We did not know at that time that it was the murder gun. 
    You see -- please Your Honor, this murder had taken place from West Haven on November 23rd. 
    The arrest on January 9th was in New Haven. 
    There was no test to the gun made immediately, although orders have been given around the several towns to have guns -- all guns checked and it wasn't until after Rogers was found over the Superior Court that my office entered into the case and that had test made and the report of those test came on Saturday, January 30th to my office. 
    So that I say that Rogers told two different stories on -- on his interrogations there by the police. 
    Finally, in the second, he admitted that he had stolen the gun from a home of his nephew on or about the date of the murder.

    Mr. Abraham S. Ullman 
    -- and we precede (Inaudible). 
    So the -- to show that he was in no (Inaudible) of police, I might mention the fact, which is an evidence and which was before the Court, that on the date following the murder, when his nephew charged him with the theft of this gun, he denied. 
    And he himself, Rogers, suggested, "Let's get down to the police and report the gun was stolen." 
    And Rogers went there to the police and made such a report. 
    We maintain that Rogers was well aware of his rights, his right to remain silent, his right to counsel, and his right that -- that he didn't have to say anything that might incriminate him. 
    Even without a warning and even without counsel, he was fully aware of those rights. 
    Now, as to request for counsel, Roger stated from the preliminary hearing that he requested Lieutenant Mulhern asked Lieutenant Mulhern in the afternoon for counsel, for his attorney, and he said that he asked Captain Eagan in the evening for counsel. 
    Captain Eagan went on the stand and said that no request for counsel was made by Rogers that evening and the detective is present in the afternoon, had not reported any such request having been made that. 
    Lieutenant Mulhern was not presented because he was hospitalized on this particular date.But at any rate, you have there a conflict of testimony. 
    Rogers claiming that he has made the request both times, Eagan claiming that he did not make the request of him and that no report of any such request had been made by the officers. 
    The court -- the trial court was called upon to resolve that conflict and it chose to predict Eagan, as that kind of right to do.

    Now, as a matter of fact on the hearing before Judge Smith, we presented Lieutenant Mulhern and two other officers who stated definitely that no request was made by Rogers for counsel at any time in the afternoon and that cover the whole day. 
    But the findings made by Judge Maletz, the accuse did not at anytime on the day of the question request the presence or assistance of an attorney and we submit that on the evidence and on sizing up the witnesses that Judge Maletz was amply justified in making that broad finding.

    Mr. Abraham S. Ullman 
    That's right. 
    Now, some reference has been made, the fact that there was no warning given to the accused. 
    The testimony of Captain Eagan on page 20 -- 101 and again on page 385 indicates that he said that anything -- he told Rogers, "Anything you do say, if you say anything cannot be of any benefit to you. 
    I can promise you no benefit before the jury." 
    Now that warning was not in the precise language that counsel attempted to get. 
    But yet but -- and -- and counsel for the petitioner "limited portion of Eagan's testimony where he says he didn't say in precise words. 
    I didn't tell him he didn't have to say anything." 
    But I say that these words or words that were understood by Rogers and acted upon by it. 
    But in addition to that, before Judge Smith, Rogers testified that he was told by Captain Eagan that he didn't have to say anything. 
    On page 28 of the transcript, we'll find where Rogers testimony on direct examination by his own attorney, tell me about the telephone calls. 
    He went to the telephone? 
    No. 
    That's before that. 
    What did he say to you? 
    You sat down and started talking about the time I was in the country jail on parole from (Inaudible) that he remembered me from them and then he said, "You know the words I didn't have to say nothing to me -- to it." 
    He didn't force nothing out of me until he started making a telephone call so that we can't ask for any more qualified witness than Rogers himself that he was in fact told that he didn't have to say anything. 
    Now, as to the threat to which reference has been made, the statement was made by Captain Eagan to Rogers during the course of the questioning that he would have to send for Mrs. Rogers, to find out whether she knew anything of this affair. 
    Captain Egan said that during your time of the jail or before, you might have talked to your wife and I'm under a duty to question. 
    And I'm going to send for her to question and during the time that I sent for her, I'll see that the state warrant which were being boarded with Mrs. Rogers are taken care off by a matron. 
    Now, Rogers didn't raise any objection then that my wife is sick. 
    My wife is crippled. 
    All he said, "She don't know anything about what I do." 
    That same page, the very next question, he said, "She don't know anything. 
    Why do you want to question her?" 
    He didn't protest that she was sick. 
    We claimed that he was fearful merely of what she might say that would be of an incriminating nature -- nature.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    Mr. Abraham S. Ullman 
    He was told not on those precise words. 
    He was told that he would have to send -- he wasn't getting any information from Rogers. 
    He had to question Mrs. Rogers to see whether she could throw any light on this transaction. 
    And he went to pick up the telephone and when Rogers interposed an objection that she don't know anything, he was then permitted to consider the matter for an hour and during that time, he considered whether he should say anything and what he should say.

    Very well, thank you. 
    And so that -- we say that there -- that this possibly could be construed to be a threat if his wife in fact was crippled but there isn't any evidence that she is cripple. 
    The only claim made of that was a belated claim at the trial, not on the night when -- when Eagan suggested a question to him, that she was sick, not that she was cripple, but that she was sick. 
    Now, that Judge Maletz could see her in court everyday and he could see that there wasn't any basis for any such claim as that. 
    So the evidence is all to the contrary and that was all before Judge Maletz. 
    Now, we submit that this threat was not the motivation for the confession. 
    Here, this man was confronted with formidable proof of his guilt of this crime already in the hands of the police. 
    But he had the murder gun the day of the murder, that he made a false report that it was stolen on the day following the murder. 
    He had the murder gun on the night of his arrest and he made these contradictory statements as to how he happened to get it. 
    We say that this confession came about by reason of his own self interest. 
    He wanted to mitigate the plate that he found himself in and so he decided to make a confession but to blame his act on liquor and upon the victim who could no longer defend herself. 
    And his defense with the trial was only in mitigation. 
    And the hour that he took to consider what he should do, whether he should confess, he exercised his mental freedom during that hour to confess or deny. 
    He made the calculated choice to confess and to invent an excuse in mitigation or explanation of this crime. 
    A study of the confessions himself will show that there was no object capitulation here, that this was a carefully considered narrative, 30 pages in length. 
    It shows his self-possession and coolness throughout and it's a dramatic reputation of any claim that he didn't have a choice to confess or deny.

    Mr. Abraham S. Ullman 
    I suppose because he saw that there was some reluctance on Rogers part to have his wife brought down, presumably his wife might be able to make incriminating statements.

    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    Yes, sir and I'll immediately go to it. 
    It's our position that the Supreme Court of Errors stated unequivocally that the test of the admissibility of a confession is whether it was voluntary. 
    That appears at -- at page 222 of the record, said, "Later on in discussing the claims made by the petitioner, the Supreme Court did state that it would depend on the falsity," as Your Honor quite preferably quoted, but it's our position that because of the cases that cites therein, that it was obviously referring to a cause of connection. 
    In other words, our Supreme Court was saying -- I think it's State versus Alcoa.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5102.244" stopTime="5146.495">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible) what about -- what do you say about stating in (Inaudible) which it cites, here again the question for the Court, I'm reading -- I'm sorry I've got the Connecticut report and not the record. 
    On page 174, 142 Connecticut. 
    Here again, the questions for the Court to decide what or whether this conduct in used to defendant to make an involuntary and hence, untrue statements State against Malm 122 Connecticut, 130, 121 and when I go to State against Malm, there it says in so many words have we arguing practically was corroborated which seems -- which is under our standard and are all irrelevant factor of the equation.
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5146.495" stopTime="5154.970">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    There's no other way I can answer the -- the second portion of your question, except to say that it's unfortunate use of the words by Judge Wynn.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5154.970" stopTime="5155.344">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well I don't --

    But --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5155.998" stopTime="5204.180">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    After all, we have no means of knowing what our state court goes on except by the word he refuses. 
    Those are the tools of our profession and those are the means by which a court gives the ground for its decisions. 
    And when it's not only uses it says quite, not false, confess false and inside the case State against Malm which says explicitly in that case every item which confirmed, I do not see what other inferences I can draw except that if a confession is confirmed as to its truth, its negatives or at least undermined and qualified any deduction of involuntariness to be drawn in getting it.

    Mr. Robert C. Zampano

    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    But well, I -- I do think that what the -- Judge Wynn was driving at was a cause of connection on the rules and not the test of admissibility of a confession because prior to that, he said the test is and he states it, the test of admissibility is whether it is voluntary and I would also like --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5232.985" stopTime="5261.114">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well of course he -- that is the ultimate judicial listless paper as it was, but what's contained in the listless paper is what he tells us. 
    Namely, it reacts that way if -- if it's false and as I say, he would lie on State against Malm, which is to me as clear as anything can be in good sunlight that in that case, they relied on confirmation of the statement, isn't that true?
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5261.114" stopTime="5270.746">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano

    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    Well, certainly Judge Maletz applied the proper test and of course that was at the trial level and it's Judge Maletz's decision as affirmed by the Supreme Court of Connecticut that Judge Smith was looking into.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5295.783" stopTime="5312.435">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I had supposed it got the highest tribunal in the state in order to -- for it to determine when it takes the case, the ground on which the case rest, (Inaudible) if the test were otherwise in Connecticut, they would have found it voluntarily.
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5312.435" stopTime="5367.893">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    I believe that the test in Connecticut is as this Court wishes it to be, but the unfortunate use of that time by Judge Wynn is just unfortunate, but the test applied by Judge Maletz is a test that should be looked into in which Judge Smith looked into. 
    Judge Maletz is the one that decided this confession is voluntary and with respect to the -- there was a question asked I believe on the -- in the findings going what was before the Supreme Court I believe. 
    In these findings, and I like to point out at this time that the findings submitted by the State's Attorney which is a normal course of our appellate procedure in the five months, there's no significance. 
    There was no counter finding. 
    I think there were some suggestions that they might have been. 
    There was no counter finding submitted by the attorney before the defendant at the time. 
    And the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5367.893" stopTime="5388.207">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is the -- I do not suppose of what you say. 
    The defendant's counsel if the State gets a verdict and then submits the finding. 
    We do not take exceptions. 
    The defendant can -- it doesn't take exception but he merely makes counter finding. 
    Like you're telling us now as if there were no proposed counter findings, is that right?
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5388.207" stopTime="5441.430">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    On the issue of the -- at the preliminary hearing, the findings of fact that we were talking about by Judge Maletz I believe that there were no counter findings or exceptions or anything else filed by counsel for the defendant, the State's Attorney which under his -- it was his duty to file -- to file findings. 
    Our -- our appellate practice demands it in the federal court, of course if not so, however, at many times, federal judges suppose a counsel to do that, but in our state court, he had to make findings and the court accepted these findings. 
    But the finding of fact was made at the trial when Judge Maletz allowed this confession in. 
    Now, we have never disputed, never disputed Judge Smith's power to reanalyze the historical facts and come up with another conclusion.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5441.430" stopTime="5443.515">

    I think you should.
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5443.515" stopTime="5461.717">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    Well, we believe under the law that Judge Smith could very well, have taken the facts as filed by Judge Maletz, the historical facts and that it was his duty to revalue these facts to come out and see what conclusion he'd arrive at and that is the duty of the federal court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5461.717" stopTime="5487.531">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But we've got to distinguish between what happens and what it means. 
    Those are two very different things. 
    What objectively happened and what it means, those are very different things. 
    And I thought that Brown and Allen meant that there was not to be a reexamination of what happened, but there was to be indeed under the essential constitutional question what it means.
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5487.531" stopTime="5555.522">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    Exactly, exactly. 
    In other words, we have never disputed the Federal District Court's power to redetermine the constitutional issue. 
    All we claimed in the Circuit Court of Appeals and in this Court would claim that Judge Smith and any other federal judge cannot disturb the historical facts unless there's some reason. 
    In other words, we use the word "vital flaw" in state proceedings, exceptional circumstances. 
    Judge Smith himself went beyond that and he said, "I must find something in the state record before I can remake." 
    There's a difference between revalue and remake the historical facts. 
    He said, "I must find something in the state record which would warrant me overruling a state trial." 
    So he looked at the state record and he said these issues were fairly and conscientiously tried by an experienced judge. 
    And based on the historical facts as found by this experienced judge, he said that his opinion, the confessions were not inadmissible in evidence.

    I -- I think there -- there was a problem there in -- in determining what the full significance of this Court's per curiam decision was. 
    Professor Pollak gave his view. 
    We gave ours and there's been larger articles written about it and so forth. 
    But I -- I do think that Judge Smith took a very liberal view of his powers and I think it's a -- it's a very good view, in -- in terms of symbols. 
    If the facts A, B and C go to a federal judge and the state trial comes out with conclusion that confession is voluntary based on A, B and C, we say that a federal judge should take A, B and C and see if he arrives at the same conclusion, but he has a perfect right not to.

    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    Absolutely. 
    Now, if Judge Smith also could have said, "Well, wait a minute, you give me facts A, B and C, but I think fact D should be going into." 
    Fine, he can hold a hearing and hear about fact D. 
    Now, if Judge Smith looks at the trial record and says that this -- this state proceeding is tainted with prejudice or that the defendant was not given a fair hearing then he could throw out A, B and C. 
    He could throw it out and say, "I won't listen to it. 
    I don't want -- I won't rule on it. 
    I'm going to hold a hearing de novo." 
    Now, all we're saying is that before a federal judge --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5711.641" stopTime="5716.047">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Or if he hasn't got -- or if the trial isn't documented as in so many (Voice Overlap), isn't it?
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5716.047" stopTime="5762.141">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    Of course. 
    Yes, that's correct. 
    But -- that's quite correct. 
    In this case, of course, the full transcript was there or if there was some -- for example, a vital flaw in my opinion is that very instance where the trial, there's no findings of fact, no historical facts. 
    I think a federal judge must, must hear -- have a hearing de novo or should have. 
    But in our case, he looked at the state trial proceedings and he said the -- that there's no lack of due process. 
    So, he says, "I would disagree if I had to hear the same testimony." 
    But he said Judge Maletz is an experienced judge and so am I inferentially, and I should not overrule him just because we have a difference of opinion.

    The one that I asked Pollak. 
    Under your procedure in Connecticut, is your Supreme Court restricted to the formal findings so that they can travel outside of them, A, as to anything that -- as to which there is no findings, or B, may go to the record, the stenographic minute and say, "This finding is not substantiated by the record.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let me be sure that you get my question. 
    There are 127 findings --

    But on a particular point that seems relevant to the total result for the Supreme -- for your Supreme Court of Errors, there is no finding, may they go to the record and -- and themselves to extract the finding from the evidence?

    In other words, if he has -- using my symbols, he has facts A, B and C and he says to us, "Well, how about fact D?" 
    Then at that -- and we say, "We have no finding on that, Your Honor." 
    Then at that point, I believe he should hold the area.

    That if he can say, "Gee, there was -- here was the testimony of -- of the defendant and as I read his testimony, he reads like a truthful man and there were three policemen and they were too slick. 
    And yet the trial court took the testimony of the three policemen who rejected that of the two seeming defendants. 
    I think I'll hear those witnesses myself." 
    You say he has no right to do that.
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5910.839" stopTime="5927.189">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    He has no right do that, unless -- unless, looking at the state transcript, he finds that there's exceptional circumstances. 
    For example, it's not beyond beliefs that state trier could be prejudice against the defendant. 
    The judge himself --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5927.189" stopTime="5930.530">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Or he refused to allow the defendant to cross-examine the policemen.
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5930.530" stopTime="5930.850">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    Right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5930.850" stopTime="5939.262">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Or he ruled that the policemen's testimony has great presumptive truth value and therefore, you can't cross-examine.
speaker="robert_c_zampano" startTime="5939.262" stopTime="5965.427">
    Mr. Robert C. Zampano 
    Right. 
    And another clear example is this, I think in these instances where the -- the defendant takes the stand and at this preliminary hearings and the judge allows a prosecutor go into the merits of the case, well, certainly, the counsel will keep him off the stand if he thought he could be cross-examined that way. 
    In that case, I think there's a vital lawsuit.

   Rebuttal of Louis H. Pollak

    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    May it please the Court. 
    There are series of issues I'd like to address myself too quickly. 
    Counsel for respondent has said that we filed no counter findings. 
    That was not our posture in the state appellate process. 
    This is a copy of the findings which were filed, a counter findings were filed by the State's Attorney. 
    We were the appellant and the so-called "comprehensive finding by Judge Maletz contains the appellant's proposed finding and adapt of course --

    -- Mr. Ullman's submitted finding.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6002.746" stopTime="6008.394">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- he said he didn't make counter proposal with reference to the question of counsel.
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="6008.394" stopTime="6009.220">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6009.220" stopTime="6011.655">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Not -- not he did say that you may --
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="6011.655" stopTime="6060.244">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    But our -- but our proposed finding indicate as the -- indicates of the State Supreme Court may claim our view on the matter of counsel. 
    With respect to whether the State Supreme Court can go behind the finding, I was remissed. 
    I should have pointed this out in my opening affirmative remarks of the McCarthy case to which I referred, 133 Connecticut of 179 was cited for the proposition that resort maybe had to the evidence whereby thus obtaining a full statement of the circumstances a conclusion of error can be avoided, was cited to the State Supreme Court by Mr. Ullman as recently as this last spring in a case which he argued there Connecticut versus Harris. 
    A case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6060.244" stopTime="6062.466">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I thought they agreed -- they agreed to this proposition.
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="6062.466" stopTime="6181.113">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    Well, good. 
    I wanted to be sure there was no question on this. 
    The Chief Justice inquired when the incommunicado status was lifted and Mr. Justice Douglas discovered the finding relevant to that, I only want to add the Coroner's own testimony at page 261 that he lifted that status as of the following Monday or maybe Tuesday, a day or two later. 
    Coroner -- Coroner Corrigan so testified on page 261 of the record. 
    Justice Whittaker inquired whether there was a possible finding by Judge Maletz that the petitioner was not entitled to be credited on the issue of request for counsel. 
    There was certainly no such finding made by Judge Maletz whether one could speculate that there could be such a supporting finding would be -- bring us purely into the area of conjecture. 
    Justice Frankfurter, I think in his questions demonstrated better than I can the insufficiency of the Connecticut Supreme Court's analysis of the admissibility under this Court's test of a confession. 
    They certainly were applying a truthfully test. 
    And indeed on page 235 -- I beg your pardon, 225 of our record, at the top of that, the Connecticut Supreme Court indicated that it was even up to the jury to determine. 
    I point you to the first sentence of page 225 whether the confession was involuntary or untrue, which supports our view that not only at the State Supreme Court level but at the trial level before Judge Maletz and before the jury. 
    The issue of truth and falsity was intermixed with the voluntariness issue. 
    A point that we have covered at length in our reply brief in which I think tends to show the inadequacy of the state reviewing procedure and the greater and greater momentum behind amplifying the record before Judge Smith.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6181.113" stopTime="6210.595">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Can you -- can you refer to the charge to which the Supreme Court referred when it said -- questioned that the jury have to decide in this connection with whether the impact of the officer's conduct on the mind of the defendant was such as -- was likely result in an involuntary or untrue statement? 
    Would you mind turning to the charge and see the words used by the judge if he tells him to do it?

    -- I thought he did charge.
speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="6219.247" stopTime="6367.207">
    Mr. Louis H. Pollak 
    But a -- but the argument made to Judge Maletz by Mr. Ullman was implicit -- explicit with the -- with the factor of truthfulness. 
    To the extent that the issue that this Court seeks to address itself to is the facts uncontradicted on the state record. 
    I refer this Court to Judge Clark's succinct summary of those facts on the state record at page 49 of our brief. 
    The inadequacy of the state adjudication at the trial and at the appellate level in our view, the inadequacy of that adjudication as to the nature of this coercion -- confessions is -- is at the greatest weight to the view that when this Court denied certiorari to review directly a decision of a state court sustaining a conviction, it -- it is the -- it is incumbent on the Federal District Court to which an application for habeas corpus then goes to make that wider inquiry which will illuminate the insufficient state record, and we think this is what Judge Smith did here in this case at his first attempt. 
    If -- if I may simply in conclusion make two further points. 
    Even the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in its first view suggested the permissibility that some more testimony might be taken before Judge Smith, testimony which Mr. Ullman conceded, I point you to page 38 of our brief, would go to an issue like the request for counsel, which has obtained such importance. 
    Mr. Ullman seemed conceded that on remand before Judge Smith, that -- that Judge Smith was entitled to take testimony on such an issue. 
    In conclusion, it is our view that Brown versus Allen permits the taking of such testimony that Judge Reed -- Justice Reed so said in describing the Speller case as it was processed in this Court and that the judgment therefore below should be reversed with directions from this Court to grant the writ of habeas corpus.
