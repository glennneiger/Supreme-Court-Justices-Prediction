    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Just before the recess, I had called attention to the two sessions before Judge Peirson Hall at which he vacated the plea of guilty, rejected a further offer to plead guilty to the first two counts, denied a motion to return the case to Judge Clark, and then put the petitioner on trial.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I hope I'm not interrupting you, Mr. Solicitor, when I refer to, what I shall refer to earlier, about the understanding of the assumption that 3, 4 and 5 would be dismissed. 
    I certainly wouldn't draw that inference from what took place after the clerk called the Court's attention to it on page 17. 
    The clerk, “Just a minute, don't go, Mr. Sheraton. 
    Mr. Sheraton, we hold thee.” 
    The court, “We're going to hold thee. 
    Mr. Sheraton, hold those." 
    And this would hold the disposition without any word from counsel for defendant.But that doesn't read to me. 
    I don't -- I'm not suggesting -- I don't know what -- if any significance it has but, certainly, one cannot attribute into the significance of an assumed dismissal of the other counts after the plea of guilty to 1 and 2.

speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="270.812" stopTime="328.454">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I think that's some confirmation. 
    The point at which I would agree with Mr. Justice Frankfurter and possibly, disagree with the implication of what Chief Justice said would be this. 
    A court, as Justice Frankfurter implies, acts through orders and decrees. 
    When it's passing sentence, the judge passes sentence. 
    But as soon as we begin talking about what the Court did here and not about impressions people could go away with, then, it seems to me plain that there was no motion and that the Court clearly did not enter an order dismissing these counts and that nothing the Court said could reasonably be interpreted as an order dismissing this count. 
    Now, this goes to the essential difference, I think, between my approach to the case and the position which has been argued by the petitioners and in the briefs filed by the Civil Liberties Union.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="328.454" stopTime="362.318">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And I think you should add counsel of -- it was a short intermission. 
    I don't know what that intermission was about. 
    I don't know what it is about. 
    If I'm to go and sail on the wide, wide ocean of speculation, I could do all sorts of things. 
    I think myself, the sentence -- the whole statute scheme for narcotics is, for me, a form of (Inaudible) 
    I think the sentences are outrageous. 
    I think they are self-defeating. 
    All of which has nothing to do with the spirit in which I must read the record.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="362.318" stopTime="792.033">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    When -- when we come to the orders, as I was saying, I think it's clear that no order was passed dismissing these counts. 
    I think a misimpression was created. 
    Now, here is where I part company with counsel for the petitioner. 
    Their contention, as I understand it, is that, as a matter of law, the promise -- and perhaps as a matter of constitutional law, the promise made by Judge Clark is binding and must have been honored no matter what other circumstances existed. 
    I reject that. 
    I think that's attempting to read into the Constitution. 
    What may be the appeal of a particular and rather extraordinary case, I think, as I shall argue later, that there are no such rules as he relies it. 
    On the other hand, when I first came to this case, it seemed to me that there was a situation here which certainly must have left a deep resentment in the petitioner and which another detached, fair-minded person could say, “This is bad for the administration of justice.” 
    This, in the words Justice Frankfurter used this morning, is unseemly and if this happened very often, it would destroy confidence in the fairness and rationality of justice in our courts. 
    Now, I think that involves an overall view of what happened and particularly, a view of what happened in terms of the final sentence imposed. 
    Furthermore, I don't think that the question is all one-sided. 
    Let me state first, the points which bother me about the trial taken as a whole and then the points on the other side because I think there are some on the other side. 
    The points that bother me are, first, that in any instance, wide divergence in sentences tends to undermine confidence by making the administration of the criminal law appear on part to depend on the whim or caprice of the individual judge. 
    And that danger is certainly much greater when you get a wide divergence in sentencing, the same man on the same indictment by two different judges. 
    It makes it look as if it all depended on who you came before and this is not good for the courts. 
    And third, here, that even though I feel that this representation ought not to have been made, I say that with some diffidence about the District Judge but I do not think it was consistent with good practice, the representation that he would, someday, impose a light sentence. 
    Still, it was made and there is, as with all of us, if the court -- the law does not keep its promises, this, too, tends to throw some doubt upon the integrity of the whole proceeding. 
    Now, if that were all, I'm not sure that I would be here. 
    If Judge Clark -- if Judge Hall, on having the case come before him, had said to the defendant, “I do not feel bound by this promise made by Judge Clark, the courts don't make promises, the courts act through orders. 
    And I feel that this was an unwise expression of opinion made without study of your record, made without learning about the crime, made without an investigation in the sentence. 
    I will give you -- I'm not going to be bound by it. 
    Now, in view of the fact that I'm not going to be bound by it, I will give you an opportunity to withdraw your plea. 
    You can stand on your plea if you wish. 
    If you do, you do it with full awareness that I am going to pass sentence here after an investigation of the facts. 
    If you wish to withdraw your plea, I'll permit you to withdraw it and give you leave to stand trial.” 
    In that case, I say, I'm not sure that I would be taking the position I do. 
    The thing that bothers me the most about this case is that the sequence of events in which it took place makes the whole thing look like an elaborate ritual for going behind the representations made by Judge Clark. 
    And I think that that does a great threat, a greater amount of erosion of confidence in the proceeding. 
    Then, if the judge had simply squarely said, “This shouldn't have happened. 
    I'm not going to be bound by it,” but instead, he forced the defendant to trial without much of any explanation and then, after trying him, imposed the 20-year sentence, four times that originally imposed. 
    And it is the feeling I get that, I can't think of any better way to put it and yet, I'm not happy with the way I phrased it, that it became sort of a mock proceeding for the preordained purpose of quadrupling the sentence without any square acknowledgment of the problem. 
    That troubles me most deeply. 
    Now, even as I say that, I do feel obliged to say that there is a good deal that can be said here in defense of Judge Hall's action once we acknowledge that he was, perhaps, a little abrupt. 
    In the first place, as has been pointed out already, the representations about the five-year sentence were made, apparently, without any real investigation of the case or of the man's previous record. 
    Actually, this involves a very large quantity of heroin. 
    The fifth count alleged in the evidence later shown that there were 10 ounces. 
    10 ounces, allowing for an average addict, would keep 50 addicts satisfied or happy for a month. 
    That's quite a lot of heroin. 
    And a -- the minimum sentence for that quantity of heroin is getting off lighter than the average sentence, which sentence is being imposed rightly or wrongly in the Southern District of California. 
    In addition, this was an instance where Saldana received the lighter sentence by virtue of rushing in to plead before Judge Clark who, I'm informed, does have the reputation of being lenient. 
    Again, surely, there's much to be said in defense of Judge Hall's position that the whole case should be handled by a single judge, and he was insisting on following that practice.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="792.033" stopTime="799.959">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    At the time of the first hearing before Judge Hall, Mr. Solicitor General, it was already clear that the co-defendant had flown the coop, wasn't it?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="799.959" stopTime="832.068">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Not at the time of the first hearing, no. 
    The -- Palomino's counsel had gone in Judge -- before Judge Hall on a motion for a continuance and at that, it was to suit his convenience and neither Judge Hall nor anyone else knew whether Palomino had flown the coop or not. 
    So, I suppose, in saying that he hadn't, I'm not quite accurate. 
    But in any event, not everybody knew it. 
    And it came out only later on the day that he was -- the next hearing before Judge Hall.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="832.068" stopTime="852.455">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But is it -- is it then, accurate to say that at the time Judge Hall, on his own motion, set aside these guilty pleas and refused to accept guilty pleas, that -- that he thought that both defendants were -- that -- that both defendants were going to be tried by him?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="852.455" stopTime="890.486">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    At the time he ordered the case transferred to him, he thought that one defendant was going to be tried before him and that the other, Saldana, should be brought before him for sentencing. 
    At the time he vacated the pleas of guilty, it was known that Palomino had flown the coop. 
    How soon they would catch him was not known, but the qualification Your Honor states should be added to my sentence. 
    I -- but in a sense, Judge Hall was asserting the practice here that when one case had been transferred to him --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- since there's a break in your argument, may I intervene for a minute to ask you to explain an aspect that you think is in favor of what Judge Hall did, if I understood you, that he's a believer, as I think rightly, that one judge should dispose of a case. 
    That would rather indicate that Judge Clark should have pleaded all that. 
    He began this. 
    The case originated before him.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="922.126" stopTime="925.700">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    But there was never any question of the case being tried before him.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="925.700" stopTime="943.609">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, but the -- the general principle, no, but the -- I shouldn't -- I don't think it's very good practice, speaking with my limited experience, to have pleas of guilty -- pleas on some counts before judge 1 and trial of the other counts before judge 2. 
    That certainly is not, as I --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="943.609" stopTime="1051.242">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That's true. 
    Perhaps this would be a good moment at which to explain the practice as it now exists in the Southern District of California because whatever the court may say in the way of opinion, I take it will deal with the general question and that the current practice which went into effect in rules promulgated this January and which only came to my attention yesterday, I'm sorry to say, now lay down that the court will find that the rules were promulgated early in January. 
    The present practice is to have one district judge in the Southern District of California in the Central Division, which is Los Angeles, hold the criminal sessions for a year. 
    So this eliminates the -- which judge choose -- much opportunity to choose the judge before you come into. 
    He handles the docket. 
    If there is a single defendant, and that defendant pleads guilty, then the judge, in the criminal sessions, pass a sentence. 
    That's very easy. 
    If there are two defendants and two plead guilty, the same way. 
    If there are two defendants and the first offers to plead guilty, the court does not accept the plea but then, as how the co-defendant pleas. 
    If the co-defendant pleads not guilty, then the case must be sent out for trial, and I'll come back to what happened to the plea that's in limbo here. 
    The case is sent out for -- all cases are sent out for trial. 
    The judge who is in charge of the criminal session does not try any contested cases.

    -- and routes to petitioner's trials.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1061.010" stopTime="1191.476">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, then, there is a mechanism, which I don't know because no counsel knows exactly what it is, by which the cases are assigned to criminal judges, the other judges in the district by, sometimes, with a system of drawing cards out of an envelope, and no one can tell exactly what judge will get the next case. 
    It's by lot with, I take it, some method of seeing that there is an equitable division. 
    Now, when the case is sent out to another judge where we have one defendant who has offered to plead guilty and one who has pleaded not guilty, the judge to whom the case was sent, not only tries the defendant who pleaded not guilty, but decides whether to accept the plea which was offered of guilty or to -- it could be withdrawn and both defendants put on trial. 
    So, this would mean that from the time the case was sent out, one judge would deal with it entirely. 
    And up to this point, it seems to me that the difficulty that gave rise to this case has now been corrected. 
    There is one little wrinkle that I should add. 
    Sometimes, a situation develops where one defendant offers to plead guilty and the co-defendant is not arraigned at the same time. 
    In that event, the practice is to enter the plea of guilty. 
    But if the co-defendant is brought in a week or two weeks later and pleads not guilty, then the plea of guilty is automatically vacated. 
    This, of course, would not be possible under counsel's contention. 
    The plea of guilty is automatically vacated and the one judge handles the entire case. 
    This is implicit in the rules. 
    The rule does not spell it out exactly as I have. 
    I'm relying on what was represented to me by the United States Attorney that I have every confidence that it's an accurate statement of the present arrangements in the district.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Enlighten me. 
    Why -- why in such a situation, one defendant wants to plead guilty and the other want to contest it?

speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1206.003" stopTime="1243.015">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, I can -- I can only speculate. 
    If they are severed, one would have two -- there would be two disadvantages. 
    One would be, he would create the risk that there would be a divergence in the sentences because they went two different places and judges do have their individual practices in sentencing. 
    Another disadvantage would be that, after all, the judge who does hear the trial will know something more about the crime than one ordinarily knows on a plea of guilty.

    There was enacted in 1960, in the fall, a statute that deals with this problem which provides that in the case of a defendant who is unable to make bail, that when he comes to be sentenced, in passing the minimum sentence, the judge may take into account the time spent in jail --

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    This Court has never had the question to the best of my knowledge. 
    Indeed, there are very few cases that we've been able to discover in the federal courts at all discussing that question. 
    There are -- there is at least one, I think one or two instances, of where a plea of guilty was vacated by a district judge over the objection of the defendant. 
    It's a case cited in our brief, Bielski or something similar to that.

    Well, but I -- before answering that, I revert to one further consideration that I think should enter into this Court's judgment.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    There was enacted a series of events, transfer of the cause, the vacation of the pleas, the trial and then the sentence. 
    All of which, I think, the eye -- to the eyes of the petitioner and to my eyes, creates a very grave danger that somebody looking at this would say this was just an elaborate ritual for getting rid of what Judge Clark did.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2011.998" stopTime="2012.454">

    Well, what --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="2012.454" stopTime="2083.130">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    And I think that it has -- if I might just add one more sentence. 
    I think to have a serious risk that that is to create the impression of the kind of the -- the way justice was administered in this case is a greater danger on the whole and a greater risk on the whole than the risk of setting aside a trial which corrected Judge Clark's mistake. 
    I suppose, in the end, perhaps it comes down to the fact that I would rather err on the side of the too light sentence than err on the side of too much severity. 
    It's -- it's because I have doubt about that and because it perhaps, in the end, comes down to such a very personal judgment that while I felt an obligation to come here and expose the case, I did not want to make -- urge either position on the Court. 
    But as I said to Justice Harlan, if I had the power of disposition, I would send it back for reconsideration in the light of everything that's happened.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2083.130" stopTime="2203.072">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, now, may I analyze your answer. 
    I start out by saying I'm a great disbeliever in severe sentences in any way. 
    I don't believe much in the reformative quality or power or heavy sentences. 
    And I don't think, either, they are necessary for the protection of society. 
    Putting that to one side, I am with you. 
    I -- you can't be too fastidious for me in the comic of a criminal trial by the Government, but we are sitting here as a reviewing court. 
    We've got to review something. 
    Somebody must have done something he shouldn't have done, either because the Constitution or the law or a statute or the exercise of his discretion was improper or unseemly, call it what you will. 
    I don't see that outside of that, we have any power. 
    We can't say it'd be nicer if the criminal -- if criminal administration is full of things that are offensive to me, and I can't say that the exercise of the individual power, I, as a voter on this Court, will say it should be done differently. 
    So, I would like to have pointed out to me someone specific reprehensible conduct, someone specific misuse of power, someone specific utterance by a court relied upon to the disadvantage of a defendant, someone specific choices open to a judge when he should have, in mercy, taken some other choice, and I don't mean if he has filed the 20 years that I can say he should have given him only 18 years or pursued only 5 years. 
    But something else than the operation of the -- of the machinery or the processes of the standards of law not directed toward against this individual, but in the sum total operating in a way that I don't think is good administration. 
    Am I asking for too much?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="2203.072" stopTime="2257.272">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    The -- I'd -- I will like to argue in a minute that you are. 
    But let me address myself in two ways to the question. 
    First, if Your Honor does feel obliged to focus on two -- on a specific item, the two that seem to me to be the best candidates are, first, Judge Hall's denial of the motion to transfer the case back to Judge Clark, which motion was denied after it had appeared that Palomino had left. 
    And at that stage, the element of the same man handling both defendants would not have been in the case. 
    And while I feel surely he had the power to grant or deny that motion, conceivably under all these circumstances, his action could have been said to be an abuse of discretion.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2257.272" stopTime="2262.405">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was Judge Clark in the holding of criminal calendar?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="2262.405" stopTime="2265.830">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Whether he was available for the assignment of criminal cases, I don't know.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2265.830" stopTime="2268.267">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that's why it's necessary for -- it should be taken into account --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="2268.267" stopTime="2268.683">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I take it, he could've --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2268.683" stopTime="2269.781">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- of your answer.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="2269.781" stopTime="2391.079">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I take it, he could've made himself available or had been made available. 
    I take it, also, that the defendant probably would have been glad to wait until he was available. 
    The second candidate, if one must pinpoint a particular error, comes to a more troublesome question, and that is the problem of sentencing because, normally, this Court does not review, in a criminal case, any exercise of discretion of any public defenders. 
    Under these unusual circumstances, it would seem to me that the Court certainly should consider whether it was not a reviewable abuse of discretion for Judge Hall to impose a sentence of 20 years, quite clearly taking no account of the promise that Judge Clark had made. 
    Now, Judge Hall didn't state that he took no account. 
    I must acknowledge that that's an inference. 
    But in view of what he said at the earlier parts of the record, it seems to me that it is a quite plain inference. 
    Now, the reason I said, Justice Frankfurter, a moment ago that I thought it wasn't necessary to point to any particular ruling, my analysis of that is this. 
    That there can be occasions where each ruling goes to the limit, but is within the limit taken by itself but cumulatively, when you get a whole sequence of them, you just feel this has gone too far that looking at anyone, yes, it was within the judge's power. 
    No, we can't fairly say that was an abuse of discretion. 
    But when you get a sequence of them, all going to the limit in the same direction, then it would seem to me that it was permissible for the Court to say, “We just think this adds up to something that we can't let stand.”

    But your -- the gravamen of your difficulties, God knows I am sympathetic with it, I've said earlier that I regard these narcotic sentences as outrageous, but the gravamen of your objection goes to the imposition of the sentence judgment.

    Mr. Solicitor General, may I -- may I suggest this, and -- and it's in keeping with what you have said, but doesn't it fair on this -- on -- on your answer to Justice Frankfurter that before these people went into court, the counsel for the defendant spoke to the United States Attorney, and the -- the United States Attorney, recognizing that he was willing to plead guilty to some phase of this indictment, said to him or indicated to him that in accordance with the practice in that kind of cases, if he pled guilty to -- to two counts of -- of an indictment, of a number of more counts, that that was the end of the situation and that pursuant to that agreement, apparently, both of them went into court and this man pled guilty to -- to two counts of the indictment and the judge, only after he had pled guilty and with the intention of -- of sentencing him at that time, said that the sentence should be five years.

    And there was an agreement on 1 and 2. 
    They went into the court. 
    He pleaded guilty to 1 and 2. 
    And the Court, intending to sentence him, let's say, just on -- on 1 -- 1 and 2, said -- said to him, “I -- I propose to give you five years.

    I thought the Chief Justice -- I was listening for agreement because of the rule that Your Honor mentions, but I thought the Chief Justice, if he mentioned any agreement, it only had to do with the District Attorney saying that if there was a plea of guilty to the first two counts, he would not press the others.

    They are very different for me. 
    The agreement between counsel and the U.S. Attorney doesn't enter into this thing at all, does it? 
    Not at all. 
    If then you -- then you are driven back to saying it doesn't enter it except in his own expectations.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I think that the basic difference, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, between your analysis and the source of my closing judgment as to the right result goes to what seems to me to be the final element of, I'll call it unfairness, unseemliness in this case. 
    I said earlier in the argument, if Judge Hall had squarely said to the defendant, “I am not going to be bound by any agreements. 
    Counts 3, 4 and 5 haven't been dismissed. 
    There was a very large quantity of heroin. 
    You can withdraw your plea to counts 1 and 2 if you wish and stand trial on all of them or you may leave it in effect if you wish. 
    It's up to you.” 
    That I would come down on the other side of the fence. 
    The thing that has troubled me from the beginning, the most, would be a difficult case anyway. 
    The thing that has troubled me from the beginning is that taking into account the final element of sentence, then when I go back and survey the whole thing, it makes a judicial trial in the federal court. 
    They looked to some people and they did to me, after a good deal of laboring over it as if it had been a bit of mumbo jumbo to get rid of what Judge Clark had done. 
    Now, if you take away the sentence, that impression isn't created. 
    But I submit to you that it is an impression of the whole thing and that there are times, not just here but Your Honor will think of many more instances than I, where one judges the quality of what occurred by how it ended up. 
    And there are problems of causation in those effaceable difficulties there, but I think that's what I've been saying to Your Honor. 
    It may be wrong, but that's the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2950.820" stopTime="2959.209">

    You said it very well, but I should say the ultimate reason is that there wasn't enforced a rule of court such as there is now.

    It seems to me that there was evidence from which a jury could find to sail here even on the most strict common law standards. 
    But certainly, that -- this is going to take perhaps more time than I'm entitled to --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3007.918" stopTime="3008.536">

    Alright, take it.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    -- Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3009.287" stopTime="3010.478">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Take your time.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3010.478" stopTime="3110.057">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    There was certainly a contract to sell between the federal agent and Saldana resulting, first, from a telephone conversation and later, from a face-to-face conversation where the agent said, “I want 10 pieces,” meaning 10 ounces of heroin. 
    And Saldana said, “Okay, I'll get,” or something like that. 
    At that stage, there was clearly a contract to sell. 
    Now, the question comes was there -- was there evidence from which it could be found that that was transformed into a sale and by a sale, I have in mind the strict common law definition involving a transfer of the property in the goods. 
    Now, the two things that were required to transfo -- that are required to transform a contract to sell into a sale are, first, an appropriation of specific goods to the contract made by either the buyer or the seller, in this case it would be made by the seller, with the ascent of the buyer. 
    That's an ascent which may be either expressed or implied, and it's an ascent which may be given either before or after the appropriation is made. 
    I won't take time to read it now but if Your Honor will look in Rule 4 of the Uniform Sales Act, you will find that these points are very clearly laid down. 
    It's discussed at more length in Professor Willison's book on sales at Sections 263 and following. 
    Now, let's look at the evidence here.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3110.057" stopTime="3124.091">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    I wonder if we don't, as a matter of -- if everybody doesn't know and therefore, judges shouldn't know that sales of narcotics are probably not handled as commercial transactions are normally are.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3124.091" stopTime="3230.185">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, it would seem to me, it's -- they are handled in a different way, but I take it that the same requirements were transfer of property would be properly looked to, that is the way the lower courts have generally approached this. 
    And most specifically, to accomplish a sale in the normal course, neither payment nor delivery, as Your Honor knows, is a prerequisite, provided that the property is transferred. 
    Well, now, here - here plainly, the petitioner did appropriate a specific 10 ounces of heroin to this contract. 
    He got up from his place on the sidewalk, where he had been with the narcotics agent, went over to this 1958 Ford that came up and got a bag contending 10 oun -- containing 10 ounces of heroin out of it and started back to the federal agent. 
    And the federal agent said, “Is that the stuff?” 
    And the Petitioner said, “Yes.” 
    It's plain evidence that he had appropriated the goods to the contract. 
    Now, is there evidence that the federal agent gave his ascent from which the jury could find this? 
    Because there were no specific instructions on this, none requested, it wasn't really an issue. 
    If Your Honor reads the arguments to the jury, there was no argument about it. 
    Petitioner said, “I made it for sale.” 
    His counsel said to the jury, “There were for sale.” 
    And everybody went on to argue the entrapment point. 
    I would say that the jury could infer the agent's ascent to this appropriation in --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3230.185" stopTime="3231.580">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    To have it thrown at him?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3231.580" stopTime="3232.061">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Huh?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3232.061" stopTime="3234.297">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean that he ascended to have it thrown at him?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3234.297" stopTime="3380.969">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    No, I'm not relying on that much, Your Honor. 
    I agree with you. 
    [Laughs] I didn't -- no, we put no reliance on that. 
    [Laughter] 
    I think that he ascended in advance. 
    The first two transactions, he made a cursory inspection of the heroin. 
    The second transaction -- the third transaction, he may not. 
    He simply accepted what petitioner handed to him. 
    And then, this one, he said, “Have you the stuff?” 
    He -- I think that a jury could find from this that he was willing to have the petitioner make the selection of the goods to appropriate to the contract. 
    Let me put just one example to indicate why I feel sure that neither sale -- neither delivery nor payment should be required. 
    Suppose that I were to telephone the local druggist and were to say “I'm in desperate need of some morphine. 
    Have you got a prescription?” 
    “No, I haven't, but my wife broke her leg. 
    She dislocated her knee and she's in terrible pain and I just must have some morphine to get her through the night.” 
    And he then said, “Well, I'm going out. 
    It will be just the boy here. 
    I've got to hurry off,” and I said, “Well, put up the prescription and I'll be down and get it in a couple of hours.” 
    And he put up the prescription, marked it “Professor Cox” and put it on the shelf and then the narcotics agent came after him for a search. 
    I haven't the slightest doubt that under those circumstances, when neither delivery nor payment, that there were -- you would agree that there had been an appropriation of the goods to the contract and that the sale was made. 
    And indeed, as a matter of commonsense, it should be held to be made. 
    Now, this one, if one were arguing it to the jury, certainly there are very sound arguments that could be made against my position, but I think that the evidence does permit a finding that there was the necessary ascent by the agent to the petitioner's prior appropriation and that this made out the necessary elements of the sale.

    No credit because I don't want this on my book.” 
    I would say there still would have been a sale because he had appropriated the morphine, in my example, to the contract. 
    It's my morphine.

    I -- Well, I -- an example along that line occurred to me when I was thinking about the case. 
    Suppose that we were dealing not with heroin but a -- the sale of infected meat under a statute that makes the sale of it a crime. 
    Suppose I go into the butcher's store and say “I want a dozen lamb chops” and the butcher says “Alright, a dollar and a quarter per pound.” 
    And he goes and starts cutting off the lamb chops and shows them to me. 
    “This is a cash and carry,” the butcher told. 
    He says that -- and I just nod, and then he puts them in the inner wrapping as they do. 
    He puts them on his scales and at that point, the neighbor's dog come and runs off with their chop -- with the chops.

   Argument of Stephen R. Reinhardt
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="3803.309" stopTime="3838.987">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    May it please the Court. 
    There is very little I can see to improve on the Solicitor General's arguments. 
    And in a large measure, we agree with -- with many of them. 
    If the Court does not find that the sentence of petitioner is totally barred by the circumstances of delay in trial and by the double jeopardy arguments and the other issues raised in our brief, we agree that the five-year sentence imposed on count 2 should be affirmed so long as the sentences on counts 3, 4 and 5 are dismissed and that this would be an orderly method for disposing of this. 
    This is --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3838.987" stopTime="3845.946">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    All three? 
    You have to say something. 
    We can't just set them aside. 
    Well, what did you -- what's the basis?
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="3845.946" stopTime="3880.730">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    Well, Your Honor, the basis -- I'm not suggesting that you just do it without an opinion. 
    I think that our briefs and arguments suggest numerous basis, including the supervisory power, as well as double jeopardy which may well be applied if it's necessary to reach that question, as well as an abusive discretion on the lack of power. 
    Now, as far as a vacation of the pleas on 1 and 2 and ordering the defendant to trial, I think that when Mr. Justice Frankfurter asks what is the abusive discretion in this case, that is clearly where we found it. 
    When Judge Hall --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3880.730" stopTime="3882.918">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was clearly where you what? 
    I didn't get the other word. 
    That's clearly where you --
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="3882.918" stopTime="3931.323">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    That's clearly where we -- where we find that abusive discretion. 
    I -- I agree with the Solicitor General that it is found in other places. 
    But I think in this instance, it is clear. 
    The judge did -- Judge Hall did not just say “Well, we'll proceed on the trial with counts 3, 4 and 5.” 
    What he did was vacate an entire disposition. 
    He said, “Let's vacate the pleas on count 1 and 2 and send you to trial.” 
    This, he considered necessary to the trial, not just a trial which could take place, but he felt it necessary to vacate the previous disposition which he believed Judge Clark to have made, and he vacated that entire disposition. 
    We don't believe there's any such power. 
    If there is a power, we urge this is certainly an abuse of discretion. 
    The grounds he gave for this do not justify any such vacation that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3931.323" stopTime="3966.565">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I ask you this. 
    Suppose it's the other way around. 
    Suppose -- suppose Clark had been Hall and Hall had been Clark, and suppose Clark had given 20 years and then, when it came before Hall, mild Hall not real Hall, mild Hall and he, out of a sense of leniency or sympathy with and disapproval of the heavy offense and said, “Well, if -- if we go to trial, we let it go to trial on the whole.” 
    I don't think you'd be here today, would you? 
    So, when you talk about power.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="3966.565" stopTime="3970.466">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    Well, Your Honor, we do not feel that there is any power to vacate a conviction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3970.466" stopTime="3973.216">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And you think there wouldn't be power -- there wouldn't be power to vacate --
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="3973.216" stopTime="3974.543">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    If we consent --

speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="3974.570" stopTime="3975.383">

    -- certainly.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3975.383" stopTime="3999.689">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Alright. 
    But there wouldn't be power if a judge, out of his sense of fairness, he calls on a plea of guilty misunderstood or misconceived by the defendant as dismissing the others, gave a sentence that he thought was raw and therefore, he wanted to have us the whole disposition before his more compassionate heart --
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="3999.689" stopTime="3999.725">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    If it were --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3999.725" stopTime="4001.220">

speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4001.220" stopTime="4008.628">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    Your Honor, if it were in the interest of the defendant, he would not have the problem of having to do it over the objection of the defendant. 
    This -- this --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4008.628" stopTime="4012.371">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You mean a defendant can play one game or the other, depending how -- what the sentence of the prior judge is.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4012.371" stopTime="4022.469">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    No, Your Honor. 
    When a man is convicted, he may remove the prejudice of -- of being submitted to trial again if it's in his interest by waiving any -- any right to that conviction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4022.469" stopTime="4035.471">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But your argument implied that if you did -- had not consenting, there would be no such power, although the motive, so far as it's going to motive, of the mild Judge Hall would have been the opposite of the severe Judge Hall.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4035.471" stopTime="4102.149">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    Your Honor, I -- we are suggesting that there is no power but -- but clearly, it is an abusive discretion. 
    The grounds given in this case accusing the other judge of having entered into a deal or the appearance of a deal, certainly, there was no basis for the accusation of a deal. 
    As to the appearance of a deal, we do not believe there's any -- this is a circumstance which warrants a vacation to the prejudice of a defendant. 
    And let -- and let me just make clear that Judge Hall was not the Chief Judge of the District at the time. 
    Mr. Cox inadvertently suggested that he was and that this might have given him some inference in the sentence. 
    It was Judge Yankwich at the time. 
    But the -- the purpose is -- the purpose was to -- to permit the increase in sentence. 
    This was the reason for the vacation. 
    This was the reason that he want -- sent him to trial on all five counts. 
    It was in order to increase this sentence and for that reason, we do feel that this be -- the sentence becomes a part of this problem. 
    Now, as to the question of why there was no motion to dismiss, Your Honor pointed out that on counts 3, 4 and 5, all that was said was “hold those”.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4102.149" stopTime="4104.310">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may -- you may continue.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4104.310" stopTime="4125.152">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    Thank you. 
    It -- it is true that there was no motion made. 
    And that -- that the question involves interpretation of the word -- words “hold those.” 
    As Your Honor suggested, under the circumstances of this case, those words could not have meant anything other than that those were to be dismissed at the time of trial. 
    They -- I -- I --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4125.152" stopTime="4127.361">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You make it difficult for me to understand that.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4127.361" stopTime="4128.443">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    Well, I -- I don't --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4128.443" stopTime="4130.938">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You could have -- you could have made that clear by just a few words.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4130.938" stopTime="4131.189">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    I agree --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4131.189" stopTime="4131.633">

    It --
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4131.633" stopTime="4153.528">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    -- I agree with Your Honor. 
    It could have been made clear if there was a necessity, and perhaps there was. 
    Perhaps it should have been made clear that those were held for a dismissal. 
    But in the District Courts, to my understanding, that is what -- what happens when counsel held for dismissal at the time of sentencing. 
    If they were to be tried, they would have been set for trial. 
    There was no -- nobody ever thought they were set for trial.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4153.528" stopTime="4171.502">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You mean -- you mean it is a practice? 
    You talk about rituals. 
    You mean to say that the practice when pleas of guilty are tendered and accepted to counts 1 and 2 and 3, 4 and 5 are to be dismissed. 
    It's the practice to make another proceeding of that at some other time?
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4171.502" stopTime="4172.581">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    No, Your Honor, not another proceeding.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4172.581" stopTime="4173.585">

    That's a little too much for me.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4173.585" stopTime="4205.781">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Let me explain this. 
    If they are -- there's not a separate proceeding. 
    They are dismissed when sentence is imposed. 
    The judge says “Count 1, 5 years, count 2, 5 years, count 3, 4, and 5, dismissed.” 
    It is the sentencing proceedings at which formal dismissal takes place. 
    And that's why they say “hold those.” 
    They don't dismiss part of the judgment apart from the sentence. 
    They are all dismissed as part of one judgment, so that it was the formal dismissal which was delayed by the words “hold those”. 
    It was necessary to do that until the time of sentence when one judgment would be entered.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4205.781" stopTime="4225.170">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Then is this your conclusion? 
    Is it your argument that the Court's acceptance of petitioner's plea of guilty on counts 1 and 2 constituted a judgment covering the whole case, including counts 3, 4 and 5?
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4225.170" stopTime="4242.659">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    The word “judgment”, I -- I cannot say that it constituted a judgment. 
    I can say it constituted a disposition of the case. 
    It constituted a court-approved settlement that the guilty plea situation and -- somewhere over 80% of the cases in the trial court are disposed of by guilty pleas.

    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    It is binding and it is the action of the Court, just as a jury verdict is binding without a judgment. 
    The -- the defendant has been convicted upon acceptance of his plea of guilty. 
    He cannot withdraw, except with permission of the Court. 
    The Court can and should impose sentence upon that -- upon that plea and that he's -- he's removed his discretion.

    Believe me, I followed your argument, and I think that I understand you.

    I'm -- I'm not (Inaudible) this information, the prosecuting attorney and the defendant lawyers get together, go to the judge, and say “Now, we are willing to satisfy -- settle this case on the basis of a plea of guilty with a sentence that's so light."

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that ever done?
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4421.717" stopTime="4423.557">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    -- I would think that that would be improper.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4423.557" stopTime="4424.749">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You think it's improper.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4424.749" stopTime="4438.986">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    I would think so. 
    I -- I don't know of any such practice. 
    And I -- it seems to me that the proper practice is for the defendant and the United States Attorney, the two attorneys, to agree on the number of counts which is satisfactory and then an open court, to go in and --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4438.986" stopTime="4441.563">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I'm not talking -- I'm talking about an open court.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4441.563" stopTime="4447.752">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    To -- well, I think it would be improper because the court is not bound by the U.S. Attorney's view as to sentence and --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4447.752" stopTime="4449.945">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You wouldn't be bound by the agreement.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4449.945" stopTime="4450.776">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    No, no, but if -- if --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4450.776" stopTime="4452.590">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You wouldn't be bound by the agreement.
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4452.590" stopTime="4462.826">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    But Your Honor, if the plea were based on any promises to sentence, I would think that it -- that it would be improper because you would then go -- into court and the judge might change the sentence.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4462.826" stopTime="4465.863">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, a lot of impropriety is committed in this country.

    There is.

    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4467.310" stopTime="4473.695">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There is, but it's rebuked constantly from the bench, and this Court has rebuked it from time to time.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't think the fact, as I asked you about this --
speaker="stephen_r_reinhardt" startTime="4476.058" stopTime="4493.130">
    Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt 
    Yes. 
    I just -- I just want to add one fact, Your Honor, to -- to refute any implication there might be of impropriety here, as far as the two judges, that this case was put back on the calendar before Judge Clark by the United States Attorney. 
    This was no effort by the defendant to -- to do that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4493.130" stopTime="4495.911">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I was remotely suggesting impropriety.

    Yes.

    Appearance is not impropriety.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, Mr. Bernhard. 
    I get the name is so alike. 
    I -- I get to be confused. 
    We always feel comforted when -- when lawyers will undertake these -- the defense of indigent defendants, such as you have and particularly when they carry them through with the diligence that -- that you have. 
    And we express our deep appreciation to -- to both of you. 
    And may I say also, Mr. Solicitor General, that -- that we're deeply comforted also by the very frank, very fair and very generous manner in which -- which you have conducted this -- in this case. 
    And I'm sure that the cause of justice will -- will never suffer when men will undertake the cause of indigent defendants such as you have here and the Solicitor General will be as fair as he has in this case, so we thank you both.
