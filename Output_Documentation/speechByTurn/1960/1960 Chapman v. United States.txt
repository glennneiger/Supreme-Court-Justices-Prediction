    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    Thank you, sir. 
    May it please the Court. 
    I had practically completed my reference to the statement of facts before lunch. 
    There is one other point that I would like to mention and that is that the United States has concluded that this was an oral rental agreement. 
    I do not feel that this is supported by the evidence and by the record in this case. 
    I refer the Court to page 75 of the record there at the -- down in the second answer, the lengthy answer there, "And I fixed him up, agreed to rent it to him and fixed him up a standard 30-day rental contract for the rent and erred." 
    I don't believe the evidence supports that it's an oral, although I do not know that that is too significant in this case.

speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="66.883" stopTime="112.023">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    I don't think it does, Your Honor. 
    Now, since the decision of the Fifth Circuit in this case, this Court in the Elkins case, overruled the so-called "silver platter doctrine" by holding that evidence obtained by state officers which would have violated the constitutional rights of an individual, if it had been obtained by the federal officers, is not admissible in the federal court. 
    So I think this would dispose of the -- any question that might come by the fact that a state agent first entered this house and that the federal agents were immediately called into the case, the silver platter doctrine question is disposed of.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The Court of Appeals didn't rely on this silver platter doctrine at all, did it?
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="115.602" stopTime="225.450">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    No, the Court of Appeals stated in their opinion that they were not relying upon it. 
    That is correct. 
    Although the United States never questioned specifically the standing of petitioner as a lessee of these premises, the trial court did hunt as such. 
    However, we feel that this question has been put at rest by the recent decision of this Court in Jones from District of Columbia. 
    There are two recent cases, Jones cases that I will refer to. 
    One originated in Georgia and one in the District of Columbia and I will refer to them as such. 
    I make reference now to the Jones case from the District of Columbia. 
    In other words, in the Jones case from the District of Columbia, if anyone is legally upon the premises, then he has a standing to assert his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment. 
    In view of these two recent decisions of this Court, this leaves only one question open to the Court at this time and that is, was this search and seizure reasonable under these circumstances? 
    Now, I would like to mention some general principles before proceeding further. 
    First, a search and seizure cannot be separated as intimated by the United States in their brief. 
    They cannot be considered as two separate things. 
    They must be considered together, the search and the seizure. 
    You cannot say that one part is the search and the other part is the seizure. 
    That has been very clearly set forth in the decisions of this Court. 
    This Court has also held that a search warrant is necessary in all instances.

    Well, what specifically I am referring to is this, that search is a functional, not merely a physical process and it's not completed unto -- until effective appropriation as part of an uninterrupted transaction of a -- of illicitly obtained objects or subsequent proof of an offense to -- to differentiate between participation from the beginning and joining before the search runs its course, would draw two final line.

speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="311.285" stopTime="328.643">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    That is correct and that had to do with the silver platter doctrine. 
    However, the language there and also in the -- the Jeffers case.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="328.643" stopTime="337.860">

    I know the wrong prentice, but they are wrong conclusions.
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="357.100" stopTime="1211.653">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    As a general principle, it might be said that a search warrant is necessary, except when you have a search incident to a lawful arrest. 
    Now, that maybe with or without an arrest warrant or -- or either in exceptional circumstances. 
    And if the burden is upon the Government to show the need for searching premises without a warrant and we feel that they have not shown any need, any compelling circumstance that would require them to search these premises before obtaining a warrant. 
    I think another general principle that is important to us today is that evidence found after the entry cannot be used to justify the entry nor can theories that have been conceived in the attorney's office or in the law enforcement offices, some months or years after the entry was made, be of any assistance in any way to justify a search without a warrant. 
    It would depend upon the particular facts and circumstances available at that time. 
    In view of the contention of the Government which I anticipate, I think that that perhaps would be of importance to the Court. 
    Also, the Fourth Amendment applies to those justly accused as well as to the innocent. 
    It is a constitutional guarantee. 
    Now, getting back to this search which was a search without a warrant, either an arrest warrant or a search warrant, it was a search made not incident to arrest. 
    It was a search made on the circumstances where no boat or automobile was involved that might get away. 
    There was no compelling circumstance here. 
    There was no activity, either of a person or a thing in this house at that particular time, and there were sufficient people available so as to guard the house. 
    And I say that in view of the Agnello case and the Jones form the Fifth Circuit case and the Taylor case and the Jones case, those four decisions of this Honorable Court have held that probable cause, however well-founded for belief that certain articles subject to seizure are in a dwelling house, cannot of itself justify a search without a warrant, even in circumstances where the facts unquestionably show this probable cause. 
    And in this particular case, there was only one indication, possible indication of a violation of the law and that was the smell of mash emanating from the house. 
    Now, the framers of the Constitution concluded or I should say, included the Fourth Amendment in our Constitution because they had learned though sad experience that the decision to search a house should not be left to the discretion of the police. 
    But as a matter of principle, if the question must be subjected to the requirement of a previous judicial sanction wherever possible, by that is meant that there must be some compelling circumstance of some type before a law enforcement officer has the right to make the decision to search premises without a warrant. 
    Now, there are five decisions of this Court that I would like to refer to now which deal with situations where there is no warrant, no arrest warrant, no search warrant and the search is made not incident to arrest. 
    The first is the Jeffers case. 
    Now, in that case, there was a search of a hotel room. 
    This was held to be illegal, although there were many indications of a violation therein. 
    In other words, there were noises and peeping through the keyhole and other indications emanating from the premises. 
    And there, the petitioner was an invitee, but nevertheless, he had the proper standing to assert his rights under the Fourth Amendment. 
    I think it also important there to see that the facts of that case show that before entering this hotel room where no one was present and without warrant, they had permission from the manager of the hotel who was the agent of the owner. 
    They even were provided a key through the room by this manager, but in that case, the owner did not strip this individual of his rights under the Fourth Amendment. 
    In the Jones case from the Fifth Circuit, there was a search of a house without a warrant, without a proper warrant. 
    In that particular case, they had obtained a daytime search warrant, but did not go into the house until after dark. 
    This Court held that that was -- was an improper search and seizure in that particular case, because even though there were -- there were members of the family of the petitioner in that case in the house at the time, they told the officers before they entered that to wait until the man of the house gets back, but they refused to do so. 
    In other words, they were put on notice that the man that they were after was not in the house. 
    Therefore, their entry was not incident to an arrest, but for the purpose to procure evidence for a future arrest, which is very similar to this case. 
    In that particular case, there were many indications of a violation are still was running in the house. 
    There were blowers which are normally connected with a whiskey's tale. 
    There were tubes coming from the house, hoses with mash running out, spent mash. 
    There were many, many indications and they had even obtained a daytime warrant. 
    But under that circumstance just as here, the officers should not have entered without a proper warrant. 
    In the Lustig case, there, we have a search of a hotel room without a warrant. 
    In that particular case, there again, the agent of the owner, the manager of the hotel called and reported this particular case. 
    I might also mention that in that case, the -- the petitioner was registered under an assumed name, under a fictitious name, which might be important in view of the probable contention of the Government in this case. 
    But nevertheless, it was held that the petitioner did have a standing and that the search was improper without a warrant. 
    In the Taylor case, the officers went to a garage and they smelled whiskey coming from that house and they broke open a door to that garage and went in and found whiskey. 
    This Court held that it's not important whether that garage was part of a dwelling or not, but since there was no one in there at the time and there was no reason for the officers to believe that there was somebody in there, this Court held and quite properly so that the search without a warrant was improper. 
    So there, we have searches of hotel rooms, of garages and we -- in later instances in other cases and I will refer to have the search of barns. 
    In the Trupiano case, that case was a search of a barn. 
    The facts are quite lengthy and I don't think it's necessary for me to go into those in detail here. 
    But in that particular case, the arrest was made -- the entry was made incident to the arrest of one person in there. 
    This Court upheld the conviction of that man, but said that the evidence obtained while in there could not be used as to other men who were later arrested and prosecuted based upon the evidence found at that time. 
    We feel that that's quite important here in the sense that even though it was incident to an arrest, it was not applicable to those people who are not there and who they sought to prosecute on that evidence. 
    Therefore, any cases are not too much in point except for sideline issues such as one that I have just mentioned where they deal with a lawful arrest or entry whether it'd be with a warrant, arrest warrant or without an arrest warrant. 
    In the Joines case, I think that's of interest here in order to round out our development of the case -- that's J-O-I-N-E-S. 
    There -- in that particular case, the officers had a search warrant. 
    They went to the house thinking and for the purpose of arresting someone. 
    As it turned out, the man that they thought was there was not there. 
    They nevertheless, were able to use that evidence because they, in good faith, searched the house, incident to an arrest. 
    Now, in the Agnello case, a house was searched which was far removed from the place of arrest. 
    I think that's important here in rounding out that if it is not incident to an arrest, then you cannot go two or three blocks over, after arresting a man and search his house. 
    In the Rabinowitz case, there we have the search of a one-room office building, which by the way was open to the public and the search was restricted to that one room in which a man was arrested under a proper warrant of arrest. 
    In that particular case, this Court held that the law enforcement officers had the right to properly investigate, to look and to search the premises there. 
    And in that particular case, it was a restricted search and this Court said that that was quite proper under those circumstances, because it was incident to an arrest. 
    Now, the United States Government contends that the landlord was acting to protect his property and that he gave permission for the search. 
    We do not feel that the decisions that we have mentioned and we'll go into more detail on support any such contention. 
    Not only do the case is not supported, but the facts of this case do not support it. 
    In this particular case, the owner of this house went to the house, smells some mash emanating from the house. 
    And this is the way the facts are framed up and I think this is most important. 
    Instead of going immediately and calling a law enforcement officer, a general law enforcement officer to come out and help me protect my property, he didn't do that. 
    He went and attended to some social business, made some social calls and then after a while when he returned to his house, he didn't' call the sheriff's department or the general law enforcement agents. 
    He called the state revenue agents and he said this, "If you will come out here, I will show you a still and you'll have to get here by such and such of time, because I'm going to busy after that." 
    And then the officer did come out and picked up another officer and came out and made the search. 
    Now, those facts are important to show this. 
    That the owner of that premises had in mind the enforcement of the liquor law and there's no indication whatsoever, but much to the contrary that he did not have in mind protecting his property or keep -- to keep waste from being committed. 
    Now, the decisions that I spoke of in the Trupiano case, the owner of that property, even drove the officers out. 
    He was present with them. 
    He had worked with the officers and drove them in his automobile out to the place before the search was made. 
    Therefore, that case would not support the contention of the Government. 
    Now, in the Jeffers case as I have mentioned, the officers got the key to the hotel room from the manager and got his permission and the manager therefore, is the agent and the proper agent of the owner. 
    In the Lustig case, I'll mention again, the manager of the hotel called and made the report and beckoned the officers to come, very similar as to these instances. 
    We think that the facts of this case clearly show that this owner was not trying to protect any civil protection or afford himself several protections, but was interested in the enforcement of the criminal law. 
    And we say that an owner --

    The -- under the federal forfeiture statutes, any property whatsoever, which is used in the violation of the law, then the owner loses all property rights in that particular item. 
    For instance --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I'm not talking about the premises in the outset. 
    I'm talking -- the owner -- the owner of a -- of a let house who has excellent or good reason of believing its use is that of a still, has he no right of entry?
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="1614.881" stopTime="1622.417">

    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    I understand, but there is such a large group of people who have the same interest of ownership such as a mortgagee on a house or the various owners for instance, the United States Government, I would say, is the biggest owner of residential real estate in the -- in -- of -- of any -- anyone that we might find and let's take, although we have other large corporations, let's take the United States Government. 
    If this case is not reversed, then the United States Government through its various agencies would have the right to strip anyone who lives in a house provided by a public authority of the constitutional rights of that individual.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1667.811" stopTime="1689.599">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, but you're stating that to beg the question, if I follow you, don't you? 
    The question in very specifically, whether the owner of premises having good reason to believe that it is being used for a still has no right of entry, nor if he makes a bad guess, he maybe in trouble.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, now, isn't the great distinction between possessing a right of entry and -- on the one hand and the right to do it by strong-arm methods.
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="1709.361" stopTime="1792.441">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    I -- I think so and in this particular case, it seems that the Government in their brief, distinguishes between locked doors and whatnot. 
    I understand breaking and entering to raise a closed window and not necessarily to break a lock. 
    But in this particular case, I think we do have exactly that, strong-arm method. 
    And I further think that the evidence clearly shows that there was no intent -- the -- this landowner, he -- what he did just like any other citizen, reported what he thought was a violation of the law and turned it over to the officers for them to do what was required of them. 
    And in this particular case, it was required of the officers to obtain a search warrant and not to take it upon themselves. 
    As a matter of fact, when they asked for permission, "Can we have permission to go in this house?" 
    The owner says, "Well, if what's in there what I think it is, you can go in." 
    In other words, the matter was in the hands of the liquor officers, not the general enforcement -- law enforcement officers. 
    This -- this owner even though he was the owner, simply was reporting what he thought was a violation of the law to the liquor people just as any other citizen could or would have done in --

    Well, that -- that all depends on the answer to Justice Black's question, what right of summary termination of a nuisance is there.

    Mr. Robert S. Erdahl 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First, Mr. Justice Stewart asked about the orders mentioned that the Court of Appeals did not rely on the silver platter doctrine. 
    I just want to point out that it did not -- not only did not rely on it, it disclaimed any reliance on it. 
    It's pointed out that the Elkins case was at the time pending here and it does not in particular, forecast the result. 
    I should also like to point out that there was no and heard and whatever the silver platter in the District Court's oral ruling of nine motions to suppress. 
    The Court -- the District Court pointed to the fact that this house was not a dwelling, not used -- as though the dwelling house was not used as a dwelling, rather it was used as a manufacturing establishment that it was Sunday, that there was probable cause. 
    And finally and most importantly, there is a specific finding by the District Court that the owner, Bridgaman, the landlord, told the officers that he had reason to believe that there was a still in his house and not only consented, but asked the officers to go in and see about it. 
    In its opinion on rehearing, denying petition for rehearing, the Court of Appeals said they did have in its opinion of affirmance, emphasized -- I'll read it, "In view of the emphasis we -- which we've placed on the fact that the entry was a Bridgaman's request, we think it's appropriate to answer petitioner's contention that the Court placed too much emphasis upon Bridgaman's request and the Court alluded to the testimony of Chance, the state revenue agent. 
    Question, "And did the owner, Mr. Bridgaman tell you to go in there and see about it and see what was in his house?" 
    Answer, "That's right," and the Court said, "The trial court so found" that is found the consent and request and that the evidence amply supported the finding. 
    Before I leave that, I would like to also point to the testimony of -- the further testimony of officer Chance which the Court will find on page 13 of the record. 
    This one sentence in his testimony sums it all up very neatly. 
    He was asked about why he didn't get a warrant. 
    He said, it was Sunday, "Well, can't you get a search warrant on Sunday?" 
    He said, "I've never gotten one on Sunday." 
    "You didn't make any attempt to get any search warrant, did you?" 
    Then Chance answered this -- this way, "Well, I didn't feel no call to get one. 
    The man that owned the house, he was there and he told us to go in, in the window" and see what's -- what in there, and that should be -- what's -- printing error, what's what or what was in there, so he went on in. 
    Now, that puts the issue here in focus. 
    My opponent says that this has -- but another case of and a -- a police entry into protected premises upon probable cause without more and he -- he called the rule of the cases. 
    He would have it that -- the fact that Bridgaman, the landlord was there and as the District Court found, not only consented, but requested that the officers go in and have no consequence. 
    Now, we say that Bridgaman's presence there and his authorization makes all the difference in the world. 
    I feel like I can fairly say that if he had not been present and given his authorization, if the police had on their own gone in, we would not be here today.

    His pastor asked him to call on a certain family and Bridgaman said, "Well, some new tenants have moved into my house down on the Herbert Smart Road and I will call on him and then I'll call on this other party. 
    He did -- he went down to the house and -- I think the best thing to do is read it, "So we went down there," currently on another parishioner is whether --

    Page 72, excuse me. 
    So we went down there to my house to visit these people and they had shades up to the windows and all of the shades was down, but we knocked at the door, nobody come to the door, so I smelled an awful scent around there and I just note what it was by smelling it. 
    I smelled it before I got to the house and I walked around the house. 
    It has a basement in the bottom and not closed in, just an open basement. 
    I looked in there and wasn't -- nothing in there and so, we went on the back and made this other visit. 
    And I went to the house and I picked up the telephone and I called the officers and told them what I thought as there. 
    And they said, "We'll -- well, if you stay at the house, we'll be there in 15 minutes." 
    Now, let's go back to Chance's testimony. 
    He's the revenue agent who Bridgaman called, the state revenue agent. 
    Chance said when Bridgaman called him, he said that if you --

    -- got there by 5 o'clock -- this is page 8, excuse me. 
    If you got out there by 5 o'clock, he would carry me and show me a still. 
    Chance picked up Harbin, a county policeman who has, under Georgia law, the powers of a sheriff. 
    And en -- en route, Chance -- or Bridgaman told them that he owned the house. 
    He went down there to invite the newcomers to church and he found out there was a -- that's the bottom of the page. 
    And he found out that there was the still in there and he came back and called us and went with us down there. 
    Harbin's testimony is to the same effect. 
    He is the county -- the county policeman. 
    And then when they got there, the conditions were still the same, nobody there, all quiet around the house, shades down. 
    And incidentally, -- my opponent had referred to the pictures that are with the exhibits. 
    He asks if it's true, there are interior and exterior views.

    Mr. Robert S. Erdahl 
    There are interior and exterior views, pictures in the -- with the exhibits and they show how -- the interior views show how tight the -- the shades were drawn and they even showed that there was a shade tucked up over the little glass windows at the -- in the upper portion of the front door. 
    Everything was closely shaded so that nobody outside could see inside. 
    And incidentally, in that connection, I want to say that this is a -- obviously, a -- a house designed for dwelling, yes. 
    It's a -- it's a modest one-room house -- one store, one room -- one-storey house appears to be built of cinder block. 
    And I want to also point out that this was not a city street. 
    This is a -- this is a rather secluded location close to this --

    It's a rather secluded spot and I think that -- it's -- that's obviously the reason Chapman --

    Mr. Robert S. Erdahl 
    It was not, no, by Chapman, this petitioner. 
    No, it was used only for a still. 
    That's the only thing there was in the house. 
    It's a small house, living room, dining room, bathroom, kitchen, a couple of bedrooms off the side, one storey. 
    And the still was set up in the living room. 
    And with the baths, it was 650 gallon still, the bath held 1300 gallons of mash. 
    They had the water -- water connections running into the bathroom. 
    There was a pump nailed to the dining room floor. 
    One of the partitions has been torn out and a bathroom partition torn out, before Bridgaman's house was pretty seriously damaged.

    Mr. Robert S. Erdahl 
    Well, there are Georgia statutes which are relevant on this question of reasonableness which I had related. 
    They're part of the total picture particularly as the nuisance provision and -- and particularly under the statute on -- on Bridgaman's rights as a landlord. 
    He obviously thought that he had a right to go in as he did.

    And so as Mr. Justice Frankfurter points out, it boils down to whether this was reasonable action.

    Mr. Robert S. Erdahl 
    And that -- that, I agree. 
    And as I've said, this was in substance and in principle, an entry by Bridgaman. 
    But let us assume that he overstepped his rights in the manner in which he exercised his rights. 
    The cases in this Court had not allowed the admissibility of evidence to turn on such technical wrongs, civil wrongs. 
    I refer to Burdeau against McDowell, the case in which McDowell's papers were taken out of his office by private persons without his authorization and the Court said that -- and they were turned over to the United States Attorney for prosecutions, for presentation to agree in jury. 
    The Court said, "We're not going to stop to consider the wrong done to McDowell or what his rights or remedies maybe against the wrongdoer." 
    In the McGuire case, the agents had a warrant, search warrant, for liquor and when they executed the warrant, they kept to court and destroyed all the rest and it was claimed that this made them trespasser ab initio, because the destruction, their act of destroying the liquor was illegal and the Court agreed to before it and oppressed it. 
    But the Court said, "This doesn't affect the validity of the search for and the seizure of and retention of the Court be kept." 
    They said that was valid, that was distinct from the civil wrong, the wrong done in destroying. 
    And more recently, in On Lee, the Court reiterated that principle. 
    It was their claim that you recall, that was the case of the informer who went in wired the sound, radio transmitter into On Lee's Laundry and engaged them in conversation, he was a friend of On Lee and On Lee made the incriminating statements, which were picked up on the radio and heard by an agent outside who had the receiving sense. 
    And it was contended there that on -- the informer was either a -- a trespasser ab initio or he was a trespasser when he went in, because the entry was fraudulent as against On Lee. 
    And the Court said there that the McGuire case controls the question and that what -- whether -- whether the informer's conduct was unlawful or not, this did not affect the Government's right to use the evidence. 
    And I think that this case is an even stronger case for the application of that principle because there, the informer who was guilty of betraying his friend's confidence was acting under the auspices of agents who sent him in wired for sound. 
    Here, the officers wrecking under the auspices of the landlord who had no ulterior motive, whatever.

    Mr. Robert S. Erdahl 
    That's true. 
    But this was Bridgaman's house and he had rights of entry as a landlord. 
    Now, I think we can test -- test the question this way, test the principle. 
    Supposing -- let us suppose that Bridgaman in good faith, on his discovery, had resorted to self-help or -- or had gone and gotten some of his friends to help him and he and his friends went into the house the same way. 
    There would be -- Chapman would have absolutely no right to complain of his discovery -- of Bridgaman's discovery of his Chapman's still, in Bridgaman's house.

    He went to get the police. 
    He went to get the police to protect him and to aid him in the exercise of his rights.

    That's all there were, that was in this house, that -- that still and those mash beds, but to get back. 
    Let -- let's suppose that when they -- when they got to the house, the officers -- and Bridgaman says, "Go on in" and the officers emerged and said, "Well, I don't know of whether we can go in, but you can go in or maybe you can go in as landlord." 
    And let's suppose, instead of Harbin being boosted through the window, Bridgaman had been boosted through the window.

    I say that only for the proposition that it -- those cases should be taken cared of, if they should arise and on the basis of the particular evidence because after all, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggested a while ago, "In all these questions, you always come back to the question of reasonableness, in all the circumstances."

   Rebuttal of J. Sewell Elliott
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="5918.644" stopTime="6017.538">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    May it please the Court. 
    I think we have discussed the number of aspects in all of the aspects of this case. 
    I do however think, it is most important to consider that we must construe the rights of a tenant in this case, as opposed to the rights of a homeowner. 
    And I do not think that because a man rents his house that he should use -- lose any of his constitutional rights such as under the Fourth Amendment to contest or to ask that certain evidence be suppressed, simply because, he is the tenant in the house, rather than the owner. 
    I cannot -- that does not set well with me. 
    I -- I'm wondering if this case is not reversed. 
    If the house is owned by the United States Government, if the federal agents couldn't just go in on the same basis that the Government claims that Bridgaman can -- could go in under this case. 
    And would it not be stripping away the individual rights of those tenants in the various housing projects throughout the country. 
    I -- I think that it is -- would be too far reaching and would really be a question that this Court is not going to allow, the rights of individuals to be stripped away in that manner.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6017.538" stopTime="6038.802">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you. 
    Have you cited any cases which showed -- tell the -- what is the Georgia law with reference to the right of a landlord to enter a house, if he finds that the law had been violated in it, in a way that may entail some kind of guilt and -- and put some kind of guilt on him?
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="6038.802" stopTime="6045.229">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    Alright. 
    I have -- I'd like to refer to the two statutes and I think that's all there is under Georgia law that we've already referred.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    No cases of any kind?

    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    58 Ga. Code 109.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6049.192" stopTime="6049.990">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I have that code.
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="6049.990" stopTime="6078.106">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    It -- it says -- it reads as follows, "Common nuisance, places defined as the following are hereby declared to be common nuisances and maybe abated as such upon complaint of the Attorney General or the Solicitor General of the circuit or any citizen or citizens of the county." 
    And then it goes on and refers to a room used for the manufacture of unlawful -- unlawful manufacture of whiskey.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6078.106" stopTime="6082.784">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So that this was, if it was being used for that purpose, a nuisance under Georgia law.
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="6082.784" stopTime="6088.787">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    Yes, in other words, a person, a landlord or any other person must go into court if--

    Now --

    -- stand.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6095.077" stopTime="6106.286">

    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    I think it's very possible that the Court would consider or in any action to takeaway his property, to condemn and takeaway his property, I think they could consider that factor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6118.039" stopTime="6142.932">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I have before me, one of the cases cited. 
    It says, "They have considered it and having reached the conclusion that he had knowledge of it, that they had refused to let his house be unpadlocked when it was padlocked as a nuisance under the statute. 
    That's the -- under the 96 Ga. Code 802.

    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    No, not -- not in our brief.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6180.342" stopTime="6182.723">

    Under federal law. 
    It could be if it's used for illegal purposes, it could be forfeitable and it --

speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="6188.860" stopTime="6213.221">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    And -- and in an instance, where a landlord fails to report something, he could be therefore, considered a conspirator to the extent of entering into the operation or harboring a criminal activity and therefore subject -- subjected to the penalties that would come to anyone who participated in any such action. 
    I would also like to refer to the --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="6213.221" stopTime="6221.220">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    May I ask you please sir, as he -- may I ask you please, sir? 
    Has he discharged his full duty when he has made the report?
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="6221.220" stopTime="6294.999">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    Yes. 
    I believe that in this particular case, what we have is this. 
    Now -- let -- let me make one or two background comment. 
    The Government says they could've entered to collect rent. 
    Well, now I -- I don't know what that's got to do with this case. 
    In -- in other words, a man -- a landlord goes to collect his rent and he knocks on the door and nobody's there, what is he going to do? 
    Go into bathroom window and find the pocketbooks and collect his rent? 
    I don't think that that's the case. 
    I think it has no applicability here. 
    And getting back to your question, Justice Whittaker, I will say this that I think that this man actually just as any other citizen when it came to his attention that -- that he thought the law was being violated there, he made a report not to the general law enforcement officers, but to the liquor agents. 
    And when he made that report and told them, "If you come out here, I'll show where it still is," I feel that he had fulfilled his obligations. 
    I feel that from that point on, it was within the hands of the officers and the officers should have known what to do and it -- the law clearly says what those officers should do in the abatement of an action.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="6294.999" stopTime="6302.840">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, under your law, could they, the officers, derive any author -- entry authority from him, the landlord?
speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="6302.840" stopTime="6354.436">
    Mr. J. Sewell Elliott 
    Not -- not to the extent of breaking and entering. 
    There are no provisions that I know of on the -- in the codes of Georgia, in the law of Georgia to allow it. 
    Turning to the common law, there is no provision there to allow any such entry to the extent of breaking -- of breaking a window or a door. 
    And by breaking the seal on this house, by opening a closed window is very clearly a breaking and it is not permitted by -- by federal -- by common law and there is no provision under state law for any such action that was -- as was done here. 
    This was simply -- very clearly, a report to the officers by a citizen that I think the law is being violated and turning it over to the officers to take the proper action.

    Even though property rights would have been lost, either under this Georgia statute that is quoted in the brief of the Government, I think that that would not strip away from his -- him his constitutional rights. 
    I also asked the Court to please, if they consider the quoted Section 58 Ga. Code 106 that they also consider the Section 58 Ga. Code 101 which is referred in that Section, but is not quoted in the brief of the Government.

    There's no indication that the landlord exercised any or -- or option to forfeit the rights of this tenant.

    There is no -- there's nothing in the Georgia law to permit this landowner to do what he did. 
    I further say that I do not agree with the contention of the Government that -- in other words, they present this argument. 
    They say that the landlord actually went in and took the -- the agent with him. 
    I don't interpret the facts and I don't think the facts support that conclusion. 
    I think, at most, what it was, it was a report to the liquor agent that I think I know where you can find the still and he helped them locate it. 
    And at that stage of the game, it was turned over to the officers and they should've known exactly what to do and that a warrant was required. 
    Also, it was a case of going around the house. 
    The Harbin, who is the officer who entered, went all the way around the house, tried all the windows until he found one that was unlocked and that one he went into. 
    I also would like to point out that this house or the evidence clearly shows that the house was not back in the woods to such a -- to such an extent that it could not be clearly seen.I 
    t was a little longer than the length of the courtroom in the -- in the trial court from the road. 
    It could be clearly seen from the road. 
    It was not hidden back in the woods as a still house might be. 
    And I want to thank this Honorable Court for your indulgence in the presentation of this case. 
    Thank you.

    Gentlemen, as to the next case, I think it would serve no purpose to -- to start at this late -- late moment. 
    We will start fresh on it Monday morning. 
    We'll recess now.
