    This is an action involving an application by Grant County, Washington to impress upon the deposit of estimated compensation in a condemnation case alleged tax liabilities or taxes against a leasehold. 
    Now, all that we have in the condemnation case is a condemnation of a leasehold, not a condemnation of buildings. 
    This case involves what is known as a Wherry housing project.

    Mr. Lyle L. Iverson 
    A Wherry housing project. 
    It arises under Title VIII of the Federal Housing Act and a Wherry Housing Act -- Wherry housing project operates this way. 
    On a military reservation, a lease is given for a period of 75 years and the -- the sponsor that is -- that's the terminology, the sponsor corporation erects the buildings and then leases them to tenants assigned by the military commander for that period of 75 years. 
    He is financed by an FHA guaranteed loan. 
    Now, in this case, Grant County levied taxes against this property. 
    In their listing of the property, they designated it as buildings on the military reservation. 
    Actually, the Circuit Court of Appeals has had some discussion of this question, and the Court has held that notwithstanding that they designated buildings, that they were really trying to tax the leasehold. 
    But the Court, the Circuit Court held that this -- some of this --

    If the Court please. 
    We have three corporations here, each which has a separate Wherry housing project, and they have these 75-year leases. 
    Grant County, Washington in -- in which Moses Lake -- Larson Air Force Base is located, undertook to assess personal property taxes against these buildings. 
    Now, by the terms of the lease, which rendered for 75 years, buildings immediately upon construction became the property of the Federal Government, and Grant County undertook to assess the leasehold upon the basis.

    It's 75-year old --

    That's correct, Your Honor --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- leasehold.
speaker="lyle_l_iverson" startTime="210.611" stopTime="750.282">
    Mr. Lyle L. Iverson 
    Upon the basis of the valuation of the buildings. 
    Now, we have approximately $6 million in mortgages outstanding against the property. 
    They assessed the property at a figure which if we disregard equalization figures and so forth would -- would put these -- put the market value at approximately $2 million. 
    Now, the Government, in condemning this property, paid in as estimated compensation, $253,000. 
    Grant County sought to obtain actually more money than the total amount paid in by the Federal Government. 
    The lower court, in this case -- the application was made by Grant County to impress their tax lien against this estimated compensation on the ground that the -- that a lien rested against the leasehold, therefore, the estimated compensation being substituted for the lien and became substituted for the estimated compensation. 
    The lower court found and the Circuit Court of Appeals has concurred in the finding that the proceeding followed by Grant County in this matter was discriminatory against a contractor with the Federal Government. 
    Now, this is the reason for that holding in Washington. 
    We have a statute that provides, this is R.C.W. 84.40.030, it's cited in my brief and it's in the appendix, "Taxable leasehold estate shall be valued at such price as they would bring at a fair voluntary sale for cash." 
    Now, you know of taxable leaseholds. 
    They're especially -- they're especially covered by statute. 
    In a long line of cases in Washington known as the Metropolitan Building Company cases, the Washington Supreme Court has construed that statute with respect to all leaseholds held from the State. 
    And in those cases, which involved state-owned land in the heart of Seattle under 50-year leases, it was sought by the public authorities to tax them upon the basis of the value of the improvements on the property rather than the value of the leasehold as someone would buy it and let someone would pay for it, and that -- those contentions were rejected four times by the Washington Supreme Court. 
    And I set out the cases in my brief. 
    And the Court held in that case that in Washington, in taxing a leasehold, the leasehold must be taxed on its -- on a reasonable market value what a willing seller -- what a willing -- what a willing seller could obtain from a willing buyer considering the burdens and benefits. 
    And the Court said that a purchaser would take it (Inaudible). 
    And that if there was a large mortgage against the property that that mortgage would be taken into consideration, and the method of taxing all leaseholds in Washington, all other leaseholds in Washington, is well-established and that is what would a willing buyer to take -- pay to a willing seller, considering the encumbrances, the burdens and benefits. 
    Now, when we got to this matter of the Wherry housing projects, it had considerable litigation over this and the first of these -- these three corporations to be organized were Moses Lake Homes, Inc. and Moses Lake Homes, Inc. obtained, in 1954, an injunction against the efforts of the County to levy upon the buildings as they were -- that's what they were listings, the buildings which were, by the terms of the lease, Government property. 
    And that injunction remained in effect until 1957. 
    And so or -- the taxes levied in 1955, 1956, 1957 were all held up the administrative proceedings while that injunction was in effect. 
    Then about that time, this Court decided a case served as the warehousing case, Offutt Housing Company versus Sarpy County, which is cited -- citations in the brief, in which this Court held that in Nebraska, a Wherry housing project could be taxed at the value of the -- of improvements on the property and the Washington court, having this before it, rather blindly followed that decision of this Court and said that they were bound by the -- for the sake of uniformity and so forth they would follow the decision of this Court and, therefore, a Wherry Act housing project in Washington in this case would be taxed at the basis, that was the leasehold, will be taxed on the basis of the value of the improvements. 
    Now, that might have been alright in Nebraska, but in Washington, that is precisely what the Washington Supreme Court, in the Metropolitan Building Company cases, had repeatedly held could not be done in one of the cases which we cite, which we quote in it. 
    The Washington court held in so many words that it was not permissible for the public authorities to take the value of the improvements and use those as the sole basis for determining the tax liability. 
    Now, in effect, what has happened has been that for Wherry housing projects only, the leasehold is taxed not as the statute says on its market value but it's taxed on the value of the improvements. 
    Now, you see what kind of difference that makes. 
    That is the difference between whether we take about $7 million worth of houses here and tax or whether we take our interest in them, which the Government estimated at $253,000. 
    Now, in counsel's brief, they say they actually did not ignore the burdens on this leasehold. 
    Now, this is the first time they've said that. 
    And in the court below, in answer to admissions, which we pointed out in our reply brief, they specifically admitted that they did not take into consideration the $6 million worth of mortgages. 
    It is the difference between taxing the equity of the lessee and the property and taxing the property itself. 
    If you count up what they have actually assessed, if we -- I think any court in Washington would take judicial notice of the fact that equalized values are far or less than the 50% they -- that they seek to get at but if we disregard that and get simply to the -- to the value that they have put on it, they have put a value of some $2 million on this property. 
    Now, we're being condemned. 
    We'd be awfully happy to get the Government pass $2 million worth. 
    It just isn't that much but nobody's going to pass that because that just isn't what our -- what our equity is worth but that's what we've taxed for.

    Mr. Lyle L. Iverson 
    The -- the -- on page 354 of the record, the Court said, this is the Circuit Court, the trial court's further finding that a different method was used in (Inaudible) the Wherry Act leaseholds here and question is also correct likewise to be sustained as the Court's finding that the method used in assessing the Moses Lake leasehold resulted in a higher tax and would have been true in the case of a non-Wherry Act leasehold. 
    And then they go on in the footnote to say the Moses Lake leasehold was heavily encumbered by a mortgage. 
    Amortization of this indebtedness was not taken into account in assessing the leasehold. 
    It was only the value of the physical improvement was considered but has the valuation of the leasehold been measured by its market value considered in the lights of its burdens and benefits, the necessity of amortizing the mortgage would have been taken into account, citing some cases, had been taken into account the assessed value for 1958 and therefore, the levied tax would have been substantially lower, but we do not know how much lower. 
    So both the District Court and the Circuit Court has specifically found the question of -- of discrimination. 
    Now, that leads us to -- to where we are. 
    Here, for the first time --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    May I interrupt you again? 
    What do you consider under this question, it appears on 370 -- page 370 of the record which the only thing we brought out what do you consider was involved in the issue that we have to decide?
speaker="lyle_l_iverson" startTime="1200.376" stopTime="1374.488">
    Mr. Lyle L. Iverson 
    The fact that now, an application has made to a federal court -- to -- and its processes to collect a discriminatory tax which discriminates against the Federal Government. 
    Now, this is a matter which is just inherit in courts, but they do not assist the violation of the laws of their own sovereignty. 
    This Court in that case, Philips Chemical Company versus Dumas School District, which is cited here, has not too long ago, very explicitly reaffirm the long-standing rule that a State, in taxing those who deal with the Federal Government, may not discriminate against them and pick them out for special adverse treatment. 
    And that is what has occurred here. 
    So that the -- this Court is now being -- the -- the federal courts are now being called upon in this condemnation procedure to assist the County in collecting from the -- from this estimated compensation, this discriminatory tax. 
    Now, it had the theory upon which -- the County proceedings, apparently is that because of the fact that the leaseholds are for a period of 75 years, they will outlast the -- the leaseholds will outlast the buildings. 
    In other words, there was no such findings that, in this case, as a matter of fact, the Court in its -- in its oral opinion indicated that since the -- the contract called for this maintenance reserves and replacements that this would be maintained on to the end of the term. 
    So that there has -- there has been no decision that there is any conversion of this property from a leasehold to ownership. 
    And in Washington, we have a case which we've cited in here which holds that even a lease for 999 years doesn't constitute ownership. 
    And if it be considered that the County is claiming this tax against the physical buildings, then I don't think they have any claim against the -- the positive estimated compensation because it is not the physical buildings that the Government is condemning. 
    What the Government is condemning here is the leasehold, and this is compensation for the leasehold.

    Grant County's position is based on the Offutt Housing cases. 
    In addition, the statute to which Circuit Court of Appeals didn't pay too much attention to it at least as far as we can see is that personal property includes all improvements upon lands, the fee of which is vested in the United States or in the State. 
    And that's the basis upon which the property was assessed as improvements upon land, the fee which is -- is vested in the United States or the State of Washington. 
    Now, in the Offutt Housing cases, the Court has ruled that you can go be -- look as to the substance, not really is the form of the lease, you can go behind the terms and look as the practical aspect and the cases of which the Wherry housing cases can be distinguished from the Metropolitan Building cases because in those cases, one, there is no -- that the improvements, last way beyond the term of the lease.

   Rebuttal of Lyle L. Iverson
speaker="lyle_l_iverson" startTime="2575.664" stopTime="2585.216">
    Mr. Lyle L. Iverson 
    If the Court please. 
    In State of Washington, there were taxes invalid, it maybe enjoined and attacked directly by statute. 
    Now, insofar as counsel's argument that there was --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2585.216" stopTime="2589.341">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    To be invalid simply because the valuation maybe accessible?
speaker="lyle_l_iverson" startTime="2589.341" stopTime="2680.258">
    Mr. Lyle L. Iverson 
    To be invalid, I don't know, to be invalid only because it is discriminatory. 
    That's the basis of the invalidity and the decision of the Washington Supreme Court in the Moses Lake Homes case did not involve any taxes. 
    That was an injunction case. 
    It was a preliminary matter. 
    And we never got down to any figures. 
    There were never any ascertain taxes. 
    This case is the first time that anybody has actually attempted to collect any taxes, so that the decision of the state court did nothing but to declare what the State voids. 
    And the state law as it declared it was that for Wherry housing projects in Washington, the -- the -- they will be taxed at the base -- at the value of the improvements and for all other -- all other property. 
    Now, I'd like to get one matter straight. 
    Well, some of Your Honors were -- were asking about the case of a person buying property and whether his equity would take into consideration the mortgage. 
    We are not in that situation here. 
    We're talking about a leasehold. 
    And in Washington, the cases are uniform and the statute has been construed and the statute has not been changed that a leasehold must be valued (Inaudible) with its burdens and benefits and that is the universal way. 
    There are just no -- there are just no exceptions to it, and that's why this -- in the both courts below found that there was a discrimination in this case. 
    Now --

    The -- the property is simply being condemned under a general --

    I understand.
speaker="lyle_l_iverson" startTime="2692.174" stopTime="2798.719">
    Mr. Lyle L. Iverson 
    -- program that the -- that the Government carries on for condemnation of the -- of condemning this -- this Wherry Act leaseholds. 
    So our -- our story is simply that we have not been treated as anybody else in the State is treated, and we have not been treated as anybody leasing similar properties from the State would be treated, and there are just no exceptions to that situation, and they pick out these -- these people but a blind following of the -- of the Offutt Housing case, which didn't take into consideration at all the fact of discrimination. 
    Now, counsel says that they wouldn't get anything if this went back. 
    Actually, what we're concerned with is taxes on Moses Lake for three years which has been allowed in the sum of about $90,000, and the Court has allowed those discriminatory taxes, although finding they were discriminatory, on the basis that Section 511, which is in one of the appendixes of my brief, did not become effective until June 16th, 1956. 
    And the -- and that -- that statute said that they could not -- that the State could not discriminate. 
    It said it had to tax on the same basis as all other taxes. 
    Now, it is our position that the Circuit Court was wrong because that was only declaratory of constitutional law as it already existed. 
    And it didn't take any statute to say that the State couldn't discriminate against the -- against the Government's contractors. 
    But even without the statute ever since McCulloch versus Maryland, it has been ruled that a State must tax those who deal with the Federal Government on the same basis of the tax (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Lyle L. Iverson 
    It rates -- it relates to method -- to method of taxation. 
    It isn't a matter that we can take up before the Equalization Board because the -- it has nothing to do with how they would look at it and use their judgment but it has to do with the law of Washington as interpreted by its highest court which is said that in determining this kind of a -- of a tax that they shall appraise it on the basis of the -- of the buildings. 
    And they left no room for the burdens and benefits theory, and they left no room for the application of the statutory test as to what a buyer would pay to a willing seller of the leasehold, and there has never been any determination in any Washington case to the effect that a long term lease converts the property into ownership in the Government.
