H. K. Porter Company, Inc. v. Central Vermont Railway, Inc.

    Mr. Richard A. Solomon 
    -- Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    Before the recess, I had outlined the facts of this case. 
    Now, these facts are not disputed and upon the basis of these facts, the Commission made a determination which is also not disputed and that is that there was in fact undue preference to the -- people in official territory and in fact undue prejudice to the people in southern territory. 
    This conclusion led to an order directing them to do away with the undue discrimination and this has been attacked solely on the grounds of jurisdiction, the jurisdictional issues of course being whether the Commission had any jurisdiction in this situation since both -- both of the rates were international rates. 
    Now, briefly, on the jurisdictional question with respect to why we don't believe the unreasonableness part of this case is properly before the Court. 
    The Commission's decision discusses the unreasonableness of the rate and its report, starting on page 61 and ending on page 79, reaches the conclusion that the rate was unreasonable and also that it would form the basis of a reparations order. 
    But if you look at the order of the Commission on page 81 of the record, you will see that this order is directed solely to the question of ordering the carriers to do away with the prejudicial rate structure. 
    There is no order directing the establishment of any reasonable rate. 
    There is no reparations order. 
    This is not unusual. 
    What the Commission did was, as far as the reasonableness and reparations point, it issued a preliminary determination here and said, “Filed necessary information pursuing to Rule 1.101 and subsequently, will get around to making reparations order.” 
    Therefore, the only final action of the Commission which was before the District Court was the action of the Court on page 81 directing these carriers to end the prejudicial rate structure. 
    The reasonableness was not before the Court and as a matter of fact, if a final reparations order had been issued, it still couldn't have come before this Court because it's established by United States against I.C.C. and other cases cited in our brief that final reparations orders do not go to a three-judge District Courts of the type that we had below here, they go to single-judge District Courts. 
    In other words, to the extent that the District Court, the three-judge District Court here, purported to discuss to -- and find improper the Commission's reasonableness finding, they were without jurisdiction because there was no final order on the subject and because there -- that Court would not have jurisdiction if there had been a final order.

    Mr. Richard A. Solomon 
    The order of the Commission, Your Honor, directs them to eliminate the prejudicial rate. 
    This Court has held in the Texas and Pacific case as you're aware that where a Commission order of that nature is issued, there must be an alternative available to the railroads. 
    There is such an alternative here. 
    This order doesn't say which they should take, but they may eliminate this discrepancy in one of two manners. 
    They can withdraw their concurrence to the joint rates now in existence to official territory which would mean they would file reasonable and non-discriminatory domestic rates from the border to official territory points and eliminate the discrepancy in that way or if they don't choose to do that and this is their option, they can undo the discrimination by lowering their domestic rates now in effect from the border to southern territory. 
    But they have under this Commission order and this is made perfectly clear in the supplemental opinion that the Commission issued later on, they have this option of eliminating this discrepancy in either way they wish.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="270.253" stopTime="275.716">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    (Inaudible) see that factual situation now to all states.
speaker="richard_a_solomon" startTime="275.716" stopTime="461.085">
    Mr. Richard A. Solomon 
    Oh yes, that's right. 
    Now, if as we suggest you vacate the order on reasonableness, that order of the District Court would not exist. 
    Presumably what would happen would be that the Commission, while on the proper filings, would issue a reparations order and if the carriers didn't choose to comply with it under the ordinary procedures, the shippers would sue and then that issue would be before the Court in a proper manner. 
    Now, let me get to the merits of my jurisdictional argument with respect to the undue prejudice business. 
    The problem here, to the extent there's a problem, comes from the fact that the Interstate Commerce Act, and I suggest primarily is a matter of constitutional requirements, provides that the I.C.C. does have authority over international railroad transportation but only has authority, “but only insofar if such transportation takes place within the Unites States.” 
    In other words, it has authority over international railroad transportation insofar as it takes place within the United States. 
    Now, there have been a series of decisions in this Court of which you will hear more of later. 
    The News Syndicate case at volume 273, the Lewis-Simas-Jones case at volume 283, the Great Northern versus Sullivan case at volume 294 in which this Court has passed upon what is the authority of the Commission to determine and hold liable American carriers for the unreasonableness of an international rate. 
    And I think it can be summed up that the present situation on reasonableness is that if the carriers enter into a joint through rate voluntarily, they are liable for the reasonableness of that rate, jointly and severally, with the Canadian carriers. 
    If instead they enter into a combination rate, of the type here, or rather they file their tariff from the border and the Canadians file their tariff to the border, then the cases seem to indicate that the carriers usually are only liable for the reasonableness of the part of the order that they have filed from the border to the American destinations. 
    As because of these findings in rate cases, presumably that the District Court thought the only issue in the case, and this appears on page 272 of the record, the only issue in the entire case was whether the Commission had jurisdiction over the portion of the transportation between the Canadian mines and Newport and East Alburgh, Vermont.

    I thought you said 272.
speaker="richard_a_solomon" startTime="466.105" stopTime="653.511">
    Mr. Richard A. Solomon 
    I -- I'm sorry, I mean 242, sir, quite right. 
    You see the -- the District Court starts off its opinion saying, “A single question is presented, does the Commission have jurisdiction over the foreign factor because it involves transportation within the United States?” 
    Now, we submit that that is an -- an issue, maybe a decisive issue. 
    Certainly, an important issue in deciding whether the Commission could find that the international rate itself here was reasonable or unreasonable. 
    But we submit that that isn't the problem and that is out of the case and the question is not whether a rate is reasonable or not but whether the relationship between two rates is such that they cause undue discrimination within the United States. 
    Because the old case in this Court, United States against Illinois Central at volume 263, makes perfectly clear that even though both of two rates are reasonable and even though some of the carriers participating in these rates are beyond the Commission's jurisdiction, that if one or more carriers that are part of both rates, have it within their power to alleviate the discrepancy that the Commission has it within its power to order that discrepancy be -- be alleviated, then what is the jurisdictional question here, the real jurisdictional question? 
    Well, I presume there are two possibilities. 
    The first question would be, “Is the Commission estopped form looking into this situation at all merely because these two rates happen to be international rates? 
    Does the fact that the joint through rate is an international rate and the combination through rate is an international rate estop the Commission from looking at the situation at all?” 
    The other question presumably would be, “If -- if they can look at it and find what's obviously true that they do result in discrimination, can they do anything about it within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States?” 
    As I understand the argument of the railroads, their argument is primarily the first. 
    They say that we have the right to file a local U.S. tariff from the border to the various points of destination in the United States and if we do that, we're only liable for the reasonableness of that rate. 
    And therefore, you cannot look to the international rate for any purpose whatsoever because we're not liable, they say, for the reasonableness of the international rate.

    Mr. Richard A. Solomon 
    There is none and as far as the undue prejudice is concerned -- well, let me go back briefly. 
    You said the U.S. portion, I don't want to misstate it from the standpoint of my colleagues here, the argument maybe as to what is the U.S. portion, but there is no argument that the rates from Newport at East Alburgh to southern territory are unreasonable.

    Mr. Richard A. Solomon 
    No Your Honor there isn't and -- and there couldn't be such a finding because the discrimination isn't because of any theoretical transportation from the border or these Vermont points to official territory of the south. 
    The discrimination is on through routes paid for one time from the Quebec points either to official territory or the Quebec points to southern territory. 
    The discrimination is caused by the fact that we have a joint though rate which Mr. McDonald admits they're entirely liable for, a joint through rate to official territory, but a refusal to enter into joint through rates to southern territory.

    Undue prejudice cannot be caused by one thing. 
    It's a relationship of two rates. 
    The undue prejudice here is caused by the fact that the joint through rates to official territory is prejudicial when contrasted with the absence of a joint through rate to southern territory.

    One, they can remove the joint through rate to official territory, put both rates on a par, both combination rates or two, within the existing rate structure, they can cut down on the part of the combination rate that they charge to southern territories, cut their rate form the border to the southern territories and equalize in that manner.

    Let me give you an example, another case of this Court, the Saint Louis Brownsville railway against the Brownsville District case. 
    There, the problem was whether a carrier should be required to provide cars from Brownsville across the Mexican border. 
    And it was argued that it should do so because it was providing cars from a couple of other ports. 
    Well, Justice Butler speaking for this Court said in that case, of course that we have no authority, nobody has any authority to require these carriers to provide cars across the Mexican border. 
    But if they provide them for one shipper, then we have a discrimination problem. 
    We have the same thing here. 
    These people aren't under any obligation to enter into a joint route to southern territory and they're under no obligation to -- not enter into a joint route to official territory. 
    But if they voluntarily act and their voluntary actions within their control produce a discriminatory situation then the Commission has authority to do something about it.

   Argument of Robert W. Ginnane
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="1721.045" stopTime="1744.615">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    One qualification as interpreted by this Court's decision in Texas &amp; Pacific case requiring a carrier to cease undue preference and prejudice whether it's within the United States entirely or whether a part of it involves international traffic, the carrier must be aloud the choice as to whether it's going to eliminate the preference by moving one rate up or the other down.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1744.615" stopTime="1748.708">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="1748.708" stopTime="1837.540">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Only on carriers operating within the United States. 
    We agree entirely with the argument which the Department of Justice has made and the Section 31 point, preference and prejudice. 
    First, I'd like to comment briefly upon the suggestion of the Department of Justice that the issue of the railroads' liability of reparations under Section 1 of the Act was not properly before the District Court or before this Court. 
    It is suggested that that issue is not just justiciable until the Commission issues a final dollars and cents reparation order. 
    And -- and on the theory that when such an order is finally issued and if the railroads do not voluntarily obey it and pay then at that point under Section 16 of the Act, the shippers may maintain a suit on that order. 
    I don't deny the logic of the suggestion. 
    However, we are inclined to believe that this Court need not accept the suggestion, that for practical reasons, it could take a contrary view. 
    To begin with, a determination of liability as distinguished from the computation of damages has been held to be --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1837.540" stopTime="1839.227">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="1839.227" stopTime="2006.783">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    -- something which the courts can determine separately from the computation of damages. 
    Now moreover, since the question of the Commission's jurisdiction with respect to preference and prejudice and is jurisdiction with respect to the reasonableness of the rates, arises out of the same transportation problem, it seems to us unfortunate that the two questions of jurisdiction arising out of the same transportation situation would have to be litigated separately by the parties by separate routes. 
    If both questions are now resolved, there would remain for any court in which a suit was brought on a reparations order, the detail questions as to whether the reparation for -- are accurately computed, whether the responsibility for particular shipments were assigned against the -- the carriers that were truly participated in the shipments. 
    If the Court should agree with the suggestion of the United States, then we have a further concern as they do. 
    The opinion of the Court below while disclaiming authority to consider the validity of reparation orders is entirely devoted to discussion of the Commission's jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of the rates which is the very jurisdictional issue which would underlie in a subsequent reparations order. 
    So we would urge that if this Court should agree with the suggestion of the Department of Justice then it should vacate the decision below insofar as it relates to the Commission's jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of rates. 
    So that in any suit which may later be brought by these shippers on any future reparations order issued by the Commission, they will not then be cut off by a res judicata effect of the opinion of the three-judge court. 
    Assuming that Your Honors will hold that the issue of the Commission's jurisdiction as the reasonableness of the rates is properly before this Court, we contend the contrary to the court below that the Commission did have jurisdiction to determine that the through combination rates from the Canadian origins in this case to the southern destination points were unjust and unreasonable and that the shippers were therefore entitled to reparations.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Could I ask you one question? (Inaudible)
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="2020.601" stopTime="2051.710">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Not on this record. 
    Reparations maybe had for discrimination, for undue preference and prejudice. 
    That takes a different type of proof, a heavy burden of proof, a different burden of proof than is involved in getting reparations based upon the unreasonableness of the rates. 
    And in -- and on this record in this case, the -- the Commission's finding that the railroads were reliable for reparations was based entirely upon its conclusion that the rates were unreasonable.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2051.710" stopTime="2096.005">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible) what about this proposition? 
    Suppose that this -- these Canadian railroads published a rate, filed it in Canada and was approved of a very high sum from the mines to the Canadian -- United States border and now then in this attack, you consider the whole combination rate from the mines to southern territory and then require the American railroads to absorb what may be a very highly false rate in Canada, do you?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="2096.005" stopTime="2106.630">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Well, and as I will get to later in my argument, we would require that Canadian carriers to absorb somewhat to the extent that they perform transportation service within the United States.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2106.630" stopTime="2108.868">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well that's just two or three miles.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="2108.868" stopTime="2414.664">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    But on the other hand, these carriers, Canadian and the Official Territory American carriers, they're dealing together all the time, establishment of joint rates divisions and so on. 
    If the -- if the Canadian segment of rate is just outrageously high, the traffic isn't going to move on particular routes, that's all and there won't be a thing we can do about it but of course the Canadian Commission has jurisdiction at that point. 
    We have no reason to believe that they're anymore indifferent to the interest of -- of shippers than the Interstate Commerce Commission is. 
    We can leave that to them I suggest. 
    Now, the rates in question consist of two factors. 
    This cut through combination rate consists of two factors, a so-called proportional rate applicable only on the through traffic, established by the Canadian lines from the Canadian mines, the origins, to East Alburgh and Newport in Vermont. 
    And the second factor of this combination rate, are the various classes or joint commodity rates which the American carriers have established from East Alburgh and Newport to the southern destinations, mostly in North and South Carolina. 
    East Alburgh is three miles south of the border. 
    Newport is five miles south of the border. 
    The Canadian lines here involved run into East -- East Alburgh and Newport where they physically interchange traffic. 
    Now the act for -- Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act specifically provides that it applies to international rail traffic but only insofar as such transportation takes place within the United States. 
    Now, in this case the shippers attacked the entire through combination rate as unreasonable. 
    They did not attack the factor consisting of the rates from Alburgh and Newport to the south. 
    Now, the appellee railroads raise only a question of jurisdiction. 
    They contend that they publish rates from the boundary to the south, that's the American railroads, and that these rates are not attacked. 
    And they contend that the proportional rates of the Canadian lines, the other factor in the combination rate, are not subject to the American Commission's jurisdiction. 
    The Commission rejected the -- the railroads' contention that they had published rates to the boundary. 
    Noting the Newport and Alburgh were three and five miles south of the boundary respectively, the Commission held or they had found that the proportional rates maintained by the Canadian lines to these points, that's Alburgh and Newport, obligate those carriers to provide substantial transportation service within the United States. 
    Now, it's undisputed that Canadian railroad performing transportation service within the United States is just as much subject to the Interstate Commerce Act as -- as an American railroad is or the same as an American railroad performing service in Canada is subject to Canadian law. 
    However, the railroads contend that as a practical matter, East Alburgh and Newport should be considered as border points because they were right on the Canadian-American border. 
    And the court below agreed with us. 
    It said, “Surely the fact that interchange occurs a few miles on one side of the boundary instead of the few miles in the other side is a fortuitous event on which Congress could not have intended that the Commission's jurisdiction should depend.” 
    Now, we admit that Government regulation around an international boundary, in fact all sorts of business around an international boundary, is a technical business. 
    It involves arbitrary lines. 
    Now, the Interstate Commerce Commission has routinely treated as border points such places as Detroit, Port Huron, Nogales on the Mexican border which in fact are right adjacent to the border. 
    We haven't taken the position that that the border at Detroit is the middle of the Detroit River. 
    We have assumed that Detroit right on the boundary river is a boundary point, but a line must be draw -- applied somewhere. 
    There comes a point at which the Interstate Commerce Act must be applied with Canadian carriers operating within the United States. 
    For reasons of topography or operating convenience, those interchange points theoretically might be 10 or 15 miles south of the border and as an operating matter as a commercial matter that might be perfectly bona fide. 
    No element of evasion involved.

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Certainly and -- and that's why we treat Port Huron and Nogales, Detroit as being border points, but some, as I said at some point of distance, the Act should be applied. 
    Now, we have -- we have assumed -- we assumed that that -- that it is proper for the Commission to apply some flexibility and treat as border points those points that are on -- right adjacent to it as on a boundary limit. 
    But we submit that the Commission is not under on any obligation to treat as border points other interchange points, three to five miles inside United States and if those Canadian lines coming down to Alport -- Alburgh and Newport, are not regarded as performing transportation within the United States so as to be subject to the act, then I suppose tomorrow they can take up the tracks they can sell it, they can scrap it. 
    Well, that thought was too much for the court below. 
    The court below said, “If for example the Canadian carriers sought to abandon interchange service between the interchange points of the border or if they sought to lease their trackage in the United States to another carrier, the Commission would clearly have jurisdiction.

    Because the jurisdictional provision in -- in Section 1, paragraph 1 is the same. 
    Foreign transportation -- International Rail Transportation insofar as it takes place within the United States. 
    The abandonment -- the abandonment and leasing limitations are applicable only to carriers and transportation subject to our jurisdiction. 
    And the court below didn't dispute that. 
    It really said as to the -- as to the rate jurisdiction well in terms of the distance of these interchange points in the border, it's de minimus and we submit that the problems of national jurisdiction should -- can be treated de minimus only very carefully. 
    They say the shippers' complaint -- well, I'm ahead of myself, that the Court agrees with us contrary to the court below and the situation for rate purposes is this. 
    The United States Lines have established rates not to the border but to points in the United States south of the border. 
    And the other element of the challenged combination rate is the proportional rate established by the Canadian lines from origin points in Canada to points in the United States. 
    We argue that thus, both the United States and the Canadian lines have performed transportation subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. 
    It's is another way of saying that both elements of that through combination rate had been applied to transportation taking place within the United States.

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    As I say the, shipper's complaint, leading right into your question Mr. Justice Harlan, challenged the entire combination rate. 
    That was required as we see it by this Court's decision in the Sullivan case and the Sullivan case involved international traffic between Canada and the United States. 
    There were two rate factors. 
    One was a proportional rate established by the Canadian carriers to the border. 
    The other was another proportional rate established by the American carriers up to the border. 
    When an American shipper tried to attack just the American proportion that -- the proportional rate established by the American railroads, this Court said no, that a shipper seeking reparations must show that the entire through charge is unlawful, unreasonable. 
    This Court analogized that the proportional rates in that case, even though they were separately established by the participating carriers as local rates, this Court analogized those proportionals to joint rates but it seems to us that the logic of the Sullivan decision clearly goes further. 
    That there is no difference between separately established proportional rates which make up a through rate as in that case or separately established local rates which are used to do -- make a through combination rate. 
    It's a combination rate whether it's separately established proportional rates or separately established local rates.

    And -- and that is not, Mr. Ginnane because in any sense it has validity, the Commission assumed jurisdiction over the Canadian part of the traffic but in order to exercise jurisdiction of that which is it's duty to exercise, namely the American part, it must take into account the whole of which the American is at part.

    We'd have to look at the entire rate but our jurisdiction to impose liability would be limited to the American carriers that had established a rate right up to the border.

    Which means that you may find that there is either the proportional or the combination of the joint was unreasonable but you can't assess the -- the unreasonableness against the Canadian.

speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="2930.729" stopTime="3037.520">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    As -- as in the Sullivan case. 
    There the -- there the rates either broke on border points or as the tariff in that case showed at the international border near such and such town. 
    Both the shippers' complaint and the Commission's finding that the shippers are entitled reparation ran against the United States and the Canadian lines who had participated in this transaction, this transportation from the Canadian origins to southern destinations. 
    The appellants contend, and the decision below seems to suggest that the United States Lines which established rates up to Alburgh and Newport cannot be held responsible for an unlawful through combination rate which includes as one of its factors, the proportional rate applied by the Canadian lines in Alburgh and Newport North. 
    In other words, they're suggesting that the joint and -- they admitted joint and severed liability of the participants in a joint rate, cannot be applied to the participants in a combination rate. 
    We think this Court held to the contrary in the Sullivan case. 
    In addition, both the Commission and the lower federal courts have applied joint and severed responsibility for the railroads participating in the combination rate composed of factors which were separately established by the participating carriers. 
    That principle is very well summarized, we believe, in the Atlantic &amp; Yadkin Railroad Company case in opinion by Judge Parker which is set -- quoted from -- in our brief at pages 42 and 44.

speaker="j_edgar_mcdonald" startTime="3221.294" stopTime="3420.183">
    Mr. J. Edgar Mcdonald 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Members of this Honorable Court. 
    I hope I can do something to clarify what I think is the very simple issues before this Court and if I may say so at the outset without the slightest disrespect to either of my distinguished opponents, I'm amazed that neither the Department of Justice nor the Commission has seen fit to face up to what we say is the very, very simple issue that requires determination one way or the other by this Court, which we think was determined by the three-judge District Court. 
    And that is this question of jurisdiction and whether it must be said to be determined on the basis of whether or not a rate applies to the actual international boundary line or whether the boundary line for practical purposes of rate making maybe regarded as some distance away from the exact international boundary line. 
    And because of our thinking on that point, we say that the issue here is a simple one. 
    The Interstate Commerce Commission either had jurisdiction over these complaints and the right to determine among the basis of recognized principles which it's -- usually applies in the conventional cases before it or it did not, in which event the complaints were defective on their respective faces and should have been dismissed forthwith. 
    Now, that's the simple position that we have taken since the first complaint was filed a number of years ago. 
    It's the position we adhered to when four additional complaints were filed. 
    It's the position we adhered to in our efforts to have the case reconsidered by the Interstate Commerce Commission and at the position that we, I'm glad to say, adhered to successfully before the three-judge court. 
    Now, I think it helps considerably to or should help considerably to this Court's consideration of this matter, if I undertook to talk a minute about the nature of the rates involved and what I understand to be the Court's prior dealing with jurisdictional matters affecting international traffic. 
    Now, first of all, as you've already heard, there are such things as joint rates. 
    A rate that applies as a single entity from a point of origin regardless of whether it's in a foreign country or this country to a destination regardless of where it is. 
    In any event, it's a single entity, one rate, one factor which applies and is made in the first instance by the voluntary agreement of the various railroads participating therein.

    Mr. J. Edgar Mcdonald 
    It might be, Mr. Justice Douglas except that I'd like to say this as long as you ask me about it that in case this is of any enlightenment to the Court. 
    Proportional rates are what I would call a qualified rate whether they'd be a single line rate, made without anybody else's agreement as the Canadian rates were in this instance or whether they are joint rates made up of the agreement of two or more lines. 
    But the significance to me of an -- of a proportional rate is the fact that it's something special, it's a limited rate, it doesn't have general application. 
    In this instance, as I think is clear from the record in the various briefs, if a shipment of this particular commodity were made from one of the origin mines to either East Alburgh or Newport, Vermont, the -- the Canadian factor which is involved in these proceedings would have had no application because there's a specific tariff provision that restricts its application in the case like that and -- or good, bad or in different reasons throughout the -- for more than 50 to 75 years at least. 
    I have no hesitation in saying, it has been -- those -- that type of rate has been referred to in the commerce world as a proportional rate. 
    It's -- they maybe made for a number of reasons, largely, I would say competitive reasons perhaps where one railroad or group of railroads may think it necessary to take something less than they would normally do for purposes of transportation competition or purposes of industrial competition, for purposes if you choose a foreign competition, the production in foreign lands that the railroad industry as such may feel some necessity of attempting to assist the industry, the manufacture on the one hand and itself on the other as transportation agency. 
    Now, the other type of rate of course is a local rate which maybe -- which usually would be a rate published by one railroad for so called local application and that it would be general. 
    That rate would have -- if that -- if these Canadian rates had been published as so called local rates there would have been no restriction on their use whether the traffic, being shipped under them, were to come to rest finally at East Alburgh or Newport or whether it was to continue which journey down to Charlotte, North Carolina. 
    Now, it seems to me that most of the disagreement in the -- involved in this litigation stems from the failure of the Commission and our friends who argue for them to distinguish what this Court has previously said and done with respect to the Commission's jurisdiction over international traffic in the sense that you have heretofore been dealing with reparation cases, cases where rates for the future were not involved and reparation cases in which joint rates were involved. 
    And it seems to me, from the beginning and -- and still does, that the law in that respect is crystal clear. 
    As a matter of fact, I think it originated with the Commission itself who first enunciated the general doctrine in a case that's referred to, I'm sure through all our briefs, the so called Black Horse Tobacco case reported in 17 I.C.C. 588, as long ago as 1910. 
    And the gist of the generally recognized rule is that American and I -- I emphasize the word American, American railroads have a clear alternative with respect to their participation in international traffic. 
    They may publish rates to and from the border, in which event they are liable only for the lawfulness of those rates. 
    And when I say lawfulness, I mean lawfulness whether measured under Section 1, reasonableness or unreasonableness or Section 3 preference or prejudice. 
    Or they can enter into joint rates voluntarily in which event they become jointly and severally liable for the lawfulness of those rates. 
    And again, it doesn't make too much difference, I don't suppose whether you talk Section 1 or 3 or both. 
    So that I hearsay if I may repeat that the simple question here is the -- is whether the Commission had jurisdiction. 
    It either did or did not and I say this Court, no more than the three-judge court, doesn't have to journey too far into the woods and fail to see the trees if I may use a common expression. 
    In this instance, you've been told a little bit about already and we have discussed at length in our brief three cases that seems to me are all that need to be examined in order for this Court to make its determination of the issue before it. 
    The first is the so called News Syndicate case reported at 275 U.S. 179. 
    The second is the Lewis-Simas case reported at 283 U.S. 654 and the third is the Great Northern versus Sullivan case to which, Mr. Ginnane has already referred. 
    Now, each of those cases was a reparation case. 
    I -- I was inclined to say that reparation here is an incidental aspect of it. 
    That's the tail on the horse. 
    I'm sure my good friend, Mr. Ussery wouldn't agree with me on that point but I do say that before you start to worry about whether the rates have been unreasonable or otherwise unlawful in the past, the big thing to be determined here is the question of whether or not the Commission had jurisdiction to take these complaints and deal with them at the outset. 
    And you can forget all about the reparation insofar as that particular aspect is concerned because if they didn't have jurisdiction, that's the end of the line. 
    If they did, I -- I guess we're at the end of the line and are wasting our time and that of the Court's in arguing to --

    And the conclusion of the Court set forth at the -- the end of its opinion on page 43 -- 463 rather, is that it follows that retention by the defendant of an undue proportion of just and reasonable charges, did not damage the plaintiff. 
    If I can without getting too involved in that, the Court there refused to look at the question of whether or not they had a right to deal with the overall thing jurisdictionally I don't -- I think. 
    I don't think jurisdiction as such was raised and simply --

    I don't think it is precisely the same discrimination because in the one case you'd have a joint rate, the assailed rate from Quebec origin to Charlotte, assailed that is creating either undue and unreasonable rates and charges or unduly preferential and prejudicial rates and charges versus other joint rates maintained to official territory, Ambler, Pennsylvania specifically. 
    But if there had been rates published and we say they were from the boundary -- from the border to Ambler -- to Charlotte, then we say the question of their lawfulness must be measured by them alone. 
    You don't go beyond the border to look at them for any reason and there's nothing I can find in this or any of the court preceding that says anything different in that.

    Mr. J. Edgar Mcdonald 
    Well, Mr. Justice Black, the answer to -- my answer to that if I were counsel to the other side would be to tell them to file a complaint with the Interstate Congress Commission and assail the legality of the American factor. 
    And if they could show that that rate and charge produced unlawfulness, they'd be entitled to relief. 
    Now, on that very point let me make this observation that one of the things wrong with all of these is that our Canadian friends, good neighbors as they are, the Canadian railroads in particular here, would be free where Canadian factors are involved to do as they please with respect to the level of them and neither the Commission nor the courts of the United States could do anything about that. 
    They could raise or lower them as they saw fit. 
    And I don't deny the -- the validity of an argument that they might in so doing make it economically impossible to transport the merchandise, but that's quite a different thing, that's not the point. 
    The point here is whether or not we in fact publish rates to or from the border. 
    Now, it seems to me the answer to that question is one that the Commission itself gave a long time ago. 
    In -- Carey Manufacturing Co. v. G.T.W. Ry. Co, reported at 36 I.C.C. 203 which coincidentally happened to be a complaint involving asbestos. 
    The Commission said that their jurisdiction attaches at ports of entry and without going into any considerable detail let me point out that we have listed in appendices (c) -- in appendix (c) of our brief a large number of cases where the Commission itself has in effect followed that statement of principle that they would not deal with the measure of the rate that applied from a so-called border point within the United States to a destination in Canada or vise versa. 
    They have gone further than that and where joint rates were involved, they have by and large disclaimed any right to deal with the fact of beyond -- with -- not with the measure of the rates, not the factor, the measure of the -- single entity rates beyond the port of entry or the interchange point. 
    But for the first time that I can discover in our particular case, they say that that sort of a situation is not sufficient to -- to deprive them of jurisdiction that on the contrary, it gives them jurisdiction because the Canadian factor, says the Commission, obligates the Canadian carriers to perform substantial transportation service within the United States.

    Number two, they could say, giving us an alternative that they are preferential or prejudicial and incidentally as this Court undoubtedly knows, they could still be reasonable but nevertheless preferential or prejudicial in violation of Section 3. 
    But they could then give us an alternative order which left to us the choice of raising the one or lowering the other. 
    Or third, because of good and sufficient reasons, they could exercise the authority granted them under Section 157 if I recall correctly affixing the exact measure of the rates to thereafter be maintained from both competitive origins in order to make the rates for the future, non-preferential and non-prejudicial.

    Mr. J. Edgar Mcdonald 
    That's right and I -- I don't know what I did because I -- I abstracted. 
    One of the answers to -- to some of these questions I've been given and the reason I said Mr. Ginnane's own client doesn't agree with him appears in a decision by the Commission itself, in Yellow Jacket Boat Company Inc. versus H.S.N.T. and S.F. Ry. Co. reported at 305 I.C.C. 117, where the defendants in that case relied on Sullivan and said, “You can assail as an American factor alone, you got to assail the whole thing” and Interstate Commerce Commission doesn't seem to agree with Mr. Ginnane there. 
    They seem to agree with me. 
    And I just pointed that out in the brief too because they say here that this doctrine that you have to assail the total rate applies only to domestic traffic. 
    It doesn't apply to international traffic. 
    And least, I -- I won't take the Court's time or perhaps my own to read at all but the discussion is rather protracted, appearing in pages 116 and 17 of the report. 
    And they say there what I have said in effect that a local rate is complete in and of itself and it's not dependent for its application upon a movement to or from beyond the border and in that respect differs from a proportional rate which is in the nature of a division of joint rate where shipments originating at Canadian points beyond the border move on local rates from the border to destinations in this country, the complaint maybe directed to the local rate or rates from the international boundary. 
    No necessity according to the Commission in spite of Sullivan to assail the through rate.

    The Commission -- the complainants and the Commission could only properly have looked at the measure of rates applicable within the United States but they could have adverted to the fact as they undoubtedly would that the American factor rates were unlawful because we were maintaining joint rates to Ambler, Pennsylvania.

speaker="j_edgar_mcdonald" startTime="5502.169" stopTime="5635.885">
    Mr. J. Edgar Mcdonald 
    I think, sir, I would try to answer you this way if I may. 
    It might simplify the thinking of the Court and perhaps mine in answering your question if we forget all about Ambler and official territory for a moment because the situation by and large wouldn't be any -- any different except -- the basic question wouldn't be from my standpoint. 
    If all that was involved here was a complaint, assail the lawfulness of a given rate from a Canadian origin to a -- to a Charlotte destination where the rate charged on it was not a single entity rate but one made over Newport or East Alburgh, Vermont, my position still would be that the Commission has no jurisdiction to deal with the entire transportation rate in charge and to tell us what to do or what not to do about it except perhaps that -- well, let me change -- I'll put it this way -- except to say one of two things either take the position as we did here. 
    They had jurisdiction in which event, they would undertake the fine that it was unreasonable for the past, although they could not as the prior discussion brought out proscribe or to require the establishment of a single factor through rate. 
    They could give you instead a cease and desist order that would make you correct it insofar as the transportation takes place within the United States. 
    And I think perhaps it's a lot easier if we think of the single rate regardless of the Section 3 aspect of it because it's an issue that is jurisdictional under the statute. 
    Now, the statute is clear. 
    I don't argue at all that the Commission doesn't have jurisdiction insofar as transportation takes place within the United States. 
    I do argue as to what that means and I say the answer to it is to be found in the Commission's decisions. 
    For 40 years, they haven't held as to the exact boundary line of the border.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So it's purely and simply a question of jurisdiction?
speaker="j_edgar_mcdonald" startTime="5754.346" stopTime="5854.737">
    Mr. J. Edgar Mcdonald 
    Yes, sir. 
    Absolutely and I said that as clearly as I knew how in the three court -- in the three-judge court action. 
    I said that in the -- in our briefs as well. 
    And I say that the thing that has to be determined is whether or not behind the language of the statute the contentions of the Commission which in effect would say, “That unless you publish your rate to the exact boundary line, you haven't complied with your statutory duty.” 
    Is that that the law or is the law that you can publish a rate to a so-called border point, point which the Commission itself has characterized as points which for all practical purposes are international border points. 
    In this instance, the District Court said, “Border points within the United States.” 
    Now, in another proceeding, right in that same area, here we're being hung for three or five miles of entry into the United States by Canadian carriers for the sole purpose of interchanging their traffic and they -- they say that gives them jurisdiction. 
    In another case where the -- the port of entry and the interchange point was Highgate Springs and the distance was close to four miles right in between these two. 
    Commission said that's -- that's transportation within Canada and ignored that completely. 
    Well, I'm old fashioned enough I guess to think that you just don't say one thing means X today and Y tomorrow especially when you're dealing with an administrative agency.

    Mr. J. Edgar Mcdonald 
    No, sir. 
    No. 
    And may I say this in that connection. 
    You'll notice that the Commission's report here has said that the publication of these Canadian rates to points just three or five miles inside the border obligated the Canadian carriers to perform substantial transportation service within the United States. 
    It fails to say what that substantial transportation service was. 
    It doesn't -- it hasn't benefited from the admonishment that it has gotten a number of times by this Court, and particularly by Mr. Justice Frankfurter to make reports clear so that we know what they say, so the Court knows what they say and make it easier to rule upon the legality of the report and so on.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I've been wondering in my mind, but I'm meaning to ask you or from Ginnane. 
    Is there any kind of -- a kind of fraternal or informal relation is there between the analog of the I.C.C. in Canada and the I.C.C.(Inaudible)
speaker="j_edgar_mcdonald" startTime="5962.683" stopTime="6083.731">
    Mr. J. Edgar Mcdonald 
    In all candor I know of none Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    I do know that 30 years ago and we've cited in our briefs I think, generally speaking, the -- the apparent informal agreement of the respective agencies was to let the Canadian agency deal with southbound rates coming into the United States. 
    In other words, the -- the originating rate making line and Commission would deal with it and similarly, northbound. 
    That was an instance in which it seems to me the Commission without any notice at least has departed from its practice. 
    Now, let me say this if I may because I'm sure my time is fast running. 
    I say to you that that the -- the fact of the Commission had given the railroads this rule or principle that they could publish rates to points like Highgate Springs or Newport and the like and that that would be recognized for all practical purposes as a border point is a rule that's been in effect for 40 years. 
    We say that when an agency like the Commission charged with the administration of the statute construes it in that fashion for 40 years. 
    We have a right to rely on it. 
    We say we did rely on it and therefore, that we are being done wrong by when the Commission now departs from it without any notification. 
    Now, the Administrative Procedure Act, we say, provides a means whereby if the Commission for good and sufficient reasons decides that they should no longer do anything other than stick to the boundary line proper, they could've undertaken a formal proceeding that would've acquainted everybody in the country with the possibility of a change. 
    Put them all on notice and if they thereafter required something different or adhered to some different principle, we would have had no cause for complaint. 
    But they didn't --

    Does transportation across the border on a Canadian rate to a point three or five miles inside of the border for the incidental purpose of letting go of the traffic for American transportation, is that the kind of transportation that the statute was intended to apply to?

    May I answer you in -- at least in part this way? 
    The great bulk of the cases on which the railroads rely are cases involving Detroit, Port Huron, Nogales, Buffalo and other towns or cities right on the border -- right on the border's grid which the Commission as routinely treated as being border points. 
    Most of the cases fall in that category.

    That's the one -- the one in which you rely is most heavily.

    What do you say to his suggestion that if the complaints were reshaped you would get the same result but -- but he would avoid the -- but he wouldn't get the principle as he is now thriving to encompass?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="6349.824" stopTime="6403.084">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    He is mistaken. 
    He is citing that if the complaint were rewritten that the -- the shippers could make a comparison of a local rate from the boundary -- from the boundary down to the Southern territories by comparing that with the rate to the official territory. 
    It would be impossible to make such a comparison. 
    The rate to the points on official territories is a joint through -- joint rate from the Canadian origins to the destination points and official territory. 
    We don't know how it would be broken down at the American boundary. 
    He would have you compare, he would say if the shippers to try to show discrimination between a rate from the boundary to the South with of a -- with a joint rate from the Canadian origins all the way through to the official territory of origin. 
    It can't be done.

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    You can't compare one segment of one through rate with an entire joint rate to the official territory and he knows it.

    What about --
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="6417.298" stopTime="6424.939">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Such a comparison can be effectively made in terms of the problems of proof and evidence only by comparing the whole group.

    I thought -- I thought Mr. McDonald agreed with you would have to take into account the fact that the -- that the joint -- that the shipment originated on a joint rate in Canada?

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    But they have no breakdown as to how much of that was attributable to the transportation in the United States to the points on official territory. 
    We might not even know what the division was as between the carriers even though -- even if that were relevant.

    If that was on the face it discrimination and the burden would be on him to show it, wouldn't it?

    I'm afraid we'll be comparing such unlike that it would be almost meaningless either for or against the carrier.

    What do you say about the Yellow Jacket case?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="6467.188" stopTime="6508.628">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    The Yellow jacket case says that where the -- that where American carrier's rate, the local rate, is fixed to the boundary, to the border, not just at some point in them -- in -- in the country. 
    In that case, it involved Detroit and I think Port Huron. 
    American carriers local rate goes to the -- right up to the boundary, then the shipper may attack just the American segment of the rate. 
    He may do so and perhaps the -- perhaps the Commission was straining too hard there to -- to help the shipper. 
    Thank you.
