    -- your argument.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="8.231" stopTime="92.924">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    -- may it please the Court. 
    At the recess yesterday, we were discussing the Government's contention that concealment and the transportation involved in this case, were completely unrelated except to the fact that the same automobile and the same persons were involved. 
    Apparently, petitioner accepts this characterization of the facts since yesterday, you'd not argue the position of his brief if one general course of conduct was involved but instead he maintained the considerably more extreme position that one automobile means one offense no matter how unrelated the acts concerning this automobile may be. 
    Now, turning to the indictment which is on pages 2 to 4 of the record, Count 3 of the indictment which is the concealment count, alleges that at particular Ford automobile was stolen in Lake City, Florida on January 19th, 1941. 
    It further alleges that between January 19th and February 13th, 1941, petitioner and his two codefendants received, concealed and stored the same automobile in Kentucky. 
    And it further alleges that the automobile at that time of the concealment was then and their moving as was a part of and constituted interstate commerce from Lake City in the State of Florida to Owen County near Frankfort, Kentucky.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="120.245" stopTime="124.788">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So far as it appears, as you just said the -- the automobile was stolen by somebody else.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="124.788" stopTime="127.336">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right and was transported to Kentucky by somebody else.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="127.336" stopTime="128.091">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    By somebody else.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="128.091" stopTime="171.352">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right. 
    Now, of course we seek concealment and storage of the stolen automobile was only a federal offense, when the automobile is moving in an interstate commerce. 
    Now, Count 3 specifically bases its allegation of receipt, concealment and storage of the automobile from Florida to Kentucky, not the subsequent transportation which is involved in Count 2. 
    Therefore, the acts of concealment which are alleged in Count 3 are specifically tied to the earlier transportation on January 19th. 
    Now, Count 2 of the indictment, which is a transportation count, alleges the petitioner and his two codefendants transported the same Ford automobile --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="171.352" stopTime="172.921">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is this the first count?
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="172.921" stopTime="249.877">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    No, this is the second count. 
    The first count is the conspiracy count and that isn't involved here at all, Your Honor. 
    Count 2 alleges that petitioner's two codefendants transported the same automobile on February 12th from Atlanta, Georgia to Kentucky. 
    Now, since on or about January 19th, the automobile was in Kentucky and since he moved from Georgia to Kentucky on February 12th, it is clear that sometime between January 19th and February 12th, the car was moved from Kentucky to Georgia. 
    Now, whether it was by -- moved by petitioner or by someone else, is again not clear from the indictment. 
    So -- so that for all the indictment shows, the possession of the car may not have even been in continuous possession of petitioner or his two codefendants. 
    Therefore, the -- the facts of this case are that the acts of concealment alleged in Count 3, were not only in tied in the indictment to a transportation which was not alleged as an offense in the indictment, but an additional transportation, which was not alleged as an offense in the indictment, occurred between the acts of concealment, the beginning of the acts of concealment and the transportation which was charged.

speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="280.755" stopTime="336.436">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, I'm -- I'm not quite clear on the facts you're posing to me, Your Honor. 
    If you're -- if you're suggesting a continuous transportation from Florida to Kentucky, whether we can charge an offense for the transportation from Florida to Georgia, then from Georgia to Tennessee and then from Tennessee to Kentucky, that -- that involves a much more difficult issue and as far as I've been able to see, the Government has never made that kind of an allegation in any of the cases which have been reported. 
    They've always alleged the entire transportation then mentioned the intermediate states in the indictment. 
    Now, insofar as your -- whether you're suggesting that there was a -- a whether we -- if petitioner had brought the cars from Florida to Kentucky, we could allege that entire transportation plus the transportation from Georgia to Kentucky, which was made three and a half weeks later. 
    That again is a -- is a different issue and that --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="336.436" stopTime="339.090">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    You're getting close to -- on this case, when you --
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="339.090" stopTime="416.901">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That is not -- that is not too separated from the -- from the facts of this case. 
    If we assume those are entirely unrelated transportations, in the sense that they may well have been done for entirely different purposes. 
    In short, as we read the indictment, the facts of this case so that the acts of concealment and the acts of transportation which were alleged, were separate and entirely unrelated. 
    This is suggested very strongly in the indictment, but this is especially true, since we believe that under well-established rules of law, this indictment must be construed in the way which is most favorable for the Government. 
    It's, of course, a familiar principle that a final judgment is presumed to be correct and that the burden is on the person attacking that judgment to show the facts supporting his claim. 
    Now, your petitioner pleaded guilty and thereby removed the necessity for the Government to prove the facts underlying the indictment and he admitted his separate guilt on the two separate counts. 
    And at the same time, he made the indictment, the sole relevant fact when he made this collateral attack, 18 years later. 
    Therefore, we believe that insofar as the indictment is ambiguous, petitioner has failed to sustain his burden of proof.

speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="711.325" stopTime="995.381">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    That's right. 
    Apparently, he's not serving that sentence or any portion of that sentence at the moment. 
    Stating the -- the facts of the case more concretely, we feel we can assume consistent with the indictment. 
    And on January 19th, petitioner and his codefendants, either themselves transported the automobile from Florida or received it in Kentucky from persons who did transport it. 
    That on that some -- same day or shortly thereafter, petitioner and his codefendants engaged in acts of concealing the automobile, such as changing the motor numbers or repainting the car or similar such acts, which have been held in other cases to constitute acts of concealment under the statute. 
    And sometime later, perhaps some three weeks, either petitioner and his codefendants or someone else, transported this automobile from Kentucky to Georgia. 
    And we can -- and we can properly assume that the purpose of the return trip from which petitioner and his codefendants transported the automobile from Georgia to Kentucky, was not for the same purpose as the original concealment. 
    For example, it may have been to go visit friends, go on legitimate business or even they commit another crime. 
    If this case is considered on these facts, which we emphasized that it must be, we feel that there is -- there were clearly two separate offenses which are separately punishable under the statute. 
    We feel that it's clear that if a person transports the same automobile across state lines and then three and a half weeks later, an entirely different criminal impulsive for a different purpose, he repeats the same act that there would clearly be two separate violations of Section 3 of the statute. 
    We can see no difference when the person commits acts of concealment, violating Section 4 of the Act. 
    And then three and a half weeks later, for an entirely different purpose and entirely different criminal impulse, he violates Section 3 by transporting the automobile across state lines. 
    Now, we think that the rule of lenity clearly does not apply in this situation then none of the case is decided by this Court composed to even suggesting that there -- there is only offense involved here or might to delay discussion of the cases applying the rule until after he discussed petitioner's contention, which he makes in his brief and the general course of conduct is involved. 
    Since as we've persist, I hope to show that the rule of lenity would not apply even if the general course of conduct were involved and for sure, it would not apply if the acts were entirely separate and unrelated. 
    Assuming the petitioner is correct and then the general course of conduct were involved, I -- I take it that this would mean that there is a single general course of conduct relating to the same automobile from January 19th to February 13th, and this is the only possible construction of the indictment. 
    The most that a general course of conduct to mean in this context is that a single criminal impulse and a single criminal purpose underlay both of the acts of concealment and the acts of transportation. 
    It would be consistent with this view of the facts for example, for petitioner and his codefendants to have intended on January 19th to conceal the automobile for purposes of sale and to have taken the trip to Georgia for that purpose and perhaps it was unsuccessful to return to Kentucky. 
    But we think that even under that -- that group of facts, assuming that would -- that were the case before this Court that the rule of lenity does not apply. 
    I would like to discuss in order of the cases which petitioner has cited and which this Court has applied the rule of lenity to -- in order to forbid consecutive sentences. 
    In Bell versus the United States, which of course involved the transportation of two women for immoral purposes across state lines on the same trip, in the same automobile at the same time, therefore, the very same act of transporting the -- of one woman also transported the other woman. 
    Certain at the least, a common transaction was involved. 
    In fact, the Court defined a rule of lenity in the Bell case, as a rule and I quote, "Against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses, unless the intent of Congress is clear." 
    Now, in the Ladner case which petitioner also cites, person -- is all that two federal officers while under arrest, perhaps arguendo and the -- in the facts before the Court by a single discharge of a gun. 
    Now, obviously, this is a single act in the narrowest physical sense.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="995.381" stopTime="998.980">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    As a matter of curiosity, what ever happened to Ladner (Inaudible)
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="998.980" stopTime="1167.354">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I'm not -- I don't know, Your Honor. 
    In the Prince v. United States which involved the Federal Bank Robbery Act, this Court held that -- that a person couldn't be punished both for entry into the bank with intent to rob it and for the completed robbery. 
    But not only did this involve what the Court called, a narrow question of the unique statue of limited purpose, but the factual situation is clearly again, one were both defenses are a part of the single continuous transaction within a very short period of time. 
    The case in which petitioner principally relied in his brief is the Heflin case, which also involved the Federal Bank Robbery Act. 
    Either the Court held that bank robbery could not be separately punished for receiving money, he had helped to steal. 
    Again, we think the Court was considering a continuous after transaction which was intimately related. 
    And in fact Justice Douglas speaking for the Court specifically stated that the issue before the Court was the intent of Congress in punishing multiple aspects of the same criminal act. 
    The petitioner is suggested in his brief that Heflin was considered by the majority of this Court under Rule 35 and therefore only the indictment was before this Court. 
    The indictment there is not too dissimilar in the -- in the concealment count to the -- to Count 3 of the indictment here. 
    They were to allege receipt, concealment, storage and other -- and other similar words. 
    Petitioner therefore suggested in Heflin as here, if the indictment where construed in the manner most favorable for the Government, totally separate acts of bank robbery and concealment, would have been involved there. 
    But we submit to the Heflin, well, this Court could not construe the indictment in the manner most favorable for the Government, since a transcript of the trial was before the Court. 
    It certainly would have been strange for this Court to construe the indictment most favorably for the Government in direct opposition to the facts which the Court knew to be truth. 
    In fact, the Government urged there and it cited the transcript that the only facts there which were -- the only acts by the petitioner there, which were separate from the robbery, was the dividing up of the loot and -- which lose immediately after the robbery. 
    And no claim was made for the Government that sometime later, separate acts of concealment unrelated to the robbery were armed -- were involved. 
    The Government's contention of separateness was the acts were physically separate. 
    And in fact, the Court likewise, considered only the acts of dividing up the loot in its opinion and -- and decided that they were part of the same criminal act.

    There is some difference and that the Woody case was the more difficult case for the Government. 
    Looking purely at the indictment, the indictment in the Woody case alleged that the acts of -- receipt, concealment and storage, occurred on March 16th, 1954. 
    That was the same date of the transportation alleged in the indictment in the Woody case, so it -- it would -- there was much more possibility of the -- of the prisoner there, arguing that the acts were interrelated. 
    Of course, as it turned out in the transcript, as this Court considered the case, that there was a considerable separation and time thereto, between the acts of -- of concealment and the acts of transportation. 
    Although, there was no indication of course, whether there was a different criminal purpose involved, presumably there were -- the criminal purpose for both there was keeping the car from it -- from its owner.

    Well, we think clearly the conspiracy -- the conspiracy is separate. 
    Your Honor's decision mandate, although under a different statute, reaffirms that line of cases but as to the other two, we think they were -- they are separate, but I -- I want to emphasize that it is a much more difficult case than as before this Court and that -- and that -- that case involves how far the Heflin case applies to other statutes. 
    We think the Heflin case has nothing to do with -- with the case that is now before the Court.

    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    Well, I --

    -- will rest again.
speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="1376.728" stopTime="1532.487">
    Mr. Bruce J. Terris 
    I assume that when -- when the intent to transport when the petitioner -- when the defendants there had their intent to transport, that they had unitary intent in which they decided they were going to transport it then they were going to keep it then perhaps, they were going to sell it when they -- when they were finished. 
    Here, we think that there was no -- there was no such interrelationship and time itself, makes a difference we think, that if a person that -- that contrary to what petitioner argues, that if a person still transports a car today, keeps the automobile and transports it across state lines two years from now, that these -- these are in no -- in no way the same criminal act. 
    And so we think time doesn't make a difference and the three and a half weeks itself makes a significant difference in the case between the one that you post to me in the -- in the case here. 
    But in addition, construing the statute, we have an intermediate transportation which may have nothing to do with petitioner and his two codefendants and we may at well have entirely different criminal purposes and impulses. 
    Briefly, we also think that the Universal C.I.T. Credit Corporation case is also very different. 
    There, the Court did speak of a course of conduct but we like to emphasize that the course of conduct there was under each different criminal provision that was a separate course of conduct which this Court held, was separately punishable. 
    If we apply the same kind of reasoning to this case, then -- then a person transports the same automobile twice couldn't be convicted twice no matter how much the separation in time, but that wouldn't at all apply to the facts of this case that would -- it would be a separate course of conduct for concealment, receipt and storage and there would be a course of conduct for transportation and each one of those would be separately punishable. 
    Finally Your Honors, petitioners argue that a person using a -- a stolen automobile over a long period of time, may cross numerous state lines and therefore, maybe guilty of multiple offenses under the Government's theory. 
    I suggest that this would make a user of stolen automobiles liable to heavier punishment than a professional criminal. 
    Well, this may at times be true. 
    We cannot assume these pre-charges will abuse their discretion by giving consecutive sentences, when they are undeserved. 
    And we must assume the district judges will properly exercise their discretion as did the District Judge here, when he based petitioner's punishment on the -- on his record, which was not an insubstantial one.

   Argument of Edward L. Barrett, Jr.
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="1534.368" stopTime="1589.252">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    I may have five more minutes, Your Honor. 
    Just really two additional points, we've discussed the construction of the indictment. 
    Petitioner's position I think, differs in the Government's only into this. 
    Petitioner would say that the indictment charges that in the third count. 
    The petitioner's codefendants received, concealed and stored the automobile between the 19th day of January and the 13th day of February. 
    Second count charged that they transported it on the 12th day of February. 
    Therefore, the petitioner thinks that it's fair to assume from this indictment that petitioner and his codefendants had possession of the car from whatever point at which they received it to and including the period of transportation, because the transportation and his charge is in the middle of the period in which he was charged that they received concealment stored. 
    So --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1589.252" stopTime="1593.616">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    An allegation at the time on important in an indictment?
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="1593.616" stopTime="1603.871">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Well, if you disregard allegations of time Your Honor, then you could read this indictment of saying that the transportation was on the 12th and their concealment was on the13th.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1603.871" stopTime="1608.645">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Or you just -- if you could read it giving some other time.
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="1608.645" stopTime="1780.891">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    That -- that they're tied together here and perhaps the only sentence that -- that's relevant I think, but generally the course of conduct here, a general period of time, both defenses related to an automobile. 
    I suspect that in dealing with this problem perhaps, the Court is as well off to have no other facts than it has because I'm not sure there's any stocking place, between saying, this statute meant to get that separate persons who were involved in varying ways with respect to a stolen car and saying on the other extreme, that criminality here becomes a factor of time and distance. 
    And that the more time that elapses, the more things that a person does with the car, the more possible counts that may be charged against him. 
    And I suggest here that generally and this is a special kind of statute, generally, we don't calculate criminality in that way. 
    Certainly in the field of larceny generally, the man's punishment doesn't rise with the length of time that we hold on to the stolen -- or stolen article, or with the number of things he does with the stolen article before the time in which he's caught. 
    These were all regarded as part and -- of the necessary incidence of effect. 
    Now true, we're not dealing with a larceny statute here. 
    We're not dealing with the larceny statute only because Congress didn't have the constitutional authority to make a larceny statute, so they made it to transportation statute and tied it in here, really assisting the States in the enforcement of their own law here not any separate federal interest basically beyond that, assisting the States in enforcing their larceny law. 
    We accept the Government's contention, the man who steals the car and keeps it within the State where he steals it, probably will get under most state laws the time whereof one charge, one sentence or whatever the local sentences for larceny of automobiles. 
    No matter how long it keeps it, no matter what he does with it or how many crimes he commits, committed or what. 
    This was an incident, but here once he go across the state line, the Government's argument now and they make it quite clearly certainly on page 13 of their brief that the longer he keeps the car, the more things he does with it, the more places he drives it and so on, the more crimes, potential crimes he's creating. 
    All I suggest is doubtful that Congress intended to give to courts the discretion to impose what could be an obviously enormously large sentences for this offense, under -- under this situation. 
    And beyond that, it seems to me that with respect to the application of the prior cases, I suggest that the Government's construction here is somewhat narrow, that the rule of lenity as I read it, as this Court has adopted it, is a part of the general rule with statutory construction.

    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Well, within the general statements, Your Honor that petitioner's position that the general statement certainly is not confined as the Government suggests to whether you have separate acts or don't have separate acts. 
    It's a general proposition which petitioner argues, should apply here. 
    The statute is not clear. 
    It can reasonably be read as the saying, we're going to reach different people and not multiply offenses to one individual. 
    There are potentialities of harsh punishments being imposed if you read the statute, as the Government reads it. 
    It seems to me here, the conditions are satisfied for the applying of this general notion statutory construction.

    Mr. Barrett, what -- what about this situation. 
    If the sentence charged with receiving and storing the car on the 1st of January, in Frankfort, Kentucky and then the second count, is charged with transporting that same count on the 4th day of January from Kentucky to Florida. 
    Is that only one offense written thereto?
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="1916.157" stopTime="1967.477">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Well, under my contention is we have to regard it -- we really should regard it as one offense. 
    I think this is basically the trouble we get into here, is because Congress was dealing with the situation where they had constitutional limitations. 
    They couldn't start out by saying, "We're going to punish you for larceny. 
    We're going to punish it for receiving stolen property." 
    So you punished transporting and then you -- you get into -- and then you punish receiving and stealing and you read the -- to what you can get out of the congressional history, they're thinking of different people. 
    Now, if the man receives the car from this person who stole it in another State and then he subsequently transports it. 
    I still don't see any reason for interpreting the statute as to say, "Well, he should be charged with the receiving and in the subsequent transporting."

    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    I just going to add one thing, it seems to me here, particularly difficult and more so than the other statue you've dealt with, to draw any line other than the quite broad line here, because unlike an ordinary theft case such as you have in the Heflin case that the number of -- of offense of separate acts they're going to occur for somebody who stole something from a bank. 
    It will be going to relatively small normally, but in the automobile case and normal concomitant into the theft of the car, is going to be many -- often, would be many act of transportation, many acts of concealment, because this is what you do. 
    You steal the car to use it or to sell it, to take it somewhere to dispose of it and this adds up the possibility of creating many separate offenses in the ordinary transaction.

    Namely and it -- and I think very engaging and -- and far reaching, namely that we're dealing here with the crime made so by Congress, not under its extraordinary penal cars, but as an adjunct and as a help to state prosecution because it's assumed with the jurisdiction.

    You know very well that the large number, the bulk of penal legislation federally enforced it derived from the Commerce Clause and if you're -- if you're -- generally, all you have to see where this case.

    This is all in aid of state, what is really local -- what is really local, what a local misconduct. 
    Well, when you think of how much there is on the -- on the -- in the Code in 18 U.S.C. and has been for the last one, ever since the champion to way back the lottery cases are, in which Congress has made crimes hanging them on -- pegging -- to peg on which they hung the power in the Commerce Clause, but I don't see that that should lead us in all those cases to say, "Oh, since this as it were, an auxiliary power, we must looks up and confine the person.
