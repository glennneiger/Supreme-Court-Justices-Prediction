Dresner v. City of Tallahassee Questions certified to Supreme Court of Florida

    Mr. Howard Dixon 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    In the spring and summer of 1961 had begun a new phase in the struggle to obtain integration in the south and to arrive at a new level of dignity of mankind as we would further have it under our democracy. 
    On June 15th, 1961, the petitioners' news case as part of a "Freedom Ride" arrived in the respondent city, the City of Tallahassee as part of a test. 
    They testified that they wanted to bear witnesses as -- as ministers, rabbis and clergymen to the struggle to obtain those rights guaranteed them by the Constitution. 
    But first, in order to bear witness, they wanted to test transportation facilities to determine if there were facilities available on an integrated basis. 
    What is a test? 
    Legally, a test to this kind is not quite the same thing as what we mean by a legal test. 
    We would define it for the purposes of this case as an opportunity to determine the availability of one's constitutional rights and to do so peaceably until that right is made available. 
    Their first test in Tallahassee came when they arrived in a clearway to a bus terminal. 
    They were met by some citizens who obviously hostile and menacing to a certain degree. 
    They were also met by what the police department and into the police termed "adequate police protection". 
    Some of them tested the facilities of the bus terminal by eating in the coffee shop, testing the restroom and the waiting room.

    Insofar as they are on the white race, how could they test the question of whether or not restaurants were integrated?
speaker="howard_dixon" startTime="149.986" stopTime="180.604">
    Mr. Howard Dixon 
    And -- they could test that because the south literally objects to the mixture of the races in any social situations as well as to the injection of any negroes into a social situation or into a situation that legally -- that we -- we legally we maintain is their -- by rights under the Constitution. 
    In short, by the -- in -- by their mixing, it is a violation with the morals and customs of the south.

    Yes, sir. 
    But however, the citizens of Tallahassee, if I may describe Tallahassee, it's a city shorts -- short distance from the Alabama border and its settlements are more of those of Montgomery, Alabama than say, Miami. 
    It is the city that is 475 miles distance from the most metropolitan area and retains the flavor and color of the old competitor. 
    In the process of testing, they -- they had arrived at the terminal's point, the City of Tallahassee and they proceeded to go to the Tallahassee terminal to take air transportation back to their homes in the north. 
    Some of the passengers, when arriving, confirmed their reservations and proceeded to take the plane out that was due at the airport at about 3:25 on June the 15th, 1961.

    -- two point they got to the airport. 
    The petitioners decided that as they had been adequately served so they went to the airport terminal restaurant. 
    And the airport terminal restaurant is an integral part of the terminal. 
    In that, there was only a glass wall separating it from the waiting room itself. 
    As they approached the door to the restaurant, they saw on the door an informally lettered sign reading "close". 
    Upon being -- inquiries being made by the spokesman, the manager of the restaurant advised them that they were closed for mapping up and they would reopen at 4:30. 
    At that point, they determined by a vote among themselves that they would cancel their reservation to enjoy a cup of coffee when the restaurant reopened at 4:30.

    Ten.
speaker="howard_dixon" startTime="356.083" stopTime="463.611">
    Mr. Howard Dixon 
    They found in this terminal restaurant that there were segregated facilities, that is to say there was a room for the negroes and negro -- room for the whites and separate restrooms facilities and a separate eating facilities for negroes as opposed to whites. 
    However, the place in which they wished to eat was obviously the white restaurant because as they looked into the glass wall with the sign reading "close" on the door, they saw white people eating inside the restaurant. 
    And in -- later in the testimony, the manager of the restaurant testified that the restaurant was usually open from 6 a.m. until 11:45 in the evening. 
    So they waited until 4:30 and when the restaurant did not open, they sat in the waiting room until the terminal close that evening, until 11:45 p.m. 
    Now, during that time, they were adequately guarded by the police, the city testified to that effect. 
    They were a number of people outside or perhaps were just curious to see them and some of them who were hostile to the point of violence. 
    The city manager of Tallahassee testified that there were never anymore to three or four cars or perhaps four or five people in each of the cars outside of the terminal. 
    They -- at the end of the close of the day when the terminal restaurant close down, they obtained transportation back to the City of Tallahassee and lodging and in -- of course, in the meantime, they had made reservations on the plane to leave the following morning at 8:30 a.m. 
    And the next morning, they were back there at 8 a.m. and again they approached the restaurant and again the sign "close" was on the door.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="463.611" stopTime="465.746">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Where they spent the night, does the record show?
speaker="howard_dixon" startTime="465.746" stopTime="754.745">
    Mr. Howard Dixon 
    No, sir. 
    They spent the night at sympathizers and negroes of the community who were supporting core and these activities. 
    So when they were back the night -- the following morning, they saw the restaurant signs still there. 
    They cancelled their reservations and made tentative reservations for 1:30 or 1:45 that afternoon. 
    They, again, sat in the restaurant and again, they had adequate police protection, and again there were some people who were outside who were hostile to them and do exhibit some feelings of violence. 
    Along towards noon, they saw that again, the sign was not going to come down. 
    The walls of Jericho were not going to fall. 
    They cancelled their third reservation. 
    Now, the city makes a great deal to do about the cancellation of these reservations but we maintain that it's between a private corporation in the airlines and these individuals and there's no concern of the city how many cancellations of reservations they had made. 
    And upon that happening in -- within half an hour, they were approached by the city attorney for the City of Tallahassee who identified himself as the special police officer of the city and said, "I am advised that your assembly here was tend to create a disturbance or incite a riot or disorderly conduct within the City of Tallahassee. 
    And in the name of the State of Florida and the City of Tallahassee, I command all of you who are here, assemble immediately and peaceably to disperse. 
    If you do not immediately and peaceably disperse, I shall arrest you or charge to be arrested for unlawful assembly." 
    Reverend Collier, the spokesman for the group stated simply that "it's lawfully we're here under the protection of the Interstate Commerce Act" and he sat down. 
    The City Attorney Messer immediately ordered the officers to arrest the 10 petitioners and they were taken to the jail and booked. 
    The following morning, several of the petitioners out on bond and in haste to return to the various portions, they did it because it was Saturday and they had to get back to preach, went by the terminal restaurant and again, the sign was close but again, there were white people inside the restaurant. 
    But again, in -- with regard to this restaurant, it had opened up Saturday morning and was only closed apparently when the petitioners came by to board their plane after they were released from jail. 
    The trial proceeded on the following week on June 22nd and petitioners' counsel filed a motion to quash which raised due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, the First Amendment rights to equal protection of laws and the protection of the Interstate Commerce Act. 
    In the trial, there was no evidence whatsoever as -- as to any unlawful rioters or to move to its conduct. 
    However -- and in addition thereto, the testimony adequately discloses that there was complete police protection provided for the petitioners at all times. 
    Now, the Florida statute provided that in order for that to be unlawful assembly, there had to be of any persons or persons whether armed or not unlawfully, riotously or tumultuously assembled within the City of Tallahassee. 
    The mayor or any officer specified in the statute within the opinion of the said mayor or any officers, there is -- the assembly of such persons shall tend to create a disturbance or incite a riot or disorderly conduct. 
    The mayor may go among the persons or the duly delegated officer and advised them to disperse and if they failed to do so, they will be considered guilty of the crime -- charge of the crime. 
    The evidence failed to disclose that these facilities were not integrated, that is to say, every -- every witness who has something to do with the facility testified that these were a segregated facilities from the -- actually, the white waiting room and separate negro waiting room to the restroom and into the restaurant themselves.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Was the -- was the restaurant ever -- was the restaurant at the airport ever opened during the period that these people were there?
speaker="howard_dixon" startTime="763.890" stopTime="768.454">
    Mr. Howard Dixon 
    Never opened during the period these people were there. 
    There were people eating in the restaurant --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="768.454" stopTime="770.814">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    When they first got there but there was a sign saying "closed"?
speaker="howard_dixon" startTime="770.814" stopTime="917.635">
    Mr. Howard Dixon 
    Yes, sir. 
    And one of the petitioners, I presumed they got hungry at sometime of the day, went around to the kitchen and found that they were preparing meals for the airplanes and that the chief of the detectives was eating in the kitchen but I don't think my petitioner felt that he could necessary do the same thing. 
    The record is bearing that the -- that the petitioners had any notice that the restaurant was closed was a reason given by the restaurant manager in his testimony. 
    He testified that they closed the restaurant because they were under repair. 
    Upon close requesting he admitted they had two reasons, the one thing that they want that heard about this "Freedom Ride" in Alabama and other States and that they wanted to avoid violence so they took this opportunity to close to make the repair. 
    But there is a (Inaudible) testimony to the effect that before and after the restaurant was open and providing service for white customers. 
    The -- at the close of our case, we also introduced -- reintroduce some motion to quash on the same constitutional grounds.But petitioners were found guilty and fined $500 each or in default thereof they were given a 60-day sentence. 
    An appeal was taken directions to the Florida Supreme Court on the basis that the Tallahassee statute was taken directly from the state statutes and was -- was adopted in direct reference thereto but the Florida Supreme Court under its jurisdiction, which allowed them to construe a state statute, said this was not a state statute and claimed that we had improvidently lodged our appeal in that Court and referred it back to the Circuit Court of Leon County. 
    The Circuit Court of Leon County, we pursued our appeal and the Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. 
    Under the State Constitution, Article 5 Section 6 Paragraph 3, the state court is the highest appellate court from cases arising in the Municipal Court. 
    We therefore have brought these petitioners a writ of certiorari to this Court.

    Mr. Howard Dixon 
    Your Honor, we find that the common law writ of certiorari is discretionary and is the old common law form that is to say is very limited and restricted in a scope. 
    It's limited to the jurisdiction and to determining what are the essential requirements of law. 
    Certainly, in -- this Court has considered the cases arising from Texas in Largent versus Texas and Tucker versus Texas where it was a question of Jehovah's Witnesses and so forth where there was a highest court, appellate court that the petitioner could go. 
    And so, from the county court in Texas, they went directly to the Supreme Court on an appeal. 
    Well, of course, perhaps, you could consider our writ of certiorari in the ground -- actual basis as being an appeal but we feel that we could not get a full review in the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    Therefore, we could come here because it would present to the federal questions which under Magnum -- (Inaudible) you -- you -- on the petition for writ of certiorari, you're mostly concerned with important questions of public interest which we think is this.

    The petitioners press there -- claims under the motion to quash under the grounds of the Thompson versus Louisville decision which stated that the lack of evidence or the lack of any evidence of a crime being committed was a denial of due process. 
    That also was a claim that we pursued in this Court together with the question concerning the freedom of speech and assembly which even assuming argumendo that the petitioners were found guilty of violating the unlawful assembly law of City of Tallahassee. 
    They went under any circumstances under freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, then permitted their rights to assemble because the conflict would have to be resolved in favor of the First Amendment. 
    There were no words of incitement and at all times, the petitioners were peacable and displayed no harshness or any type performed to misconduct whatsoever. 
    This line of cases, of course, is -- it's been highlighted in the past year by Edwards verus South Carolina and Garner versus Louisiana and so forth. 
    And the third and chief ground was that the denial of the facilities on -- at the terminal that is the restaurant facility was a burden on interstate commerce under the Boynton verus Virginia case. 
    And as such, this was a denial to them of rights amended under the Constitution.

    We didn't understand that we would've do that to -- to argue the question of jurisdiction when the writ was granted because this Court has only two other occasions and I think this counsel himself was involved in -- in these matters, tried to come to this Court directly from the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit of Florida, that Leon County and has been denied.

    Then he says, “Failure to observe the essential requirements of the law means failure to accord due process of law within the contemplation of the Constitution are the commission of -- and error so fundamental in character is to fatally infect the judgment and render it void." 
    Then he says, "It seems to be the southern law of the State that the duty of a court to apply, to admitted facts a correct principle of law, correct principle of law is such a fundamental and essential element of the judicial process that a litigant cannot be said to have the remedy and by due process of law guaranteed by Section 4 of the Declaration of Rights."

   Rebuttal of Edward Hill
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2853.870" stopTime="2861.794">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Alright, 10 days.
speaker="edward_hill" startTime="2861.794" stopTime="2972.246">
    Mr. Edward Hill 
    And if it please the Court. 
    The position of the City of Tallahassee here is, and we framed our -- the complaint or the information around the ordinance that required the police officer to make an examination of the situation as he found it. 
    And if in his opinion be contemplated, disturbances of the peace and other disturbances, he could go along those persons who were assembled and ask them to then and there disperse. 
    Now, that we think is one of the things that had been written in Talla ordinance specifically to comply with the common law definitions of unlawful assembly that if where they -- where he has -- has the opportunity and has the right and is vested with this opinion procedure. 
    If after he formed this opinion, he orders them to disperse, there is a refusal of dispersal, then the -- the ordinance carries further and says that they are then and there deemed to be unlawfully deemed guilty of disorderly conduct. 
    And if they are then deemed disorderly -- guilty of disorderly conduct, you have an assembly of persons deemed guilty of disorderly conduct and thereby, they become a -- a disorderly and unlawful assembly. 
    Now, let's work back to the facts in this thing. 
    These persons came to Tallahassee with no valid purpose known to the persons who are charged with responsibility of law and order that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2972.246" stopTime="2973.776">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    With no what? 
    I didn't understand.
speaker="edward_hill" startTime="2973.776" stopTime="3106.293">
    Mr. Edward Hill 
    They had no advance knowledge of the -- of the reasons why they were coming there. 
    They -- there were some advance publicity that filtered them to Tallahassee by virtue of the press and the like and they were called "Freedom Riders" and they -- they notified the press in advance that they are coming for obvious reasons so that they can be met and their views disseminated in that manner. 
    With that advance knowledge, the City of Tallahassee furnished them what we thought was adequate protection because we -- we did not want any instances that it -- or incidents that it happened like in other places. 
    For a period of time, as Mr. Dixon says, they were merely observed here and there. 
    They were allowed to go in and out of the waiting room, in the washroom and the eating facilities of the bus station there. 
    And there were people -- yes, sir, there were. 
    There were people there who are contrary to their views and they were somewhat hostile. 
    But all of those people would disperse and clear the way. 
    And as far as equal protection of the law is concern, they will give them every protection that it was possible to give them even more than equal, more protection that was given anybody else in Tallahassee at that time. 
    After they had eaten and so tested these facilities, which we assumed to be their right under their right to assemble and their right of free speech, they went from there to the airport and as Mr. Dixon says, they found the airport restaurant closed. 
    They were not denied the use of the restaurant facilities. 
    They were not denied the use of the airport waiting room facilities. 
    But this restroom -- this restaurant itself which is the Savarin Restaurant in the Tallahassee Municipal Airport was closed and the record indicates that it was closed for repairs. 
    Counsel points out that there was a two-fold reason. 
    One, to repair certain machinery, two, that since this repair to this machinery was necessary, then this was the right time to do it. 
    We contend that that's not an unlawful exercise of the discretion by an authority of that kind to choose a proper time when there is that possibility of some type of disorder in the area.So --

    But in cases of this kind, you find that community somewhat seating and it's impossible to -- to really get everything like that and to the -- to the record.

    The continued activity which they knew and did result in disturbance that was created there at the scene. 
    We maintain that -- that the length of time that's involved in -- in this thing has a great deal of bearing on it. 
    In the many of your cases of unlawful assembly, one he cites -- that cited the Aaron against -- States versus Butterworth, the man was asked, "What do you do in here?" 
    And he just said, "Fellow worker," so on so on. 
    They arrested him just like that. 
    But these people were given every opportunity in -- to test here and the city provided them that -- that particular protection that they need. 
    I -- and -- and after it lasted as long as it did, those persons in authority found that it was necessary to attempt to disperse them. 
    Now, I -- I -- without -- it's not -- it's not in my brief but in -- in Edwards versus South Carolina, Justice Clark says that even though the city manager, and he was a city manager at that time, might have been honestly mistaken as to the eminence of danger, this was certainly a reasonable request that it was his request to disperse by the city's top executive officer in an effort to avoid the public poll and that's -- that's generally the theory on which (Inaudible).

    Mr. Edward Hill 
    No, sir, I didn't -- I didn't say that. 
    I said that the factual situation between the two cases involves a prolonged period of time and -- and if -- if Edwards had -- had those people stayed down there for hours and hours and days and days and -- and constituted a tumultuous or turmoil situation in that community, then you might have considered it differently, I don't know. 
    But we are asking you here to affirm this decision -- affirm this decision by our Circuit Court. 
    Here, after these people have been given every and ample opportunity to express their views. 
    And then when the community becomes involved, we think that they ought us pursue other and peaceful and lawful methods. 
    And there are others court review and the like. 
    In answer to the question that was raised about the interstate commerce clause, we feel and we do not admit that the interstate commerce clause is involved in this thing. 
    The testimony of the Eastern Airlines manager himself under -- under cross-examination, I believe it was, testified that the tickets were cancelled. 
    The only thing I can do is to rely on that. 
    The tickets were cancelled according the Eastern Air and will and they say so. 
    The fact that I've got an Eastern Airline ticket in my briefcase, it's over there, doesn't bring me within the purview of the interstate commerce clause for every activities that I might have become engaged in -- here in Tallahassee -- I mean here in Washington. 
    So we urged that -- that the essential elements of defense have been proved as they were set out in the information. 
    That it was a lawful exercise of the police power when there was imminent danger of a right to aboard public brawl, quoting again from Mr. Clark -- I mean Justice Clark. 
    And we urged that -- that no expressed activity of persons that cause breaches of the peace should be considered free speech that they -- that if they get into the realm of causing breaches of the peace and disturbance that they should use other lawful and peaceful methods. 
    This is an unlawful assembly and I don't think the question of unlawful assembly in factual situation to this kind and a tense situation to this kind had been presented to this Court, breaches of the peace, disorderly conduct and nevertheless, other charges have been printed -- presented in other --

    Now, it might be that they are aware into that (Inaudible) -- it might be that they are aware that they are trading on a rather dangerous grants. 
    But for definition purposes, I ran into a matter that cited in my brief on page 17 that says, "Few words possess the precision of mathematical symbols. 
    Most statute must deal," this is Boyce Motor Lines versus United States, "must deal with untold and unforeseen variations and factual situations in the practical necessity discharged in the business of Government inevitably limits this specificity with which legislators can spell out prohibitions." 
    And it goes on and it say, "Nor is it unfair to require that one who deliberately goes close to an area of proscribe conduct shall take the risk that he may cause the line." 
    And that's -- that's the position here.

   Argument of Roy T. Rhodes
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4411.805" stopTime="4413.607">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Rhodes.
speaker="roy_t_rhodes" startTime="4413.607" stopTime="4701.377">
    Mr. Roy T. Rhodes 
    Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen. 
    If I might address myself an issue to the question raised by Justice Black, dealing with the Edward decision from Carolina in distinguish, if I may, the application of the theory expressed by Justice Clark, not denied by the majority of this Court in the different set of factual situation that we have in this instance. 
    In the Edward decision, you say that under the circumstances that this group of demonstrator were arrested that they were denied the exercise of federal constitutional rights. 
    Now, those demonstrators had arrived at a place before the building the house of legislation of that State and it had been there from all late that morning for a period of maybe an hour, the best I could determine from the record. 
    During that period of time, the temperature within which they found themselves had changed to some degree. 
    But nonetheless, they had continued to exercise what you recognize is their right of free speech and freedom of assembly. 
    Then, the officer in charge or the responsible person charge with the preservation of peace to that community determined that they continue exercise of that right that you recognized constituted a breach of the peace, the majority of this Court said no. 
    That -- that did not constitute a breach of the peace that it constituted the continued exercise of a constitutional right which you recognized and therefore, reversed the decisions. 
    Our position is that in the language expressed by Justice Clark in the dissent in that case that he recognized something that this Court has not declined to recognize, that is a corresponding responsibility and a corresponding constitutional duty on the part of those charged with the preservation of peace and tranquility within a community irrespective of the exercise of a constitutional right of an individual. 
    Under the ordinance in question in the City of Tallahassee, the ordinance provided that within the opinion of those charged under the ordinance with carrying in to force in effect, they work of the opinion and concerned with the breach of the peace that is the assembly of the such person would tend to create a disturbance. 
    That mean the language of the statute. 
    That's not fraud, nebulous language but rather specific language that somebody under the terms of the ordinance is charged with the responsibility of carrying out. 
    Now, when, under those circumstances, that law enforcement officer determines that the continued assemblage of persons would tend to create a disturbance or to incite a riot or other disorderly conduct and so forth, that it becomes an unlawful assembly. 
    That's a very specific charge. 
    And factually in the instance before the Court, we have a situation in which the petitions exercised this right, not for a matter of an hour or hour and a half or half a day but from about the middle of day on Thursday when they got to Tallahassee until the back in the middle of the following day when they were ultimately arrested. 
    You have a record which reflects the change during that period of time of some 24 hours of the temperature and atmosphere within which they had, 24-hour period, been exercising that right. 
    What we are saying is that the exercise of a constitutional right are the continued pursuit of what is initially a lawful pursuit can become an unlawful pursuit or can become the abuse of a constitutional right in light of a specific ordinance or a corresponding constitutional duty placed upon those charges of responsibility of preserving the peace and tranquility within the community.

   Argument of Carl Rachlin

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of this Honorable Court. 
    I wish to thank the Court for the privilege of submitting a supplemental memorandum. 
    As a non-member of the Florida Bar, I must confess to the difficulties of trying to understand the vagaries of the Florida appellate procedure appeared in this case at about a late date but I have great concern for the petitioners here in this general counsel for the organization which sponsored their trip where there's one that may be known to some of you the Congress of Racial Equality. 
    In any event, I would like to suggest one-forth which we will brief in this -- in this memorandum to permit me to draw the analogy of Fay against Noia. 
    At the time the petition was filed with this Court, there was no other place they could go. 
    The petition for certiorari to this Court was timely filed in that limited sense. 
    The time to file such a petition had already expired in the Florida court. 
    There was no possibility of any remedy in the Florida court. 
    And if I understand, the reasonable inferences of Fay against Noia and I say -- suggest you expand this argument perhaps in a -- of memorandum.Despite the laps of some 20 years in that case, this Court undertook to entertain the petition for habeas corpus even though all the remedies that may have been available to the petitioner in Fay against Noia had not been exhausted in the State of New York. 
    But as I suggest, we will try to develop this argument at some greater length. 
    Now, it is our position --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible) may I -- may I suggest that I thought Fay and Noia tried carefully to draw the line between jurisdiction on direct review and the jurisdiction of a federal habeas corpus put on -- on collateral. 
    And what we're dealing with here is I -- this Court's jurisdiction to hear this case at all on direct review of the Florida courts when the avenues of appeal and suggestion is at least these had not been exhausted that they should have been in the Florida court.
speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="5104.047" stopTime="5376.767">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Your Honor, I recognize there is that distinction and this is something we will have to attempt to persuade you in this memorandum, not we are going to have -- we would in 10 days. 
    With regard to the few comments I would like to make with regard to the merits of this proceeding. 
    It is our -- adopted -- it is our position to (Inaudible) if it should have been read at all, it's read to the wrong people. 
    This case and the similar ones that have appeared before this Court, and once that I have tried in some of the other States in the United States, always seem to turn on a kind of blackmail theory of law. 
    If I don't like what you have to say, I get up a crowd, I make noise and then I'm arrested for disorderly conduct or as in the case here for a violation of the -- of the so called riot act. 
    This -- we -- we suggest that this approach is really part of the discriminatory segregation attitude of the community. 
    And I -- I would like to refer this Court to -- to page 18 of the respondent's brief in this Court because while the comments are entirely irrelevant to a legal proceeding, they illustrate perfectly the state of mind that was gathering together against the petitioners in this case. 
    And I read from the top of the page, part of this brief is written on August 28th, 1963. 
    As one of the riders was reading the morning papers under a byline of a national news syndicate, the main headlines refer to the mass march of certain persons, predominantly negro who are marching in groups of thousands of persons on Washington D.C., the capital of this country, in protest and to demonstrate. 
    Certainly, but no orderly purpose other than to show some type of brute or political strength. 
    Respondent urges that such a demonstration and protest is an unlawful assembly. 
    Now, this, of course, is quite irrelevant to this proceeding. 
    But I think it shows the state of mind of the public officials of Tallahassee. 
    They were -- it is clear that anything that the petitioners did in this case, anything they did at all, their mere presence in an integrated group would have -- would have been flamed the community and they were going to arrest them. 
    The same thing happened in our -- one of our previous cases, Taylor against Louisiana, where the negroes in the bus station at Shreveport -- I think the only other freedom right case that has come to this Court on the merits, the same type of situation arose. 
    And of course, this Court has spoken in Garner against Louisiana on a similar type situation where the guinea pig becomes the crime -- the committer of the crime because he is roasted. 
    This is really what have comes down to. 
    Mr. Rhodes said a moment ago that it was his view that when in the opinion of those carrying out the ordinance, the assemblage would tend to create a disturbance that becomes unlawful. 
    We suggest, and I suggest in closing, that if these were the law, we would have a literal police state in the United States. 
    I think the cases of this Court, as well as in many other higher courts, have previously decided that there is a right upon the part of the citizen to refuse to obey an illegal order of a police official. 
    Since no acts of any kind are shown in this record of any illegal conduct on the part of these petitioners, I think based upon the previous decisions of this Court, that the petitioners had the right to refuse, to obey the illegal order of the policemen. 
    If they do not have that right, then we have a police state. 
    With that, I trust the Court will forgive if I don't use all the time that is available to us but we will perhaps exercise that right by the supplementary memorandum. 
    I wish to thank the Court for the opportunity herein.
