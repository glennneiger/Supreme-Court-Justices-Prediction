Hardy v. United States

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 112, Zebedee Hardy, Petitioner, versus United States. 
    Mr. Ratner.

    Mr. Mozart G. Ratner 
    May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals from District of Columbia, this case presents the question whether an indigent convict confronted with the District Court finding that his appeal or would be appeal is not taken in good faith is entitled to a complete stenographic transcript to unable his court appointed counsel to search for hidden error. 
    For us, it is both the beginning and the end of the argument that in the federal system, in the first place under rule 52 (b) hidden error is ground for reversal. 
    And in the second place that a solvent defendant can provide his counsel a complete stenographic transcript to search. 
    That brings denial of a complete transcript to an indigent squarely within Douglas against California, "Where the errors are hidden, the indigent has only the right to a meaningless ritual, while the rich man has a meaningful appeal.” 
    The Governments says, “So what?” 
    The gap is only a product of the indigent's poverty and Government is not required to equalize economic condition. 
    But when the consequence of poverty is inability to defend a criminal conviction, overcoming the disability is not to equalize economic condition. 
    It is to equalize the criminal justice under law. 
    If Government is under no obligation to overcome the disabilities of poverty when it under takes a criminal prosecution or would borrow criminal appeal, why should it have to supply an indigent with counsel or with any record at all? 
    Government is constitutionally required to do these things because in administering criminal justice, it must overcome disabilities resulting from poverty just as much as it practically can. 
    In Norvell versus Illinois, this Court held that the State was not obliged to supply a transcript because through no fault of the State, the transcript was simply unavailable. 
    The inescapable implication is that the transcript had been available. 
    The State would have been compelled to supply it. 
    What otherwise could we possibly mean when we claim to provide in our system equal justice under law for the rich and for the poor. 
    To deny a poor man the appellant review which is available to a convict with money is to mock the very idea of equality, nothing could be more damaging to democracy at home or abroad than the notion that to us, the majestic equality of which the law speaks means only that the rich and the poor alike have no right to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets and to steal bread.

    I submit that the right to take the appeal depends upon the right to search for the hidden error in a complete transcript. 
    And if that is withheld from the indigent conflict, he is being deprived of equal justice under law.

    As far as I'm concerned, any system which makes hidden error a ground for reversal and does it reply a proper observation and notice and preservation of the point below carries with it inevitably the requirement of the opportunity to find the error be accorded. 
    And when you add to that, that in the federal system, alright, any state system that adds to that the rule that any paying defendant has a right to buy an opportunity to buy the whole transcript then I say juxtaposition this Court is held and I think due process and equal protection both jointly are denied by the denial to the man for indigency of the juxtaposition of those privileges to search in a complete transcript for hidden error.

    If it escapes the trial counsel when he tried the case, he obviously hasn't discovered it since the end of trial. 
    The court reporter on reading it may or may not revealed it, but the chances are he won't because appellant lawyers know generally that the place you get your idea is by reading and pondering a transcript and not by hearing somebody talked about it.

    Mr. Mozart G. Ratner 
    I think that it did -- well, the notion that the transcript ought to be denied in the federal system is based on the assumption that somehow converses responsible for this result. 
    And then I think it's based done on misreading of 28 U.S.C. Section 1915. 
    The assumptions are that under that statute, the indigent unlike the solvent defendant either has the one assumed the burden of proving substantiality or to specify errors as a condition of being allowed to appeal in the form of proverbs. 
    Now, if either of those disparities really existed, if Congress really provided for that, then a serious constitutional question would be presented. 
    But copied, as we read it put an end to the first idea. 
    The burden is not on the indigent but on the Government to prove insubstantiality and there is nothing in the second section which lends the slightest support to the second idea. 
    All that Section 1915 requires is that the convict state in his affidavit, "The nature of the action defense or appeal and defiance belief that he's entitled to redress." 
    If the indigent is not required to specify errors at that stage of the case, how can it possibly be argued that Congress tried the indigents appointed counsel to those portions of the record which relate to errors that the indigent pro se has superfluously specified. 
    The only semblance of plausibility as we see it in the Government's argument is that Section 1915 does say that in appeal may not be taken inform of papyrus, if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith. 
    The consequence of that provision is that where the error is hidden, the indigenous confronted with the District Court finding of frivolity before his appellant counsel has even with a chance to look at the record whereas the solvent defendant cannot be faced with a challenged on frivolity ground until his appellant counsel has either filed his statement of points on appeal or has filed his brief on the merits. 
    Rule 75 (b), if the federal has criminal procedures specifically provide that no assignment of errors is necessary, we take it that that is true in the form of papyrus case as much than any other. 
    It is only if the appellant does not designate for inclusion the complete record at all the proceedings and evidence in the action that he's required to serve with his designation a concise statement of the points on which he intense to rely on appeal. 
    Now of course, before any paid lawyer would file a statement of points on appeal, he will have coned the entire stenographic record for every piece of reversible error he can possibly find.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="868.468" stopTime="893.489">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In this Mr. Ratner, a little -- different argument in the -- in the plain error or the hidden error argument that you -- you're just saying that if you're -- a new counsel come in to the case at the appellant state must have the chance or the indigent is entitled to have him and look the record to see what points he wants to make?
speaker="mozart_g_ratner" startTime="893.489" stopTime="959.998">
    Mr. Mozart G. Ratner 
    Well, I don't know that it's a really different point. 
    What I'm -- I'm suggesting that even -- even counsel would try the case would be entitled to a second crack at the record. 
    Suppose he hadn't seen it before, suppose that it hadn't been prepared until the time of the appeal, he would be entitled at the time he noted the appeal it seems to me or requested leave to appeal when he came in to the -- to that stage of consideration of his case. 
    Suppose he representative throughout, he would be equally entitled to have a complete stenographic transcript to make the initial decision as to whether he's going to take this case up unless than a complete transcript or he wants a complete transcript because that's going to determine whether he makes a statement of points on appeal or not. 
    And then he can't do until he is studying and finding the transcript and decided what is better in -- in this case. 
    If paid counsel has that opportunity in accordance with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, if he has that and it's worthwhile that he haven't -- and if for worthwhile he wouldn't -- rules wouldn't provide to him, that account be withheld from an indigent.

    Mr. Mozart G. Ratner 
    I have no idea Your Honor. 
    I -- I did never saw the transcript and they didn't give it to me and the part I saw of it was very big, it was one volume. 
    But I can imagine that it may have been -- oh there's no point in my guessing, I don't know. 
    Much what I would have known if I had gotten the transcript, I don't know. 
    We submit that the minimum constitutional condition of requiring indigents to face a frivolity hurdle at an earlier state then solvent defendants have to face it, is that indigent's counsel must be provided with the same opportunity paid counsel have to search the record for ammunition to meet such an effect. 
    That means that the entire stenographic record must be made available promptly to appointed counsel faced for the finding of frivolity. 
    The Government says this distracts the tracks unduly from the weight that was be given to the District Court's finding of frivolity, but the Government is very significantly silent about the duty that Ellison poses both on counsel and on the Courts of Appeals to search diligently for error with which to upset the District Court. 
    It is that word as -- we remarked, determined colloquy with Mr. Justice Goldberg which this Court has never envisage it seems to me before in this context in which requires the result for which we contempt. 
    Restriction of transcripts to indigents explained as a safeguard against the wasteful abuse of the appellant process. 
    But as long as the plain error rules stand withholding a full transcript from indigents could be justified only if there were some connection between the defendant's solvency and the potentiality of unnoticed error so that there would be less chance on hidden error in indigent's cases than in other. 
    Well, there is a connection, alright, but it works just the other way around. 
    This Court observed in Coppedge that forma pauperis defendants are generally less ably defended in the trial court than solvent one. 
    Therefore, it is more not less likely that the records in the case of the indigent will contain unnoticed plain error. 
    Obviously therefore, to make ability to pay the test for opportunity to search a record for unnoticed error is that their impunity of invidious discrimination. 
    Of course as I say, our argument would have no relevancy in a judicial system in which no appeal can be taken except for errors noted and preserved the law. 
    This, we think, is all this Court had in mind when it reaffirmed in Draper versus Washington, Griffin statement that a state did not provide parts of the stenographic transcript which are not germane to an appeal nor our courts need we be concerned about problems which may exist when transcript tuck unavailable, for Congress is to make sure that in the federal system, transcripts are available, and where a transcript is available, Government must supply it. 
    Every appellate lawyer knows that in searching for hidden error, there can be no substitute for a stenographic transcript. 
    Thank you.

    It seems to me, it's that likelihood or unlikelihood, it must be weighed against the cost and against the probability of a wealthy defendant obtaining the same transcript under the same circumstances.

    It may not be but at least, it is important I think, to -- to point out that it's not only those defendants who claim inability to allege error and who must, therefore, have a transcript to search for error, would be entitled to a transcript. 
    But surely, those who assign error, should by the same standard of equality, be entitled to the remaining transcript to search for additional error. 
    The notion that a complete transcript should be made available in every case is clearly contrary to every decision on this subject which this Court has rendered thus far. 
    Mr. Justice Goldberg point out that the Draper decision, which I cite in support of this proposition, involved the jurisdiction which plain error was not noticeable. 
    That, however, can hardly be said to distinguish Johnson involving the federal courts and Coppedge which clearly implies that only -- it says -- that only such portions of the transcript as are necessary to evaluate the claims actually made, need to be finished. 
    All of that would have been unnecessary I suggest if a full transcript is required in every case. 
    Likewise Griffin versus Illinois makes it clear that a full transcript is not required in every case. 
    It is also clearly contrary to the policy of Section 1950 to acquire a transcript, a full transcript in every case. 
    Technically, I suppose that the granting of the transcript is not the same as the granting of the appeal. 
    No argument on that basis has been made. 
    However, the statute insofar as it addresses itself to the question of a record at all seems to talk of the record being granted after the trans -- after the appeal has been granted. 
    Likewise, Section 753 (e) of Title 28, envisages a transcript granted after lead to appear in forma pauperis. 
    In the court below, seemingly recognizing the -- this problem uses the form whereby they grant the appeal to the extent to requiring the Government to furnish such and such portion of the transcript in this case, the whole of the Government's evidence. 
    The most important hurdle to overcome it seems to me in Section 1915 is the prohibition on appeals in forma pauperis where the trial judge has certified that the appeal is frivolous and not taken in good faith.

    That never happens today because the indigent pro se makes some claim of error before his counsel has a chance to disavowing and therefore, he gets some transcripts. 
    Under the new practice, this result had been happened. 
    I will say, in answer to the Chief Justice that we do feel it necessary for the Court to determine before remanding this case that it should agree with us, that there is not a right to a complete transcript in every case, merely to search for error.

    Such as the transcript and then the Court of Appeal has recognized that in a case where trial counsel had died, the United States Attorney who is normally consulted had left Government service, then the Court realized that the only practical way for appellate counsel to do his job was on a full transcript which the Court did order. 
    But in very Ingram case, the case which follows this one and the light of which we suggest this case should be remanded, the Court distinguished between that unusual situation where trial counsel is no longer available and the normal situation where he can be consulted.

    That chance seems to me, at least equal to the chance of an injustice resulting from the denial of transcript under these unusual circumstances. 
    In the best of all possible wills, everyone, rich and poor, would be given a free transcript but no one has suggested that nor would that be by any stretch of the imagination possible under the existing statutes.

    But there is a difference between that rule which treats everyone alike, truly treats everyone alike and the rule which requires the man with money who is unable to make the affidavit of poverty to weigh the -- how worthwhile it is to pay for a transcript. 
    He may well decide unless his sentence is severe or unless his attorney advises him that there's some real point in appeal not to buy transcript merely on the hope that some error will be found there.

    May I ask you a question Mr. Claiborne? 
    Assuming that (Inaudible)

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    I think the Court would insist on counsel's giving the Court a little more information. 
    If he gave the Court more information about the case and still insisted that he was unable to discover any basis for error, having already received the Government's evidence, I think the Court might well deny any further transcript, and ultimately might well deny the appeal after looking at the Government's transcript. 
    On the other hand, that decision, Ingram was a two to three decision -- a two to one decision. 
    Dissenting view was that the new rule should be applied retrospectively and that view may very well prevail on the remand of this case. 
    In which event, since the petitioner pro se made sufficient allegations to require in the entire transcript, he would receive an entire transcript. 
    I can't confidently predict what would happen in the Court of Appeal. 
    One question I think, I should in or kindly advise the Court as to the cost of indigent transcripts, it has gone up very measurably from -- in 1960, the Administrative Office advises me the cost of the transcripts in criminal cases to indigents criminal cases involving United States of course 74,500, last year, fiscal 1963, $145,000.

    That -- to that must be added the cost of printing joint appendix of the cost are involved in processing these appeals but the cost of joint appendix would not exceed about $20,000 under -- assuming the number of appeals provided here. 
    This has nothing for the cost of a program which would allow every case be prosecuted with a full transcript.

    Mr. Ratner.
speaker="mozart_g_ratner" startTime="3055.246" stopTime="3186.105">
    Mr. Mozart G. Ratner 
    May it please the Court. 
    To me, the one thing that Mr. Claiborne's discussion of the shifting sands of Court of Appeals policy has done is to demonstrate that there is no basis for the assumption which Mr. Harlan indulged when he asked Mr. Claiborne what this case was about. 
    Namely, whether assuming Congress has spoken on this subject, then are we who reverse Congress. 
    If Congress has spoken on this subject, how does it happen that the Government and the Court of Appeals can decide to grant indigents without making anymore claim of error than has been made in this case, a full transcript if the cost is under $200 but not if it's over it? 
    Where in the statutes does it say that it equals an appeal to give a transcript if the cost is under $200 but it doesn't equal an appeal if the cost is over $200? 
    Where in Section 1915 or any other statute of the code does it say that in order to honor the District Court's certificate of frivolity, you must deny a transcript to an indigent in order to permit his counsel an opportunity to prove that the District Court is wrong? 
    The fact to the matter is that this policy of the Court of Appeals are requiring counsel to come forward with some assurance to the Court that they have done a job of investigation. 
    It seems to me, it can do nothing but to lead, to invite something less than complete candidate for counsel. 
    How can counsel in good faith say that there's a substantial basis to allege that there is inadequate evidence in the record that the District Attorney has been unduly pierced in his attack upon the defendant if he hasn't read what has been said? 
    Whose word is he to take of this? 
    Is this the way we expect lawyers to operate? 
    Is this the kind of representations to the Court have a right from expect from Bar? 
    I don't believe it and I think that to avoid what to me is an unseemly business, this Court in the exercise of its supervisory power should demand that lawyers' function in a way that appellate lawyers always function. 
    By reading a transcript, they can possible lay their hands on it in making statements based on fact instead of hypothesis and suspicion.

    What I suggest to the Court, Congress really has decided. 
    It's the problem that Mr. Claiborne would set it large. 
    Congress has really decided the defendants who can afford to pay for transcripts should pay for it. 
    And by allowing indigents to appeal, whenever they haven't got a frivolous case, Congress has necessarily decided by implication that the Government could -- should pay for their transcripts because without it, we just cannot know whether their case is frivolous or not. 
    Thank you.
