    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    I have just a few remarks if I may and I'd like to say this to Mr. Justice Stewart, the question about Title 10. 
    But I should have in answer to your question about its construction indicated to you that the Supreme Court of -- of Alabama has already construed the statute in the way that we suggest. 
    This is in (Inaudible) versus Cleveland Motor Company case which it has given the construction of the statute that is merely a genuine -- at least genuine service of process statute. 
    The motion for rehearing which is set out on page 213 as all of the assignment of errors really or assignments of errors are in fact the restatement of the -- all the allegations which have set -- set or which have been set out there. 
    And the question to Mr. Justice Black asked about the application of the rules as to whether they were discretionary. 
    We have set out in -- in our main brief at page 29, a list of cases which we think will support our -- our contention that there has been a departure from these rules and that the Supreme Court of Alabama does indicate that that the rules have not been complied with -- that they will go through the merits anyway. 
    One point I'll finally -- the record of -- the entire record is in the -- is in the clerk's office and that insofar as the Attorney General's office is concerned that in our brief, we argue, our brief was devoted almost entirely to the merits of this cause. 
    We filed our brief here first and we would want to point out to the Court that if there was concern in the Attorney General about meeting the argument on -- on the merits, that they had the opportunity at that time.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Carter, assuming for the moment that the Alabama rule at the court below ap -- applied, was it valid, acceptable -- acceptable state grounds for doing what it is, then what matters are here on the merits? 
    Anything?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="145.010" stopTime="147.011">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    No.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="147.011" stopTime="165.070">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Except fully the -- the proposition that the -- that the rule below that -- quite a proper rule and insulates something anyway from review here.Is there anything left there for review here on the merits?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="165.070" stopTime="230.698">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, I would think that the -- all of the -- I would say first that all of the assignment of errors, we have filed the assignments of error, we made them a part of our motion for rehearing and therefore presented them to the court below and the court below disposed of them in trial court. 
    We made and put them in a form of assignments of error and presented them to the -- to the court of -- to the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    The -- now, I would say that all of them -- but certainly, where the Court indicates that the assignment that we have made about the sufficiency of the weight of the evidence which is the questions that you were addressing to Mr. Madison and indicates that these are without merits. 
    I think that we would be in a position to argue that those have to be here because merit must mean merit. 
    I don't know what it means other than that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="230.698" stopTime="252.953">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the trouble is -- of course the trouble with my point on the specific ones I raised was it -- was it within those assignments of error, no federal question was raised. 
    It's true that the -- that the -- the assignment didn't say the sufficiency of the evidence that -- and the Supreme Court perhaps passed on the merits of that -- that point. 
    But it didn't have to construe them in federal issue.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="252.953" stopTime="253.515">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    I would --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="253.515" stopTime="255.216">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That was reviewable here.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="255.216" stopTime="261.985">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    I would think Your -- Your Honor that -- doesn't that bring us into the case of Thompson versus Louisville?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="261.985" stopTime="266.859">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that -- that -- It just doesn't have to be worded that way.That's all, that assignment of error. 
    It --
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="266.859" stopTime="266.943">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    But --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="266.943" stopTime="270.898">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- certainly -- there was another assignment of error raised the point.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="270.898" stopTime="302.081">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    But -- but if we argue -- we say that the decree below is -- is not accorded with the weight of the evidence. 
    And -- and as a matter of fact, that you find that it's not. 
    It seems to -- it seems to me that under the -- under the doctrine of Thompson versus Louisville and Wright versus Georgia, I think this Court -- this -- this is a due process question as to whether there is a sufficient ground upon which the decree could be sustained. 
    And in view of the fact that what we are (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="302.081" stopTime="310.408">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But normally, you don't raise Thompson -- the Thompson point by saying that he -- the judgment is against the weight of the evidence.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="310.408" stopTime="331.000">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    No, no. 
    That -- that's true but I -- I'm -- I'm saying that we raised it, the Court held and -- and apparently indicated that -- that by denying it on the merits that there was sufficient evidence. 
    Now, I would think that under the long standing doctrine here where the Court is able to make its own independent examination of the error --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="331.000" stopTime="349.678">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Alright. 
    Well, let's assume that -- assume then that the Thompson point is here because they passed on the -- on the merits of those particular times. 
    What other point is here, assuming that the Alabama rule is valid?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="349.678" stopTime="353.380">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Just give me one -- about two minutes and I --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="353.380" stopTime="357.955">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I don't mean to really take up your time Mr. Carter, you got -- you go ahead, I mean.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="357.955" stopTime="535.161">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, I -- I would think in my own open argument in regard to it is that -- is that as a matter of -- of fact, I would think that all of the assignments would be here even assuming that the -- that the decree is -- that the rule of -- of Alabama is valid. 
    Because as a -- because as a matter of fact, we did discuss in our -- in our brief on the merit, each and every one of the assignments except one. 
    The Supreme Court of -- of Alabama has said because you have argued this -- you have argued one together -- ones without the merit and therefore, we won't -- we won't consider any of them. 
    But I suppose what I'm really doing is, I'm going now to attack the rule which is not really the question that you asked. 
    The problem of course that we have with this is that apparently, we raised 23 assignments of errors and as we made 23 points, the Supreme Court of Alabama would've held that we were within the rules. 
    We thought that we were giving assistance and help to the Court by arguing the -- the cases as we did. 
    I would say also that if the questions that were raised to Mr. Madison indicate the difficulties, Madison is the Assistant Attorney General of Alabama. 
    The difficulty of interpreting the rules of the Alabama court and, although Alabama has said the rules are not traps. 
    Mr. Madison seems to have difficulty in telling the Court how the rules are applied or even what the rules are. 
    And I would suggest to the Court that if the Attorney General seems to have that difficulty then certainly an ordinary practitioner would also. 
    And finally, the cash bond issue which was raised. 
    I want to say that on this cash bond, that in the argument before the Supreme Court of Alabama and I think I'm quoting Mr. Madison correctly “indicated to the Supreme Court of Alabama that this was a question but it was not being pressed by him.” 
    Now, the Supreme Court of Alabama knew this and yet passed upon -- dismissed the case or dispose of it on the grounds that are now before this Court. 
    On the ordinary rules and procedure, I would assume that having had it before -- before it that the Court has therefore disposed of it. 
    But by Mr. Madison raising this point in this Court at this time, seeking to preserve it and reinject it into the case, it's -- I think it -- it is clear that the difficulty in the preca -- precarious procedural difficulty in which petitioner would find itself is -- unless this Court finally settles this cause.
