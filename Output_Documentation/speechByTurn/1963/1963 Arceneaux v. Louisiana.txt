   Argument of Bertrand De Blanc
speaker="bertrand_de_blanc" startTime="48.060" stopTime="173.123">
    Mr. Bertrand De Blanc 
    May I proceed Your Honor? 
    May it please the Court. 
    Our position is that the question has become moot. 
    Our position is first that the question has become moot because there is no controversy, that there is no adversity that the relief sought cannot be granted and second that the District Court did not err in denying the accused a preliminary examination and third that the vagrancy laws are not vague, does not penalize our status and that the vagrancy laws have generally been held to be constitution and fourth that no federal question was presented, because no writ of habeas corpus was properly presented to any court. 
    Now Your Honors, I think that this case should be presented to Your Honors on the record and we should stick to the record and the record consists of an affidavit which was made against the accused charging him with vagrancy. 
    That there was a warrant issued for his arrest, a valid warrant issued for his arrest, a valid affidavit made out charging him with vagrancy of crime in the State of Louisiana and that he was found near a structure without being able to account for his presence therein, that was a motion for a preliminary examination made on his behalf by counsel, that after that the state filed a bill of information against the accused based upon the affidavit and based on the same offence.

    Well, Your Honor I could talk off the record and tell you that he was properly arrested. 
    Now there was a Bill of Information filed by the District Attorney charging him with the same offence in the same affidavit, what we do is we do not prosecute in the District Court on affidavits, we prosecute on Bills of Information which are based upon affidavits. 
    We prosecute in city court on affidavits. 
    Now there was a recall of the preliminary examination by the judge based upon the fact that the District Attorney had filed a Bill of Information. 
    There was request for writs and a prayer for preliminary a examination and for habeas corpus.

    Now he has prayed in his preliminary -- request for preliminary examination. 
    He asked for a preliminary examination and he incidentally mentioned the word habeas corpus, but he never at any time asked for habeas corpus, there was never any petition on his part requesting habeas corpus. 
    Habeas corpus has to be made in the name of the State of Louisiana and on the relation of the person in custody. 
    The petition has to state by whom the accused is deprived of his liberty and that was no done. 
    There was no affidavit attached attesting to the truth of the allegation and as a matter of act the accused in this case was actually asking for a preliminary examination. 
    Now Your Honor we feel that that's the record and there is nothing that in that record which shows that the accused was in any way illegally deprived of his liberty. 
    There is nothing in that record that shows that he was kept in jail incommunicado or that he was denied access to his attorney.

    He said he felt that his sentence under the guilty plea would be less than the time he would get in jail.

    The Louisiana statutes require under Article 144, it says that the writ of habeas corpus maybe issued by the Supreme Court or any justice thereof at the instance of the person in actual custody, in any case when the Court may have appellant jurisdiction by the District Court, at the instance of the person in actual custody in their respective districts, provided that neither the Supreme Court nor any justice thereof except in cases provided for in Article 96 and 116 shall issue said writ unless every District Judge of criminal jurisdiction in the district in which the relator is in custody be absent, recused or prevented from some cause from acting and unless such actions, recusation or disability is made to appear by oath of the relator or by other sufficient proof. 
    Now Your Honor the case that I was going to cite if I may, and I've already given it to him this morning was Parker versus Ellis, which citation is 80 Supreme Court 909 decided in 1960 and this is a case which came out of Texas I believe. 
    The accused had already served his sentence in the state penitentiary when the case came up before this Court, and was held by this Court, that this Court would not adjudicate a matter in which it's judgment cannot operate and as the only judicial relief provide for by the statue authorizing the issuance of the habeas corpus writ, is a discharge of the prisoner or his admission to bail and that issue has become moot. 
    Now, we feel that this is the same situation. 
    He voluntarily pleaded guilty to the charge which was filed against him. 
    That was transferred from the District Court, the affidavit was transferred from the District Court to the City Court upon his request to plea guilty in the City Court.

    Now I would like to say this, that this affidavit was transferred, this is the same affidavit, same original affidavit was transferred. 
    We do it all the time because these two Courts have concurrent jurisdiction insofar as misdemeanors are concerned, it was transferred because we do it every week when somebody wants to plead guilty because we have Court there every week, in the City Court and we don't have Court, but once every six months in the District Court for misdemeanors --

    Now, one in the District Court, the Bill of Information was based upon this same affidavit. 
    So as I said we'd prosecute him on Bills of Information of District Court in affidavits of the City Court and in order to clear the record after he had pleaded guilty in City Court on a misdemeanor affidavit then and cross the case, dismiss the case in a District Court just for the record would be clear, so he is not charged with any offence either in the District Court or in the City Court.

speaker="bertrand_de_blanc" startTime="1736.310" stopTime="1872.248">
    Mr. Bertrand De Blanc 
    Thank you. 
    Coming to the point the question of the vagrancy statute, incidentally I just wanted to stress the point that after the District Attorney files a Bill of Information that the accused is no longer entitled as a matter of right to a preliminary examination and that is reason why the Judge recalled his order for a preliminary examination and we do it all the time. 
    The reason simply is that we don't want to try the case twice when the case is coming up in the near future. 
    In this particular case the next couple of weeks we would have been fall, we would be having a misdemeanor week and then also in the view of the fact that we don't prosecute on affidavits that was the reason. 
    Now, I have to go to the vagrancy statute, I have cited cases that show in that, that it's within the police power of the state to enact these vagrancy statutes and that they are passed to prevent crimes that may have flow from vagrancy ways of actions all their life that there is no cases which was cited by the appellant that vagrancy statute was unconstitutional. 
    This one here, the part he is attacking of course is only that part of the statute which provides that no person may be found in here any structure, movable vessel or private grounds without being able to account for their lawful presence they are in, and of course this prevents people from, say lie and awake in a building or structure would be intended to commit a crime. 
    The statutes have been held to be constitutional or valid exercise of police power of the states in the main because these statutes have been upheld as constitutional, as a matter of fact is one in this in the District of Columbia which is very similar to Louisiana's Statute.
