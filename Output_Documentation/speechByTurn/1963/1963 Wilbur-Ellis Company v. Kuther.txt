    Mr. Frank A. Neal 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors, may the Court please. 
    This is a patent case and the issue presented to the Court involves a question of whether or not the acts complained about amounted to impermissible reconstruction. 
    The patent in suit is one for a fish-packing machine. 
    There are five claims to the patent. 
    The mode of operation of the machine might be of interest to the Court. 
    I don't know how familiar the Court is with the record. 
    In any event, fish are fed in by a plurality of conveyors and, eventually, are deposited in open-top arcuate pockets. 
    After the deposit of the fish in the pockets and arcuate-top open-bottom compressor comes down to compress the bundle of fish into a charge which would fit a cylindrical can.

    Pardon me. 
    It's shaped like this, Your Honor. 
    The fish are in here and this comes down and presses the fish. 
    When that is done, a plunger comes along and ejects the fish into the can. 
    It's a fairly high-speed machine. 
    Now --

    Now, there are four accused machines which were acquired by the petitioner, Wilbur-Ellis, by way of a purchase. 
    In other words, the machines were the subject of an outright and unconditional sale stemming from the respondent. 
    These machines, at least three of the four, were in a fairly sad condition due to corrosion and so forth. 
    And, the -- each of those three machines were purchased at a cost of $1,250 a piece.

    The packing plant went out of business about 1952 and it remained -- the machinery and the rest of the contents of the plant remained there inactive and exposed to salt, sea air, and that type of thing. 
    As a consequence, the machines were corroded. 
    In any event, the petitioner Wilbur-Ellis acquired these machines at $1,250 a piece and then went to the other petitioner, Mr. Leuschner, and asked him to recondition these machines, in this sense, to put them in operating condition and also to do that which was necessary to adapt them to feel what is know in the trade as “5-ounce cans,” as distinguished from “1-pound tall cans.” 
    “5-ounce cans” are considerably smaller. 
    There was a fourth machine. 
    The genesis of the fourth machine is a little shady in the light of the record here. 
    Opposing counsel and I know where it came from. 
    We know that it cost maybe a couple hundred dollars more for Wilber-Ellis to acquire. 
    We know that it was in somewhat better condition than the three which had been standing down around Moss Landing, South of Monterey.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="436.701" stopTime="459.012">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I'm not talking against the -- as the manufacturer is making a patented machine and selling it to the public makes two sizes of it -- two sizes of it. 
    And, it sells one size to one customer who promptly converts it to the other size. 
    It's your position that there's no infringement then?
speaker="frank_a_neal" startTime="459.012" stopTime="775.236">
    Mr. Frank A. Neal 
    Well, it depends on what is required to convert it to the other size. 
    Now, here, in order to convert the original machines, after they had been cleaned up to the 5-ounce can handling size, it was necessary to either resize or relocated six parts. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit characterized the total number of parts as being in the order of 35. 
    This would cover essential parts, and I use the word “essential” in the sense that the parts which are essential are recited in the claims. 
    They are elements of the claims. 
    35, undoubtedly, includes both essential and non-essential parts but the 35 parts were in the machines which embodied the patented entity. 
    Now, the Court might be interested in the extent to which each of the five claims of the patent was affected by the changes of the six parts. 
    Now, for example, claim one was directed or is directed to the combination of nine elements. 
    When I say elements, I should explain it further in this sense. 
    It calls for means for delivering produce to the receivers. 
    Now, the means may embrace a number of elements. 
    It calls for a plurality of radially disposed arms, so that were -- when we're talking about nine elements, we're really talking about nine classes of elements here. 
    And, out of those nine classes of elements called for in claim one, six out of nine were either resized or relocated in order to adapt these machines to handle the smaller cans. 
    Claim two calls for the combination of some-seven groups of elements and, in order to modify the machines to handle the smaller cans, three out of those seven groups of elements were modified. 
    Claim three calls for a combination of four groups of elements. 
    It is interesting, I believe, to advise the Court that no one of the four elements of claim three was affected by these resizing or relocation. 
    Claim four calls for a combination of seven groups of elements, three of which were modified as to size or location. 
    Claim five calls for five groups of elements, three out of the five having been either resized or relocated. 
    Now, as I represent it to the Court and as the record and the findings will bear out, the four machines in question were sold outright and unconditionally. 
    Hence, they had become fully released from the patent monopoly. 
    This Court has held that many times in connection with cases of this general type and cases which are fairly closely related, among such cases, the earlier -- among such earlier cases of this type decided by this Court was the case of Chappie versus Boston Building wherein, and I'll just quote briefly from the Court's opinion, “by a valid sale and purchase, the patented machine becomes the private individual property of the purchaser and is no longer protected by the laws of United States but by the laws of the state in which it is situated. 
    Hence, it is obvious that if a person legally acquires a title to that which is the subject of letters patent, he may continue to use it until it is worn out or he may repair it or improve upon it as he pleases in the same manner as if dealing with property of any other kind.” 
    In other words, having been fully released from the patent monopoly, the machines in question took upon the full and complete nature of general personal property. 
    As an owner of general personal property, I may destroy it. 
    I may do anything I wish with it. 
    Here, the machines were not destroyed. 
    Instead, they were cleaned up to put them into operative use and less than the entire patented entity was modified. 
    To me, the courts below took the wrong bend in the road at this juncture and when the District Court said that it is the right of the patentee to either put the invention of his patent into use or not to put it into use, and this is clear. 
    This has been decided by this Court in the Paper Bag case. 
    But -- pardon me?

    Mr. Frank A. Neal 
    In the Paper Bag case, Your Honor. 
    But, then, the Court goes on and says this, “since he has the right to keep it entirely out of use, he has the right perforce to put it into use but to attach any condition that he wishes to it, to the use of it.” 
    Now, this was the rationale of the District Court and it was precisely that rationale which this Court rebutted in the case of Motion Picture Patent versus Universal.

    Mr. Frank A. Neal 
    No, that is right, Mr. Justice Goldberg. 
    Now, in the Motion Picture case, their movie projectors were sold outright in the sense that the seller obtained the full consideration for the equipment but he put a notice on the equipment saying “limited to the use with film to the -- to use with films covered by another patent owned by the seller of the equipment.” 
    And, just like the District Court here, the Court there -- I think both courts there, both the district and the court of -- the Appellate Court held that that was already -- it could attach such a condition to the use of that equipment. 
    However, the Court said this, and they had reference to the decision by the court immediately below which had approved that type of an arrangement, “This decision proceeds upon the argument that, since the patentee may withhold his patent all together from public use, he must logically and necessarily be permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he may allow of it.” 
    The defect in this thinking springs from the substituting of inference and argument for the language of the statute and from failure to distinguish between the rights which are given to the inventor by the patent law and which he may assert against all the world through an infringement proceeding and rights which he may create for himself by private contract which, however, are subject to the rules of general as distinguished from those of the patent law. 
    While it is true that under the statute, it says they were and now are, a patentee might withhold his patented machine from public use. 
    Yet, if he consented to use it himself or through others, such use immediately fell within the terms of the statute and, as we have seen, he is thereby restricted to the use of the invention as it is described in the claims of his patent and not as it may be expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it imposed by mere notice to the public. 
    And, I might carry the Motion Picture case one point further in this sense, that it perhaps is even closer to the case at bar than the Aro case because, while respondent here is really complaining about a making in the sent -- in the sense of a reconstruction, at bottom, what he is really complaining about is a conversion of the machine to a new use, which new use was never made in the machine by the petitioners. 
    In that sense, named -- in talking about 1-pound cans, and so forth, as compared to 5-ounce cans, this case is not unlike, in too great a sense, the motion picture case because they are now talking about the materials that go through or which are processed by the machines covered by the patent.

    Mr. Frank A. Neal 
    Well, it might be of interest to the Court also to -- I don't think I mentioned this, but to give the Court some idea as to what was involved in getting these machines into condition to put them to use with 5-ounce cans. 
    There was the initial purchase price of $1,250 per machine. 
    Then, Mr. Leuschner charged $1,600 and that's broken down in this manner. 
    $1,350 of which was to clean the machines up, $250 of which was to affect these matters of resizing or relocation and, now, the respondent has his hand in petitioner's pocket to the tune of $1,500 per machine as a second royalty. 
    Now, the Circuit Court didn't expressly follow the rationale of the District Court which I have just spoken of. 
    However, it referred to the District Court's decision as a well-reasoned one and the Circuit Court fell in with the First Co -- Circuit and the Eighth Circuit where you -- where the courts were faced with the matter of resizing or relocating or enhancing capacity of patented machinery. 
    In the George Close versus Ideal Machinery Company case, which is a First Circuit case, you had a candy-wrapping machine adapted as it was made and sold to wrap -- to cut and wrap caramels of a specific size. 
    The owner of the machine changed the machine by re-spacing the cutting knives and whatever else was involved so that it would produce a slightly larger caramel. 
    And, of course, he was charged with infringement, suit ensued, both courts held that that type of thing amounted to an infringement by way of reconstruction. 
    But, there, the First Circuit, they said the test was this. 
    The test was whether the identity of the machine had been changed and they -- the court equated change in identity with change in capacity. 
    Whereas, in reality, when we're talking about what is covered by a patent, identity has reference to the patent claims. 
    The court made no reference -- no controlling reference to the claims in that case, neither did it do so, that is the Eighth Circuit Court, in a fairly parallel case entitled “Miller Hatcheries versus Buckeye.” 
    There, you had a matter of enhancing the capacity of an egg incubator by adding things and relocating elements and that type of thing. 
    So, our position here is this that neither court below has properly applied the criteria which call for application here. 
    And, in failing to do so, both courts below have violated the constitutional standard as to the -- as to protection of the rights of inventors and, of course, the implementing statutes.

    The record is silent on that. 
    Nobody made any such request that I know of. 
    In actuality --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1314.295" stopTime="1318.506">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I thought you said you did have the machine with 5-ounce --
speaker="frank_a_neal" startTime="1318.506" stopTime="1574.586">
    Mr. Frank A. Neal 
    No, these very same machines which were originally made for the 1-pound tall cans, Mr. Chief Justice, were in the hands of two -- of sardine packers up and down the west coast. 
    Now, I wouldn't be here today had not the sardines disappeared from the Monterey area. 
    That's what caused the canneries to close down in Cannery Row. 
    And, the available machine -- the available sardines, excuse me, became a little smaller so they wa -- required smaller containers to pack them in and so, after this episode of the closing down of the Hovden Packing Plant, some of the packing plants in Los Angeles area, Del Monte area, remained in operation but they, too, required that their machines be adapted to fill a 5-ounce can. 
    Now, they went to Mr. Kuther, the respondent here, and paid him money to receive permission to do that. 
    Now, when I say though that both of the courts below have violated the constitutional provisions and the implementing statute, this is what I mean. 
    Article I, Section 8, of the constitution gives the sole power to Congress to protect, for a limited time, the rights of inventors to their respective discoveries. 
    And, under that constitutional provision, there has been a whole succession of patent Acts commencing in 1790. 
    The key ones were 1790, 1836, and 1870, and the latest in 1952. 
    Now, the statute, 35 -- Title 35, United States Code, Section 154 defines what the grant of a patent means and it means that the patentee is given the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling his invention. 
    Section 271 (a) refers to infringement and says “he who, without authority, makes or uses or sells an invention shall be liable for infringement.” 
    So, that we have this. 
    There are three ways in which a patent can be infringed - making, using, or selling. 
    Now, Section 112 requires the applicant for a patent to particularly point out and distinctly claim his patent. 
    That's the patent claims. 
    It's like a real estate deed in effect. 
    So that, when all those are taken together, and it's always the claim which is looked to, to see whether there has been a making, or using, or selling. 
    Now, so that you cannot have a making by way of reconstruction unless you have the entire patented entity or the entire combination remade. 
    That I think is the full sense of Mr. Justice Black's concurring opinion in the recent Aro case. 
    He -- Mr. Justice Black did advert to this marginal type of thing where, perhaps all else except a bolt and a nut might be changed. 
    But he said “Let us leave that to the time when we reach a situation like that,” but that is not this. 
    As I have pointed out to the Court, in respect of each of the five claims of the patent in suit, at least two to three essential elements of the combination were left unmodified and, hence, unmade by the activities of the petitioners. 
    And, we say that this cannot amount to reconstruction or infringement by way of reconstruction. 
    That to reach such a conclusion is to accord or confer patent monopoly on something which was not the discovery of Mr. Kuther. 
    He didn't discover the sub-combination, namely, the six out of the nine elements which were modified with respect to claim one. 
    If he had discovered it, he should've claimed it, but he didn't. 
    So, to say that claim one or any one of the other five claims ha -- we're infringed by the modifying activities of the petitioners is to confer patent monopoly where it is not deserving to be conferred.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I thought, in answer to Mr. Goldberg's question, you had conceded that the-- that a 5-ounce machine would be covered by Mr. Kuther's patent, wouldn't it?
speaker="frank_a_neal" startTime="1586.147" stopTime="1588.268">
    Mr. Frank A. Neal 
    Yes. 
    A machine--
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1588.268" stopTime="1590.530">

    And that it, therefore, was embraced in his discovery.
speaker="frank_a_neal" startTime="1590.530" stopTime="1666.005">
    Mr. Frank A. Neal 
    Oh, yes. 
    Yes Your Honor. 
    Yes, that is true. 
    These claims refer to packing machines completely independent of the size or capacity of the cans which go through them. 
    The cans are not an element of any one of the claims. 
    The claims are referred to by way of background or environmental description. 
    So that, both before and afterwards, the 1-pound packing machine and the 5-ounce packing machine were embraced by the language of the claims but, as I pointed out earlier, by virtue of the outright and unconditional sale, the machine, in the 1-pound sense at least, had been fully and for all time released from the patent monopoly. 
    Now, the question is did the machine get back into the patent monopoly so as to require a further royalty, and that only raises this question as to whether there was a remaking in the sense of substantially the entire patented entity. 
    This, we submit, did not occur. 
    I'd like to reserve a few minutes for possible rebuttal.

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The knob of our case is that the petitioners here have made additional unauthorized exploitation of respondent's patent without any obligation to respondent for this increased exploitation. 
    The facts of this case are quite simple and authority had been stated in some detail. 
    As far as the patent is concerned, I again want to emphasize that it does cover a 1-pound machine or a one -- or a 5-ounce machine or any other sized can machine that acts in the way described in the patent. 
    It's the same as in the Aro case wherein the claims weren't limited to Chevrolet's or to Ford cars or any other specific cars.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1732.053" stopTime="1733.335">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You're both in agreement.
speaker="carlisle_m_moore" startTime="1733.335" stopTime="1862.759">
    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    We're in agreement on that. 
    Now, what happened here originally was that respondent or rather respondent's licensee, I -- if I may, I will refer to them both as respondent because they're essentially the same person. 
    They made four 1-poundmachines. 
    That's all these machines could do, was pack 1-pound cans. 
    They're in no way adjustable. 
    It could pack no other sized can. 
    These machines were bought. 
    The purchase price for the machines of course would include two elements. 
    They would include the sale of the physical machine and then they would include the royalty for the use of these machines to practice respondent's invention. 
    Now, the patent rights which passed by the sale of a machine are well defined by this Court. 
    First of all, a sale of a patented machine does not convey all the rights of a patentee that he has. 
    The rights are specific to the particular machine that is sold. 
    The buyer of the machine gets the right to use that machine to practice the invention for as long as the machine is operable. 
    If the machine needs repair, the owner may repair it. 
    That's clear from the Aro case. 
    However, if the machine is destroyed, again as from the Aro case, the license which ran with the machine comes to an end. 
    The purchase of a machine does not give the purchaser the right to make a second machine.That, I believe, too, is clear from the Aro case. 
    Now, what do the petitioners do here?

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Well, that depends upon the scope of the license. 
    A common license under a patent, for example, gives the licensee the right to make machines covered by the patent. 
    Normally, he can make as many as he wants to, paying the patentee a royalty for each machine.

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    No, the Chaffee case has language in it that states that the owner of a machine can improve the machines. 
    Now, I take it that that language means that the owner of a machine can, for example, makes structural changes to make the machine stronger so that it will operate in a more effective way. 
    But, however, I believe that that should be limited to maintaining the machine for the original purpose for which it was bought. 
    That's all that was bargained for by the original buyer and by the original seller. 
    As for example --

    No, Your Honor. 
    We are not contending in any way that the petitioners here should've thrown away the 1-pound machines. 
    They had the perfect right under the facts of this case to buy those machines, restore them to their original use, and continue to use them, that, they had full right to do. 
    However, when they changed these machines, they changed it to obtain an increased economic value of the patent. 
    There is no other reason for them to spend money to convert a machine that they had bought to another use, unless that additional use is going to be more valuable to them.

    This is simply where a person buys a patented machine and nothing more is said. 
    We say that that person has the right to continue to use this machine for the purpose for which he bought it. 
    That's why he bought it, was to use it in the condition that it existed when built and when sold. 
    Now, later on, if he decides that he can make more money from this machine, from the invention by changing the machine, then he's getting something. 
    He's getting an additional use of the invention which was never bargained for in the beginning.

    As for example, again, in your coffeepot situation, although it's hard to imagine the exact situation, but supposed that, originally, you could've bought an adjustable coffeepot which would make either one pint or one quart. 
    I've never seen such a machine but I suppose one could be built.

    In one machine, it may take 60% of the elements. 
    Another machine, it may take 90% of the elements. 
    Each machine is going to present a different factual situation.

    The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals also said that the District Court had not come to any determination as to whether a new machine had been created and, in that, I believe it was in error because, in the record at page 24 which is the decision by the District Court, the judge says, "However, as previously noted, defendants do not rest satisfied with the restoration of the machine to its original condition. 
    They proceeded to change its elements, not to restore the additional, but to build another machine designed to fill cans of a different size than the cans for which the original was manufactured and sold.” 
    Now, I think clearly that the District Court directed itself to the question of whether a new machine had been made.

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Yes, and I -- it is my feeling that that is an unimportant limitation to put on this. 
    I might note that this Court, in discussing the Cotton-Tie case, referred to the fact that the Cotton-Tie, as originally sold, was marked licensed for use once only and that --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2857.517" stopTime="2859.499">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Of course it wasn't (Inaudible)
speaker="carlisle_m_moore" startTime="2859.499" stopTime="2981.593">
    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    Well, it was used only once and then voluntarily destroyed and then recreated. 
    And, to digress for a moment, that is what we contend has happened here, too, is that the petitioners here bought these four 1-pound machines as junk. 
    They destroyed their utility as 1-pound machines in making the new machine. 
    But, anyway, to get back to the-- this license, the thought of having to restrict the purchaser as to what he can do with the machine, I might make an analogy between a landowner. 
    Suppose that a landowner has two adjacent parcels of land that he owns and he sells one of these parcels without any reference to the other parcel. 
    Now, no one would contend that the buyer, through failure to mention this other parcel, would then own both parcels. 
    Now, the parallel here is that the patentee originally has the right to exclude anyone from using a 1-pound machine and he has the right to exclude someone from using a 5-ounce machine. 
    Now, if he sells a 1-pound machine having no other use than to pack 1-pound cans, without any mention of a 5-ounce machine, I don't see that the purchaser of the 1-pound machine gets anymore rights than to use the machine which he bought. 
    If he wanted those additional rights of the patentee, then he should've asked the patentee for those rights, bargain with the patentee for those rights, and pay the patentee a royalty for these increased rights which he wanted.

    But, again, my argument is that the converted machines, the 5-ounce machines, have a particular value of the patent. 
    They will enable the user to exploit the patent in a way which was never contemplated by the original purchaser of the machine or by the seller of the original machine. 
    It's for this additional exploitation that we feel that we're entitled to a royalty. 
    Now, as Mr. Justice Black stated in his opinion in the Aro case, one sale-- one royalty for one sale of machine is enough, but we don't think that that is quite applicable here.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We say that he violates the patent because he is practicing the invention in an unauthorized way which was never given to him.

    Well, the invention is a particular machine which has its utmost utility in packing sardines. 
    It could pack oysters if a person wanted to use it in packing oysters without modification of the machine.

    Now, it may not be a completely new machine, in that there many parts of the old machine used in the new machine, but it's a second creation of the -- of the invention. 
    As for example, in the Cotton-Tie case, the reconstituted ties were made up of scrap of the original ties and of the original buckles.

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    The severed ties were sold for scrap and the infringer bought these ties, rooted them back together, the severed ends, attached the original buckle to it and sold for use again as -- for baling cotton, unless my memory fails me as to the facts of that case.

    Well, Your Honor, the amount of royalty in this case which was voted by the District Court has never been a sale as to its amount or as to the fairness of the award.

    That was the royalty which had been awarded on or which had been paid on the original machine, yes. 
    In this particular case, the District Court felt that that was a reasonable royalty under the facts of this case. 
    As I say, the amount has never been a question as to its fairness here.

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    No, no, we don't -- we don't claim profits at all. 
    We -- all we ask for and all that we received were reasonable royalties which, in this case, was held to be $1,500 per machine.

    The same as there was a new machine?

    Mr. Carlisle M. Moore 
    It was the same as if it had been a new machine. 
    Of course, again, our contention is that this machine for a new purpose is a new machine. 
    The amount of royalty, however, in situations such like this, should really perhaps be based upon the additional economic advantage to the person who converts this purpose of the machine. 
    That's why they convert the machines because they're worth more but, in this case, they're unwilling to share the end piece profits with the -- with the patentee.

    (Inaudible) to get the issue on.

   Rebuttal of Frank A. Neal
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4313.851" stopTime="4315.606">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Neal.
speaker="frank_a_neal" startTime="4315.606" stopTime="4436.788">
    Mr. Frank A. Neal 
    I merely have a couple of observations to make, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    There are two anomalies as I see it, here in the situation as supported or contended for by Mr. Moore and, in the position we find ourselves in, in the light of the decisions of the two courts below. 
    The first one, of course, is the one that Mr. Justice White just had reference to, that when one buys something that's covered by a patent and he acquires it by way of outright sale. 
    There is no longer a tether between the patentee and the item which now belongs, 100% in all of its aspects, to the purchaser. 
    He, therefore, is entitled to derive as much use out of that as it is possible to obtain. 
    The second anomaly is this, that in holding that it was -- would not have been infringement for us to have replaced the six units with units precisely the same in size as the original ones but, on the other hand, it was infringement for us to resize those six units or relocate them, that patent monopoly was conferred on an aggregation of those six elements but only when they're used not in conjunction with the 1-pound can. 
    On the Cotton-Tie case, there again, I think the court in Aro observed, and properly so, that it was the strap that was patented and not the combination of the strap and the belt, and I think that pretty well covers it. 
    I thank the Court.
