    Mr. Sherman.
speaker="samuel_w_sherman" startTime="21.241" stopTime="191.913">
    Mr. Samuel W. Sherman 
    Yes, Your Honor, if the Court pleases. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    Ethel Meyer, the petitioner, is the wife of Peter Meyer, deceased. 
    Peter Meyer, in 1943, had life insurance policies totaling some $50,000. 
    Under 1943, he borrowed from the Huntington National Bank of Ohio the sum of about $26,000 and made assignments and pledged these life insurance policies upon which his wife was the beneficiary to the bank for these loans which were made to him. 
    Now, in 1943, Peter Meyer did not owe the United States Government any moneys, any tax moneys at all. 
    In 1945 and 1946 -- 1946, the tax liabilities for those years arose which were due to the Government of the United States from Peter Meyer. 
    Now, the Government in 1946 and in 1947 made assessments on those tax moneys some $6100. 
    And as soon as they made those tax assessments under the Code, United States Code, the tax liens arose. 
    Now, they were unpaid. 
    These taxes were unpaid. 
    In 1955, Peter Meyer died, so that there was due to the Government from his estate some $6100. 
    The bank having received assignments and pledge of these policies upon his death, the bank received the sum of $26,800 or thereabouts, $26,000, I should say, $26,800, which was due the bank for the loans and that exhausted practically with the exception of some $400, the entire shares surrender value of the policies.

    Under the agreement, the bank had the right to collect the money that was due it from all -- from the entire proceeds of the policies. 
    There's no question about that.

    Mr. Samuel W. Sherman 
    Yes. 
    Yes, Your Honor, from the entire amounts. 
    Now, the widow received her moneys, the balance of the proceeds which would be some $24,000 or $23,000 from the insurance companies. 
    And the United States Government then brought an action against Ethel Meyer, individually and as executrix of the estate, of Peter Meyer's estate, to collect this $6100. 
    And the -- the position that counsel for Mrs. Meyer took was that this money is justly due to -- from her estates because it was due from the estate, the husband and the estate owed the money. 
    However, the courts granted summary judgment against her personally upon the basis that the proceeds that she received were subject to those tax claims. 
    Now, because there are decisions rendered by the United States Supreme Court in the case of -- which were handed down in 1958, in the case of Commissioner against Stern and United States against Bess, where this Court has held, and I've omitted an important trace of this case, New York State Section 166 has an insurance law which states that the proceeds of life insurance are entirely exempt from creditors of the insured. 
    Various other States throughout the United States have similar laws. 
    This Court has interpreted laws of various States and as I recall, the Commissioner against Stern case and United States against Bess, involved Kentucky statutes as well as New Jersey statutes which contained similar provisions of exemption.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="samuel_w_sherman" startTime="446.048" stopTime="665.613">
    Mr. Samuel W. Sherman 
    Yes. 
    This is the crux of the case and I'm going to come to it right this minute. 
    The Government is relying upon a decision which was handed down in the United States against Behrens in 1956 or some two years before this Court handed down decisions in United States against Bess, in which Judge Learned Hand had before him a situation not similar to ours and briefly, the facts in the Behrens case were as follows, in which the equitable doctrine of marshaling was -- was applied. 
    In the Behrens case, we had the tax liens arising and attaching immediately to the cash surrender value, immediately, which is done (Inaudible) as I'll come to in a moment. 
    Thereafter, because the tax liens in the Behrens case weren't filed, they had to be recorded and the bank in that case being an innocent holder, having -- not had an opportunity to check against the recording acts, to see whether there were any tax liens on fire. 
    The bank subsequently, in the Behrens case, lent money to the insured and -- and up to the full amount of the cash surrender value. 
    Now, what happened there was this. 
    In as much as the tax lien was not filed in the proper office, the Court in the Behrens case held that the Government did not have a first lien but it had a second lien subject to the bank, but it still had a lien. 
    And Judge Learned Hand said in applying the marshaling doctrine, he says, in as much as the bank can collect the proceeds of the policy and also the entire proceeds of the policy, which would include the cash surrender value, "We will allow the bank to attach its lien to the widow's share so that the Government which had the tax lien on the cash surrender value can be paid." 
    We don't dispute that, but we say that our case is a material difference, is our case. 
    In 1943, there was no tax lien. 
    There was not even a tax due. 
    In 1943, Mr. Meyer borrowed from the Ohio Bank the full cash surrender value of the policy, so we start with the face there is no more cash surrender value left, whatever. 
    The Government didn't have a secondary lien, it didn't attach. 
    There was nothing due the Government at that time. 
    Now, some three years later, the Government comes along and makes an assessment. 
    As soon as that assessment is made, if there is any property or property rights that the insured has in 1946 and 1947, it will attach, but there's nothing left because the cash surrender value was disposed off, so that the marshaling doctrine can't apply. 
    The cash surrender value was disposed off in 1943. 
    Now, the Government's lien attaches to what? 
    To any other property or property rights that the insured had.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And then for this reason you say that at the time that the federal tax lien attached, there was no cash surrender value in his lifetime to which it could've had?
speaker="samuel_w_sherman" startTime="836.839" stopTime="935.310">
    Mr. Samuel W. Sherman 
    That's -- that's correct, Your Honor. 
    As a matter of fact, this Court in the -- this Court in the Bess case made the same statements at page 57, which is quoted from on page 14 of my brief. 
    It says, "The question, therefore, is whether the cash surrender values with the liens attached were transferred to Mrs. Bess as beneficiary when Mr. Bess died." 
    Now, she -- she received no transfer of any cash surrender value. 
    She only collected her own proceeds. 
    As a matter of fact in the Behrens case where the equitable doctrine was applied, Judge Learned Hand and I quote his language on page 10 of my brief. 
    It says this, "The tax lien not being filed did not indeed have priority over the pledge, but it's attached because there was a tax lien in the beginning." 
    Then Judge Hand goes on and says, "The United States does not assert that it could recover if no lien had attached to this surrender values during Behrens' life." 
    That significant language and then -- and then the other cases decided by this Court, there were holdings that the tax lien must attach during the lifetime of the insured because --

    Mr. Samuel W. Sherman 
    Well, Your Honor, the -- the difficulty there is this, if the bank -- if the bank had been paid, undoubtedly there would've been a new cash surrender value sprung up sometime and if he had gotten that money, the Government's lien of course, would attach. 
    Well, the Government's lien would attach but in this situation, all she collected were proceeds which were exempt under state law and the decisions of this Court holds that where creditors have an exempt -- where credit -- where the proceeds of a policy are exempt from creditors, then the -- as far as tax liens are concerned, we follow state law.

    Generally, --
speaker="samuel_w_sherman" startTime="1174.081" stopTime="1287.524">
    Mr. Samuel W. Sherman 
    Generally, I think it is followed now. 
    The equitable doctrine is followed and we have no dispute with that. 
    But we say that in the application of the equitable doctrine, the facts are entirely different. 
    The Government gets a lien immediately during the lifetime of the insured. 
    That lien attaches. 
    But it doesn't file it and because it doesn't file it, a subsequent bank loan which is made, comes first as a creditor and head of the Government by reason of the statute requiring filing, but the Government's lien is dead, becomes a secondary lien, then when the insured died. 
    The theory is that even though the widow only receives the proceeds less the cash surrender value, she's still liable because of -- under the equitable doctrine that's applied, the Court says, in as much as the bank has a first lien on the entire proceeds of the policy, we will permit the bank to collect that portion of the proceeds which doesn't represent the cash surrender value. 
    And then the Government's lien that has a reason, secondary lien that has a reason, he will permit the Government to collect it from the cash surrender value. 
    This is not our case. 
    This -- our case is entirely different. 
    In our case, the Government never had a tax lien that could attach to the cash surrender value because in 1943, before any taxes were due, the full cash surrender value was -- we'll say mortgage, if I may put it so or assign the -- the policies were assigned to the bank as collateral security.

    Could attach and having disposed of it in 1943, we cannot apply the equitable doctrine either because then, we would be violating -- when I say, we, I mean, the theory would be violating the New York State Statute, which says that the proceeds that a widow or any insured will receive is exempt from creditors of the insured. 
    And in this case, the Government would then be coming along and -- and saying this count that statute, we come first.

    Mr. Samuel W. Sherman 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    And since the proceeds under New York State Statute are exempt from claims of creditors, the Government must show that it acquired a lien during his lifetime and it couldn't because disposition was made on that before any tax claim even arose, and that's some substance of our case.

   Argument of Joseph Kovner
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1397.446" stopTime="1405.518">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Kovner.
speaker="joseph_kovner" startTime="1405.518" stopTime="1566.014">
    Mr. Joseph Kovner 
    If it please the Court. 
    The Government's position in this case can be summarized, I think, shortly in three or four propositions. 
    The first one is that as a matter of legal precedent and prior authority, this case is on all force with Behrens. 
    There is no distinction. 
    In fact that in Behrens, the unrecorded federal tax lien here arose before the bank made its loan is immaterial because the lien as against the bank can become effective until it was recorded. 
    And the Behrens' opinion makes it quite clear, explicitly clear that the cases to be treated as one in which there is a prior lien in favor of the bank for a loan made by a bank against the security of an insurance policy. 
    So that the Behrens case is -- is merely in point and is the decided law prior to the case coming here that was relied upon by the court below, it was also relied upon by the Sixth Circuit, the recent case went, which is pending on certiorari -- petition for certiorari. 
    So the question is whether Behrens was wrong or right. 
    We think it's right. 
    We think the case is clearly stated by Judge Learned Hand, when he points out that when you come to the point of the death of the insured, you have a bond, in pace amount of the insurance policy, which is subject to claims on creditors. 
    One claim that of the United States which is good against the part of the fund, the insurance proceeds, the other claim that of a bank which is good against the whole of the bond, all of the proceeds. 
    The wife claiming as beneficiary, her interest is junior to both, since it was wholly contingent one, arising only after the taxpayer's death and on the condition that she would remain his beneficiary at that time, since he deserved during his lifetime, the full power to change beneficiary. 
    Her interest up until the point of his death was a mere expectancy, vesting only at his death, but vesting subject to these prior liens.

    She did but may I take a point as to one statement Your Honor made, Justice Black. 
    That it was getting something out of something that wasn't if I understood you, the insurance property. 
    And I suggest that the insurance proceeds were property of the insured to a very substantial extent, as this Court said in Chase National Bank. 
    He could control its disposition. 
    He bought it, he created -- he created it. 
    He paid for it. 
    He could dispose of it, the facts of this case show that he did in a very important way. 
    He assigned it to a bank as security for loan to him. 
    Now, he could assign somebody else's as property --

speaker="joseph_kovner" startTime="1668.896" stopTime="1734.683">
    Mr. Joseph Kovner 
    That's right. 
    But in the doctrine of marshaling, the unsecured, the creditor, the one bond creditor always gets the benefit of a fund that he couldn't get directly. 
    May I put it this way? 
    To our mind, the case comes to this. 
    The taxpayer during his lifetime owns one asset. 
    The cash surrender value of a certain insurance policies. 
    There are two liens on that, one of the bank junior -- senior and the other, the federal tax lien. 
    He also -- he also has made a contract with the third party, the insured, which when taken together with the assignment of that contract to the bank, putting it altogether has said to the insurer and to the bank, "If I die, it might get to the bank as unpaid, you pay the bank." 
    Out of this other plan, this other plan, you pay the bank. 
    And the Government's position in (Inaudible) therefore is that leads the other -- the first step, the cash surrender value available to pay the bank -- the (Voice Overlap) --

speaker="joseph_kovner" startTime="1740.089" stopTime="1772.363">
    Mr. Joseph Kovner 
    Oh, I can get from New York law and -- in two respects. 
    First, that New York law -- New York law recognizes the cash surrender value as an asset of the insured during his lifetime. 
    New York law recognizes that the insured taxpayer may make this kind of a contract with an insurer to pay his debts out of a certain sum of money that will become available upon his debt. 
    New York law gives him the full power and control with that sum of money could come into existence upon his death, and New York law says that he can assign that to a bank to get a loan.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I take it then if -- if this insurer had not made the contract with the bank -- the bank, you may collect out of the proceeds of the policy. 
    But had made a contract with the bank, you may collect only out of the cash surrender value policy, you wouldn't be here.
speaker="joseph_kovner" startTime="1790.481" stopTime="1792.001">

    (Inaudible)
speaker="joseph_kovner" startTime="2500.205" stopTime="2558.502">
    Mr. Joseph Kovner 
    Well, those cases, if the Court please, were relied upon rather heavily by the petitioner in Wintner and where -- in the Wintner case, that's the case this -- that it's a companion to this case arising out of the Sixth Circuit. 
    You held it pending the outcome of this case. 
    And that argument was addressed to the Court in Wintner both to the District Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, that it had been two private creditors. 
    The doctrine of marshaling would have not been invoked because the effect would have been to defeat the exemption statute for the benefit of the widow. 
    But the Sixth Circuit accepted the Government's argument that since the exemption statute did not bar the Government, the Government retained the benefit of the marshaling of asset stocks. 
    Now, it is now -- it was there. 
    It is. 
    And it's just not feeling that the tax debt does have a special priority which private debts don't have. 
    That's been illustrated by more than one case and --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2558.502" stopTime="2563.014">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    By the term to the statue itself that it -- the lien attaches only to a property --
speaker="joseph_kovner" startTime="2563.014" stopTime="2563.169">
    Mr. Joseph Kovner 
    It's true.

speaker="joseph_kovner" startTime="2567.834" stopTime="2616.679">
    Mr. Joseph Kovner 
    That's right. 
    But -- but the -- but the reason why this Court limited the federal tax lien, which is otherwise all embracing through the cash value was because it interpose to invest a limitation upon the reach of the federal taxing and that it had to be property which the taxpayer could enjoy during his lifetime. 
    That didn't mean that the proceeds weren't the taxpayer's property. 
    It's our point here which somewhat counts us the equity which the Court is speaking of which lies behind the exemption statutes that this is not property of the wives that's being ceased by the Government to pay the husband's tax debt. 
    This is property that the husband created that in a number of very important respects is his property that escaped the reach of the federal tax lien by his brother.

    Mr. Joseph Kovner 
    That's a pretty important right. 
    This Court had in Chase National Bank that that was enough to include the property and this is a fair state tax. 
    If it had not been his property at all, it could have been -- been included in his estate -- the state -- state tax purposes, I think this case really lies squarely between the rule to invest, that the reach of the federal tax lien is only to property which the taxpayer can possess during his lifetime and Chase which holds that as to insurance, the taxpayer has a very important property interest to whip the control and disposition of a sum upon his debt. 
    And the Government's assertion is that those interest is so close that where the taxpayer has provided that a credit, another lien creditor will be paid out of that sum but that creditor ought to be satisfied out of that sum leaving the Government to collect assets otherwise, it would -- otherwise, it's been taken by that creditor now become available too. 
    I think if you read Chase (Inaudible) the case is not quite so simple in equity of the widow because to suggest that it's the equity of the widow is only to suggest somehow or the other that the Government is taking property belonging to the widow.

    That's right because the big difference between the two cases is that the private creditor is directly barred by the state exemption statute and the United States is not.

    Mr. Joseph Kovner 
    Well -- no, because merely all of the States have the exemption statutes and I -- there are some cases, I think almost every State in fact we cited textbook, the Court can find in the textbook, we cited it in very recent textbook a collection of those state statutes. 
    As far as I know, the state statutes are -- are in almost every State, they vary. 
    Some confine the exemption through immediate beneficiaries. 
    The New York Statute does not. 
    Some confine the exemption proceeds to a fixed amount not more than $15,000 or $20,000 but I don't regard those exemption statutes as any different from the several kinds of state exemption statutes of many -- of additional exemption statutes.

    This case involves -- just indeed, if the Court please, I would submit that this case is controlled by a federal law, two points in federal law. 
    One is the federal lien law, the exclusive priority and -- of the federal statute that it is subject only to exemptions expressly provided for by Congress and third, that the Federal Government in the collection of its federal lien is entitled to invoke the marshaling doctrine. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Samuel W. Sherman

    Mr. Samuel W. Sherman 
    Can I just have one minute, Your Honor?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2982.387" stopTime="2984.147">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    Yes, Mr. --
speaker="samuel_w_sherman" startTime="2984.147" stopTime="3137.793">
    Mr. Samuel W. Sherman 
    Thank you sir. 
    Your Honors, this is beyond dispute, a mere reading of Commissioner against Stern which was decided by this Court 1958 involving a Kentucky statute similar to the New York statute of exemption of creditors. 
    And I'm quoting from page 42 of the Court's opinion just a mere sentence. 
    "We hold that the Kentucky statutes govern the question of the beneficiary liability and treat no liability -- and create no liability of respondent," that's the Government, "to the -- to the Government in the circumstances of the case." 
    In that case, in Commission against Stern, the Government -- the widow, upon the death of the insured received not only the proceeds but received also the full cash surrender value of the policy. 
    And the Government came along and said, "Why, we want that money to the extent of the full cash surrender value." 
    The United States Supreme Court in that case said, "The Government can't get it by reason of this exemption. 
    It can only get it --" page 47, "We agree that the state law may not destroy a lien which has attached in the insured's lifetime." 
    So that in this case, in our case, if the Government's lien attached in the lifetime of the insured, the Government would get it. 
    But in as much as it didn't, this -- the -- the Government being accredited just like any other creditor must follow state law and these proceeds are entirely exempt on the state law and it hasn't gotten any greater right. 
    Congress has not yet enacted any lien granting to the Government any right. 
    As a matter of fact, the only law of Congress is laid down where the Government is given a tax lien on all property and property rights. 
    What are property and property rights are still defined by state law. 
    And in this case, Section 166 defines what a property and property rights and therefore, the Government's lien never attached during a lifetime and the widow isn't entitled to her own proceeds. 
    She never got the chance to run the value. 
    In the Behrens' case, the widow got the full cash surrender value and paid the bank the money. 
    In our case, she only got her proceeds. 
    That's entirely exempted. 
    Thank you.

    Very well.
