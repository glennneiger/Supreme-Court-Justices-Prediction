    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    We have here an appeal or a putative appeal of a criminal defendant whom, through some type of error or negligence, did not get his notice of appeal filed within 10 calendar days after the judgments of conviction was pronounced in open court. 
    The judgment of conviction was pronounced on April 24 after 2 o'clock pm in the afternoon. 
    The written judgment and commitment was signed and was filed with the clerk of the Court the same day. 
    That day, a postcard was sent to counsel's office, my office. 
    We have a notation on that judgment which is in the original record. 
    The notation however, not being transcribed by the printer of the record that it was docketed as a judgment the following day, April 25th, which was a Thursday. 
    That docketing relates only to the civil aspects of this judgment. 
    It -- providing for a fine as well as a prison term and the docketing which was done the next day in the civil judgment docket was on a Thursday. 
    We do concede that we are concerned with the criminal appeal here rather than the civil appeal.

    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    From the weight of authority of this Court and of the Circuit Court of Appeals, we would have doubts as to whether we could rely upon the April 25th docketing of the fine as giving us a right to appeal. 
    The whole doctrine of authority and of this Court in the past, has considered the sentencing in open court to be the principle point. 
    However, this is a factor that enters into this case that may distinguish it from other cases that there was a separate docketing of this case as a civil judgment the following day.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="343.155" stopTime="355.003">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, they take the sentence as it was given in Court, why does it make any witness when -- when it was docketed after that?
speaker="bernard_b_polak" startTime="355.003" stopTime="406.309">
    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    Because the -- the docketing -- if the metaphysical concept of entry of judgment is to be considered, the actual entry into the clerk's docket as of the time when the clock starts to run, then it may well be that if the Government or the Court chooses to enter the judgment as a money judgment as well as a criminal judgment that the fact that this is effective the following day, at least gives him the right to appeal from the money fine or the judgment insofar as it is a money fine.

speaker="bernard_b_polak" startTime="481.640" stopTime="694.003">
    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    My principle point is if this appeal is to be considered as a -- a matter of limitation upon the right of the defendant to file his notice of appeal as it has been found in previous cases that the defendant ought to be accorded, every benefit of any possible doubt of interpretation of the rule in as much as the right of a defendant to appeal to the extent that it is to be considered as a right by this Court, deserves protection. 
    The defendant's rights herein concern some constitutional points, points that may not have been appreciated too well by counsel that urged these points upon the trial court or by the trial court itself that decided the points. 
    The point of course being the claim that the search and seizure of contraband at premises where the defendant had desks space that he rented from an overall lessee of the premises was to be considered, he stops from raising an objection to the search and seizure on the ground that his landlord who was the overall tenant of the premises had consented. 
    It was upon this ground that the trial court finally denied the motion of the petitioner in the trial court to suppress all evidence that was raised and seized upon that search including an alleged statement that was given by the petitioner to the arresting officers after the contraband was found. 
    On Monday of this week, this Court, in Stoner against California, indicated in very strong terms that a person having legitimate claim to protection of his right against search and seizure has standing an interest to complain of it regardless of who else may have consented to the search. 
    This decision certainly was presaged by this Court's decision in Jones against United States and in Chapman against United States as well as the earlier case of McDonald against United States in 1948, which -- although it is not cited in my brief, I --

    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    This is -- this is a -- another problem that this Court really must consider because the last case where the principle point was raised, United States against Robinson, this Court indicated that where the constitutional rights of a defendant were at stake, he would always have the right to have a collateral attack brought against the judgment on the grounds that the infringement of his constitutional rights vitiated it. 
    This is a statement in United States against Robinson that the Government cites in its brief.

    Was this a collateral attack?
speaker="bernard_b_polak" startTime="745.892" stopTime="756.282">
    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    This is not a collateral attack, Your Honor. 
    This is a direct appeal and certiorari upon a direct appeal. 
    However --

    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    The second appeal herein, as you may recall from the record after the first appeal was dismissed, the -- a petitioner brought a proceeding under Rule 35 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure in the District Court to modify and correct his sentence. 
    This motion was granted by the trial court and judgments denoted as an amended judgment and commitment was entered on June 10, 1963. 
    The defendant petitioner filed a notice of appeal the next day from that and --

    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    There is an indication in the --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="814.152" stopTime="815.869">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- decision of that order?
speaker="bernard_b_polak" startTime="815.869" stopTime="1053.523">
    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    There is an indication in the earlier Berman case which of course has no relation to this particular petitioner, in 1937 where that particular procedure was attempted to be followed by the petitioner in that case who thought that his appeal was in jeopardy of being dismissed and hoped that he could revive it by making such a motion in the lower court which motion was granted and a relief sought therein was granted. 
    This Court, in that case, held that the first appeal was still a valid appeal and decided that first appeal on the merits and held that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to sentence the man. 
    That question was really left open in the Berman case. 
    There is a Circuit Court opinion cited in my brief, Bridges against United States wherein the Circuit Court, in reviewing a petitioners -- an appellant's claim of invalidity upon a remote collateral attack upon a judgment, held that the failure of that appellant to have made an appeal when the Court sua sponte had entered a corrected judgment months subsequent to the original judgment of conviction was thereafter precluded or at least prejudiced by his failure to have appealed from that corrected judgment. 
    From the indications in these cases, it is apparent to petitioner that where -- not only the petitioner asks that the judgment be corrected by any reason but where the Court sees fit to grant that application and thus enter an amended judgment thereon. 
    And it is noted in the record on appeal herein that in the oral argument that preceded the entry of this corrected judgment, that the history of the dismissal of this appeal and the desire of the petitioner to appeal claimed errors of the original conviction, was urged before the trial court. 
    And the trial court in its colloquy or pronouncements to counsel took note of the fact that the defendant desired to have such an appeal. 
    It is submitted by petitioner that if that second judgment did not open up the petitioner's right to appeal from the original conviction -- it's -- in its entirety that the effect of that second appeal should at least be considered equivalent to a collateral attack upon that judgment rather than to burden the petitioner appellant to go back to the District Court and make a motion under Section 2255 of -- I believe, Title 18 to set -- assign the judgment of conviction on the ground that it was obtained by the use of illegally seized evidence that where he --

    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    If it is available, it would seem a matter of judicial economy to consider on a direct appeal that which could be treated upon a collateral attack. 
    There must be some effective meaning to the statement of this Court in United States against Robinson, that where there is an error of constitutional degree that the defendant is not barred and precluded by the fact that the 10-day rule may serve to preclude his direct appeal because in such an injustice, this Court has said, “The aggrieved defendant can go back to the District Court for collateral relief.”

    Mr. Bernard B. Polak

    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    To file your appeal within the 10-day period be it as it may. 
    It is our contention that in as much as the 10-day rule is a rule and not a statute, that the rule is subject to interpretation to a greater degree than a statute could be interpreted, and that --

    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    I would certainly urge that point upon this Court and any court where any type of grave constitutional error occurs, it would seem that it is within the province of the Courts of the United States to entertain a claim which a defendant maybe able to substantiate, that his constitutional rights were infringed either by a coerced confession or by an unlawful search and seizure or by any other infringement of any constitutional right of a petitioner.

    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    And I may add a fourth that where the procedural steps are taken to put a case into an appeal court where there is a narrower constitutional degree that is involved that the Court ought to consider it.

    Mr. Bernard B. Polak 
    I don't have that in front of me, Your Honor, the Robinson case, the type of case that was involved. 
    That appeared to be one only on the calendar and the issue there seemed to be confined to a matter of calendar. 
    It is -- I -- I'm unable to answer that question. 
    But, it would seem that if there were any grave constitutional issues in that case that it would be possible to determine that from the record in that case. 
    And I regret that I'm unable to answer that question of the Court. 
    It would seem in conclusion that regardless of how a petitioner's right of appeal may expire a normal cause that if he is able to demonstrate some constitutional error involved in the original proceeding in the trial and the trial court therein is willing to enter a corrected and amended judgment even though under Rule 35 on a purely technical point of reduction of sentences. 
    The fact that a judgment is entered and it is a judgment and a criminal judgment of the District Court that his right to appeal therefrom, even the ordinary right of appeal should be permitted to the extent of at least the constitutional questions that were involved in the original conviction. 
    It -- it seems that this is what the Court -- the Circuit Court in Bridges against United States meant when it discarded the appellant's later collateral attack when he hadn't made no direct appeal from the corrected judgment that was entered by that court. 
    And it would seem that whenever any judgment is entered in the criminal docket in that particular case, if the defendant at any stage of the proceeding has been aggrieved by constitutional errors that have contributed to that judgment. 
    It would seem that the defendant should be able to appeal to the extent of urging those constitutional errors.

    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari from the Second Circuit to review two separate dismissals and presents basically two questions. 
    The first question is, when the last day to file a notice of appeal is a Saturday, whether the notice of appeal filed on Monday will suffice because of -- of a number of reasons either at the New York -- certain courts in New York have a practice where they exclude Saturday or because the clerk's office -- the federal clerk's office in New York was open only half a day on Saturday. 
    The second appeal which was dismissed presents the second question which in substance is whether an appeal maybe revived after the time -- the 10-day period has expired by a nominal reduction in a sentence. 
    In other words, may the District Judge deliberately enlarge the period for taking an appeal from 10 days to -- such as this case, a period of a month and a half?

    Now, that may be a vacation and put a man on probation, let's say, or something like that. 
    There's no -- there's no indication in the rule that would forbid. 
    As a matter of fact, that this is part of the purpose of the rule that the judge can have a second thought so to speak on the extent but it was limited deliberately as to time because as a matter of fact, the old practice was that they would extend the term to hold it over the head of the defendant and the idea was to get rid of this and to allow the District Judge only 60 days within which to do this type of thing.

    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    Well, I'm not sure but I think it would arise in the same type of -- I -- I know of no case like this but I think that what you are talking about could arise in a type of proceeding that gives a judge jurisdiction power to grant a new trial. 
    And in that circumstance -- I mean after all, once you granted a new trial, you start fresh and -- and then I go back to my example of an invalid indictment or for any reason the judge enters a judgment of acquittal. 
    Now, the Government may be very unhappy that we haven't had a chance to even prove it nor we're -- we're suddenly thrown out. 
    We have no right to appeal and so forth but I have no doubt that the District Judge has power in certain circumstance. 
    Whether or not in all circumstances, I think would be questionable because I think it depend on the facts. 
    In other words, I don't think -- well, I don't -- I can't imagine, first of all, any judge just doing it for no reason. 
    Once you get to some reasons, you see, you find ways to do this.In other words, if there is an indictment that's invalid, I can find reason but I mean if -- if you just have a whim, this is difficult for me to -- to work with. 
    In any event, they -- the -- the second issue presented by the second appeal in this case really comes down to whether the District Judge can purposely enlarge the period from 10 days to, as in this case, approximately a month and a half. 
    At the outset, I think I should make the -- the Government's position clear about two matters. 
    One is the rules. 
    We do not say that the rule should not be changed or that this rule is the best rule that could be devised and certainly, the Rules Committee have these rules under consideration and that's why they're rules so that they'd be -- can be continually looked at in view of our experience and possibly some changes made. 
    The second thing is that we feel that in 1960, when this Court decided United States versus Robinson, that to a great extent, the excuses that are now offered in this case are of no different caliber or no different substance than the excuses that we're offered in Robinson and at that time, it was decided that the period for appeal cannot be enlarged, where the failure to take the appeal was due to the neglect of counsel even though it was excusable neglect of the counsel.

    No, no. 
    As a matter of fact, this is one of the problems you see about petitioner's new suggestion of -- of collateral attack. 
    You see, what really happens on a notice of appeal is that they're just a paper file. 
    There's no -- one of the things we got away from in the rules was the -- the idea of setting forth why a person has to take an appeal, setting out the reasons and so forth. 
    So that all that the petitioner has to file is a paper saying, "I want to take an appeal." 
    Doesn't -- he doesn't have to present any issues. 
    So that what the Court of Appeals has in most cases is merely a notice of appeal saying, "I want to take an appeal." 
    They get the docket entries from below and the Government's motion to dismiss because of the timeliness of the -- of taking the appeal, so that the question of the real issues which may or may not be involved in some case are never really truly presented to the Court of Appeals and in an appellate procedure.

    Yes. 
    I -- well, this -- this is a civil lien. 
    And it -- it really isn't involved in this case but -- well, let's say, in -- in your jurisdiction in Chicago, for example, they had a number of places. 
    You had attorn, titles, and you have title companies, in some places you have dockets for types -- other types of title. 
    Those people who have judgments of money value against them, in order to docket it as a lien, it has to be docketed in a special book so that it will be picked by abstractors who -- a house or something like that or if somebody wants to check your credit or something like that, I suppose they could it. 
    But this has -- and this is done usually and not in a federal -- this has nothing to do with a federal clerk's office or anything else because the problems of liens are usually -- are controlled by this county or state organization. 
    So what happens is that when you have a -- a case where a fine is entered or it happens a number of times in -- all liquor violations you get fines of this type of thing, that's done as a -- or tax cases is automatic. 
    They do this all the time. 
    They take the tax judgments over and enter them as a lien. 
    Now, that judgment, that lien entry, judgment as a lien, has absolutely no bearing on -- on the question here. 
    In other words, the entry of a judgment somewhere else to perfect a civil lien and I would assume that this judgment would be good as far as a criminal is concerned even if this entry had never been made, has absolutely nothing to do with a question of taking a criminal appeal.

    We -- we've had judges -- we've cited cases where judges have deliberately reentered orders or reentered something in order to give -- but I can't see that that would make any difference really what you do. 
    I mean if the whole purpose -- here, the judge is deliberately enlarging the man's time to take an appeal. 
    The rule -- I think in unmistakable terms, says, that the judge may not enlarge the time for taking an appeal because otherwise -- you see there're two sides to the coin. 
    And the fact -- and if you're going to allow the judge to enlarge it, you -- you're also going to allow him the withhold it. 
    And this is the kind of thing that we've tried to avoid in the -- in the whole setup of criminal rules that -- that it shouldn't be a matter that you just go in and have to ask leave of the judge to take an appeal. 
    You have 10 days and you take it. 
    It isn't something he can give you and it isn't something he can take away from you.

    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    If what you are posing had been the case, in other words, if there was some error in the reduction process that could be appealed, certainly, it would have been incumbent upon the petitioner to say something about that and he didn't say anything about that when he filed his affidavit. 
    He just recited again his excuses for not taking the original appeal. 
    So that I think the Court of Appeals was -- was well-advised to dismiss the -- the second one. 
    The petitioner argued that -- I should mention the things it covered in the brief. 
    One is this problem of Saturday in New York courts. 
    Of course, it depends upon which New York court you look to, I suppose because some New York courts are open all the time, Saturdays and Sundays. 
    So that if you -- if you start to adopt some type of procedure related to local practice, I think we would have a hodgepodge of taking appeals. 
    The problem of full days -- I'd also do not think is in this case because the rule certainly contemplate that even Saturdays and Sundays in the middle of the period are to be counted, he is not merely entitled to 10 full business days. 
    The question of half a day was also recognized by the rules because the rule specifically stated that a half a day should be counted as a full day. 
    In any event, let me say this that if this petitioner had made any real effort to file this notice of appeal on Saturday --

    As a matter of policy, it might be wise to eliminate Saturdays in the proposed amendments to the criminal rules aren't going to eliminate Saturday from a period of computation just as it's been eliminated in the civil cases.

    He asked that his sentence be reduced. 
    He asked that if that not be so that he'd be allowed an extended period of time before he started to serve his sentence, in other words, time to adjust his affairs. 
    This is the type of relief that he asked for at the time of the motion under Rule 35. 
    He didn't -- he didn't ask for a new trial or something like that in the sense of --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="3304.883" stopTime="3305.853">

speaker="theodore_george_gilinsky" startTime="3305.853" stopTime="3383.839">
    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    Go to the merits because -- well, some of the merits, of course, are bound to come out every time you -- you start talking about it but I don't think that they were primarily there. 
    And certainly, if -- if that's what he meant, I think he could've made himself a little more clear as to -- that he didn't -- in other words, if he -- what he really meant, instead of Rule 35 reduction, was that I want to attack my conviction now collaterally. 
    I think, at least saying something like that would've alerted the -- the judge to the problem that he was presenting but I don't think you'll find that in this motion at all or in these papers that he filed at that time. 
    So that we feel that this would fly in the face of all the rules of -- that -- on the time and unlike the civil cases by the way which this Court has had recently, there was absolutely nothing done here during this period, so that what -- what happens is you really have to revive it. 
    Now, the last point that I would like to make is that we think this is evaluation for committee of rules and the question whether to extend times, whether to give everybody appeals maybe within 10 days, cut the whole thing off --

    Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky 
    There are -- yes. 
    There is one and there's no question that this consideration of Saturday, that's all that had been printed by the proposed -- and we cite that in our brief. 
    The appellate rules are under another Advisory Committee and their treating of the whole may have not published any affairs but you can see in the articles that this problem is under consideration. 
    In some, we think that the petitioner is proposing a series of strained and technical interpretations to -- would create just a hodgepodge in -- in the manner of taking appeals which we think are rather simple. 
    And to throw out these rules and standards, would really turn us back to where we were over 30 years ago when you used to have to ask, leave to appeal and when you used to take periods of time and extend them beyond. 
    And we think all of this was done away with when they started the new civil rules. 
    And we respectfully submit that both dismissals should be affirmed.

    First of all, I would like to call the attention of the Court to Folios 640 through 646 of the printed transcript of record in which the consideration of the defendant's desire to again appeal was raised orally upon the return of the motion and was discussed between the Court and counsel for both sides to eliminate any doubt as to that particular point. 
    We did not get it into the motion papers.The motion was a several pronged motion. 
    There were other problems affecting the defendant, namely the prospect of immediate surrender which would have involved losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars to his creditors and to his family.
