    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Judge Pierce and I represent the four individual petitioners in this case which is a companion case to the one that was argued yesterday. 
    And if the Court will permit us, we would like to divide our time as far as the argument is concerned. 
    The courts of Alabama could have decreed that these four individual petitioners too, should be punished in a civil libel action. 
    No actual or special damages were awarded. 
    The trial court in charging the jury, merely said that punitive damages means such damages as are given as a kind of punishment to a defendant with the view to preventing similar wrongs in the future and that falsity and malice are presumed. 
    The jury responded by awarding a $500,000 punitive damages against these individual petitioners which was the largest such judgment in the history of Alabama up to that time. 
    I think it'd be --

    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    I think it's interesting in that connection Your -- Your Honor that the largest fine that could've been imposed in a criminal libel action in the State of Alabama would have been $500. 
    Now, what did -- what did these petitioners do to deserve this punishment? 
    A precise recital of the evidence brings into sharp focus the petitioners' constitutional rights have been violated. 
    The petitioners are not in truth being punished for what they did or failed to do in this case or what they said and did elsewhere and who they are. 
    That the central fact of this case is that they are being -- drastically punished because they were Negroes residing in Alabama, who've had the courage to speak out in the struggle to -- to achieve the rights guaranteed by the Constitution for all citizens regardless of race or color. 
    Indeed, these petitioners, Dr. King and these four petitioners are the leaders of the civil rights movement in Alabama. 
    What was the proof in the case? 
    In the testimony offered by the plaintiff, there were only two brief references to the petitioners. 
    The first was that their names appeared in the advertisement as published by the New York Times in March 29th, 1960. 
    The second was that a few days before this suit was started, each received identical letters from the plaintiff demanding that they publish a retraction. 
    There was no evidence that the petitioner's authorized the use of their names in the advertisement. 
    There was no evidence that they were members of the group or committee that inserted the advertisement in the paper. 
    And there was no evidence that they had any knowledge of the advertisement at all that appeared in the New York Times. 
    That's all there was to the plaintiffs' case, no other evidence. 
    The defendants then proceeded to show that the total failure of proof by the plaintiff was not a mere oversight. 
    Mr. John Murray who is a volunteer worker for the Committee to defend Martin Luther King in the struggle for freedom in the South testified that on or about March 25th, 1960, he took the draft to the advertisement in question to New York Times and gave it to a Mr. Aronson, who was an employee of the paper. 
    Mr. Murray testified that in addition to the proposed advertisement with the names of a large group of individuals and a letter from A. Philip Randolph, saying that those persons were signed members of the Committee endorsed the advertisement. 
    Mr. Murray and Mr. Aronson, who were the two people who would know both testified at the trial and each testified that the names of these four petitioners were not on the list. 
    Mr. Murray further testified that the Executive Director of the Committee, a Mr. Rustin, some time later after the original advertisement had been submitted to the paper, decided that he wanted some prominent names from the South to be included among the sponsors. 
    So he proceeded to add to the original list submitted to New York Times, some names from a list he had in his desk of persons who belonged to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an entirely separate organization. 
    Now, because he was anxious to get the advertisement published, he decided not to take the time to ask the individuals for permission to use their names. 
    All of the petitioners testified, each as a spiritual and religious leader of his people. 
    All have been active in the cause for civil rights. 
    Each testified though that he had not been and was not a member of the Committee to defend Martin Luther King. 
    Non-authorized publication of the advertisement that appeared over New York Times or had any knowledge of the advertisement prior to its publication, the cross examination was brief and nothing was to develop -- was developed to cast any doubt on the accuracy of the testimony of these petitioners. 
    Why then, it might be asked, was such harsh punishment imposed? 
    It is stated that it is because the petitioners somehow ratified the publication of the advertisement. 
    After the publication of this advertisement, there was considerable publicity about it in Alabama. 
    It was finally decided that several lawsuits should be commenced by certain state officials but there was a difficulty. 
    Respondent and others like him obviously had no actual or special damages and a mere technical victory would have not have served their basic purpose of the litigation which was to intimidate. 
    So how could they accomplish the end that they sought whether it was decided to base the lawsuits on Title 7, Section 914 of the Code of Alabama which provides that a public official in order to recover punitive damages must make a written demand on the person who published the material demanding a public retraction five days before bringing a suit. 
    So few days before starting this lawsuit, the plaintiff wrote a letter to each petitioners demanding a retraction of the fall -- false and defamatory matter published by you in the New York Times on March 29th in this prominent public manner as the original publication. 
    Parenthetically, the letter only set forth two paragraphs from the advertisement and these were out of context. 
    Petitioner according to the testimony never saw the advertisement until the lawsuit was started. 
    Now, none of these petitioners, after they received this letter and during a few days before the suit was started, answered the letter or attempted to place an advertisement in the New York Times saying that they had nothing to do with the original advertisement. 
    This is the -- the basis, the sole basis for the claim of ratification. 
    What did the petitioner say about it when they were asked? 
    Well, Reverend Seay was asked why he did not reply to the letter. 
    He testified, and this on page 789 of the record, "Well in the first place, I was so amazed about the complaint and about the ad that I was afraid to make any reply to it until I had some legal advice for fear I might incriminate myself. 
    I had no knowledge of it whatsoever." 
    When Reverend Shuttlesworth, page 789 of the record, was asked why he did not reply to the letter, he said, "I had not written anything to be retracted as the letter demanded and neither had I seen a material which the letter call upon me to retract." 
    When Reverend Abernathy was asked why he did not make a retraction, he replied, "Well, I didn't make a retraction number 1 because I did not publish the ad and I felt that I was being asked to retract something that I did not put forth." 
    Reverend Lowery, who -- page 802 and it's interesting I think, in this case that he didn't receive the letter demanding retraction until after the complaint had been receipt -- had been -- had been served on him. 
    When he was asked the question he said, "As I recall, the letter didn't for a reply, it asked me to republish a retraction of equal size or something like that to an ad that -- that appeared in New York Times. 
    I had no knowledge of the ad and so I could make no retraction." 
    Of course, the claim of ratification is auspicious. 
    Petitioners were under no obligation either in law or as a matter common sense to publish or retraction in the New York Times as demanded by the letter. 
    The statute which -- which is relied on by the respondent refers only to publishers of the alleged libel. 
    It does not require persons who did not publish a libel to retract it. 
    In fact, the letter from the plaintiff recognizes this and demands retraction of the defamatory matter published by you. 
    It did not say, retracted defamatory matter -- I warn you whether published by you or not. 
    Counsel for respondent now says, that it was the petitioners' silence, not their failure to retract for which they're being punished. 
    But certainly, the letter from the respondent did not call upon the petitioners to speak. 
    It did not ask for a reply. 
    It demanded a retraction in the New York Times. 
    In fact, I think it's interesting to notice that the letter which is really the basis of this whole lawsuit was -- gave every indication of being a "trick and device" because it was dated March 8, 1960. 
    And it referred to something that -- that appeared in the New York Times on March 29th, 1960 so that the petitioners in reading the letter quite nastily would have thought it was a trick. 
    It was dated March 8 referring to an advertisement that appeared in the letter that's set on March 29.

    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    The settled law of Alabama is that mere silence concerning it does not create liability for a tort committed by another person with whom there was no agency or other such relationship. 
    The Alabama Rule as to tort as declared in Burns against Campbell, which is 71 Alabama 271, and W.E. Belcher Lumber Company against York 20 -- 245 Alabama 286. 
    Ratification occurs only as the Court said in the Belcher case where the relationship of agency exists and the principle derives a benefit from the Act beyond the scope of the agency. 
    Even in such a case, ratification occurs only after the principle -- after having been fully informed, fails to express his data -- his dissatisfaction after a reasonable time. 
    The Supreme Court of Alabama pointed out in the Belcher case that in tort cases, mere silence or non-interference does not amount to a ratification. 
    That is the settled law of Alabama.

speaker="william_p_rogers" startTime="789.810" stopTime="1131.651">
    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    Yes, it is Your Honor. 
    In Leach against Peirson, this Court, in the opinion of -- of -- written by Justice Holmes held that a man cannot make evidence for himself by writing a letter containing the statement he wishes to prove and then claim a failure to answer as an admission, this is a settled law too in Alabama. 
    In fact, the Supreme Court decision in the Leach case was cited and relied upon in the decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama in Fidelity &amp; Casualty against Beeland Company. 
    Now, notwithstanding this -- notwithstanding the fact that there was no evidence against these petitioners and they'll -- that the law of Alabama makes it clear that silence cannot be construed as -- as ratification of a tort committed by another who is totally unconnected with the person concerned. 
    The Courts of Alabama have found a judgment of $500,000 against these petitioners. 
    Such a basis for imposing liability is utterly without foundation in law or reason. 
    I believe that any fair reading of the record causes one to reach the conclusion that this case represents a perversion of the judicial process with no evidence to support the verdict and the case has it -- as its purpose the intimidation of these petitioners and others like them who speak off for equality and justice for the Negro in Alabama. 
    This Court said in (Inaudible) that it retains the authority to nullify action when it encroaches on freedom of utterance under the guise of punishing libel. 
    The Court held in Garner and Thompson that when the record contains no evidence to support a finding that the petitioners' rights of due process of law have been violated. 
    Now that is this case. 
    And we contend that the petitioners' rights of due process have been violated. 
    But this case is much more significant than merely a case where there's no evidence to support a finding. 
    It is clear that this case is a direct attack too on the constitutionally protected rights set forth in the First Amendment. 
    Without attempting to repeat the arguments made yesterday, or the arguments made in the amicus brief of the Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune, we merely submit, one That a fair reading of the advertisement discloses simply an attempt to speak up on a crucial public issue, not an attack on any individual. 
    And two That freedom to criticize and comment in good faith upon the conduct in office of public officials even if overstated and exaggerated is constitutionally protected. 
    Otherwise as the Court points in the Farmers Union case, all remarks even faintly objectionable, would be excluded out of an excess of caution. 
    A newspaper, however carefully it may be run cannot possibly check on every detail and every statement that is made on the great public issues of our time. 
    And public officials, I have to think quite naturally that the arguments of -- and the statements of those who oppose them are misleading and defamatory. 
    The punitive procedures such as were used in this -- in the related cases were readily available to public officials, it would present a most serious threat to a free press, possibly, the most serious threat to free press in this country during this century. 
    If this case should stand, many newspapers, magazines, radio and television networks I believe, would have to give very serious consideration to limiting their circulation or coverage to certain states, otherwise they could well be destroyed or severely damaged by a flood of punitive litigation. 
    And of course, it goes without saying that such a result would be most destructive to our national interest particularly if it resulted in stifling public discussions on issues such as civil rights and the other great issues of our time. 
    This case is not merely a case of denial of due process. 
    This case represents a federal attack under the guise of a civil libel action on freedom of the press as represented here by the New York Times yesterday and freedom of speech and assembly as represented by Reverend Abernathy, Shuttlesworth, Seay and Lowery. 
    It is the violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. 
    I like to say in closing my remarks that three of these petitioners have had their automobiles seized and sold at public auction, sheriff sale. 
    Two of them have had their land seized and sold at public auction, three have had -- have had to move out of Alabama, all have spent a great deal of time and money in this and related lawsuits.

    Mr. Samuel R. Pierce, Jr. 
    Thank you. 
    If it pleases the Court. 
    I should like to address my remarks to the question of fair trial and if time permits to discuss briefly the question of fair comment and to close by summarizing the position of the petitioners in this case. 
    A present litigation is but one of several libel suits instituted by a number of state and local officials in Alabama on the basis of an advertisement which appeared in the New York Times on March 29th, 1960. 
    The sole purpose of this litigation is to suppress and punish expressions of support for the course of racial equality and to try to keep those who are actively engaged in their fight for civil rights, such as the petitioners in this case from continuing to participate in that stroke. 
    It is the petitioners' contention that the injustice of this action which encroaches on freedom of speech under the guise of punishing for libel is magnified by the fact that the petitioners fail to receive a fair trial. 
    This trial was conducted in an atmosphere of racial bias, passion and hostile community pressures. 
    The atmosphere under which this trial was conducted is quickly sensed by bruising the record. 
    One has only to thumb through this record to find a number of interesting things. 
    One, you'll find that the record makes reference to Mr. M.R. Nachman, Jr. 
    To Mr. Embry, but when to get to the lawyers for the petitioners who happened to be Negroes, they are referred to as Lawyer Gray and Lawyer Crawford. 
    I think it's a shame in this day in time for a record to come up to this great Court where so many pronouncements of equality and freedom have been made particularly in recent years, had to have a record of this kind before it. 
    To be sure it is done by the stenographer, but the stenographer I think generally speaking reflects the attitude and the demeanor of the court and the customs and the usages of what goes on in a place where the court is located.

    Mr. Samuel R. Pierce, Jr. 
    That -- that's the judge, Judge Jones. 
    And on one occasion, one of the plaintiff -- one of the counsels for the plaintiffs mispronounced the word Negro as Niger and went in a subsequent colloquy with the judge, he said that's the way he'd been pronouncing it all of his life. 
    Now, also in final argument to the jury, plaintiff's counsel made a highly prejudicial, I think, race-baiting remarks to the jury which should have been censored by the trial court. 
    And I quote, "In other words, all of these things that happened did not happen in Russia where the police ran everything. 
    They did not happen in the Congo where they are still -- where they still eat them, they happened in Montgomery, Alabama, a law abiding community". 
    Now, I think when the Court thinks that this remark was made about the time when there was a great deal of civil strife in the Congo and there was a great deal of public statements made in newspaper articles printed about that civil strife and about how the Congolese mistreated Whites, raped and so forth. 
    The intensity of that remark can be felt here. 
    Now, it is difficult to see how there can be equal protection under the laws and due process in a court where there's not even equality of courtesy or recognition of human dignity. 
    Now, I'd like to talk for just a few minutes about the presiding judge of that trial, Judge Walter B. Jones. 
    Now, Judge Jones in a companion case, as I said before this -- there are -- this case is but one of several pieces of litigation arising out of the same set of facts. 
    And James B. Abernathy, Judge Jones made a statement on open court that the Fourteenth Amendment was a pariah, an outcast that the case would be tried in accordance with White men's justice, not in accordance with the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The exact words of Judge Jones were very interesting. 
    He said, "I would like to say for those here present and for those who may come here to litigate in the future that the Fourteenth Amendment has no standing whatever in this Court, it is a par " --

    I would like to say for those present and for those who may come here to litigate in the future, that the Fourteenth Amendment has no standing whatever in this Court. 
    It is a pariah and an outcast."

    He said, "The presence of this crowd of Negro spectators, occupying every seat from the front row to the back row of the courtroom is -- is to test and challenge the right and power of the presiding judge to direct the seating of spectators in the courtroom. 
    And here, under the constitutional laws of Alabama, he exercises in the case on trial a solemn judicial power of the state."

    But the judge, who is Judge Jones, decided that the motions under which the objections were made had lapsed and I want to get into that a little while and because I think his action there was strictly arbitrary and capricious and discriminatory.

    Mr. Samuel R. Pierce, Jr. 
    Well, what -- what happened here was this, just as well take this now. 
    Let me go back a little bit and say that the -- the respondent here contends that the constitutional objections that I've been discussing are not properly before this Court because they were not raised in a timely fashion. 
    But if the Court will examine the amended demurrers, they will see that even at that early stage of the trial, there was a -- an objection to any recovery because it was claimed by the petitioners that it would be violate the Fourteenth Amendment and that it would deprive the petitioners of their property without due process of law, would deny them equal protection of justice and would abridge the privileges and immunities of the petitions. 
    They then make -- they then again made constitutional objections and motions to exclude evidence and then finally, after the trial, they made motions for new trials and these -- that in here, they made very extensive objections, constitutional objections. 
    Now, the -- the respondent claims that -- that these objections shouldn't count and should not be before this Court because they involved lapsed motions. 
    Now, we believe that the -- the --

speaker="samuel_r_pierce_jr" startTime="2125.316" stopTime="2333.282">
    Mr. Samuel R. Pierce, Jr. 
    Well, I'm gonna -- I -- I -- I -- I will -- here's what happened. 
    After these motions for a new trial were made and they were made timely within the 30 day period, the petitioners appeared in court on December 16th and all the parties to the lawsuit, at least the times and the petitioners, they wanted to get a long adjournment. 
    Under the Alabama law, you can only adjourn a motion for new trial for 30 days at the time. 
    So these petitioners or attorneys for the petitioners, they said, well (Inaudible) -- they thought that as the New York Times was going to come in and adjourn the motion until it was heard, they would not have to appear in court. 
    And they did not appear in court until it was time to argue and that was March 3rd, 1961. 
    And when they walked into the Court on March 3rd to argue this case, the judge refused to hear argument. 
    He said that the motions had lapsed, that -- that they did not appear at the time they were adjourned and therefore they had lapsed. 
    Now, there are no cases in Alabama precisely on point. 
    The respondent cites none and we were unable to find any in our search of the Alabama cases. 
    The respondent does cite cases on lapsed motions but this involved an individual plaintiff or defendant who was allowed a motion to lapse. 
    They did not involve as here two or more plaintiffs or defendants who had each made a motion for a new trial and one had appeared to adjourn the hearing of the motion and the other had not and the court then decided on the day of the argument that the party who had failed to appear on a date, the matter was adjourned could not argue because he allowed it to lapse, announced precisely on that. 
    I'd -- I would go further here Your Honors and say that state judges have an obligation to protect fundamental constitutional rights of individuals. 
    As this -- as this court had said as far back is Gibson versus Mississippi in 1895, "Upon the state courts equally with courts of the union rest, the obligation to God, enforce and protect every right guaranteed or secured by the Constitution of the United States." 
    More recently, in Johnson versus Virginia, this Court stated that the state has a duty to deny no one equal protection. 
    I think that the action of the judge here was arbitrary, whimsical and capricious. 
    And for that reason alone, can be set aside and the objections that are raised can be looked at by this Court. 
    Moreover, this Court has held that alleged violations of fundamental constitutional rights when plainly and reasonably made, are not to be defeated under the name local practice and such violations are reviewable by this Court even if they were not raised strictly in accordance with local forms of practice and procedure and -- procedural technicalities. 
    Therefore for all of those reasons --

    It -- it is our position here that there was absolutely no cause or connection between the petitioners and the alleged libelous statement. 
    There is no evidence to show that the petitioners authorized published or ratified this statement in question. 
    Consequently, the recovery against the petitioners is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and that it amounts to a denial of due process. 
    Moreover, we submit that a fair reading of the entire advertisement involved in this case discloses simply an attempt to speak on a crucial public issue. 
    It is not an attack upon any specific individual therefore it's protected by the First Amendment. 
    We further submit that even if this can properly be -- properly be characterized as a libel case, the utterances here made as they were in good faith and without proof of any special damages are constitutionally protected since they relate even on the respondents' theory solely to criticism of his conduct as a -- an elected official.

    The record of which is not before this Court. 
    We take sharp exception. 
    The statements of Judge Pierce and of Mr. -- General Rogers regarding matters which we say and we say -- we say correctly are not involved in this case. 
    Matters which were not raised at the trail of this case with matters which had most were presented in the Supreme Court of Alabama and in this Court and at worst, matters which don't even relate remotely to this case but to another case that was tried three months after this case was over.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="roland_nachman_jr" startTime="2873.613" stopTime="3018.560">
    Mr. Roland Nachman, Jr. 
    -- but some of the points were raised for the first time before the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    They were not raised at all in the trial court when this case was tried or -- and -- and as to the James case, I think I can dispose of that quickly. 
    That hasn't even been appealed Your Honors. 
    That there -- there is no record of that case. 
    And in connection with records, in answer to Mr. Justice Goldberg's question, the trial court does not and did not approve the record of this case. 
    As a matter of fact, there is a statutory procedure and we've cited the statute in the appendix to our brief. 
    "Whereby any person, any party who has an objection to anything that is transcribed in the record which that party thinks is inaccurate, he can make an objection before the trial judge. 
    And then the matter is brought to the attention of the trial judge and the trial judge rules on the question of whether or not the court reporter has accurately and properly transcribed the record." 
    But in the absence of such a motion, the trial court has nothing whatever to do with it. 
    That the -- the record in Alabama is certified by the clerk of the court and by the court reporter who transcribed the testimony and that is it. 
    Unless there is an affirmative motion made by a party objecting to any part of the record as being improper, the trial court has nothing to do with it. 
    And we had nothing to do with it, it wasn't our record. 
    The Times had it prepared. 
    The other defendants all of whom were defendants jointly in this lawsuit are -- are appealed and it was their record. 
    What the Court -- the court reporter's designation of their counsel didn't even get before the court with -- that the trial court. 
    And as a matter of fact, it wasn't even raised in the Supreme Court of Alabama where over 80 assignments of error were made by these defendants and that we submit is the spurious nature of these objections that are now brought before the highest court in the land, matters that weren't even mentioned below much less raised and disposed of and this -- this record does not carry the stamp of approval of the trial court because there never was any occasion for him to consider it.

    It -- it was simply a court reporter's designation when he wrote the transcript up and as -- as I have said, there was ample opportunity for these petitioners to accept to the record, to ask the trial court, to direct the court reporter to change it if it has been improper.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="roland_nachman_jr" startTime="3412.295" stopTime="3614.601">
    Mr. Roland Nachman, Jr. 
    For this reason sir -- that is one of the reasons. 
    The motion for a new trial lapsed. 
    Another reason was that the Court, the trial court and the Supreme Court of Alabama subsequently held that under Alabama practice, long established, the only matters it can be -- considered by a trial court on a motion for a new trial on matters that are contained within the record, unless the ground for the motion for a new trial is newly discovered evidence. 
    If newly discovered evidence is one of the grounds for motion for a new trial, then the party moving may seek to introduce evidence in support of its motion. 
    But if that is not the ground and this of course was not the ground, then the Court may not consider on the motion for a new trial matters which were not part of the trial record. 
    Now, this -- this was -- this point was reached for the New York Times because it kept its motion alive so to speak. 
    The point was never reached for the individual defendants because they allowed -- allowed their motion to lapse. 
    And this is why I say sir that -- that your -- your observation was partially correct even if they had kept their motion alive -- their motions alive, they still would not have been able to introduce any evidence outside the record which did not deal with -- with newly discovered evidence. 
    On the question of lapse while I'm on it, we think the cases that we've cited Your Honors are crystal clear. 
    And I state what has long been the law of Alabama, they're cited in Footnote 4 on page 5 of our brief, "That it is incumbent on a -- on a party moving for a new trial either to submit for consideration by the Court within 30 days or to get a continuance for resetting within a 30-day period." 
    If this is not done, the cases as I say are crystal clear and of long standing, the motion is as the Alabama Supreme Court calls it, "discontinued". 
    And this is what happened to their motions. 
    These -- these defendants, the Times on the one hand and the individual defendants on the other tried their cases completely -- separately throughout. 
    They were represented by a different counsel, as a matter of fact, there were frequent objections in the record by Times' counsel to questions that the individual petitioner's counsel asked and all that sort of thing. 
    And if there was to be any -- any joint protection so to speak, it seems to me that -- that the Times possibly should've taken it. 
    But certainly, there is no requirement that where there are several defendants, that if one does one thing, it's presumed that he does it for all of the rest of the defendants in the case. 
    As a matter of fact, one of the principle contentions as the Court has obviously recognized, one of the principal contentions in the case on the part of the individual defendants was that the Times had published their names on this ad without any authority. 
    And there was quite a difference of -- of -- of a position at the trial throughout on this matter.

    They had not been set for hearing or -- on -- on a particular day.

    Mr. Roland Nachman, Jr. 
    The cases that we've cited do not as I recall, deal with multiple defendants but there is no difference made in -- in Alabama practice where -- whether there's one or -- or several defendants. 
    In other words, it is incumbent on the movement to present his motion for hearing within 30 days and if he doesn't, he's got to get a continued for setting within a 30 day period otherwise, it's discontinued and we've cited cases that -- that go back a considerable number of years in Alabama. 
    It's -- it's a -- a well established rule of Alabama practice. 
    We -- we will certainly if -- if the Court would like or -- or attempt to give the Court a -- of a case where there are joint defendants but we do not think it makes any difference, Your Honor. 
    In -- in other words, it's -- it's what's incumbent on the movement in connection with his motion for new trial.

    The -- the -- the second time there was -- there was no -- when -- when the matter came on for hearing, the trial judge announced that the individual petitioner's motions had lapsed and for -- I -- I was going say proceeded to hear the Times' motion. 
    Actually, I think the Times' motion was heard and then the counsel for the individual petitioners sought to bring theirs to the attention of the Court and the Court announced that -- that theirs was discontinued or was dead to use the -- the -- the colloquial list. 
    But there was one continuance by the individual petitioners, quite separate from the New York Times and certainly indicates again that that they were handling their case on a separate basis and were not riding the -- the Times' coattails.

    Your Honor, there -- there was no occasion for such an instruction because they didn't do anything. 
    If they had done this and it made the contention that by doing it, they complied with the statute, we would've had one situation but these defendants testified without exception that they did nothing. 
    And so we have -- we don't have a situation where they attempted to comply and -- and to give a retraction of -- of the same publicity that the ad itself had had and -- and we think that by that very simple expedient, these petitioners could have given publicity to the fact that they retracted.

    Mr. Nachman, I'm very much interested in the basic question argued by (Inaudible) as to evidence in connection with -- whether they were responsible for this.

    It seems to me it divides the (Inaudible) into two parts.

    I'd like to just --

    Mr. Roland Nachman, Jr. 
    Alright, sir. 
    I was just going to address myself to that. 
    First of all, their names were on the ad. 
    Secondly, a demand for retraction was sent to them. 
    The demand for retraction said, to -- to paraphrase it, "You published a defamatory ad about us, about me", the -- the plaintiff. 
    Now, under the rules of evidence, Alabama has them and it's a common rule, if an inculpatory statement or charge is made to a person, in circumstances which would ordinarily call for a reply and the person doesn't reply, he doesn't deny the charge contained. 
    That failure to deny in those circumstances is considered evidence of the fact that the person did what he was charged with doing. 
    In this case, publishing this defamatory statement. 
    Now, this is different from the question of retraction.

    Mr. Roland Nachman, Jr. 
    And the answer was -- yes, sir but if the -- if these individual defendants did not object as they didn't object, the answer went into evidence and there was no request to restrict it to anybody. 
    There was no objection to it. 
    It went into evidence. 
    It went before the jury and there was no objection to -- to that letter. 
    Now, there was a conflict of testimony as to whether or not there were two lists of names attached to the -- the Randolph letter. 
    The -- the petitioners maintained and their witness Murray testified that there was one list and then later a subsequent list of names was added to that list. 
    And that their names were on the subsequent list and were not included in the original Randolph authorization. 
    On the other hand, Mr. Redding who testified for the New York Times and the Times makes this observation on page 16 of its brief. 
    Mr. Redding who was in charge of the Advertising Acceptability Department said, he did not recall any two lists. 
    That far as he knew, there was no difference between the lists, a conflict of testimony which went to the jury on that point.

    Mr. Roland Nachman, Jr. 
    -- we respectfully and in addition to that on the question of ratification which we also contend provided a basis for the judgment against these individual defendants. 
    They're quite the contrary to the argument that was made by counsel for petitioners. 
    There is no requirement in Alabama and there is no requirement generally that there be a preexisting agency relationship before there can be ratification. 
    Mr. Seavey (ph) in the restatement of agency says, "There need to be no preexisting agency relationship." 
    We've cited that in our brief and contrary to what counsel argued, Alabama requires no preexisting agency relationship to Birmingham News Company case which is cited in our brief, makes it perfectly clear but we've cited in Footnote 18 on page 23 of our brief, makes it perfectly clear that there need to be preexisting agency relationship in order for there to be ratification. 
    And I believe, the question was asked -- answered in -- in response to Mr. Justice Harlan's question about whether there were some equal protection matter involved because in this case, there was no preexisting agency relationship and ratification was found. 
    Whereas in other Alabama cases, the Court had held that there had to be a preexisting agency relationship, this is simply not the case Your Honor. 
    And the Birmingham News case which we cited on page 23 in Footnote 18 so holds and was so interpreted not only by the Supreme Court of Alabama but by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Parks against the New York Times -- New York Times against Parks as it is here, which was -- the same case were cited in the Court of Appeal's decision. 
    So we say that, in addition to these items of evidence, we also have ratification. 
    And we say --

    It said that you published this ad in the New York Times on March 29, 1960, saying specifically this and it quoted two paragraphs from it, the two paragraphs which were -- were discussed at some length yesterday and -- and -- and referred to the ad as a whole.

    We don't think that either on this issue or on ratification Your Honor, a preexisting relationship is required. 
    We think that Alabama stands for that and we think that Mr. Seay, his restatement states the law generally on that and that a preexisting relationship is not required. 
    On the other matters that -- the -- the question of the courtroom in the atmosphere at the trial and other matters that -- that -- that are raised even including the question of whether the trial judge was properly elected. 
    These things we submit were complete afterthoughts had nothing to do with this -- with -- with -- with the -- the record in this case. 
    They are not -- they were not -- none of these matters were raised before the trial court even if these people had not let their motions for new trial lapsed. 
    We say they would not have been properly presented because these are things that should be presented at the time, not on motions for new trial later. 
    And not in this case, we think they are smoke screens for this case, we think the sole question that these people attempted to raise which deal with federal due process was the question of whether or not there was enough evidence to connect these people with the publication of this ad to get to a jury and that we submit is the sole federal question that was raised in this record.

    That -- that's right sir.

    You can't raise things like that by demurrer or by motions for a directed verdict. 
    These -- these are things that -- that -- that requires specific motions going to those specific matters and they simply aren't in this case nor is there in this case what may be in another libel suit and we -- we think that whether another libel suit is -- is a -- a -- a valid one or a groundless one is not before the Court in this case. 
    This case should be heard and we are confident it will be heard on its own merits. 
    These were joint defendants Your Honors, under Alabama practice, a jury could not even if it had wanted to apportion, culpability or damage among several defendants. 
    We've cited in our brief the case of -- of Bell against Riley Truck Lines where a jury as a matter of fact tried to apportion damages among joint tortfeasors and the Alabama Supreme Court says, "This cannot be done.

    Mr. Roland Nachman, Jr. 
    No sir. 
    I said that there were -- what I meant to say sir was -- was that there were separate theories of defense on the part of the -- the -- the different defendants, individual defendants on one -- one side and the New York Times on the other. 
    The -- the -- the trust of the -- the evidence of -- of these individual defendants was really the -- they had nothing to do with the publication of this ad. 
    It was tried as a joint case, yes sir. 
    But -- but they -- they had different attorneys and each was looking out for the interest of his own clients, that was what I meant to say. 
    We would like to -- to -- to leave with the Court in closing the observation which we made yesterday, ask the Court to bear in mind that here we have four individual defendants who reside in Alabama. 
    Two of them resided in Montgomery. 
    There was not one word of evidence from anyone of these defendants that any part of this ad was true. 
    And we ask the Court in weighing this case to bear in mind that not only did the Times put in -- failed to put in any evidence of truth but did not one of these individual defendants did either. 
    And they, even more than the Times, were in a position to know what the true facts were. 
    We ask that both these cases be affirmed. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    -- one or two brief comments. 
    I think counsel ended his remarks by saying that these petitioners reside in Alabama. 
    The fact is only one of them resides in (Inaudible). 
    I think that I would like to refer to the answers that Mr. Nachman gave to the questions by Mr. Justice Black because he left the impression that this letter from -- from Mr. Randolph even though hearsay did state that these four petitioners had authorized this publication. 
    Now, the record is just the opposite from that. 
    In page 807, Mr. Murray testified that the names of these petitioners were not included in that list and Mr. Aronson at page 755 who was the other witness who would have known said that the names were not on that list so what Mr. Nachman said is 100% different from the truth. 
    The truth is that not only did they not authorize it but in Mr. Randolph's letter, their names were not included at all.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6338.700" stopTime="6353.877">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I understood him to say there was a conflict that these two witnesses testified as you've said.I -- I may have been wrong but if someone else has testified, that a Times' man had testified about a second list, that should've been a part of it. 
    I thought he said --
speaker="william_p_rogers" startTime="6353.877" stopTime="6355.898">
    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    Well, yes he did --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="william_p_rogers" startTime="6356.141" stopTime="6396.264">
    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    -- Your Honor but there -- there was -- that the interesting thing about that is the other witness he talked about was a Mr. Redding who was not involved in the original transaction. 
    In other words, Mr. Murray took the advertisement in the Randolph letter to Mr. Aronson. 
    Mr. Murray said at this four -- the names of these four petitioners was not on that list. 
    Mr. Aronson said the names of these four petitioners were not on that list. 
    Now, the other man that he referred to was a man named Mr. Redding who subsequently reviewed the advertisement for acceptability. 
    His testimony was that he didn't know. 
    In other words, he didn't say, "Yes, the names were on the list." 
    He said, "I don't know. 
    I don't have any recollection." 
    So there wasn't any conflict of testimony on the --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did he say something about a second list or -- or --

    No, that's what he was talking about.

    I don't know of --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    His name is Redding?
speaker="william_p_rogers" startTime="6403.617" stopTime="6405.889">

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I can give you the --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6405.889" stopTime="6406.508">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's alright.
speaker="william_p_rogers" startTime="6406.508" stopTime="6663.471">
    Mr. William P. Rogers 
    The page number is 771 and Mr. Redding said that he did not know. 
    So there is no conflict at all. 
    Now, the second thing that I thought was interesting in Mr. Nachman's statement, he said, "Now, that he was not relying on the statute." 
    In other words, he said that he didn't expect these petitioners to comply with the statute but he said the failure to say anything after they received the letter in his view was an admission that they actually had authorized the advertisements. 
    Now, the fact of the matter is, they all denied that they had anything to do with it, not within the five days. 
    What if he -- if he doesn't rely in the statute as soon as they were served with the complaint, they said they did not authorize it then they -- they all gave depositions and then new depositions. 
    They said they did not authorize it. 
    They didn't even know anything about it. 
    So very quickly after they received the letters, they made it perfectly clear to the public and to Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Nachman that they had no connection at all with this advertisement. 
    So that the arguments he makes -- well, interesting, really are -- I think designed to deceive the Court. 
    The fact of the matter is these petitioners are here today because they're Negroes and because they've been leaders in the fight for civil rights. 
    That's all there is to this case. 
    Now, he -- when -- when Justice Goldberg asked him about the cases in -- in Alabama which he relied, it seemed to me he -- he didn't answer that one. 
    The fact of the matter is there are three cases, Burns against Campbell, which is 71 Alabama 271, Belcher Lumber against York, and there's Fidelity &amp; Casulty against Beeland. 
    Now, in every one of those cases, it's made perfectly clear that the law is that in a tort case, mere silence does not make you guilty of a tort. 
    There is no case in Alabama that suggest that and Mr. Nachman didn't really -- he just -- adopt the issue when you asked. 
    The fact of the matter is in that -- in the -- in the Beeland case, the Court said that a man cannot make evidence for himself by writing a letter containing the statement he wishes to prove and then claim failure to answer as omission. 
    That's a settled law of Alabama. 
    He -- he cited the Birmingham News case. 
    The Birmingham News case Your Honor is a case where the Birmingham News wanted to have a shopping guide published and it employed a person, gave him an office in the Birmingham News Company. 
    He went out and solicited ads. 
    He had the shopping guide printed. 
    The printing company sued the Birmingham News because they weren't paid for the printing. 
    They had set the bills to the Birmingham News because they thought it was for the Birmingham News. 
    And the Birmingham News didn't deny the fact that he was an agent. 
    He had an office in the building. 
    He was doing their work. 
    And the Court said in that case, because of the relationship with the party and because it certainly appeared that he was not an independent contractor that their failure to claim that he wasn't after they received the bills made them liable for the work that they had done in behalf of the Birmingham News. 
    Now that's not this case. 
    And when counsel states that case, I think he's trying to mislead the Court. 
    In conclusion, I'd like merely to say this that this case has I think very broad significance because if -- if it should be affirmed or -- let's see there are four other cases now pending where a request for damages amount to $2,500,000. 
    There are cases pending against CBS, damages amount to $1,300,000. 
    There are other cases against the New York Times for a request of damages of $1,800,000. 
    And if this case should stand in the cause the civil rights will be set back a great many years.
