    Mr. Irving Galt 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday when Court adjourned, I had been pointing out at least four factors which we were able to discern relative to the problem of securing equal representation among residence of different constituency and I want to touch on them just rapidly for a moment. 
    First of course and the most obvious is the much discussed per capita representation, which is an important factor although by no means they seen a -- well, none nor to the starting point of inquiry. 
    But there is a second, third, and fourth -- there are second, third, and fourth factors. 
    There should be some kind of minimum representation for voters of each county, that's an important ingredient. 
    I suggest that also that it might be relevant in securing equal representation to impose some limit on the physical size of districts to prevent all the large sprawling districts, that's important. 
    And finally, that it was important to ensure proper diffusion of political power, so that no one small group of counties can ignore the needs of voters in the other counties. 
    And I had started to suggest at the time of yesterday's recess that each of these is an important component in any concept of a truly viable apportionment system but ---

speaker="irving_galt" startTime="164.967" stopTime="256.624">
    Mr. Irving Galt 
    Well I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not placing a premium in the sense of giving a specific weight to any factor. 
    And as matter of fact Mr. Justice Goldberg, I would say this, that if we take anyone of these components, we have been discussing, anyone of them conceivably, a constitutional standpoint might be selected as the basis upon which a state, in exercise of it's own discretion as to what it state requires may use as a sole standard if it desires to do so. 
    That would not necessarily and probably would -- that would not render it unconstitutional per se. 
    But I would say that it's specious to suggest that any one factor should be used to the exclusion of others or be given a specific weight or you'd be used a starting point. 
    I would think that on the most circumstances, a state would have regard to a combination possibly, all of the factors which I have mentioned. 
    But no one stands out predominant, no one subordinates another. 
    It might for example be, you might have a situation of the state relying solely on the population standard, that in itself would not be unconstitutional nor would it be unconstitutional if a state relied let's say on the minimum guarantee of one -- of one representative for the voters of each county.

    And while -- we would not go that far, there are these situations of extremes. 
    This breaking point is an important concept but I would say that if it is not carried to that extreme length which is used for purposes of illustration, I suppose, along those lines, yes, but not to the extreme where rationality disappears.

    Mr. Irving Galt 
    I'm sure Mr. Justice Harlan that I fully understand your use of that term if it has reference to equating the ray against standards concept, single constituency concept of one man one vote, then I don't equate it if that was -- would be precisely the opposite of the points I was making yesterday. 
    If that is what you meant, then I would say that this is not the equivalent. 
    Now, I would like to point out too that I see no warrant whatever for an argument such as the appellants and the Solicitor General made yesterday in their briefs to the effect that per capita representation should be the starting point of inquiry and the burden of justifying any variations from per capita representation should evolved on the state whenever the plaintiffs are able to show some disparity from a per capita standing and no more warrant for that approach than for making any -- any other ingredient, minimum guarantee of one representative per county for instance, the touchstone starting point of inquiry for determining whether an -- any -- whether an apportionment furnishes equal representation. 
    Now, in most states beyond any doubt, certainly in the fairly large and fairly populous -- heavily populous states, even apportionment in those states where to rely solely on per capita representation. 
    I suggest to the Court that if anything, it might be reason to suspect its efficiency as a vehicle for equal representation because of the problems of equality which were suggested in the argument yesterday. 
    And the state experience, in this field furnishes any guide, I think it would be most unusual or certainly more unusual to find sole adherence to per capita representation that defined for example, a guarantee of one representative per county. 
    And the critical thing is this, a very plain fact it seems to me is this, if the appellants are correct that the starting point of inquiry is per capita representation, then there is no doubt that they would succeed in making a prima facie case against virtually every state of the union simply on filing a complaint with statistic showing the disparities which inevitably are there, and I do not think that this can possibly accord with any known concept that what constitutes a prima facie case. 
    Take the case of New York for instance. 
    If simply to tear a sheep out of some political scientist's textbook or to take a page from the legislative manual of New York with its recitation of figures will show that this State, 12th in the order of ranking on a per capita basis in the United States is prima facie and unconstitutional apportionment then indeed it squares with no concepts either of them as it come across --

speaker="irving_galt" startTime="661.106" stopTime="757.908">
    Mr. Irving Galt 
    We -- we have given our analysis beginning in yesterday's argument on the premise that there must be equality and we have shown that these four factors achieve very well that equality. 
    If you go to New York State for example, the second, third, and fourth factors which I mentioned are shown by our one assemblyman per county which guarantees representation to the citizens of each county that certainly tends to achieve equality and real political equality, the provisions for enlarging the senate which was to prevent the more populous districts from securing so larger representation that you would have to have oversized sprawling districts elsewhere and prevent multi-county districts. 
    And in that connection yesterday, I might note that I failed to stress one thing. 
    I talked yesterday of the need for accessibility between constituent and representative, and I did not stress at all that which is equally important and that is the converse situation of representative to constituent that is just as necessary for a representative in order to be adequately informed to go to the constituents of his district and ascertain what maybe their needs. 
    And very obviously that's a great difference in doing that in New York County and doing that in a place like St. Lawrence County or the 40th Senatorial District which is larger than the State of Connecticut. 
    And finally because it leads to something which I --

    -- and you can't get away from it.
speaker="irving_galt" startTime="882.969" stopTime="1150.508">
    Mr. Irving Galt 
    I -- I suggest Mr. Justice Harlan that when I point up an example like St. Lawrence County and the larger 40th Senatorial District, I -- I do so to show as Mr. Justice Goldberg indicated yesterday that we're trying to prevent posing greater problems that already necessarily exist with all the well-directed efforts towards achieving equally. 
    We do not want to have this characterize our system. 
    Now, there is a third respect in which New York deviates somewhat from a per capita standard and that's the senate full-ratio rule which has the obvious purpose of ensuring proper diffusion of political power. 
    And I mentioned that specifically because Mr. Justice White, I would like if I might to answer more fully a question which you imposed yesterday and that was the question of "Why New York draws a line at a 6% figure?" 
    And I want to say to begin with, that there is no magic whatever in a figure of 6% itself. 
    In fact and this is very important, I think in answering that question, no such figure appears in our State Constitution. 
    What our State Constitution does say and does provide is that any county having more than three senators shall obtain an additional Senator only on a full ratio. 
    Now, since a full ratio obviously is -- is 1/50th of the citizen population, 50 being the basic number of senators and of course a county with more than three senators has more than 3/50th, so it's over 6% of the State's citizen population. 
    And getting back then to your question Mr. Justice White, "Why draw the line at counties having more than three senators?" 
    I suppose that when it comes to a drawing line to -- to a drawing of lines, there is no fixed answer. 
    But if we are correct in saying that it's permissible to place some limitation on per capita representation for the sake of other value, it does become necessary to draw a line. 
    And I say that it is surely as reasonable to draw a line at three senators as it would be the draw line at four or to draw a line at two. 
    Or as it is as it surely is, the tax income at $600 or to tax it at $700 or to tax it at $500. 
    Now, if I may turn, there's one thing I want to try rapidly to do in the time remaining. 
    We spoke yesterday of a constitutional convention and I just want to bring out one of two specifics on that. 
    Every 20 years, there are put -- there is put to the people a specific question, "Shall there be a convention to revise the Constitution?" 
    And if a majority vote is cast in favor of holding a constitutional convention later, delegates or elected at a separate election, they are elected on the basis, number one, of three delegates per -- on the basis of senatorial districts, three times the amount of the senators from each district. 
    In other words, each district has one senator, so there are three delegates. 
    That would be three times 58 in the present apportionment, 174. 
    Plus 15 delegates elected at large, statewide which makes I think a total of 189. 
    Now, this 189 under the current apportionment, 81 would be elected from districts, from legislative districts contained within the five so-called full ratio counties and then of course the 15 at large delegates by the entire state and that would mean this. 
    If the five full-ratio counties elect, they can control 81 plus the 15 at large because they are a majority of the voters of the State and they have a majority of the total of 189. 
    That is why I cannot understand what I regard as the erroneous contention made yesterday by the appellants that the counties pictured as the victims of discrimination were powerless to change the constitutional formula.

    In the natural cause of events, I would assume so. 
    But very decidedly, this was an emphasized issue, very clearly so. 
    Now, I'd like to advert in the short time remaining to one or two other things. 
    We were talking yesterday. 
    I started to talk yesterday about the reasons why federal equity power should not be used to intervene and no compelling circumstances, and the very same factors which in our view bear on the validity of the New York formula on its merits. 
    I've also suggested, there's no reason for intervention of federal equity power without repeating them in detail, close adherence to per capita representation, the clear control of the Legislature by urban counties, a built-in opportunity for the majority to change, to convene a constitutional convention and the consistent adherence by the Legislature to principle standards embodied in its Constitution. 
    All of these suggested, there's absolutely no warranty here for federal equity intervention, and that you have to look to the governmental processes of New York as a whole since the question of legislative apportionment after all is only one facet of the problem of giving citizens of the State an adequate voice in State Government. 
    And I'll touch only on one aspect of this. 
    The Governor of the State of New York, not only as a chief executive as an -- the chief executive and administrative officer to the head of the State, but I would say without exaggeration, he is probably the most important element in the state legislative process and that's obvious because he prepares the budget. 
    He recommends legislation. 
    He has veto power which I cannot recall having been overwritten in New York. 
    It's very rare. 
    And he's elected in the -- and of course on a statewide per capita basis where the majority have the opportunity to express their voice and concern on matters affecting State Government and I --

    Mr. Galt, may I ask you this -- this question if -- if using this formula, that is used by New York and using the criteria that you have raised here. 
    If the result was to give 25% to the people from New York control the both Houses of the Legislature, would you say it was constitutional?

    Yes -- no. 
    If it worked out instead of being for 40 in one House and 41 point something in the other House, it was reduced to 25% in each House, would you say it was still constitutional?
speaker="irving_galt" startTime="1483.173" stopTime="1502.942">
    Mr. Irving Galt 
    It might be. 
    It would not necessarily -- it would by no means render it unconstitutional because the constitutional touchstone is not going to be a question of purely applied mathematics. 
    There would very probably be other statute ingredients involved there, but of course New York does not present that picture.

    Mr. Irving Galt 
    Well, the -- the answer to that is that if we discuss it in the abstract this way without regard to all the surrounding facts and circumstances, there maybe other elements appropriately to be considered there which would tend to give that equality that is required and that would be the important consideration. 
    The -- the responsiveness to the popular will is not to be measured by giving anyone element, any particular specific weight. 
    It's to be measured by the realities of the situation with regard to all the factors or with regards to all of the factors which we do have in the State of New York. 
    I see that my time has expired and unfortunately I must leave the rest of my remarks. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Leonard B. Sand

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Sand?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1606.348" stopTime="1777.102">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    We -- we have appeared before the Court on behalf, not only of the appellants, but also on behalf of the City of New York and the County of Nassau at the least in this case but who have supported the -- the positions of the appellants and we file briefs in that support and are represented by -- by counsel together with my co-counsel, Mr. Max Gross. 
    The principal point which I would like -- I would like to make in the brief time remaining is that, even if it be assumed solely for purposes of argument that accessibility is a valid criterion, the senate rule was not designed with that criterion in mind. 
    The operation of the senate rule is not such as to limit the geographical size of the senate districts. 
    The State's own examples of the large senate districts which exist under the formula indicate that fact in comparison of present senate districts with those in 1894 will show that in fact geography has been disregarded. 
    What the senate rule does is precisely what it was designed and intended to do to discriminate against the residence of the most populous areas with respect to their representation in the Legislature. 
    The formula operates in such a way as I -- as I urged yesterday as to cause a disproportionate increase in the extent of overrepresentation of the rural areas as the most populous areas increase in size. 
    There are two rules with respect to the senate formula. 
    One is the full -- the senate expansion rule to which I have referenced yesterday. 
    There is another totally independent rule which is the full ratio rule which also discriminates against the residence of the most populous counties. 
    It was suggested yesterday in response to a question of Mr. Justice Stewart, that the -- that the inequities caused by the full ratio rule are corrected when a particular county achieves a full ratio. 
    That maybe true but the basic inequity which causes the growing disproportion arises by virtue of a solely independent rule, the senate expansion rule.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Sand, as I understand that you got roughly in your argument in illustrating the -- the report of inequity, constitutional violations you've equated, have you not pretty much in Nassau County and Suffolk County or not?

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    A comparison has been made between Nassau and Suffolk County.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1797.130" stopTime="1835.293">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, I noticed there the representatives of those different counties take these adverse positions in this litigation which suggest to me that there maybe a -- a factors or some suddenly here, quite apart from what it characterized yesterday as a sixth grade arithmetic or even eight grade arithmetic. 
    I noticed that the -- the representatives of Suffolk County says at his -- the difference in the -- in the form of his County's Governments, he points that out between his County and Nassau County, these are things that haven't been briefed at all and only suggestively.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1835.293" stopTime="1884.290">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    May I -- may I -- may I suggest that the difference between Suffolk County and Nassau County is -- is very significant here. 
    Nassau County is a -- is a 6% county. 
    It is discriminated against by virtue of the senate apportionment rule. 
    Suffolk County is not a 6% county. 
    It is not discriminated against. 
    And therefore, although they are contiguous and although their circumstances are very similar, they are treated very differently by the Legislature simply because one falls in for the category of counties discriminated against and the other is not within that County -- not within that category. 
    I see that my time has expired.
