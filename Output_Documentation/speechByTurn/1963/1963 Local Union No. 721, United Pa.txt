    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    If the Court please. 
    This comes to this Court on a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Iowa. 
    That court affirmed a ruling of the trial court, Circuit Court of Woodbury County, Iowa, to the effect that the Union's participation or the employees' participation in a walkout can be effect of waiving the right of the Union to require the employer to arbitrate discharges which arose in the context of the walkout. 
    As the matter came to the Iowa Supreme Court, it came there by way of an interlocutory appeal from a ruling of the trial court under a rule of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 105, which is a rule that appears to be designed to make it possible for rulings of law, final determinations of law to be made in advance of disposition of the entire case where the facts which raise the issue of law are not contraverted. 
    As the case commenced, it was a proceeding by the Union to require the employer to arbitrate grievances which the Union had presented under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. 
    There were two grievances. 
    One was the discharge of one employee and the second grievance had to do with the discharge of approximately 190 other employees. 
    Insofar as the record discloses the facts from which these disputes arose, it discloses a set of facts very similar to the facts in the Enterprise Wheel case which was before this Court in 1960. 
    There seems to have been a dispute between an employee and someone in management. 
    That employee was discharged and then a significant number of other employees walked off the job, presumably in sympathy in protest. 
    So that, the question that is presented here is whether or not the conduct of the employees, and possibly of the Union as well, precludes the Union from requiring the employer to arbitrate the disputes under the provisions of an arbitration clause which is certainly as broad as the arbitration clauses that were before this Court in the Steel Workers cases. 
    The arbitration clause contains the language "disputes with reference to the proper interpretation or application of the provisions of the contract." 
    It's our contention that, notwithstanding what appears to have been possibly illegal conduct under the contract by the employees and the Union, that the question of the discharges, whether they were for just cause, is a question which should be decided by the arbitrator.

    I would say that there is room but I think it would be an extraordinary and very exceptional case. 
    The only decision that I think I would be inclined to agree with, which represents an instance in which the relationships between the parties had deteriorated to the point where it was probably proper to say that no contract remained, was Judge Nordbye's opinion in the Minnesota Joint Board case. 
    I don't think that situation is presented here, nor do I think that that situation is the situation that post in your hypothetical question.

speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="379.693" stopTime="539.346">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    I don't think that there was, no. 
    That would be my point, yes.I think perhaps the problem is created for the courts by the somewhat ambiguous meaning of the term "arbitrability". 
    I'm sure that there is no question but what initially the term "arbitrability" is a -- an issue which has to be considered by the court. 
    But, as I understand the decisions of this Court, it has instructed the lower courts that they are simply to concern themselves with the question of whether or not the dispute presented appears to be one on the face of the contract and the face of the arbitration clause that the parties bargain should go to the arbitrator. 
    Here, however, we have an additional reason urged, not on the face of the contract, an additional reason urged why these grievances should not go to arbitration, the reason being the claim to misconduct of the Union. 
    It seems to me that that is something in the nature of an affirmative assertion or allegation, perhaps even an affirmative defense, which for a Court to decide would necessitate the hearing of evidence, a consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the strike, the consideration to what extent the officials of the Union participated in the walkout, either encouraged it or stood by and did nothing about it. 
    It seems to me that if the contract, in its wording, in the arbitration clause appears to be such that the dispute hear a discharge should go to arbitration, that that issue of arbitrability, properly a judicial question, can be determined without the hearing of any evidence which may bare upon what I've described as in the nature of an affirmative defense to it.I would say that when the matter goes to the arbitrator, it would be perfectly proper at that point for the employer to assert that, by reason of the wrongful misconduct of the Union, it should not have the benefits of arbitration in that particular case. 
    Or, another type of affirmative assertion that might be made is that, notwithstanding what appears to be the language of the arbitration clause, the history of bargaining over the years indicates quite clearly that the particular kind of dispute which has arisen is one that the parties previously had come to an understanding, although not expressed in writing, should not be heard by the arbitrator.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    The arbitrator will hear your argument (Inaudible)
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="544.787" stopTime="776.021">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    I think the arbitrator could hear and pass upon the very argument which the respondent is making in this Court and wants the courts to pass upon, and I think it would require -- before the issue could be decided, it would require a full hearing of the evidence and the facts and circumstances surrounding the events which lead to the discharges. 
    The difficulty, it seems to us, in having a court pass on these issues, as the Iowa courts did, without hearing evidence but simply on the face of the pleading is it's extremely difficult for a court to consider as a defense to the question of arbitrability the facts and circumstances surrounding the strike without coming perilously close to determining whether or not there was just cause for discharge. 
    I believe, conceptually, you can separate the two issues. 
    You can say that one issue is simply the question as to whether or not the Union conduct is of such a nature that the contract relationship has deteriorated to the point where the employer is no longer bound to arbitrate the dispute. 
    I think that is an issue which could be posed and, apart from the evidentiary problems, probably could be passed on by a court, but what appears to us to be the inherent difficulty of the question is that once a court enters upon that, I think it is extraordinarily hard for it not virtually to decide whether or not there was just cause for the discharge. 
    I say questions conceptually are separate, but the evidence and the arguments which would go to the decision of the two questions are so closely related that once a court determines that it may properly decide whether this particular affirmative defense to the petition to seeking arbitration is a good one or not, it almost inevitably is going to be entrenching upon the question of whether or not the discharges which are the heart of grievances were for proper cause under the terms of the contract because, obviously, in some situations, arbitrators will hold that employees walking off the job without proper justification may be discharged and that that action of employees constitutes just cause. 
    But, that question is so closely related to the question which is here urged as a defense to arbitration at all. 
    Is so closely related -- these two questions are so closely related that I do not see how a court, mindful of the decisions of this Court as to the limited function that the Court is to engage in, can decide one question with almo -- out almost inevitably deciding the other. 
    So that, it seems to me, that perhaps the problem can be helped some and the issue clarified some for the guidance of lower courts. 
    If it is recognized that, initially, arbitrability is for the court to decide on the face of the contract and the language which the parties have used but that, once the matter goes to the arbitrator, there may be much more detailed considerations which the arbitrator may consider and which may lead the arbitrator to conclude that, in this particular circumstance, the conduct of one party or the other precludes it from having the merits of the -- of the grievance finally determined by way of arbitration, so that there may be two levels of the issue of abitrability.

    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    No, I don't think that it would be because, I think, there is -- there are two separate questions. 
    One of which, obviously, would be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Board, namely, whether there was an unfair labor practice. 
    Nowe, the second question might well be whether there had been a violation of the contract. 
    And, I think those two questions are separate even though the facts and circumstances bearing on the two questions may be very, very similar, if not identical. 
    As I understand respondent's argument here, it is that we do not have a situation comparable to that in Drake Bakeries because the arbitration clause here is narrower and, conceitedly, it is. 
    In Drake Bakeries, of course, the arbitration clause was so broad that this Court held that the employer had agreed by the provisions of that arbitration clause to have to go to arbitration even the question as to whether the Union should be required to pay damages for breach of contract by engaging in a strike. 
    There's no question that the arbitration clause here does not go nearly so far. 
    The arbitration clause here, first of all, is concerned with the interpretation of the contract, and the only kind of issues which can go to it are those which the Union asks to go to arbitration.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="884.739" stopTime="905.107">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is the argument broad enough to cover the question of whether or not a strike -- whether or not the contract allows the employer to repudiate for an unauthorized strike? 
    It's a matter of contract interpretation.

    -- be different -- It would be a different case if this employer were -- had brought a suit for damages and the Union countered and asked a stay in order to send the -- to put the damage claim on arbitration.
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="924.842" stopTime="1103.512">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    That's correct. 
    If it arose in a different context, it might be an issue which would not probably be one to go to the arbitrator. 
    But, here, as a matter of fact, it is quite clear, since the employers filed a counterclaim and since there is no question but what the employer has a right to have that counterclaim heard by the court and determined, that the employer retains his judicial remedy for any breach of contract by the Union and he has a right to sue, under Section 301, and pursue that remedy. 
    And, he has not given up that remedy by virtue of this particular contract, whereas, in the Drake Bakeries case, he had agreed to give up a court remedy for that type of violation. 
    Consequently, in this case, it seems to me that the reasoning applicable in the Drake Bakeries case is just as strongly in favor of having this issue go to arbitration, the grievances here, as in the Drake Bakeries case, not withstanding the difference in the two arbitration clauses and for this reason. 
    In this case, the employer retains his remedy. 
    He has filed a counter claim asking for damages in the court. 
    That counter claim is not proceeding at the present time because all proceedings in the Iowa court have been stayed, pending the determination of these issues, so that he has not restricted himself to have questions as to the violation of contract by the Union which may lead to his right to damages. 
    He still has his court remedy and is not compelled to have that question heard by the arbitrator. 
    So that, when the respondent indicates that, by reason of the narrower arbitration clause here, it is not broad enough to concern itself for the question of walkouts and strikes amounting to substantial breach, I think it is necessary to clarify that assertion and indicate that, in part, what the respondent says is correct but, impart, what he says is incorrect. 
    He is correct insofar as he is interpreting this contract and this arbitration clause as not requiring the employer to arbitrate any claim for damages he may have by reason of the conduct to the Union. 
    But, it seems to us, he is incorrect insofar as he indicates that this arbitration clause would not permit the arbitrator to consider whether or not the strike, action or walkout action by the Union, precluded the type of remedy which the Union seeks to arbitration. 
    I think it's necessary to consider in what context the issue was to be decided and, if it's in the context to have a claim for damages, then, obviously, that should be heard by the court. 
    If it's in the context of a claim that employees were improperly discharged, then, it seems to me, the issue is properly one here for the arbitrator.

    Application form.
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="1466.435" stopTime="1691.795">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    Correct. 
    That would be our position. 
    Now, preliminarily, there are two issues which have been raised which I would like to comment very briefly on. 
    The respondent contends that the judgment of the Iowa court is not a final judgment and, therefore, is not reviewable by this Court under Section 1257. 
    It seems to me that, in the practical terms and using the practical test which this Court has employed in many cases, the judgment below is final. 
    The only thing that remains undisposed off is the respondent's counter claim for damages. 
    Now, admittedly, that counter claim for damages, if and when it goes to trial, will involve a lot of questions that are very similar to the questions that would be involved before an arbitrator in connection with these grievances but, so far as the right of the petitioner to obtain arbitration is concerned, the judgment of the Iowa court puts an end to that for all practical purposes, except in the remote circumstance that respondents -- respondent suggests, namely, after a trial of a counterclaim. 
    If they were determined that the petitioner had not violated the no-strike clause, then the petitioner could ask the Iowa court to change its and reopen its decision and, at that point, perhaps order arbitration. 
    I agree that that is a hypothetical possibility but it's so remote as a practical matter and it's so remote in time that, if arbitration were to be ordered some-two or three years from now, after a trial of counterclaim, it seems to me, would have no work whatsoever. 
    And, furthermore, as far as any further proceedings in the Iowa courts are concerned, we took the matter to the Iowa Supreme Court. 
    There's no place else in Iowa to go, so that it is a determination of an issue in this case, finally, by the Highest Court in Iowa that can pass on the matter. 
    Secondly, there is, urged in the respondent's brief, the contention that there are certain undenied allegations in an amendment that -- or an answer that respondent filed to an amendment to the petition. 
    I endeavor to cover that matter in the brief. 
    Under Iowa law, where the issues are properly framed by a complaint or a petition and an answer, a reply is not necessary. 
    A reply or a responsive pleading following an answer under Iowa law is necessary only if the answer raises new issues. 
    And, in connection with the strike, the circumstances surrounding the alleged strike, the number of people who left their jobs, the matter of the picket line, and so on, those issues were all properly raised and fully raised by the pleadings prior to the amendment which respondent asserts we did not respond to or did not answer. 
    So that it would be our contention that, on the pleadings, no further pleading was necessary and that this Court could not properly take as undenied the allegations that were contained in the amendment to the answer which the respondent filed. 
    There is a -- the Iowa Supreme Court never dealt with that because the matter was not raised at any point in the proceedings prior to the brief filed by respondent in this Court. 
    We urge that the judgment of the Iowa Supreme Court be reversed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Alfred L. Scanlan

    Mr. Alfred L. Scanlan 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, before addressing myself to the three points that are involved this case, namely, the jurisdictional issue, then the merits, and then the final question touched upon by Mr. Watt whether the record in this case permits a factual basis for the legal conclusions reached by the Supreme Court of Iowa, I would like briefly just to touch on some points that had been covered in part but perhaps not fully illuminated by Mr. Watt's presentation. 
    First, and there's no argument here, the Union has conceded below, concedes here, and Mr. Watt again has conceded in argument the employer's right to sue over the breach of the no-strike clause. 
    That in a breach of the no-strike clause as a concept, at least as he put it, is a non-arbitrable matter. 
    Thus, from the beginning, we don't have the situation that was presented in Drake and in Atkinson.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1754.784" stopTime="1757.626">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You assume then this is the non-arbitrable matter?
speaker="alfred_l_scanlan" startTime="1757.626" stopTime="1863.198">
    Mr. Alfred L. Scanlan 
    Yes, that's -- the claim for damages, Mr. Justice White, for breach of the no-strike clause is a non-arbitrable matter. 
    Therefore, we don't have the problem this Court had to wrestle within Drake and in Atkinson, for that matter, to determine whether the breach was included under or out of the arbitrational clause. 
    Also, as in Atkinson, and unlike Drake, only the Union could petition for a grievance. 
    And, finally, the -- and this point I don't think has been touched upon, the no-strike clause in this case is much broader than the no-strike clause in Atkinson. 
    In Atkinson, actually, the Union had a right to strike over matters that were not subject to the grievance procedure, provided they gave notice. 
    Here, on the record at pages 8 and 9 where the no-strike clause is set forth, it is perfectly clear that it bars all strikes and walkouts and work stoppages. 
    Finally, with respect to the no-strike clause, and I think this is important in light of the shaky denials that the Union persists in that they didn't call, sanctioned, or support the strike, it doesn't make any difference for this Court's determination of this case because the no-strike clause finds both the employees and the Union, it says it has agreed that, during the period of the agreement, the employee shall not engage in and the Union shall not call or sanction any slowdown, work stoppage, or strike. 
    And, we're talking here about the reinstatement of the employees who walked out, so whether or not the Iowa court went beyond the permissible realm of judicial notice and pierce the pleadings to find that the Union was supporting the strike, it doesn't make any difference. 
    We'll deal with it as a walkout by these 191 employees.

    I -- I believe, Your -- Mr. Justice Goldberg, it isn't in the record but I think it was 205. 
    I think, the first day, they all walked out but a few came back. 
    Now, there's no question here that the walkout was over an economic dispute, a matter that was subject to grievance. 
    Their own pleadings, their application for appeal tell you what it is. 
    It was an assigning supervisory employees to the production gang, to the production line. 
    It's clearly a matter that was subject to the grievance procedure and that's what the initial walkout was all about -- I mean, the initial discharge or walkout by the first employee, Stamoulis. 
    Now, unlike Atkinson, when we filed the counterclaim in the Iowa court, they did not move to stay the counterclaim and, I think it's fairly conceded right along that the issues involved at the trial of the counterclaim are inextricably bound up with they're -- I forget the exact phrase used by the appellant, but they're practically inseparable and they are, they're basically, whether the walkout was justified. 
    I assume if the walkout was unjustified, the management wasn't perhaps justified in treating the no-strike clause as breached but the issues are there back in Iowa in the counterclaim, the same issues that Mr. Watt would send to the arbitrator.

    As I understand it, Mr. Watt agrees that we have the right to sue for the breach of the no-strike clause but, since the issues raised there are also raised by their grievance, these are economic matters for -- as to which an arbitrator is more qualified and more experienced to decide. 
    They involve a great deal of detailed pros and cons, and he should decide them first.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Scanlan, (Inaudible) don't you think that this matter had been dealt with in Atkinson? 
    It's the very question we were having discussion with.
speaker="alfred_l_scanlan" startTime="2023.221" stopTime="2131.113">
    Mr. Alfred L. Scanlan 
    No, I -- I would like to be able to claim that Atkinson settled this case in our favor, but I don't think we can read Atkinson that way. 
    Our adversary circumvent Atkinson and the ruling there by conceding that we can sue for breach but they turn out to be Indian gurus because, after making the concession, they come around and say "but if a grievance is alleged, following the walkout or the discharge which raises the same issues as the walkout -- I mean, as the alleged breach, then this must go to the arbitrator." 
    In effect, Mr. Justice White, and I know you have justifiable pride of authorship, his argument would render -- would render Drake Bakeries meaningless. 
    I see the luncheon recess has arrived and I'll sit down. 
    Well, one, if the arbitrator is privileged to determine these questions, questions which have been traditionally determined by courts, too, the question will be presented then, as we come into our -- for our counterclaim, would the matter be res adjudicata in that case. 
    I would contend, no, they are two different and unrelated causes of action, but the problem exists. 
    But, there's another aspect to the point I think Justice Black raised. 
    If we're going to take what are admittedly traditional causes of action for breach of contract, for instance, and there are other areas, raising issue that courts have traditionally determined, under conditions of a jury trial, swearing of the witness, full judicial protections, and pass them over on the grounds of some alleged expertise in a situation, where I think it's fairly arguable the employer didn't bargain for, where the Union concedes that he attempted to preserve his right to sue.

    You had progression from (Inaudible) and the question is whether they didn't want to view and, when the dispute is over, the application at that time for arbitration as a bargaining agreement.

    Mr. Alfred L. Scanlan 
    Well, I'll say this, Mr. Justice Goldberg. 
    If his analysis is signed, then, it seems to me, an employer never can protect himself against avoiding arbitration when there's been a material breach. 
    The suggestion in your earlier question that were presented in this case, with the possibility there's nothing left of the material breach doctrine, then will be a fact and I think that result would be a disservice to arbitration.

    Mr. Alfred L. Scanlan 
    Well, no, I don't think you could. 
    The way I see it, you -- suppose this was an expressed no-strike clause. 
    “Breach of this no-strike clause shall in no way give rise to issues that are subject to arbitration,” suppose that was written in there very carefully by lawyers. 
    He could still come in here because, once there's a walkout or striker -- in most cases where there's a walkout or strike in violation of the "no-walkout or no-strike clause," it's followed by discharges. 
    The employer is mad. 
    He tells them “comeback or I'll fire you.” 
    He fires them. 
    So, the Union then will be able to use arbitration when it wants to and layoff when it does. 
    In other words, if you have a weak grievance strike, maybe the employer will capitulate. 
    If he doesn't capitulate like he did in here or if the strike fizzles, “alright, now, let's arbitrate.” 
    It seems to me, arbitration then, Your Honor, will not only be a one-way street. 
    It will be a dead-end for an employer.

    It should proceed. 
    Actually, they didn't ask to stay the counterclaim and I suppose the courts could've moved ahead if we hadn't got down -- I would say blocked down, involved in the appeal that is now before Your Honors today.

    As I say, they can make this concession and then they take it back by the argument they advance about the grievance. 
    It seems to me that this makes the Drake Bakery opinion, which we think is a sound opinion and a controlling opinion, would rarely have a set of facts to which anyone could apply it in following a wake out -- a walkout because the grievance would be asserted and the argument would be made. 
    Grievances are things that arbitrators are procurely equipped to determine.

    Suppose the Iowa court, on the trial of the counterclaim, decides that there was -- the Union did not authorize a strike or a walkout. 
    It had no part in it. 
    Just assume that.

    Even if the Union didn't advocate support or sanction the strike, we still have the case because the employees walked out. 
    The record is clear on that, and the clause -- the no-strike clause applies to walkouts by the employees, as well as strikes called by the Union. 
    But, just to rephrase your question, if I may, if the trial court found that the men were justified in walking out on the trial of a counterclaim, our argument then would be that, certainly, the Union would be free to reopen it under appropriate Iowa procedure and, if that was denied, they could appeal to the Supreme Court of Iowa because, then, the order would be final. 
    The whole controversy would be finished and, if the Supreme Court of Iowa denied that, they would be back here.

    Oh, no.

    I think the trial court of Iowa and the Supreme Court of Iowa, more familiar perhaps with the controversy, were entitled to go so far as to say the Union, if it didn't call it, it sanctioned it.

speaker="alfred_l_scanlan" startTime="2986.848" stopTime="3174.824">
    Mr. Alfred L. Scanlan 
    May I -- may I answer that, if I can, Mr. Justice Goldberg? 
    I agree that the mutually dependent Covenant Doctrine is not applicable as such to labor Union contracts. 
    I agree that -- I won't say they're sui generis but they're certainly different than many of the commercial contracts with which courts are familiar. 
    But, they are not that different and the clauses that are important to the various parties are many, and I don't argue that, in every negotiation, the no-strike clause is given in exchange for the arbitration clause. 
    But, certainly, the negotiating parties regard them as having some correlation. 
    I noticed our opponents, well, let's put it this way. 
    I think at least the two clauses have this in common. 
    Both aim at labor peace, both aim at continued production and employment, and both of them the no-strike clause on the one hand and the arbitration clause on the other, represent a very valuable concession by the respective party. 
    For the employer, on the arbitration clause, he has given up the right, in effect, to manage his business in a certain area. 
    For the Union, by giving the no-strike no-walkout clause, they surrendered a very valuable economic right. 
    So, while they may not be quid pro quo, and I don't argue that they are and I agree that there's a difference, nevertheless, they are important to the parties and they have some relation. 
    Now, our adversary say, in the reply brief, they rather minimize the importance of the no-strike clause to the -- to the employer. 
    At Page 13 of their reply brief, they said, "No one pretends that a no-strike clause guarantees an employer against strikes." 
    Well, I don't know where and on what basis they make that point, and -- but I suggest that the importance of the no-strike clause of the employers of this nation may be found in the statistics given us by a very -- a writer in a very recent note in the New York University Law Journal, 38 NYU at Page 1009, were he says, "Absolute no-strike clauses are found in 48%, conditional no-strike clauses in 46% of all collective bargaining contracts." 
    But, I will agree that maybe the importance of the no-strike clause, which is the employer's guarantee of industrial peace during the period of agreement. 
    I will agree maybe its importance varies from industry from industry. 
    Perhaps, in the Steel Industry, for instance, it isn't -- it's important but not so bad as a strike, but as merely cessation of production and you stop sales at a profit. 
    But, in an industry like the Meat Packing Industry where you have perishable cattle out in the yards, 3,000 or 4,000 of them, shrinking in the sun at the rate of 4% a day, the guarantee of continued prosuc -- production and the immunization of the employer from even quickie strikes, and this was no quickie strike, the record is perfectly clear. 
    It begun on May the 11th and they filed their grievances on July the -- on July the 15th. 
    This was no quickie strike. 
    You can see the importance of the no-strike clause to an employer and if it's going to turn out --

    Well, I'm saying, from the general proposition, if it turns out that no-strike clauses can -- an arbitration clause can be used by the Union in two ways one, when they have a legitimate grievance and they seek arbitration, fine. 
    On the other hand, they have a weak grievance, they're still permitted to resort to the test of their economic strength. 
    They strike. 
    When the strike fizzles or the employer proves stronger than they thought, then they claim -- then they assert the grievance. 
    They want to arbitrate the discharge, which is exactly what they did here on July the 5th, after the strike was finished in effect. 
    In other words, it wasn't achieving its objective. 
    They wanted to arbitrate. 
    Now, that's -- if arbitration is going to mean that to employers, I suggest that employers will be reluctant to enter into that type of agreement. 
    Now, if that's true, I don't think we --

    He was entitled to take the position that material breach had occurred and I think, under Drake Bakery, there is room left for a material breach that can be determined by a court and does not have to be referred to an arbitrator who has no special expertise in that field.

    I see no reason why the arbitration could not proceed simultaneously with the counterclaim which the respondent has for damages pending in the Iowa courts.

    Assume that you are asking to have arbitrated something with reference to the interpretation of the contract as applied to the conduct involved where you ask the ar -- for arbitration of that and the final decision on it, and you get it in your favor, and suppose that same issue has to be solved by the court.

    Which governs?

    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    I think, although the factual circumstances upon which the arbitrator and the court would base a decision are substantially the same, the precise issue which each must decide is different. 
    The arbitrator must decide whether, under the circumstances, there was just cause for discharge. 
    The court must decide whether the Union violated the contract by participating in, sanctioning, or calling the strike.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3698.778" stopTime="3727.342">

    That's right.

    Would the arbitrator's decision be final or could the court make a different decision?

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That would be a little contrary to the rule we've had with reference to primary jurisdiction of the various agencies, and I don't say that it should apply but it's the problem that worry me in connection with the arbitrator deciding some of the same things that would be involved in the right to sue which Congress has given for bridge of the contract, whether rightful or wrongful.
