    The answer in this proceeding admitted that the illegal practices complained of had continued in Virginia and elsewhere in the United States up to April 1, 1959, which we have referred to during this trial as the magic date.

    That is the contention that was made but I think that is not accurate because the record will also show that the -- I have not had the opportunity to develop to you just the -- the way that these financial records were managed then I will undertake to do so now. 
    This specific -- specific check was a check which was made out -- or directed to be made out by the president. 
    It was sent to the Legal Aid Department, the stub of the check is at 1246 in the record. 
    Mr. Savage had sent bills for personal services to the Brotherhood in amount of $6800 which is on page 1247. 
    Now, that was then ordered to make out a check to Mr. Savage. 
    It was sent to the Legal Aid Department. 
    The Legal Aid Department then sent it back to the general fund to the credit of Mr. Savage. 
    That's the way that transaction was done. 
    Now, that $6800 was in part the reimbursement to the Brotherhood for the use of a man named Tingle who was then a regional investigator and who was assigned by the Legal Aid Department to Mr. Savage for his use. 
    In other words, that Tingle was paid by the Brotherhood's Legal Aid Department but reimbursed by Legal Counsel. 
    And those current operations went on as you had stated this morning until April, those are all mixed up in that $6800.

    Mr. Aubrey R. Bowles, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Harlan asked the question as to how many cases there were in Virginia. 
    And the answer to that will answer your question simply because Mr. Kennedy, the president of the Brotherhood, testified that as soon as this suit was commenced and a suit shows that there was a long period of conversation between the Committee of the Bar and the Brotherhood before that. 
    But as soon as these questions were raised, that he stopped all business in Virginia of every kind, and that there was no service rendered to any Virginia member of the Brotherhood during dependency of this contest between the Bar and the Brotherhood. 
    Now sir, that being so, Mr. Savage -- Mr. Savage would not even come into Virginia so that he could be served, neither would -- did Mr. Tingle. 
    And they claim that there was no business done, awaiting, as Mr. Kennedy said, the pleasure of the Supreme Court of Virginia or the Chancery Court to tell him in Virginia what he could do. 
    Now, as I started to explain, the basis of this decree is predicated upon the fact that they say prior to April 1, 1959, they did not do this either in Virginia or anywhere else. 
    And the proof here shows that we could not find a case in Virginia where this was done. 
    But we found some seven or eight others in other places where they had done this exact same things which they had it in some dozens of instances before, claim they would not do it and then go on right back to it as soon as the heat was off. 
    But under that basis, this chancellor had the present apprehension which we have a statute to that effect that gave him jurisdiction to apprehend that the thing would be resumed in Virginia as it had admittedly been done prior to April 1, 1954.

    That I -- I do not know that sir. 
    They were for personal services rendered to the Brotherhood apparently for other reasons than the FELA case. 
    Now, the respondent first contends if Your Honors please, that there really is no questions for this Court to determine because an examination of this decree shows very clearly in our view that the thing that they say they want the right to do, namely, to tell their members that they ought to get counsel before they settle a case and to recommend the name of a competent lawyer. 
    Nobody can possibly complain of that. 
    All of us lawyers get a -- a practice by a virtue of reputation. 
    And to John Jones may say that so and so is a good lawyer. 
    And when the thing stops there, there can be no complaint by the Bar or by anyone else. 
    Now, if that is so as to what they contend that that is the purpose and -- of -- of their intention, by this plan then there is not one single thing in this decree of the Chancery Court of the City of Richmond that prohibits that. 
    And the finding of fact you will notice says, as to some of these facts that they find that they have done them in the past and still continue to do them as to other facts, however, the finding as only that they have done them in the past.

    Mr. Aubrey R. Bowles, Jr. 
    Well, that means that I must review right now, which I had intended doing from the record very briefly, what this plan is. 
    First of all, it is a contract agreement between the lawyers, and I suggest to you that there's nothing in the Illinois decree that forbids this. 
    There is nothing in their brief or anywhere else that says what I'm telling you now isn't still going on. 
    There's no denial of it that they entered into a contract which says in effect, "If you will appoint me to be the lawyer in this region, then I agree to do certain things namely, to handle your FELA cases on a 25% commission instead of a higher one. 
    And I agree that I will pay all the expenses involved in the trial, such as, getting witnesses' fees and medical testimony and that I will investigate the case and pay all those expenses. 
    And, that if I will do all of those things, you will undertake by a system of advertising of me, the lawyer, to all of your members in such a way that I will be assured of a sufficient whole -- sufficient volume of business in order to warrant me doing this business on a wholesale basis." 
    Now, that's the contract that they signed.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1501.281" stopTime="1502.365">
    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="aubrey_r_bowles_jr" startTime="1502.365" stopTime="1580.651">
    Mr. Aubrey R. Bowles, Jr. 
    That's what I was coming to a moment ago. 
    That contract and it's the advocacy of that is what they want to do as I was about to show you. 
    Look at Page 8888 -- 8888, that is in Volume II sir. 
    Now, this is a contract that Mr. Savage signed back in 1937. 
    The purpose of it is stated in the first paragraph. 
    Regional lawyers will be selected in various railroad centers in the United States with a view to rendering the service contemplated by the establishment of the Legal Aid. 
    And the total membership in a given districts so as to give regional lawyers a reasonable assurance of a sufficient volume of Brotherhood business to warrant their rendering of proper service on the basis of compensation agreed upon. 
    Now, Mr. Savage signed that contract as you will see over at page 8982. 
    I think that's where he said it back, right at page 891 and he --

    Unknown Speaker

speaker="aubrey_r_bowles_jr" startTime="1584.654" stopTime="1765.533">
    Mr. Aubrey R. Bowles, Jr. 
    1937 and he's been operating under that contract and so far as I know, and this record shows, he is now operating under this contract. 
    It has been amended by letters, saying that he can't split fees. 
    But it has never been amended to show that the Brotherhood is not sending his name daily, monthly, weekly, by its publications, by its directories, by seculars, by officiaries, meetings, and which he's allowed to speak and tell him what a great lawyer he is and how many great cases he has won and so forth and so on. 
    In other words, this is a -- a Number 1 Madison Avenue pre-mind conditioning that if you ever have an accident, this is the lawyer you must employ. 
    And that's a contract that they've entered into. 
    Now, that is the thing that we are after, mark if Your Honors please, that somebody who is a friend. 
    Incidentally, there is proof shows, generally, those friends who went to go and tell the man about his rights, got paid off anywhere from $150 up to $1000. 
    But the -- this is not an objection of the Virginia State Bar and then a friend should go to a man and say, "I -- I know my cousin uptown." 
    You will find in this record where these regional lawyers, get into realms with themselves, trying to see whose going to get the case that you -- one or the other is going to get and they begin to hold them away from each other. 
    There is a case of that sort in this record established where within one day, after a girl came back from a hospital, after having giving birth to a baby, three days after her husband was killed on the railroad, she was assailed on the first day of her return by reason of counsel in Atlanta. 
    And on the third day after her return, by the Chairman of the whole Brotherhood on a particular Georgia railroad trying to take it to Mr. Reeves over in Birmingham, so they were competing with one another. 
    That is that they agreed of trying to break up. 
    Not the question of what I hope my friends do for me is to recommend me, but you will find in the hideous deposition, right in the State of Illinois, that happened after April 1, 1959, that these people came after Mr. Hughes so much and so often and so frequently until Mr. Hughes had a nervous breakdown at the solicitation. 
    That is in this record. 
    That is the reason that the record is so voluminous because those cases had to be shown in order to show this Court exactly what has been going on and what we believe is still going on.

speaker="aubrey_r_bowles_jr" startTime="1779.711" stopTime="1927.817">
    Mr. Aubrey R. Bowles, Jr. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court in so many works did not jump on solicitation perceived. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court said we are greatly embarrassed by the prior decision of our intermediate Court that said this was a wonderful plan. 
    The -- and on that account, we will not administer any disciplinary measure against the union. 
    They said, "You cannot have a man that will go out and carry a contract to sign and to fill it up." 
    They said, "You can't split fees." 
    They said that you can't in the thudding of this thing. 
    You cannot carry around checks showing what the great settlements we've made in the past. 
    And you cannot make contributions to the Legal Aid Department. 
    But the Illinois Supreme Court did not say, you cannot advertise this man ahead of time to the point that everybody is brainwashed already if you have a -- have an accident, the whole force of the whole thing converges upon him to get him into the hands of one single lawyer. 
    Now, you'll note, the contention is not their right to recommend a competent lawyer. 
    The contention is to recommend a competent lawyer selected by me, the president, under my control that I think is competent, not the man who is going to have the case. 
    Now, the president has said, and I believe you asked the question Mr. Justice Harlan, that about the control of fees. 
    The control of fees still exists. 
    Mr. Kennedy testified that if anybody charged more than he thought he ought to charge, he'd fire him as reason of counts. 
    And I said to him, "Mr. Kennedy, you do control the situation, do you not?" 
    And he said, "To that extent." 
    Because the Constitution shows and the whole case shows that the sole control of this Department is in one man, the president, under the Constitution and he's the only man that can approve anything that's done in there.

    So, now you'll see that's what they want to do by looking at Page 27. 
    After a recital that all lawyers except the union lawyers are hostile to union members, which I think is a very erroneous assumption, says, because of this hostility, the only effective way to see that union members obtain legal advice is to permit group referral to union lawyers. 
    This is that basis of the petitioner's plan.

    They say that the right to freedom of speech -- now, the right to freedom of speech and the right to freedom of association, that fundamental right permits the Brotherhood to advocate their employment of those lawyers in whom the Brotherhood has competence. 
    Alright, it isn't a question of recommending. 
    It's a question of solicitation, advocating and when we get to question of where there is a financial interest -- I've just read to you that in 1955, the interest was something over $2.5 million.

    Legal Aid is supposedly as I understand it, and -- and we, in Virginia, understand it, to be for indigent people and the legal aid in Virginia is prohibited from accepting any contingent fee contract in a case that is worthwhile to any lawyer.

    Now you see this plan sets up what seems to me is sort of an elaborate early warning system to these people who they are engaged in a dangerous activity. 
    There's no question about that. 
    And they are unquestionably likely to have an accident and they are told in advance. 
    The man you heard at the (Inaudible) last Friday is the only man in this whole area that knows enough about this thing to give you a square deal, and to get you a square deal. 
    And they undertake to argue, that all railroad clear maidens, thieves and robbers who have steal, that's -- that's the motive upon which the plan was done. 
    It was that those people would do your deck. 
    Now, we get around to them that this is a composite thing. 
    It begins with the original proposition of saying we've set up a plan, we've designated the lawyer, we advertised him, we agree that in -- in turn for your agreement to do this the way we want it done, we will see that you get the volume. 
    And if you read on -- on those pages of 888, you will see that the elements of control, the control fees, the solicitation and splitting of fees are all in that contract. 
    Now, it has been modified with respect to the splitting of fees.

    Mr. Aubrey R. Bowles, Jr. 
    (Inaudible) sir. 
    Could I have saved three minutes to do it here. 
    Now, there -- there -- the First and Fourteenth Amendments has interpreted in the Button case as I understand it, undertake to say that, well first shall I say this. 
    The Button case starts off, by recognizing the State's interest in regulating the "tradition on an illegal practice of barratry, maintenance and champerty". 
    Now that the assumption and credibleness upon which I understood your opinion to start sir. 
    Now, from time immemorial I think this Court has recognized the rights of the states to regulate the practice of the law and the professions, and if we get to that point really what the question and real issue here is whether or not that practice in law is a profession or whether it's a business. 
    Now, if it's a business, there's no difficulty about regulating the -- them doing the things that they want. 
    But if it is a profession, it is the only profession I submit in which the courts and this Court has the inherent power to regulate. 
    It's the only one. 
    Now, you've regulated dentist from hanging a tooth outside the window, you have regulated various and sundry professions on the ground that a state has a proper right to do that and you have seen some magnificent things in assembler case for example. 
    The community is concerned with the maintenance of professional standards which will ensure not only competency and so forth and so on. 
    Now, in this situation, as well as in (Inaudible), this Court has never expressed a doubt about the states prior right to regulate the profession that overrides the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    Now, the exemption that was made in the -- in Button as I understand it if I read the majority opinion there correctly, is that that interest does not justify their prohibition of the N.A.A.C.P. activities disclosed by this record. 
    Now, the activities that were disclosed by that record were that they were modes of political expression which were undertaken and used to protect constitutionally guaranteed rights.

    That is correct sir, and he sues under a federal statute.

    No sir, I think that the regulation of it and there's nothing in this decree that prevents the individual present for doing that. 
    There isn't -- there isn't anything in this decree that prevents recommending a lawyer. 
    There is in this decree something that prevents going out and running and capping and getting all the cases for him that you can. 
    That's what prohibited. 
    Well, I see that my time is practically up. 
    I submit if Your Honors please, that the practice of law is not alright. 
    It is a privilege conferred by the state. 
    Now, we live under the government, under law and this Court has many times approved the proposition that a minute a member of the Bar becomes a member of the Bar. 
    He's part in the puzzle of the government under law and a member of the process of administration of justice. 
    Now, if the survival of government under law is going to succeed then it is not to depend upon the respect that the public has and the citizenry for the administration of justice. 
    And then tell you to the lawyer under practice of law, is vital to the survival of our system. 
    Now, is this practice of law a profession or is it a business? 
    I submit if Your Honors please, that the Bar of Virginia looks confident and to this Court at the pinnacle of that system to assist it in maintaining for it a high standards of a profession. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of John J. Naughton
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3415.221" stopTime="3416.710">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Naughton.
speaker="john_j_naughton" startTime="3416.710" stopTime="3590.372">
    Mr. John J. Naughton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I'm in the laws to understand the position of the Virginia Bar Association. 
    It seems to me that as stated in its brief and as stated on oral argument that the many contradictory aspects have been at the -- the same time urged by the Bar. 
    This case gets down it seems to me to how this Court and how the Bar would feel about solicitation. 
    When we first start discussing the subject of solicitation, I think it is important to mention as it is stated in the case of In re Haines in Sixth Federal Supplement 467. 
    The fact that somebody says that someone solicits a case is not an end to the matter. 
    The question always raised in these cases is, is the solicitation unethical, illegal, and unlawful? 
    As the Button case states, was there a malicious purpose in mind -- in the mind of the solicitor? 
    The record in this case is clear. 
    There is no such malicious purpose. 
    This Union was organized many years ago in 1885 and it was organized for one purpose only. 
    To tend to the many injuries and deaths suffered by its members. 
    The organization commenced as a Fraternal Insurance Association providing insurance for its members who at that time were unable to obtain insurance from any insurance company. 
    Throughout its history in its Acts of 1906 and in 1908, and seeing that the original Federal Employers Liability Act become a statute of the United States that has been interested in the injuries and the debts suffered by its members. 
    Today, it seems to me that the question is, "Does this Court recognize the rights of free speech to recommend and refer?" 
    We have cited in our brief many summaries which have stated that an uncompensation -- uncompensated recommendation and referral has never been held to be a violation of legal ethics. 
    We also have in this case the -- the question of the conflicts between the union members and members of the Bar. 
    Many years ago in 1937 for example when Mr. Savage signed his contract which is no longer a contract minding either him or the Brotherhood but has been avoided, has been abrogated. 
    The -- the record shows clearly that it was a letter in 1946 which was written to all legal counsel specifically stating that the Brotherhood had no financial interest in the cases that is -- there was end the fee splitting --
