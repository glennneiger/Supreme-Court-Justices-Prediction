   Argument of Constance Baker Motley
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="34.309" stopTime="521.383">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Before this Court for review upon the granting of a writ of certiorari is the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirming the convictions of petitioners for trespass. 
    That law, Section 16-386, by its terms makes it a misdemeanor to enter upon the lands of another after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry. 
    The Negro petitioners in this case are Columbia, South Carolina college students, who were arrested on March 16th, 1960 when they went into Eckerds Drug Store, a large multi-department chain store, the only department of which -- which is restricted to whites is the lunch counter. 
    The petitioner seated themselves in a booth in the lunch counter and the owner asked them to leave and the police officer asked them to leave and after a few minutes hesitation, one got up, the other was attempting to get up and he was pulled up by the police officer, and they were arrested. 
    Petitioners were tried in the Recorder's Court in the City of Columbia without a jury on March 25th, 1960. 
    They were convicted of trespass and sentenced to pay a fine of $100, $24.50 of which was suspended or 30 days in jail. 
    Their convictions were affirmed by the Richmond County Court Criminal Division and by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 
    Throughout the state court proceedings, petitioners claimed that their arrest and convictions violated rights secured to them by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses for the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. 
    Petitioners urged that their convictions amounted to state enforcement of private racial segregation to the use of the state's judicial machinery to enforce such discrimination in a public place where -- where petitioners have been invited to trade and where they had the right to be and that this action singled them out for different treatment by the state solely because of their race and color. 
    These contentions were summarily overruled by the Supreme Court of South Carolina on the ground that similar contentions have been rejected by it in a similar case, City of Greenville against Peterson, which was reversed here last term on other ground. 
    Upon this review, petitioners contend first that their rights have been violated because here, the state's criminal law enforcement and judicial machinery were employed to sanction and enforce private racial discrimination in a place open to the public. 
    Every member of the public could go into this place and every white member of the public could sit at the lunch counter. 
    Secondly, petitioners claim that their rights have been violated because the state is involved in this act of racial discrimination, because it's an act performed by the manager of Eckerds Drug Store in obedience to a community wide custom of racial segregation in public-eating places, which custom in turn is dictated in part by a state law and massively supported and encouraged by a network of corresponding state laws clearly defining that state's long pursued policy of enforcing racial segregation. 
    Not only in the public life of the state, but in private affairs as well. 
    Thirdly, petitioners claim that their rights have been violated because, contrary to the command of the Fourteenth Amendment that no state shall deny equal protection of the laws, South Carolina has denied the same by a regime of laws, which fails to furnish such protection to petitioners by subordinating petitioner's claim to equality in the public facilities of the community to a narrow and technical property claim, which is no more than an assertion of their right to deny equal treatment to Negroes in one department of a store open to any member of the white public. 
    Now, the gravamen of this case was put before the arresting officer in a single question, which appears on page 17 of the record. 
    The arresting officer was the Assistant Chief of Police and he was asked this, "Chief, isn't it a fact that the only reason you are called in from the police department to arrest these two persons was because they were Negroes who are asking for service in the food department of Eckerds store. 
    And the manager was directing them out because they were Negroes, isn't that correct?" 
    And the chief answered, "Why, certainly," I would think that would be the case. 
    Consequently, there is no question in this case that the policy of Eckerds Drug Store was to permit Negroes to trade in all of the numerous departments of the store except the lunch counter. 
    At one point, the manager of the drug store testified that he did not refuse to serve petitioners because they were Negroes, that's on page 26, but when he realized that he's previously admitted, an obvious policy would not permit him on the cross examination to evade the crucial issue as to why service was denied, he asserted all stores do the same thing. 
    It is also clear that the manager's refusal to serve therefore was influenced by community custom, which we claim amounts to unconstitutional state action because dictated in part by state law and supported by a massive state segregation policy. 
    Constitutionally relevant here, is the fact that this community-wide custom of not serving Negro and white persons together in public-eating places in South Carolina is expressly dictated in part by a state law. 
    At the turn of the century when public-eating places were largely the concern of people traveling, South Carolina made it a crime to furnish meals to white and colored persons in the same room, at the same table or at the same counter in station restaurants or station eating houses, in times limited by common carriers of such passengers. 
    And then, in Peterson versus City of Louisville, the case which was here the last term, there was a South Carolina city ordinance in Greenville, which expressly required segregation in restaurants. 
    In addition --

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right. 
    Well, I'm saying is that this is state policy and this, the custom stemmed or was generated by this state policy expressed in this statute and numerous other state statutes making the action of the owner state action because --

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="565.822" stopTime="576.587">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But there was -- there was no -- if I understand it correctly, there was no statute or ordinance, which compelled the -- this restaurant -- this store proprietor to do as he did to discriminate.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="576.587" stopTime="578.185">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right. 
    There was no ordinance or a state statute.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="578.185" stopTime="589.078">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or -- or -- and none which made it an offense for -- for people to eat together, is that right?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="589.078" stopTime="694.453">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right, that's right and then as I've said, this custom which was dictated in part by state law and that it expressed the state's policy with respect to public eating in a certain area was again massively supported and has been for almost a century by South Carolina statutes, which created the segregated society presently existing in that state because the state not only decreed segregation in the public life, and facilities owned and operated by the state but in a facilities owned and operated by private individuals as well. 
    And as we point out in our brief, during reconstruction, there is historical evidence that Negroes were able to eat in public-eating places in Columbia, South Carolina, the same city involved here and as way as 1895 and 1898, there was opposition in South Carolina to the enactment of racist legislation. 
    However, it is obvious that the pro-segregation forces prevailed and after a brief, desegregated reconstruction era, the policy of South Carolina changed and became that of segregation of the races as we've said as evidenced by these numerous laws, which requires segregation in such places, in circuses, in traveling shows, steamed ferries, carrier stations, restaurants, textile factory. 
    In other words, the state extended its policy beyond the public life into private affairs.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, may I ask Mrs. Motley, your argument in essence is that just as the store owner in Peterson would not be heard to say that he made a private choice, invited the existence of an ordinance expressly requiring segregated eating facility? 
    Here, the store owner ought not be heard to say he made a private choice against the background (Inaudible) to segregation law?

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes.

    Did you raise it in the -- I think vagueness (Voice Overlap)
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="782.113" stopTime="855.837">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    No, the vagueness was not raised as such in the South Carolina Court. 
    However, throughout the proceeding, due process was raised and when the case got to the Supreme Court and a petition where -- for rehearing was expressly pointed out that free speech was involved and one of these petitioners Bouie had been convicted of resisting arrest and one of the assignments of error or two of the assignments of error were failure of the state to prove a prima facie case and the failure of the state to prove the corpus delicti which I understand in South Carolina, means the state proved no crime and that was raised and passed on by the Supreme Court of South Carolina and they reversed Bouie's conviction for resisting arrest on the ground that there was no evidence to show that. 
    So they did pass on the sufficiency of the evidence and so, if here we're saying that there was no evidence to convict the petitioners of the crime defined by the statute.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="855.837" stopTime="860.311">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And you think that would embrace the fair warning point?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="860.311" stopTime="909.585">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes, that's right. 
    Now, also relevant here is I've just mentioned is the fact that there has been no perceptible voluntary change in the state's policy. 
    The South Carolina announced for example, just in August that it would close its state parks rather than desegregate them as required by a federal court. 
    In other words, South Carolina is still pursuing and pushing a public policy of segregation and this public policy permeates every aspect of life in South Carolina either by direct legislative file as we've pointed out or by public custom of the nature described here.

    Well, we will cite 30 statutes, state statutes provi -- prohibiting discrimination and public accommodations. 
    Now, they don't cover every single public accommodation but there, the state would not have the same heavy burden that South Carolina has of showing that the state's policy is not operating here. 
    And we say that in all these cases, a state could not be heard to say that its massive policy of segregation had no effect, whatsoever and that it never intended to enforce segregation in this kind of situation.

    And we think that the day after the state passed -- repeals all its laws and South Carolina would certainly be too soon for us to say there is no state involvement at all here because the magic of repealing those statutes has wiped out all of the influence which the state policy previously had.

    I would love to have you," but the custom is what's operating here and in Maryland, they've had a similar massive segregation policy. 
    It's only recently that they began to change that policy and we say -- in that case the burden is still on the state to show that that policy has not influenced the choice of the owner and as a matter of fact, in that case, the owner said, "It does.

    Each of us is motivated by customs of those of whom he lives. 
    These are all fairly, fairly settled. 
    Psychological considerations calling upon a discipline, which does not deal in its amplitude, is that the kind of evidence you think (Voice Overlap) --

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, I think the state would have to begin with its laws to -- to point out that these segregation laws, anything having to do with this particular facility, and then repeal by the state are not enforced by the state and the state has gone further and provided a remedy against such discrimination. 
    And all of these kinds of things I think the state would have to prove and of course, the state will then have to show that this was -- has been many years of the state had any such laws, that it couldn't possibly have had the effect which we claim.

    The state has a heavy burden right now in this case with all of these laws which required segregation and I think that it will be a long time before we get involved in that kind of situation in South Carolina where we would have difficulty in proving or the state would have difficulty in proving no state involvement and no effect to the state's policy in this kind of situation.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, what happened as a matter of fact is that the facilities in these department stores are segregated like the rest rooms and if they have a lunch counter, it was some time segregated or Negroes excluded all together, but they could buy at the merchandise counters generally without discrimination. 
    They might have had to wait until all the white customers were waited on, something like that, but the policy in these department stores and drug stores is to segregate only the eating.

   Rebuttal of David W. Robinson, II
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1675.589" stopTime="1676.794">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Robinson.
speaker="david_w_robinson_ii" startTime="1676.794" stopTime="1743.206">
    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I'm replying in behalf of the City of Columbia in both Numbers 9 and 10 and would request that you consider all of my remarks addressed to both cases except when I specify otherwise. 
    I would first like to direct the Court's attention to the problems of vagueness and the convictions on the merits in these cases. 
    It's our position that these cases are not defective for those reasons, for three reasons. 
    First that petitioners failed to properly raise and present the question of whether they were guilty of trespass at all before the state Supreme Court. 
    Secondly, that they had actual notice of the owner's policy before they enter these stores, therefore, were guilty under the statutes and thirdly, that the question of whether a construction of refusal to leave after entry, whether that such a construction would be vague was never presented at all to the state Supreme Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1743.206" stopTime="1745.124">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As – how does your third point differ from the first one?
speaker="david_w_robinson_ii" startTime="1745.124" stopTime="1825.675">
    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    My first point is that -- is that they didn't properly brief and argued whether they were guilty of anything. 
    The -- the third point is that they didn't raise a question of the constitutionality of the construction that was rendered by the state court. 
    In connection with the first point, our state Supreme Court has rules that most appellate courts have regarding the exceptions and questions presented which are designed to focus for the Court what the question involved each. 
    The questions and the exceptions in these cases simply said that the state failed to prove of a prima facie case and to produce a corpus delicti. 
    There was no spelling out what the error of the trial court was. 
    In their briefs, which we have attached as an -- as an appendix to our brief, in the Barr case, the petitioners have fully argued the question of state action, but when it came to the question of a conviction on the merits, they simply said that the argument on the question one, which was a state action argument, would simply take care of question two, which was the question whether they're guilty of anything and our Supreme Court refused to raise the question. 
    They said that under our rules, they have improperly raised it and wouldn't consider. 
    Now, in the Bouie case --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1825.675" stopTime="1848.843">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The matter -- as a matter of South Carolina law, has this statute, I' talking now about 16-386, which begins by saying every entry upon the lands of another where any horse, mule, cow, hog or any other livestock is pastured. 
    Has that been consistently construed to apply the -- the places like drug stores?
speaker="david_w_robinson_ii" startTime="1848.843" stopTime="1849.401">
    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    There are no cases --

speaker="david_w_robinson_ii" startTime="1851.571" stopTime="1861.941">
    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    There were no cases involving drug stores until the Charleston versus Mitchell decision, which was decided by this Court a few days before these cases were decided.

speaker="david_w_robinson_ii" startTime="1863.167" stopTime="1888.908">
    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    After these convictions, that's correct. 
    Now, there is language in an old 1926 decision, which indicates that a refusal to leave after notice would be a misdemeanor, but that's purely dictum. 
    That case didn't involve a drugstore. 
    It didn't involve a refusal to anything. 
    It was simply a comment by the Court in refusal to leave. 
    It was simply a court comment that it would be a misdemeanor. 
    There are no other decisions on it and of course, we --.

    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    It had been applied mostly in rural area -- in rural type cases, involving farmland. 
    Quite often, you get the question of where there's been a shooting on -- with question of retrieve as to whether the trespasser had a duty to get off the premises when requested to do so.

    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    That's correct, that's correct, that's correct. 
    In the Bouie case, coming back to our point number one, the petitioners did brief fully the question of whether or not Bouie was guilty of resisting arrest, and our Supreme Court reversed on that, but when it came to this matter of where he was guilty -- guilty of trespass again, they simply passed it over, and we submit that the question was not properly presented to our Court. 
    Now, if you conclude that it was, then it's our position that these people had actual notice before they entered these premises. 
    Our statute says in part every entry after notice from the owner prohibiting such entry shall be a misdemeanor. 
    In each of these cases, the petitioners testified they had been in these stores many times previously trading in the other departments. 
    One petitioner testified that he had bought food at the lunch counter to take out. 
    Also, these petitioners testified specifically that their purpose, their sole purpose in entering these stores was to be served food or not to buy food to take out or not to use the other departments, and the record as a whole show that their entry into these stores was a demonstration to protest the owner's policy of refusing to serve Negroes.

    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    Well, it's -- it's our position that by the owners maintaining of this policy, and by the fact that the petitioners knew of it, this notice had been brought home to them before they entered the premises.

    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    If -- if you're going to find error on the -- it's the part of the state court, we feel this should be taken in consideration in your decision as to whether to review it. 
    Now, coming to the question of vagueness, this was raised at all in the briefs, in the exceptions, in the questions, and in particular, we like to call your attention to the petitions for rehearings in our state court. 
    We have a typical procedure, whereby after the Supreme Court's decision, counsel can file a petition for rehearing. 
    These were filed in this case. 
    The rule, if I may read to you in part says, "The petition must be filed stating particular the point supposed to have been overlooked or misapprehended by the court." 
    Now these petitions were -- for rehearing, were not only filed of course after the decisions in these cases. 
    They were also filed after the decision in the Charleston against Mitchell, which I believe is pending before you now, in which our Court did so construe the statute to make it a trespass, to refuse to leave. 
    So the precise -- and counsel were the same in all cases. 
    So counsel had notice of this case and a petition -- the -- the points raised in the petitions for rehearing which are contained in the record make absolutely no reference to this question of vagueness. 
    And it's our position that this Court under your decisions is without jurisdiction to reverse for -- on a ground, which whereas was not raised at all, it would be highly improper to do so.

    I have said in -- in my first point is it one properly raised. 
    Now, I think when you say a case doesn't prove or a state doesn't prove a prima facie case that covers the world.

    That -- it was really a companion and in this case, in the Barr case, they said, "We're not going to consider it because the exceptions don't comply with our rules." 
    In the Bouie case, they did comment in one sentence, I believe in the opinion, that in discussing the resisting arrest question, they said they're obviously guilty of trespass. 
    Now, whether there was -- their theory was -- was a theory I'm proposing that they had noticed before they went in, or whether it was refusal to enter, it's impossible to tell on the right. 
    In short, it's our position that under the decisions of this Court, it would be highly improper to -- to rule that the lower court is an error on a ground, which it never had the opportunity to conserve it.

    There was -- the stores themselves would be segregated in all other departments. 
    Now, in all frankness there was at the time on these cases, most of the lunch counters in Columbia were segregated. 
    It's my view this has nothing to do with the state. 
    The state is completely apart. 
    Let me say it first before I get in to it. 
    It's my belief that custom makes our law and that under our form of government, the wishes of the people through the vote and through our system determines the state law. 
    It is not vice versa. 
    We don't have a situation where the state tells the people what to do. 
    Under our form of government, we tell the state through our vote and through our choices and it's my belief that custom makes the law and many of these statutes on the book are still there, the -- the eight statutes and most of them -- I think couple on them this Court's held unconstitutional.

    These owners have taken their money and invested their money in a store. 
    They have -- they're in this business for profit. 
    They made a judgment that they can serve both races in all departments except the lunch counter and make a profit, but they have found that they cannot make a profit in that lunch counter if they serve both races and so they have chosen to serve the white race and exclude the Negro. 
    Now, this is -- this is the private owner's decision, no matter what else is said. 
    He wants profit. 
    Both of these owners I believe testified that personally he didn't care and I don't think many of them do. 
    It's strictly a profit motive involved in these things. 
    Now, the Negro comes along and he is protesting this judgment. 
    He's not interested in the profit either, but he has a racial point to make and he comes in to the store to protest this decision.

    I do not think that the slavery law created the segregation. 
    I think the condition of the Negro when he came to this country created it. 
    I think there is some difference. 
    I believe that he's -- the fact that he was so different in background, culture, morals, sanitation and everything is what accounted for this segregation, whereby the white people did not want to share their every -- all of their everyday lives with him.

    Same thing was true in Clemson. 
    It's true that was a class action decision on the books, but there were no separate precedent for that. 
    Charleston has been ordered, desegregated with respect to the state parks. 
    Let me add two, that there's a legislative committee going about the state now, holding hearings on the state parks and the unanimous settlement at these hearings has been to keep the parks open and to open them next year.

    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    Most of the restaurants in Columbia are still segregated. 
    There are demonstrations taking place there now, which began about month so ago, up until that time, we have had none. 
    The lunch counters, most of which were the big chain stores like Eckerds is a chain store, did desegregate over year and a half ago. 
    The Taylor Street Pharmacy and the Barr case went out of business. 
    They shutdown lunch counter altogether and put up vending machines, which served coffee and so on. 
    They no longer have a lunch counter. 
    Coming back if I may to the point where these demonstrators or petitioners entered the store in protest of the management's policy. 
    They asked to be served a cup of coffee on one hand. 
    The management persisted in his policy of serving only one race. 
    That is a discriminatory act. 
    At that point, the discrimination has occurred. 
    Now, we respectfully submit that there has been absolutely no state action to that point. 
    In fact, the state is not in the picture. 
    It's simply a private individual who refuses service. 
    Now, the problem comes when these -- these people are asked to leave and really the management pulls out another right altogether when he asked these people to leave. 
    He pulls out a property right and that is the right to determine the people on his premises. 
    Now, it can be argued that the reason he asked them to leave was because they were Negroes, but I submit to you the real reason he asked them to leave was because he wasn't going to serve, which is the act of discrimination earlier. 
    In other words, it's like a -- a boy who wants to buy cigarettes and the owner refuses to sell it to him because he's too young. 
    And then the boy stands there, well the owner finally says, "Leave the premises." 
    He's not saying leave because the boy is too young for cigarettes, he's saying leave because he's not on the business with him anymore. 
    It's the same as the owner requesting any unwanted customer to leave and this is the property and at this point --

    Now when -- when the Negro refuses, he's -- he's now a trespasser as to that owner and under the law of our state, the owner has a choice of either using self help which he can do in our state or of calling the police and in these cases, the owner chose to call the police and we get a constitutional question. 
    Let me ask you now, what is the state's interest in those trespassers?

    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    No, sir I don't think so. 
    There have been prior demonstrations in the store. 
    The evidence shows that. 
    The Bouie case, which was Eckerds, took place on a Monday and Simon Bouie testified -- now there was -- the police testified that Simon Bouie, when arrested clapped his hands and commented, "I wonder how many they'll get tomorrow" and that tomorrow was a Taylor Street Pharmacy case. 
    Now, how the police found out for sure that they were coming to the Taylor Street Pharmacy, I don't know, but the police notified the manager who had had a demonstration in his store the week before and knew what it amounted to and it was simply a question of the police being there anytime knowing when they would come. 
    I don't believe that alone, it puts the -- the state into the picture. 
    It would mean simply that if you know a crime is going to be committed, you got to let it be committed and not have an officer there to prevent it.

    What he told the police is, "I want them out." 
    And they were working to a group in the sense that he and the police had agreed that after he told him to leave, if they did not leave, the police would then arrest them. 
    I think that is that fact.

speaker="david_w_robinson_ii" startTime="3550.889" stopTime="3664.833">
    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    I think that's -- they were working as a group to remove them from the premises if they refuse to leave when requested. 
    I don't think there's any question about it, but I think the decision, and as I would like to explain, the decision to -- to exclude was not that of the police. 
    The decision itself was made by the proprietor to refuse them to come in. 
    Now, he turns to the police. 
    Under our law, he could've told the police to get out and he could have used self-help to run these people off, but he chose the police. 
    Now, the police came, and I think it's interesting to see -- it's important to see what the state's interest in a trespasser is. 
    One of the state's interest is this property right and it's true that property can be regulated and it's true that public property can be more regulated. 
    What the primary interest of the state and a trespasser we submit is keeping the peace, because if the owner goes to self-help, a breach of the peace will occur, at least a breach in the layman sense is going to be bias and the state's interest in enforcing a trespass law, is to prevent the necessity for the owner having to go to self- help and to keep the peace and those interests have nothing to do with racial discrimination. 
    And we submit that when the state comes in, in these cases, the discrimination has occurred and they are simply enforcing the criminal law, which itself is color blind and applies to all in removing these people from the premises. 
    If you hold otherwise, the effect is going to be, it seems to me to say that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits -- permits one to violate the criminal law of the state without being prosecuted if at the time he's violating that law he is being racially discriminated against by another private individual, which we submit has never been the law until now.

    The only law on the books that is even in the same field is this statute talking about carriers, railway terminals, restaurants.

    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    Well, that the law itself -- in the law, I haven't -- I frankly haven't examined it, but from the title of it, I'm sure that it's limited to eating facilities and place, and determine, for carriers. 
    It had nothing to do with lunch counters in private stores I believe. 
    Now, I'd be frank with Your Honor, I have not reviewed that statute. 
    I felt it was completely irrelevant to this case. 
    If there was no way to tell from the statute where it applied, it would be probably unconstitutional and vague too, but there were no -- there were no ordinances, there were no statutes other than that one that applied.

    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    That's correct. 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's our position. 
    Let me, if I may in fact suggest another distinction that has been that -- that has been suggested for Shelley. 
    It's our position that Shelley does not control your decision in this case and that it is distinguishable on a little bit different ground than has been suggested had you done. 
    It is our view that the question of what -- what is state action and what is not is determined by -- determined by whether or not the state makes the effective decision to discriminate. 
    Now in the Shelley case, the Negro had taken title to his property. 
    He had legal title to the land in question. 
    No private individual by rightful conduct could deprive him of that title. 
    That title was vested in the state law and no one could take it away from him except the state and the state was faced with a question of taking that Negro's property away from him because he was a Negro and enforcing a covenant or not enforcing a covenant and letting the Negro keep his property and when the state decided to take the course which was racially discriminatory, it was an effective part of the decision to discriminate. 
    Now in this case, the decision to discriminate was made by the private proprietor himself. 
    The state, we submit, had no part in that decision. 
    The state, but -- neither is a state enforcing that decision because the proprietor had the right through his own self-help to remove these people, because the state's interest in keeping the peace with such that it intervened to remove these people, thus, we submit make it an effective part of the decision. 
    In other words that if the owner had had no right to self-help, then, we may have a situation where the state is becoming an effective part of the decision in moving them out, but where the owner has that right and the state's own interest is solely out of keeping the peace, we submit the state is not a party to the discriminatory decision and this we will submit --

    Now, he -- he had a limitation of his right and the limitation of this covenant.
speaker="david_w_robinson_ii" startTime="4087.980" stopTime="4139.728">
    Mr. David W. Robinson, II 
    Well, it was only valid if sustained by the state court that that covenant was only valid if the state sustained them and led its way in depriving this Negro of his property, which his neighbors couldn't come in forcibly and take his title. 
    It had to be done by the state. 
    Our situation, the proprietor can under the previous decisions of this Court refuse that service and can under state law evict this trespasser by self-help. 
    We submit the state's participation in solely that to keep the peace, to keep the party from falling into a fight. 
    Get him out of the restaurant, and the state is not a party to the discriminatory decision. 
    I think there is a difference.
