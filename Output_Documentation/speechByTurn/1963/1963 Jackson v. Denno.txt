    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Nathan Jackson, Petitioner, versus Wilfred Denno. 
    Mr. Collins, you may continue your argument.
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="10.808" stopTime="309.970">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Just before the Court recessed yesterday, I asserted that the New York procedure for determining voluntariness of a confession, which lets the jury have this question unless the defendant can meet the very heavy burden for showing that anything but a finding of involuntariness would be unreasonable, imposes a very, very heavy burden on a defendant and in New York, makes the protection against coerced confessions largely an illusion. 
    I do not assert this merely as a theoretical argument. 
    I think it is a prevalent notion in the New York Criminal Bar that all confessions will go to the jury. 
    Moreover, it seems to be no accident that a great deal of this Court's litigation on con -- coerced confessions has through the years come from the New York jurisdiction. 
    In appraising the New York procedure, it is, as I said yesterday, important to recognize that there is no legitimate relationship between constitutional protection and degree of constitutional violation that this is so. 
    And that the New York procedure applies in the face of this conclusion is apparent from the rationale of the rule that coerced confessions, once admitted, vitiate a state conviction. 
    We note today, after this Court's opinions in Rogers against Richmond, Spano against New York and Mapp against Ohio, that the basis for this rule is the fact that our system of constitutional justice will not tolerate the impermissible method used to obtain such confessions, in essence that they are used -- taints the entire proceeding and requires its complete nullification. 
    Only if the rationale of the coerced confession rule or the unreliability of such confession might there be some justification for finding a positive relationship between constitutional violation and the degree of constitutional protection. 
    On this point, I think it is useful to recall that in Stein against New York, Mr. Justice Jackson, speaking for this Court, indicated that he believed, erroneously we now know, the unreliability of the confession was the basis for the exclusionary rule. 
    Petitioner also asked this Court to take cognizance of the fact that the New York procedure compels a defendant on penalty of losing his constitutional protection against the use of an involuntary confession to take the witne -- the witness stand in a state criminal trial. 
    As a practical matter, a defendant cannot afford to let a confession go unanswered. He must take the stand to refute or explain it. 
    This is just what happened in the present case. 
    Petitioner took the stand to deny any memory of the interrogation by the Assistant District Attorney to claim that in any event, there was duress present and to deny among other allegations in the confession that he had admitted firing the first shot. 
    The question of state compulsion, testimony of -- the state -- the question of -- of incrimination under state law is squarely before this Court again this term in the case of Malloy against Hogan, which has already been briefed and is awaiting argument. 
    Should this Court find unconstitutionality there, that would indicate that there is another fatal deficiency in the New York procedure. 
    Respondent repeatedly asserts in his brief that petitioner's argument here against the New York procedure is essentially an anti-jury argument. 
    This is most certainly not so. 
    In the first place, this Court, in a long series of -- of cases, has firmly established that a confession that is involuntary as a matter of law cannot go to the jury without vitiating a conviction regardless of the sufficiency of the other evidence. 
    Respondent in -- at page 15 of his brief, himself, admits this rule. 
    Petitioner is only asking that this well-established rule be applied consistently and rationally. 
    Secondly, the procedure in which judge and not jury makes the factual determination of voluntariness is the traditional common-law procedure, the so-called "orthodox" rule. 
    Professor Wigmore, no great friend of exclusionary rules generally, nevertheless, was outraged from the viewpoint of the law of evidence by the New York procedure. 
    He simply could not understand how a jury could administer exclusionary rules. 
    Petitioner here certainly cannot be accused of making -- of advancing a position that tampers with the traditional rights of juries. 
    Petitioner hopes that it is abundantly clear, both in his brief and in this oral argument, that the rule -- that involuntary confession vitiate a state conviction is based on their abhorrence under our constitutional system of justice. 
    Unfortunately, the New York procedure does not serve the ends that a constitutional procedure must serve.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="466.072" stopTime="803.863">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    He -- when he had alighted from the taxicab in the vicinity of the Cumberland Hospital after the shooting shortly after 1 a.m., he was approached by a policeman with a drawn gun and then taken into custody and taken to the hospital. 
    With the Court's permission, I would like to turn to petitioner's second argument that is that his confession to the Assistant District Attorney was involuntary as a matter of law. 
    I think it is fair to say that the courts below took an extremely narrow and pseudo-technical view of the facts of coercion in this case. 
    There is no dispute that at the time he confessed, petitioner was desperately ill nor is there any disputes -- dispute that a confession would be involuntary when taken while a defendant were under the influence of the drugs that were actually administered to petitioner. 
    The answer of -- of the court below to all of this, and I think it is a very, very inadequate answer, is that there was no problem, and I am quoting "because the undisputed proof was that any effect of a demerol would not have commenced until at least 10 minutes after the confession had been concluded". 
    In the first place, petitioner submits that this is not what the proof showed. 
    It showed in the only medial testimony that the -- that demerol reaction is an individual matter and that any statements about its time effectiveness can speak only in terms of averages. 
    Averages is not my term, although I am very glad adopt it here. 
    Speaking in a memorandum of law in the district -- to the District Court, respondent said, and I quote, "The medical testimony was to the effect that in the average case, demerol does not begin to operate upon the patient for 15 minutes." 
    Moreover, for the purpose of safeguarding this petitioner's rights and the rights of other -- of -- of criminal defendant similarly situated, petitioner asked this Court to hold that whenever a confession follows close upon the administration of drug and memory -- the administration of will and memory depri -- depriving drugs, the confession should be regarded as presumptively involuntary. 
    And that presumption should not be subject to rebuttal merely by showing -- by general medical testimony, some time effectiveness of normal drug reaction. 
    Any other rule petitioner submits is fraught with the greatest danger and imposes an unfair burden on -- on a criminal defendant. 
    How I think is it fair to ask, can a criminal defendant mount the necessary technical attack on a drug induced confession when there is a real danger that he cannot even remember the confession because one of the properties of the drug that was administered is to create amnesia? 
    The very least that the prosecution should be required to do in such cases, and it certainly did not do it in this case, is to prove that a criminal defendant under such circumstances had the benefit of advice of counsel when he confessed. 
    And I think that bringing in the question of counsel on this point follows naturally from this Court's many opinions on coerced confessions in which it has said that a criminal defendant who, under the circumstances, did not have the necessary -- ordinarily would not have had the necessary capability of making a voluntary confession should have had some independent advisor-counsel at the time he confessed. 
    Such cases as Gallegos against Colorado, Haley against Ohio, Fikes against Alabama, Culombe against Connecticut, all considered the point of the necessity for independent advice when a defendant makes a confession under circumstances that indicate that in all probability, he did not have the requisite mental capacity alone to confess at that stage. 
    Petitioner's third argument here goes to the question of the necessity for a hearing in the District Court. 
    Denying petitioner a hearing, the courts below, both the District Court and the Court of Appeal -- Court of Appeals relied heavily on Brown against Allen. 
    This Court has since rendered its opinion in Townsend v. Sain, which found that the Brown -- Brown case was an inadequate guide for determining when a District Court hearing must be held. 
    At the very least, Townsend requires a reappraisal of the decisions below. 
    More importantly, Townsend also offers specific guidance for this case, since the actual basis for the decision here, that material facts concerning the properties of the drugs scopolamine and demerol were not developed at the state hearing is very much in point. 
    In fact, this case presents an even more compelling need for a hearing than existed in the Townsend case. 
    Here, the jury was told merely that scopolamine, and I'm quoting, "dried up secretions". 
    The jury was not giving the -- given the faintest inkling that scopolamine is notorious as a drug capable of breaking down will and memory or that it intensifies all of the effects of demerol including the amnesic effect. 
    Nor were there are any -- any facts developed in the state hearing at all concerning the time which it takes scopolamine to be effective. 
    As to demerol, as I have said previously, a reading of the attending physician's testimony in the state court, indicates that he made no categorical statements about time effectiveness. 
    A reading of the Standard Medical Authority does not bear out the normal time effectiveness periods that he referred to. 
    Moreover, the trial record is devoid of any reference to the manner in which demerol was administered. 
    If it were administered intravenously, the drug would have been effective immediately.

    However, in the full Court record, just before the jury retired, the following instruction was given by the Court, and I quote, "When the felony terminated, I leave as a question of fact for you to decide taking all the facts into consideration". 
    And now, I come to the important part, "and I have in mind as I told you, Judge Healy, I would charge in regard to the voluntariness of the confession that they are to take into consideration all the elements present, his physical condition, his mental condition and everything that occurred at the time he made the statement.

    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    I believe he stated that -- that they were given for normal preoperative -- operative purposes. 
    And I think that would be consistent with the standard practice, sir. 
    We -- the petitioner has never asserted that the drugs were administered as part of any conspiracy between doctor and -- and police to obtain this confession, only the taking the confession under the circumstances made it involuntary. 
    And I think -- I think it's fair to say that respondent would agree that if in fact the drugs had taken the effect that they are capable of having, that the confession under those circumstances would have been involuntary -- involuntary. 
    It seems to be respondent's position throughout this case has been that the time effectiveness period was controlling. 
    Petitioner's argument is that -- that a rule which decides these questions in terms of a minute or two when drug reaction as an individual matter is fraught with the greatest danger. 
    In that respect, I think the case of Griffith against Ray, which was decided in the Ninth Circuit, is of some interest. 
    There, the confession was taken under almost identical circumstances. 
    Testimony by various medical testimony resulted in a characterization by the Court of the time effectiveness period is from 5 to 15 minutes. 
    The confession was over as here at -- in 5 minutes. 
    The District Court there said that the confession was not involuntary since the drug reaction began the moment the confession ended. 
    I think that's frankly cutting it too close, much, much too close to protect the defendant's rights. 
    Fortunately in that case, the conviction was reversed on other grounds in the Court of Appeals.

    Yes, I think that's a fair statement that -- that under the standard medical authority that I'm familiar with the -- the size of the dose would make a difference. 
    But I think it's also a fair statement to say that the standard medical authority has indicated that the doses administrated in this case would have the effect that I've described. 
    In denying any need for a hearing, respondent makes what -- what seems to be today a somewhat startling argument at pages 32 and 33 of his brief. 
    His position on the question of hearing is in essence that petitioner's trial counsel decided as a matter of tactics, not to attack petitioner's confession and that petitioner thus is barred from attacking it here. 
    To attack the confession says respondent is to attack the competence of petitioner's trial counsel, and petitioner here has not shown such incompetence. 
    In the first place, it seems to me, the record indicates quite clearly that there was no such tactic. 
    Quite to the contrary, the trial counsel attempted to show in cross-examining the attending physician that a drug was administered and that it hadn't the effect on petitioner of making him incapable of rendering a voluntary confession. 
    He took an objection to the admission of the confession in -- in the Court. 
    He asked for a charge to the jury specifically concerning the effect of the so-called "sedation". 
    That charge, as I've indicated this morning, was -- was in fact given to the jury. 
    In the face of -- in the face of those facts, it seems to me, not fair to characterize petitioner's trial counsel -- counsel's tactic as one of not protesting the admission of this particular confession.

    The problem was in the trial court, not a problem of tactics. 
    The problem was that the material facts that I've indicated are present were not brought out in the state court hearing. 
    Moreover, I think respondent misconceives the significance of this Court's decisions in Townsend v. Sain and Fay v. Noia. 
    Those cases indicate quite clearly that a criminal defendant does not forfeit constitutional protections because, as a tactical matter, his counsel decides not to protest depravation of constitutional rights, something more is required. 
    The Court has indicated to raise the argument on waiver that respondent raises here. 
    There must be a showing that the criminal defendant consciously and willingly participated in the tactical decision, which resulted in the purported waiver. 
    But respondent's argument will be tenable only if he could show, probably at a District Court hearing that there was such a conscious and willing waiver of constitutional rights. 
    It seems to me that on the facts in this case such a contention would be incredible

   Argument of William I. Siegel
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1688.062" stopTime="1692.298">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- Collins. 
    Mr. Siegel.
speaker="william_i_siegel" startTime="1692.298" stopTime="1748.482">
    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    My learned and respected friend has made a statement that there is some significance in the fact that a great volume of a litigation coming from -- involving coerced confessions comes from New York to this Court. 
    Now, within the last 20 years, approximately, this Court, to the best of my recollection, has considered only four such cases. 
    The first was the Malinski case. 
    And I have a very definite recollection of that because I retried Malinski after this Court reversed the judgment on the ground of a coerced confession. 
    The next was the Leyra case.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1748.482" stopTime="1750.077">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What happened there?
speaker="william_i_siegel" startTime="1750.077" stopTime="1751.385">
    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    In the trial?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1751.385" stopTime="1752.295">
    Unknown Speaker 
    The second trial?
speaker="william_i_siegel" startTime="1752.295" stopTime="1833.961">
    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    Well, we couldn't use the confession, Your Honor. 
    And the state's principal witness on the first trial who was a very degraded character, a -- a convict, I forget his name, who was Malinski's brother-in-law, and who had implicated him outside of the confession recanted. 
    So we didn't have the confession, we didn't have this witness, and the jury naturally acquitted him. 
    The second case was the Leyra case. 
    And I have an even more pertinent and personal recollection of that because I argued the case in this Court. 
    And there too, the Court reversed the judgment because of a coerced confession. 
    And perhaps to anticipate a question, we retried Leyra, but we didn't have the confession in that case. 
    The jury convicted him anyway. 
    This made three juries which had found him guilty but our Court of Appeals reversed and dismissed the indictment. 
    The third case was the -- the Stein case to which I will refer more at length later. 
    And the fourth case was the Spano case. 
    In Stein, the Court affirmed. 
    In Spano, the Court reversed.

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="william_i_siegel" startTime="1835.456" stopTime="1994.961">
    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    In Spano? 
    I think, sir, that he pleaded guilty to a lesser crime. 
    It wasn't our case, it came from the Bronx. 
    Only the first two were ours. 
    I find (Inaudible) in the fact that in Leyra, which I argued there was a strong dissent by three members of the Court. 
    So that there is not this preponderance of litigation from New York to which my friend has referred. 
    He makes this statistical claim or I should say, perhaps, it has a statistic. 
    Our record in this Court is not very impressive. 
    And from New York, there are three reversals and one affirmance, but I don't cite these facts as a statistic. 
    I cite them because of their pertinence and relevance to the first argument which Professor Collins makes to wit that not only is the New York procedure in testing out the voluntariness of confession, unkind to defendants. 
    It is unconstitutional. 
    Now, in Malinski and in Leyra and in Spano, no point was raised about the constitutionality of the procedure. 
    But in Stein, it very definitely was raised. 
    And Mr. Justice Jackson wrote at length on the subject. 
    And Your Honors will find quotations from his opinion, which I, of course, admire very much, scattered throughout my brief. 
    And counsel has just conceded here in argument that the Court found in -- in Stein, found in New York procedure to be a proper one, unobjectionable from any point of view -- of view, and he has reduced to the necessity of asking this Court in effect to reverse on it. 
    It is, I think, noteworthy that he doesn't cite a single judicial authority for that point. 
    And that he has constrained to cite only the writings of text writers and of learned professors of the law, whose authority to speak generally, I -- I, of course, do not attack, but whose practical experience in the field is open to question.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1994.961" stopTime="1998.628">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Do you happen to know, Mr. Siegel, how many states follow the New York rule that you've told (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="william_i_siegel" startTime="1998.628" stopTime="2005.252">
    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    I have no statistics, Your Honor. 
    They -- there are more than one I would say.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2005.252" stopTime="2006.483">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    New York's not unique.
speaker="william_i_siegel" startTime="2006.483" stopTime="2233.191">
    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    No. 
    I think my friend would concede that. 
    That there's anything inherently unfair in the system, I do not believe. 
    I've tried cases. 
    I've tried cases for many years before I began to argue on the questions of law. 
    I've seen jury's concern with -- with confession cases who have acquitted defendants. 
    I can't give you a statistic on that either, but I think it is fair to sum up Professor Collin's position and the position of those legal scholars in whom we he finds his support in his conflict, that it is based on a deep pervasive and underlying fear and disbelief and distrust of the jury system. 
    Now, this Court had occasion to write in Leland against Oregon, in addition to Stein against New York, where the specific question of confession was involved. 
    This Court had occasioned to write not too long ago in 344 U.S. Juries have for centuries made the basic decision between guilt and innocence and between criminal responsibility and legal insanity upon the basis of the facts as revealed by all the evidence and the law, as explained by instructions detailing the legal distinctions, placement and weight of the burden of proof, the effect of presumptions, the meaning of intent, etcetera. 
    We think to condemn the operation of this system here would be to condemn the system generally. 
    We are not prepared to do so, and it is our answer almost in some to the contention on the first point that nothing has been shown in this case to cause this Court to change its opinion expressed in the Leland case, in the Culombe case, in Rogers against Richmond and Stein against New York that the jury system of trying out the voluntariness of a confession is both proper and workable and constitutional. 
    That it -- that the system operated to the detriment of this defendant in the final verdict and judgment. 
    So, of course, no argument at all because there was a plentitude of -- of evidence in this case of guilt outside of the confessions, and I will have to refer to that in brief in a moment or two. 
    But to summarize our position, there is no warrant either in the decisions of this Court or in the Constitution itself to compel this Court to say that a particular method of trying a question of fact is unconstitutional. 
    My friend speaks of the Stein decision as the Stein aberration. 
    Now, I think he is not -- he is not really referring to this aspect of the Stein case at all. 
    And that which caused the dissent in Stein was the intimation, although I don't find that it was a holding that if there was other and sufficient credible evidence of guilt, the fact that an involuntary confession had been admitted would not void the judgment. 
    Well, this Court has made it clear in Spano and other cases that that is not the law, and that is not the point that's involved here in this case.

    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    Yes. 
    Our procedure -- I -- I had thought the Court was familiar with it, our procedure in summary is this, the confession is offered on behalf of the people. 
    The defendant may then, through counsel, object to it and ask for a preliminary voir dire. 
    He doesn't have to. 
    This is (Inaudible) but he certainly has this important right. 
    Or you may wait and cross-examine on the subject. 
    If he wants a voir dire, he may have it in the presence of a jury or not in the presence of a jury. 
    Usually, it's done in the presence of the jury but I am very certain that if a request were made that the jury be excluded, it would be granted even though that would involve trying the issue of voluntariness twice. 
    If, after all, the evidence is in and the defendant, if he wishes, may call witnesses on the issue of voluntariness, he may even take the stand on that issue, although if he does, he subjects himself to general cross-examination. 
    When all of the evidence is in, if the Court must say that no reasonable men could differ on the issue of involuntariness, then the Court must, as a matter of law, exclude the confession. 
    If on the other hand, reasonable men, with normal mentality and normal probity, can disagree on this subject, then it must go to the jury with proper instructions as to the necessity of complete voluntariness.

    And since the question must eventually go to the jury anyway, I don't see that he is harmed by having the confession tried out preliminarily and then other proceedings.

    I just -- just to com -- just to complete your New York procedure, I am quite sure I'm correct about this, but you tell me if I'm not, that after the judge has determined that reasonable minds could differ as to the voluntariness of a -- of this confession, he then -- if the confession is then introduced and -- and subsequently or at that time, in his instructions to the jury, the judge tells them that it's up to them to decide whether or not it's voluntary.

    And the third is that the -- that's my answer. 
    He says it was involuntary, and he says in his third point that in any rate, the District Court shouldn't have decided the question without a hearing. 
    And I answer that they should. 
    Now, for this reason, it's necessary to refer a little more fully to the facts of the case than did Professor Collins. 
    This defendant, with a woman, had entered a Brooklyn hotel and perpetrated a robbery on a number of people there.

    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    And as I say if the Court denied the voir dire, the request for voir dire, this would be grounds for reversal without more, regardless of the other proof of guilt. 
    Now, as I say, Your Honors, this man entered a Brooklyn hotel with the woman. 
    He perpetrated a robbery. 
    ]He herded the victims to an upper floor room, and in effect, he said, "You stay here and don't make any noise or else." 
    But when he got down on the street, they broke the window -- a window and they shouted for help. 
    There was a policeman named Ramos in the vicinity, and Ramos ran towards the defendant. 
    Unfortunately, he didn't have his service revolver out when he met up with the defendant. 
    And a struggle ensued during the course of which the police officer was knocked to the ground. 
    And this defendant, and we had other witnesses aside from the confession that I think four taxi cab drivers has happened to be at a stand where taxi men rested from their labors. 
    He stood over the policeman, who was continuing to try to get his revolver out of his holster, and in substance, he said to him, "Don't be a hero, don't be a hero." 
    While the policeman persisted, he finally got his revolver out, he shot the defendant. 
    I think it's fairly clear, although it's confused. 
    It's fairly clearly that the policeman shot the defendant first, which, of course, raises no legal question in this case. 
    And then defendant shot the policeman a number of times. 
    And after he did, he come and get a taxi cab and asked for -- forced the man, because in the record, you will see somewhere that the taxi driver says, "Put that thing away", meaning his gun. 
    He forced him to take him to the Cumberland Street Hospital, which is a city hospital in downtown Brooklyn. 
    The taxi driver had presence of mind enough to say to the defendant, "I can't take you in all by myself. 
    I've got to go and get help." 
    And the defendant permitted him to leave the cab. 
    There was a police officer in the vicinity, came up, arrested the defendant, he was taken into the hospital. 
    The detectives of the precinct were notified and very quickly, thereafter, one of the detectives came and he got a statement which certainly implicated the defendant in the crime. 
    And this detective testified that the defendant was strong. 
    He gave no evidence of weakness. 
    And as a matter of fact, his confession is not at all tact. 
    About almost two hours later, well, I should say this, the police then notified our office. 
    We have a system whereby whenever a felony is committed in the county, in the borough of Brooklyn, we are notified, and somebody from our office goes with a stenographer and interviews witnesses and interviews the defendant, if he's been apprehended and tries to get a statement or a confession. 
    It was about two hours later that our man came with a stenographer. 
    And it is one of the coincidences which happened, which give warrant to the phrase that more -- truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, but just as this defendant was about to be taken upstairs to the operating room and just as he was given this injection of combined scopolamine and demerol, our man came, took the statement. 
    The evidence shows that the statement was 5 minutes in duration and then our man left. 
    Now, the testimony as to his physical condition, there was nothing in the record, nothing whatsoever to show that he was unable to try to give this statement, the trial of some statement about his being refused water unless he continued to give the statement. 
    We showed quite satisfactorily that he was refused water at the instance of the hospital attendants because that's proper preoperative treatment. 
    Nobody gets water when he is about to go up to the operating table.

    Well, at that time, it was. 
    In state law, we've since had a decision by our Court of Appeals in Donovan v. Menture (ph) in which by a very sharply divided court, four-to-three, Judge Fuller wrote, that where a defendant is being questioned, this case happened to be the police station, could be by us, and a lawyer retained for him by his family comes and asks to see him and is refused admission. 
    The confession thereafter gotten is inadmissible. 
    So that I think our procedure and if the police are wise, police procedure, hereafter will be, if somebody comes and asks to see the defendant and he is going to see him. 
    But Judge Fuller's opinion still doesn't go to the length of saying that willy-nilly and without a request, we have to say you are entitled to a lawyer. 
    And neither a prophet nor a prophet's son, therefore, I won't say whether in New York, we will eventually reach that point, but we haven't reached it yet.

    And that everything, every argument made in his behalf in this Court is based upon assumption.

    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    That's Stein. 
    That's the practice. 
    I guess practice in New York is practice in the federal courts so far as I know. 
    Now, the second class of cases, the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole. 
    We say that just because counsel didn't inquire into the hypothetical features does not mean that the evidence which actually is there does not support the finding that the defendant's mind was not affected. 
    The third, the fact finding procedure employed by a state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing. 
    Well, I think the answer is that our voir dire procedure does support such an opportunity. 
    The fourth, there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence. 
    Now, Your Honors, there's no new evidence offered to this Court and there was none offered to the District Court. 
    All that is being offered now is the fact that in cases quite different from the instant case, this Court has held that demerol -- that a confession induced by demerol is inadmissible. 
    And all -- in addition to that that's offered, is that there's some medical -- there are some medical treatises, some medical learning on the subject of demerol. 
    But evidence as such, evidence tending to show even in the most minute particular that this defendant was thus affected has not been offered and is not now offered in this case, in this Court. 
    It's only generalizations based on medical knowledge but the material facts were not adequately developed at the state court hearing. 
    Now, I'll skip this for a moment. 
    And six, for any reason, it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing. 
    Now, I -- I don't think that there is any question that -- that the hearing was fair insofar as it went. 
    And I don't think there's any question that whatever limitations on the hearing that were in the state court was -- were limitations self-imposed by counsel. 
    In other words, counsel didn't ask for more than the defendant got. 
    I -- I think this requires me to say word about counsel. 
    Defendant was represented by assigned counsel, Chief of whom and the gentleman who carried the fall was Mr. Leo Healy. 
    I think in my brief, I speak of him as the Nestor of the criminal bar in Brooklyn. 
    He was then almost 70 years of age. 
    He had in his earlier days been an Assistant District Attorney. 
    He'd been a magistrate and for upwards of a half a century had practiced criminal law almost exclusively. 
    He was assigned to this man. 
    Your Honors will read the record. 
    I think you will perceive that he did for his client everything that anybody could do for a client in the situation and precarious predicament in which this defendant found himself on the trial. 
    So far as I pointed out, we had eyewitnesses that the defendant stood over the policeman and said, "Don't be a hero. 
    Don't be a hero." 
    And finally shot him. 
    Now, what was Judge Healy to do in a case like this? 
    Was he to exercise his forensic ability and he had it in great degree, he had a voice that sounded like the overtones of a cathedral organ. 
    And try to get this man acquitted in the face of the overwhelming evidence, one, of premeditated murder and two, that it -- it was a homicide committed at the very moment of the completion of the robbery? 
    Well, no lawyer worthy of resolved would do that anymore than a general would send a platoon against a division. 
    All Mr. Healy had opened to him, and all he tried to do was to persuade the jury not to convict his defendant, his client, a murder in the first degree. 
    And the summation is replete with that. 
    He uses the word I don't quite understand the -- the relevance of this. 
    He says, "It would be -- it would be affectatious for me to ask you to acquit the defendant completely." 
    And his whole summation was devoted to an attempt to show that there was no premeditation and that the felony had long been completed and therefore, this was not a true felony murder. 
    Now, to say to my friend, it's too gentlemanly to say it, but I think it's implied in his argument even though he rejects the suggestion in his own presentation to say a lot to imply that Judge Healy's choice of tactics, and I use the word "advisedly", and I don't there is anything offensive about it. 
    That to say or to imply that Judge Healy's choice of trial tactics rendered the representation that bad, as to make a mockery of justice in this case, is I think to misconceive the nature of the state and federal cases on that subject and to misconceive the -- the tenor of the trial. 
    Now, let me concede that the issue was not fully explored. 
    It wasn't. 
    I take it that Judge Healy had been so minded he could have asked for a continuance. 
    And he could have brought in an expert witness or witnesses. 
    And the expert could have testified in response to a hypothetical question involving all the evidence in the case and maybe, the expert would have said, under these circumstances, the man could not have been in full possession of his mental faculties. 
    I think Judge Healy had the right to say whether from the overall point of view of the ultimate interest of his client, he wanted to confuse the issue in that fashion. 
    And he also had the right to say out of his experience and out of his ability that he didn't have a ghost of a chance to win this case on that kind of an issue. 
    Because from practical experience I think juries demonstrably always pay more attention to a witness who was present and who can testify and who did testify, the man was alright than they will to a paid expert who come in and on the basis of a hypothetical question pontificate that this was or was not so when he wasn't there. 
    And this whole issue was as simple as all that. 
    And this, by the way, is what's going to happen if this Court shouldn't reverse the court below and -- and return the matter to the District Court. 
    I can't conceive that this Court will reverse the judgment because there's nothing in the record to warrant anything of that kind. 
    The outside limit of what this Court could or -- and I don't say should, could do, it seems to me, is to return it to the District Court for a hearing on the issue of the physic -- not the properties of demerol but the -- the effect of the demerol administered here on this defendant within the 5 minutes that it took to take the statement. 
    Now, what would the District Court have? 
    It wouldn't have a single thing beyond -- before it that it didn't already know because everybody knows that drugs given to reduce pain, and that's what demerol is for, drugs given to reduce pain have, an effect on the nervous system and on the mind in general and the District Court would have no more than this. 
    We get hold of the same doctor. 
    We get hold of the same nurse. 
    We can get a hold of everybody who is in that room when our assistant took the statement. 
    And those people would testify and testify truthfully to the same effect as they testified to on the trial. 
    And then they would be paraded before the District Court, a possession of one or more experts, who would testify that in certain cases, demerol causes a man to lose control of his mental faculties. 
    They couldn't say. 
    They couldn't say positively. 
    They couldn't even approximate the certainty which our eye and ear witnesses would have that in this case, it has that effect. 
    Now, what could the District Court properly do except to find after a hearing exactly what it found before a review.

    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    I'm going to read -- on cross-examination, Dr. Suarez, who had been present, testified that demerol is a pre-anesthetic medicine. 
    Its main action is to relieve pain, to deaden pain and somewhere in here, scopolamine, apparently isn't in question, not only dries up secretions, but somewhere in here, the word it makes them drowsy or the phrase as used. 
    And then on redirect examination or on cross-examination, Judge Healy asked, "Wouldn't it take effect in a shorter time, perhaps on one person than it might on another?" 
    The doctor said, "In children, for example, the same dose might have a faster effect." 
    Then the Court said, "Judge Healy asked you, doesn't the physical condition of the patient to whom you inject have an effect on how long before it takes effect?" 
    And the witness said, "Oh, no." 
    Now, this is undisputed, nothing in the record to the contrary. 
    The -- he -- he said the same thing. 
    There wouldn't be much different as between a person in good health and a person who have been shot through the liver, is not much different. 
    And when Judge Healy persistently said that there would be some difference, wouldn't there? 
    He said, "I couldn't say. 
    I don't think there is much difference." 
    Then he goes on to say, "Well, 15 minutes is usually the time of action after you inject it." 
    He says it operates individually, the sum and substance Your Honor is that our witness, it was not contradicted except in the form of questions which, of course, wasn't evidenced. 
    Our witness in substance said that the fact that this man had lost a pint of blood that he had been shot through the liver, I thought it was the lung, had made any difference. 
    He was still in full possession of his faculties. 
    And that's exactly what this witness will say, I'm sure, if there's a hearing order. 
    And so will everybody else who was there speaking as layman not as -- as technicians or experts. 
    And the expert alone he say, "Well, there are cases", I sum it up, he say, "Well, there are cases where demerol and/or scopolamine will have this effect." 
    But I can't tell you. 
    I'd had this effect in this case of course I wasn't there. 
    And I can't tell you that it had this effect in this case even though the man had been shot and even though he lost a pint of blood because I wasn't there. 
    In other words, it's comparative value of an eye-ear witnesses' testimony as against expert testimony in response to a hypothetical question.

   Rebuttal of Daniel G. Collins
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5097.108" stopTime="5103.532">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Collins.
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5103.532" stopTime="5198.964">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Several of the points that have been raised, questions by the Court to Mr. Siegel, I think, are answered in the Stein case. 
    The opinion by Mr. Justice Jackson, on page 172 of 346 U.S., speaks of the -- discusses the question of whether the jury should be present -- must be present when the judge makes a determination of voluntariness or involuntariness as a matter of law under the New York procedure. 
    Now, I'm quoting from the bottom of that page, "The judge is not required to exclude the jury while he hears evidence as to voluntariness," citing People against Brasch, "and perhaps is not permitted to do so", not permitted to exclude the jury. 
    Now, I've read the Randazzio case and I don't think that that case would be a bar to the judge's -- frankly to the -- would be a bar to the judge's decision to exclude the jury as a matter of discretion. 
    Yet, I do think it's a matter of discretion very clearly under New York law. 
    As to the amendment of the remittitur of the New York Court of Appeals to which Mr. Siegel has referred, all that says is that the Court of Appeals held there was no violation of any constitutional right of said defendant. 
    I assumed that the Court simply means that it was applying what we have referred to here as the Stein rule, that they simply had found that there was no involuntary as a matter of law confession but have not gone into the facts except to the extent of seeing whether there's sufficient other evidence in the record to sustain a conviction.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5209.242" stopTime="5216.733">

    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    I so read the amendment of the remittitur.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5222.877" stopTime="5233.101">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Did the Court of Appeals have to hold the existing New York procedure that is the Stein rule of -- violative of the Constitution.
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5233.101" stopTime="5299.686">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    They were not, sir. 
    That question was never raised in the New York Court of Appeals to my knowledge. 
    I don't think that's a bar to consideration of that question by this Court. 
    The District Court, the Court of Appeals below both decided that question on the merits and reaffirmed -- reaffirmed Stein. 
    And moreover, I think we have a principal in law -- in our law very deeply ingrained principal in all areas of our law that a defendant need not perform a futile task and I think in the case of the New York courts, the Stein rule is so well settled with approval of the federal courts and this Court in particular that there will no point in raising that issue. 
    And on that point, I would cite to you as -- as an illustration of another court which has recently so considered a point which wasn't raised in the state courts because it would have been futile as United States ex rel. Duke -- Dukes against Sain a Seventh Circuit opinion at 297 F. 2d 799, which involved the question of whether exclusion from a jury of -- of jurors, prospective jurors of professed group was against capital punishment was constitutional. 
    The Court reached the issue on the merits. 
    The Courts decided against the defendant.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5299.686" stopTime="5307.065">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You know and if so have you told us, if you have, I've missed it. 
    How many states follow this New York procedure?
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5307.065" stopTime="5343.821">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    Yes, I haven't told you, but I think I do know. 
    About a dozen follow the -- oh, I'm sorry about a dozen follow the orthodox rule and somewhat more follow the New York procedure. 
    I think the New York procedure we would say is the majority viewed today, although in Wigmore's time, Wigmore set only a few jurisdictions of the New York procedure. 
    It seems to have become popular, but frankly, I must say that reading the cases, it's very difficult to tell what -- what procedure a jurisdiction is following particularly in terms of what the trial judge is doing. 
    Very often doesn't appear in -- in the cases Wigmore cites in many cases, sometimes, he has jurisdictions on both sides, New York and non-New York procedures. 
    As --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5343.821" stopTime="5344.349">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But -- but --
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5344.349" stopTime="5344.527">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    I'm sorry.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5344.527" stopTime="5348.479">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So far as you can gather more -- more follow New York's procedure than don't.
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5348.479" stopTime="5423.389">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    I think a few more follow the New York procedure than don't. 
    And there are a number of jurisdictions where it's impossible to say what procedure they follow. 
    I do think the federal courts follow the orthodox rule or some variant of it that is required the federal -- the trial judge to make a decision as to the question of voluntariness as a matter of fact. 
    Whether or not they leave that question to the jury should there be -- the same question to the jury, should there be a finding of voluntariness is, I think, the subject of some split in the Circuits. 
    As to the question as -- as to who shot first, on page 12 of the record, in the confession of Nathan Jackson to the Assistant District Attorney, the question was asked, "Who fired first, you or the police officer?" 
    I beat him to it was the answer. 
    I think it -- as I said earlier in my presentation, it's clear that the confession contains a statement that the defendant fired the first shot. 
    Later on in his testimony, defendant denied that he had made -- that he could have made such a statement. 
    He said he did not fire the first shot in his trial testimony.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5423.389" stopTime="5428.107">

    What relevance is that?
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5428.107" stopTime="5462.004">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    It's relevant, it seems to me. 
    I -- I didn't raise that point in my presentation, Mr. Justice Stewart, but the question was asked yesterday and I pursued it. 
    It's relevant only to the extent that the fact of shooting first was a material part and it was a material fact under the question of premeditation, this was a premeditated murder conviction. 
    I think the rule of this Court is that the sufficiency of other evidence to sustain the conviction is immaterial. 
    And so -- so I did not -- did not raise that question from it.

    I raised the question of right to counsel on page 11 of my brief. 
    As I raised it here this morning in terms of the needs for the prosecution in meeting its burden of proving voluntariness to show under circumstances such as present in this case, that counsel or some independent advisor was present. 
    I noted in a footnote on page 11 of my brief that in the record of this case, at page 46, the Court indicated that because it believed there was no right to counsel at this preliminary stage of a prisoner's detention. 
    There was no right to counsel that the Court would have excluded that with respect to Jackson or at least by indicating that the question -- that the fact of right of counsel couldn't be raised in the case of the codefendant, really told Jackson's counsel that he was futile form to raise that question himself.

speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5592.772" stopTime="5607.818">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    Well, I don't think so because this -- the question of scopolamine simply was not gone into under state court at all.

    Scopolamine is -- what produces the amnesic effect.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5732.034" stopTime="5818.228">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    And by putting his client on the stand and testifying. 
    And this client on -- in his direct testimony, in response to questions by Mr. Healy, denied -- not only said that it -- that the -- there was duress employed in the sense of being deprived of water, also said he couldn't remember the confession at all and denied a number of statements that were made in it in his direct testimony. 
    I don't find -- I -- I don't believe the fact show it such a tactic. 
    As far as the -- Mr. -- Mr. Siegel said that a number of New York cases didn't bear out my broad statement that a -- that a great part of this Court's litigation dealing with coerced confessions came from that state. 
    He cited four cases, I had add Fay against Noia which had coerced confession as the basis for the problem in this case. 
    And in addition, with now three cases that -- that arose in jurisdictions which have the same rule as the New York rule that I know. 
    Payne against (Inaudible) or the courts -- of this Court's opinion in that case indicates it has the same rule as New York. 
    Haynes against Washington, this Court's opinion indicates that the rule at least in Washington at the time the case arose was the same as New York and Haley against Ohio which affirmed as to New York rule as well. 
    So I do think that the statement that the -- this procedure is the root of a great many of our constitutional promises, an accurate one.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I ask you (Inaudible) on the properties of scopolamine. 
    It may be that Judge Healy, defense counsel, was just not aware of the significance of those properties to the issue of voluntariness.
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5830.766" stopTime="5832.604">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    I -- I think he wasn't aware of them and I -- I think --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5832.604" stopTime="5833.446">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    He was not?
speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="5833.446" stopTime="5915.700">
    Mr. Daniel G. Collins 
    He was not aware of them. 
    And I think that that, perhaps, is born out by his own reference in -- in speaking to the jury, he described the -- the drug is atropine, as we -- you -- the Court will recall was the problem in the Townsend case. 
    If he thought the drug was atropine and he might have thought so because the attending physician, in his testimony, first referred to it as atropine and then changed his characterization as scopolamine. 
    I said they are the same. 
    Judge Healy may simply have not related the scopolamine, the properties of scopolamine to the drug that he thought have been used. 
    I only suggest that because we -- we don't have a definite statement in the record of course. 
    I do think that Mr. Siegel is on the basic question here of a general finding of involuntariness of these confessions as a matter of law. 
    I do think Mr. Siegel's argument presents the question in its most dramatic terms and that is the problem when drugs are administered, approving their effect on a particular petitioner. 
    When we are talking in terms of minutes, 5 minutes or 10 minutes or 2 minutes and we are talking about drugs that deprive -- deprive dependence of their -- not only ability to resist interrogation but ability even more importantly I think to remember interrogation. 
    I think we have such a dangerous situation that we'd be -- that certainly petitioner feels this Court should adopt the rule which would strike at that practice as a general matter. 
    Thank you.
