    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    United States, Appellant, versus Ward Baking Company, et al. 
    Mr. Orrick.
speaker="orrick" startTime="14.708" stopTime="496.815">
    Mr. Orrick 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case, a civil antitrust case, is here on appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. 
    The jurisdiction of this Court is conferred by Section 2 of the Expediting Act. 
    The question presented by this case is a simple one. 
    After consent decree negotiations between the Government and appellees had reached an impasse, appellees requested the District Court to enter an injunction which was narrower than that sought by the Government. 
    The difference between these two decrees turned on factual issues without a trial of any kind on those issues or indeed, on any of the issues framed by the pleadings and without the consent of the Government, the District Court entered the injunction proposed by the appellees. 
    The question simply stated is whether the District Court erred and so doing. 
    The underlying facts are very briefly these, on March 6, 1961, two indictments were filed in the court below charging certain bakery companies with conduct which violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
    In one indictment, all five appellees here were charged with combining and conspiring to allocate among themselves the business of supplying bread and rolls to federal naval installations in Jackson, Florida and submitting non-competitive and rigged bids and price quotations. 
    In the second indictment, four of the five appellees here plus two other companies were charged with combining and conspiring to fix and maintain the prices in which they sold bakery products to nongovernment wholesale accounts which are defined as grocery stores, supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and similar large purchasers. 
    All of the defendants in both criminal cases were convicted on their pleas of nolo contendere and fines were imposed. 
    Now, the case at bar, a civil action, was brought against all five of the defendants who had been convicted of fixing prices in connection with the sales to the Government. 
    Four of whom, as I've previously stated, were also convicted of fixing prices on the nongovernment sales. 
    The complaint asked for both damages and injunctive relief pertaining to the violations on sales to the Government and in addition, a request for whatever more general injunctive relief might be deemed appropriate after a trial. 
    Answers containing general denials were filed in due course and thereafter, consent decree negotiations were initiated by appellees with Government counsel. 
    These negotiations followed the normal course. 
    The parties first negotiated a settlement of a count for damages and they have reached an agreement pursuant to which the parties paid -- agreed to pay the Government $44,000. 
    At that time, the -- the appellees offered to take an injunction limited to the specific prayers set forth in the complaint. 
    The Government, this was not satisfactory to the Government, and the Government proposed a broader injunction enjoining the defendants from price fixing with regard to sales to third parties and forbidding certain attempts to set the price on resale of the appellees' bakery products. 
    Counsel for the appellees refused to accept the Government's proposal and he then submitted a -- another proposal which was broader in scope than his first one and went beyond the scope of the prayers for relief in the complaint. 
    Further attempts to negotiate, and they were a good many, which I won't detail, were fruitless and the negotiations reached an impasse. 
    And just briefly, the Government wished two provisions to which the appellees would not agree. 
    First, that they be enjoined from price fixing with regard to sales to third parties and second, that they be enjoined from setting the price on resale of their bakery products. 
    Appellees then filed a motion in the court below for entry of their first judgment. 
    The Court issued an order to show cause why the judgment shouldn't be entered. 
    Appellees then amended the motion to have the Court enter their broader proposal and a hearing was held on this motion. 
    At the hearing, the Court was advised by counsel for both sides of the nature of the impasse. 
    And he was advised by counsel for the Government that at the trial and at the hearing on relief, the Government would bring in evidence to support its broader decree. 
    Now, the understanding of the Court and counsel for the appellees seemed to be that if the Court entered appellees' proposed decree, the Government did not have a right to go to trial. 
    But if the Court decided to enter the Government's proposed decree, then the appellees would have the right to go to trial. 
    I'd -- I would call the Court's attention to this unusual situations, which is in the Government's brief reproduced in a footnote at page 33, and I just briefly summarize it. 
    The Court says, "Let me say this now, that I'm going to enter your decree or the Government's decree." 
    One say, "I'm going to enter a decree here. 
    I'm not just going to enter an order after this 30-day expires saying we'd better go on to a trial. 
    Is that understood?" 
    Counsel for both side said, "No, sir." 
    And then the counsel for the appellees went on and he said, "We did not agree that we were foreclosed from a right to go to trial if you decided to enter the Government's decree." 
    Now, I -- I agree that the appellees were correct in asking for their day in Court and that's just what we're asking here. 
    The Court then, on December 10 of 1962, entered as a final judgment in this case. 
    The defendant second proposed judgment was modified in certain respects at the hearing. 
    And I -- the judgment on its face recites that it was entered and I quote, "Without trial or adjudication of any of the issues of factory law and before the taking of any testimony", and upon the appellees' motion. 
    And so the Government, in a suit brought by the Attorney General, to vindicate public rights, winds up with a decree which it doesn't like even though it is neither consented to the entry of that decree nor been provided with a litigants' basic right to make the record. 
    And now, as the Court please --

    Mr. Orrick 
    Well, there's a factual issue on the scope of the relief, Mr. Justice, yes, sir, because the scope of the relief very often and particularly in antitrust litigation, it must go beyond the -- the facts that are pleaded in the complaint. 
    This Court recognized this in the U.S. Gypsum case. 
    But the Government here, I want to make clear, doesn't ask the Court to order entry of its proposed judgment. 
    And indeed, the Government's complaint is that it has no record on which to base such a request. 
    That's the striking feature of this case. 
    Instead, the Government asked that the District Court's judgment be vacated and the case be remanded for trial. 
    Now the issue here is of great practical importance in the administration of the antitrust law.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Supposing the scope for the relief had not been called in question, in other words, that the broadened relief that the Government wanted had been consented to oppose. 
    And there -- then the only issue was whether or not the -- the presumption following from a decree after trial that's available in a treble damage suit was the issue, would the Government then have had a right to insist under trial to give effect to that presumptive effect of the decree after trial?
speaker="orrick" startTime="623.914" stopTime="650.265">
    Mr. Orrick 
    The -- the adjudication? 
    I -- I think Mr. Justice, the Government is entitled to an adjudication. 
    The -- we make that point in a footnote in our brief where we discussed the Brunswick case and I think we're entitled to an adjudication. 
    It often makes a -- a difference in the scope or the --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="650.265" stopTime="655.267">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    And I'm wondering whether the real issue here isn't that question rather than the scope of the relief.
speaker="orrick" startTime="655.267" stopTime="663.945">
    Mr. Orrick 
    No -- I think, if you please, sir, we think it is the scope of the relief. 
    Although it's perfectly clear here, we didn't even get an adjudication.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="663.945" stopTime="665.688">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    No, I realize that.
speaker="orrick" startTime="665.688" stopTime="745.193">
    Mr. Orrick 
    But the -- the issue is very, very important in antitrust administration because more than 80% of our cases in fiscal year 1963, civil cases were settled by this -- by consent decrees. 
    And the disposition of cases by these decrees has -- and the Court is well aware, it saves large expenditures of time, energy and money including the time and energy of the courts. 
    And the possible savings are often a factor in determining what relief by way of consent decree the Government may accept. 
    And I have no doubt that use by the courts of consent decree negotiations as a basis for entering a decree without a trial and without the consent of the Government would quickly tend to inhibit our negotiations in future cases. 
    Our position briefly summarized is this. 
    First, that when relief turns upon disputed questions of fact, those facts must be resolved in a trial record made. 
    And secondly --

    Mr. Orrick 
    Yes, sir, the sales of the -- to the public here in question. 
    We offered at the hearing. 
    We stated to the judge there several times in the course of our hearing that we were prepared to present to the Court facts on the scope of relief which would show that relief enjoining these defendants from fixing sales to the -- fixing prices on sales to the public was proper. 
    And both page 90 in the record and at 94, we've -- our counsel pointed that out to the Court.

    Would you offer to prove them in connection with the -- with the action that the Court took or did you offer to prove them only if a trial took place?

    Mr. Orrick

    Mr. Orrick 
    -- on page 90 is the best that our counsel said. 
    Third, if the case were to be tried, the Government would be afforded the opportunity, both at the trial and at the hearing on relief, to offer evidence in support of its claim for injunctive relief broader than that offered by defendants proposed judgment. 
    And also over again on page -- I said 94 --

    That doesn't say that it has facts and it doesn't -- isn't an offer to -- and -- and didn't the Government -- did the Government refuse in connection with the Court's action to submit the facts that it had prior to trial?
speaker="orrick" startTime="854.602" stopTime="863.503">
    Mr. Orrick 
    No, sir. 
    The record is barren of any request at all by the Court to the Government asking it to produce facts and --

    Mr. Orrick 
    The -- the Government -- what the Government did as I'd -- has set out here, if you please, sir, on page 90 and then 94 and 95. 
    But I want to point out, Mr. Justice, that that is not an issue in this case because Judge Bryan Simpson, in his order said -- and I call the Court's attention to his order on page 128 of the transcript, that his judgment was based upon this Court's knowledge of the facts involved in 11677-Crim-J. 
    And this record, this proposed judgment provides all the relief to which the defendants are entitled to. 
    And bear in mind if you would, sir, that this is the very same judge for whom both indictments were returned and before whom all defendants were convicted on their pleas of nolo contendere in the criminal cases.

    Mr. Orrick 
    We could have amended the pleading to conform the proof. 
    And we would surely on a hearing on relief where as I pointed out previously, this Court has recognized that you very often have to have -- the scope of relief has to be broader than the specific violations. 
    There isn't any question, we ought to have shown it, and this judge knew it. 
    That's the extraordinary thing. 
    But if this -- the procedure impinges on the discretion that the Attorney General has to determine what the acceptable scope of relief is. 
    And very often, in determining whether or not to enter a consent decree, an admission or an adjudication is an effective sanction which operates as a part of the remedy and bears upon the sufficiency of other relief.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="orrick" startTime="1418.220" stopTime="1554.212">
    Mr. Orrick 
    -- 5 (a) and at this point, let me take that up. 
    Section 5 (a) was added to it, was in the Clayton Act in 1914. 
    And it is designed to assist in the administration of the antitrust laws and the section of the statute is set out at page 2 of our brief and briefly summarized. 
    Section (a) says that a final judgment or decree rendered in any civil or criminal proceedings brought by the United States under the antitrust laws to the effect that a defendant had violated said laws, shall be prima facie evidence against such defendant in any action or proceeding brought by any other party. 
    That's clear enough. 
    Now then the proviso, which appellees, I think erroneously construe, provides that this section shall not apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony has been taken. 
    Now, appellees cite this section as -- they call it on page 16 of their brief, a sanctuary for antitrust violators, if you please. 
    And this, in the light of the legislative history, where this section was added to -- by an aroused -- at -- at the instance of an aroused President Wilson and an aroused Congress to get more effective enforcement of the antitrust laws. 
    There's nothing, I submit, in the legislative history to support any such assertion. 
    But as I pointed out, it doesn't give them the double privilege, surely, of rejecting the pretrial consent judgment which is proffered by the Government and then at the same time avoid an adjudication on the merits. 
    Now, I will tell you conscientiously that we have tried to ascertain the basic -- the reasoning behind this. 
    And I'd simply can do and perhaps Mr. Dunlap is better qualify than I do, do that. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Davisson F. Dunlap
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1554.212" stopTime="1556.819">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="davisson_f_dunlap" startTime="1556.819" stopTime="1711.907">
    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would like to make a few statements in regard to the facts before, if I may, before we get into the law. 
    I take issue with my friend, Mr. Orrick, on what -- how this got before the Court. 
    It's very clear that after there was a pretrial hearing, at which this dispute between the Government and the private parties was outlined and the affidavit was filed outlining these procedures to give the Court the factual background. 
    At that hearing, the Government tendered a proposed judgment and so did the appellees. 
    And at that hearing, the Government -- the Court issued a rule nisi which told in effect to the Government, "If you've got any proof, if you've got any legal -- any points about that I don't have power, bring them in." 
    And what did the Government do? 
    The Government absolutely did not file anything showing that they had any facts. 
    As a matter of fact, although Mr. Orrick said they didn't refuse to in effect they did. 
    And they took this position, and I call this to your attention, it was in the brief filed after the last hearing in June, in the record on page 122 in their brief filed in July of 1962, and this is a position they took. 
    The defendants here argued, if the Government had admissible evidence going beyond the facts plead, showing a legal need for broader relief then it should have set this out specifically in answer to the rule nisi. 
    But the simple answer to this argument is that the Government was under no duty to reveal all of its evidence and answer to the rule nisi. 
    It didn't reveal any evidence that it had any. 
    They've consistently taken the position that the Court didn't have power to act. 
    And as I see it, and I'll go into this a little bit later, that if you follow their position to its logical extreme, you have here the Government saying, "You don't have power to act to see if your actions are arbitrary because you don't have a record. 
    And we're not going to give you the facts to give you the record, therefore, you don't have power to act", which I think is an erosion of the District Court's judicial power to determine whether or not the action is arbitrary. 
    We didn't ask them to show all the facts. 
    All they wanted to show was facts that would show there was a triable issue on this question of relief.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You think this, what was entered here was a consent decree?
speaker="davisson_f_dunlap" startTime="1717.511" stopTime="1750.663">
    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    Justice Stewart, the Brunswick-Balke case which preceded this, which I'm sure the Court is familiar, deleted the word "consent". 
    I don't conceive of it as a consent decree. 
    I think Judge Goldberg's point is well taken. 
    That's hard to see how you have a consent without the consent of both parties. 
    But the fact is that, this is a decree that we say is entered under the equity power of the Court and also permitted under Rule 83 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
    But if you go back to the strict definition of consent decree, I would not say so.

    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    That says that the District Court can make rules if they -- as long as they're not inconsistent with the other rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
    I'll tell you Mr. Dabney in 63 Columbia Law Review in his article published last year on this very case, went into that point very thoroughly and that was a position he took at that time which I think is a sound position.

    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    Judge Goldberg, 5 (a) provides in relevant part that a final judgment or decree to the effect that the defendant of -- of -- has violated the antitrust law shall be prima facie evidence. 
    And therefore, since it contains no adjudication and it's violated the antitrust laws, therefore, we feel it falls within that -- that language. 
    That's the point I was reading from Columbia Law Review of Mr. Dabney's point. 
    So, we say that this presents a very serious question.

    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    Yes, sir, our motion and the judge also, in his order, says that I am entering this decree as if the defendants had pleaded pro confesso to the allegations of the complaint. 
    Now, out of fairness in that, Justice White, I must say, the only disputed issue I know that would remain with the pose would be the adjudication of guilt. 
    But all of the factual issues other than the adjudication of guilt for the purposes of relief, it was entered as if that there were pro confesso in determining the scope of the relief.

    Yes, I understand that.

    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    None, Your Honor.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But what -- now what -- what the Government is insisting on, as I understand it, I had a little difficulty in trying to reaching it but I think is the issue and what's behind it. 
    The Government wants a judgment that on which, private litigants can depend in case they sue for civil damages.
speaker="davisson_f_dunlap" startTime="2343.235" stopTime="2343.424">
    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And the Government -- it's arbitrary in your view for the Government to take the position that it wants a judgment, wants to go far enough to get a judgment that will adjudicate guilt. 
    And you take the position that you do not want to go far enough to adjudicate guilt and you say, you have a right to do that and it's arbitrary for the Government to insist the other way.
speaker="davisson_f_dunlap" startTime="2366.417" stopTime="2403.025">
    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    We say under the congressional purposes and the -- the adjudicated cases of Twin Ports Oil versus Pure Oil and the Commonwealth Edison case which is the last year of the Seventh Circuit, that that would thwart the intent of Congress in encouraging private litigants to come in and say, "Alright, we'll agree to our consent judgment." 
    And in effect, the -- Mr. Bicks, the Attorney General, when he proposed this, said he would only use it in a limited number of cases because he admitted that if they did this on all the cases, that it would practically wipeout their consent decree plan and -- that they used in settling these cases.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It seems to me like it had precisely the opposite effects. 
    I don't quite understand that argument. 
    What you're saying is that a litigant if it -- enjoined to the Court with the Government say, "We're not going to let you hear this case. 
    We confess everything but we won't have an adjudication against this of guilt. 
    And we thereby defeat the purpose of Congress to make judgments available for the use of private litigants."
speaker="davisson_f_dunlap" startTime="2430.670" stopTime="2435.116">
    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    Your -- your -- the point is Justice Black, there are two purposes of Congress.

    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    That's one.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but we would have a different issue here if the Court had entered an adjudication of guilt but then entered the narrow decree which you wanted. 
    We would have a completely different case here. 
    As a matter of fact, you wouldn't -- you're the -- be the one who was appealing from something like that.

    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    I -- I think the issue would be different. 
    It would be a Brunswick-Balke situation in that case. 
    But I think it's inherent in here that we see the case, Your Honor. 
    They come in with this broad, unwarranted relief provision. 
    It's way beyond the pleadings or anything else. 
    They refuse to the Court to make any showing why they needed or that they have any callable evidence to support it. 
    And then, in order to force us into that type of relief, which is completely outside the scope of the pleadings and outside of almost the scope of the public matter --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2613.933" stopTime="2638.817">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you maybe completely correct, you maybe completely correct in what you say up to the point that the Court is entitled, not only to enter the narrow relief but to avoid an adjudication. 
    I mean, there could be -- it could be that you're absolutely true that the Government was trying to get broader relief than it was entitled to. 
    But that's no excuse for saying that there shouldn't be an adjudication in the -- in the case.
speaker="davisson_f_dunlap" startTime="2638.817" stopTime="2666.814">
    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    Well, I think the -- the congressional history supports this and if you'll examine Judge Nordbye's opinion in Twin Ports Oil versus Pure Oil, he clearly sets forth the twin congressional purposes. 
    One of which is to encourage treble damage private litigants to use advantage and the other one is to encourage private litigants to come in and agree.

    The private litigants to come in and in effect, consent to the judgment under 5 (a) and therefore get the protection of 5 (a), Judge Black. 
    And this was the entire issue in Brunswick-Balke. 
    Exactly the issue raised in Brunswick-Balke, whether we have any rights under 5 (a) and we think, the congressional history supports that we have rights. 
    Now, we don't claim we have an unqualified right because it's qualified by the courts entering a decree which under its equity power, it feels -- it takes care of the situation.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2701.420" stopTime="2710.067">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, the Brunswick case involved the -- an assistance by the Government that the defendant waived the protection of 5 (a) by consent in the decree, isn't that correct?
speaker="davisson_f_dunlap" startTime="2710.067" stopTime="2777.298">
    Mr. Davisson F. Dunlap 
    No, the first two did, Justice Stewart. 
    The first two they proposed said, in effect, "You've got to admit guilt and liability in any suit brought by a state agency." 
    Then in the last one, which the judgment was based on, they only gave it prima facie. 
    They said that -- that you got to agree to give, even though it's a consent judgment, you got to agree to give, get prima facie effect in a suit brought by the other local governments. 
    And that's a good example of -- of what the Government of -- of -- if isn't completely has unfettered power in this -- in this area, what the Government will do because they -- that Judge Tehan points out that the first two decrees proposed by the Government probably would be unconstitutional, a conclusive evidence and an admission of guilt. 
    And this, if the legislative history's examine, was the very reason why they changed the proposal of 5 (a) from conclusive evidence to prima facie evidence. 
    Before -- of course, they were concerned with the constitutional issues and the doubtful constitutionality of a provision that would make it conclusive evidence against the defendant.

    So in order to give them that area, you've got to allocate that area to them, but there's an area of arbitrariness beyond which we say, the courts through it's pretrial procedures can determine the question and relieve against that arbitrariness.

    And antitrust law enforcement would come to a grinding litigated halt because it's the very importance to the defendants of being able to enter into a consent decree and avoid these treble damage suits that enables the Government to carryout a decree -- sensible program of law enforcement.

    That's right. 
    And they -- they say that a trial judge has two jobs. 
    His first job is to determine whether the parties' desire to agree as honest as they call it. 
    He sets that out on page 22 of his brief. 
    And whether the Attorney General's view as to the relief he seeks is warranted. 
    So that's the first judgment that the judge must make --
