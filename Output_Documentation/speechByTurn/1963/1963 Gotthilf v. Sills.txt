    Number 50, Morris Gotthilf, Petitioner, versus Benjamin Sills, et al. 
    Mr. Rogge.
speaker="o_john_rogge" startTime="12.314" stopTime="444.605">
    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case presents the question whether the body execution statute of the State of New York violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It is my position that it does and in support of that position, I am going to suggest an approach to the Due Process Clause which I think is in accord with its intervening and historical development which is at one and the same time less inclusive than what has been called the incorporation theory based upon the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Douglas and also the concurrence on this point of Justices Murphy and Rutledge in Adamson against California and on the other hand, is more inclusive. 
    I say less inclusive because I don't think it's historically correct to say that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866 anymore than the barons already made almost three quarters of a millennium earlier when they exacted from King John. 
    He promised not to go against them except by the law of the land that they thought about it specifically what it meant other than it meant to do right. 
    I don't think it's historically correct to say therefore that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by itself incorporated the first state amendments and made them applicable to the States. 
    On the other hand, I submit that the Due Process Clause does represent the better angel of our nature and therefore shouldn't be limited to the first state amendment. 
    For example, there is a provision in the Fourteenth Amendment for equal protection of the laws. 
    If it were not there, can there be any doubt but that today justice that's not even handed would be struck down under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    There is in the Thirteenth Amendment, for instance, the provision against involuntary servitude except for those who've been convicted of a crime after a due trial. 
    If it were not there, can it be any doubt -- can there be any doubt but that today under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? 
    There couldn't be involuntary servitude. 
    On that basis -- on that approach, I submit that the body execution statute of the State of New York violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on five different grounds. 
    It violates it because it imposes the punishment without the incidence of a criminal trial. 
    There was a default judgment in this case never anything more. 
    It violates the Due Process Clause in the second place because the body execution statute which was Section 764 of the Civil Practice Act bears no reasonable relationship to the ends, the Legislature had in mind when they enacted. 
    It violates the Due Process Clause in the third place because when this body execution statute is taken together with a couple of sections of the New York Correction Law, it denies the petitioner of equal protection of the laws. 
    A rich man won't have to go to jail for six months the way my client will if he goes back to New York. 
    He's not in New York. 
    He had to leave New York a minute that order for body execution was entered. 
    Therefore, it violates the Due Process Clause because it denied him the equal protection of the laws. 
    In the fourth place, this Section violates the Due Process Clause because it imposes upon him a cruel and an unusual punishment. 
    And in the fifth place, it violates the Due Process Clause because it imposes upon him involuntary services. 
    Now, before I get to the merits of the case, there are two nagging procedural questions that I'd like to deal with. 
    The Attorney General of the State of New York says that I did and exhaust state court remedies in New York. 
    I say that I did. 
    He says that I don't have a final judgment. 
    I say that I do but I say it doesn't make any difference. 
    You had in this case a judgment of the trial court, Mr. Justice Gellinoff who ordered that execution be issued here and against the person of Morris Gotthilf defendant herein without notice to said defendant. 
    Had my client stayed in New York? 
    He didn't. 
    The sheriff could had seized him and put him in prison for six months. 
    I say that under any normal concept and indeed, under the language of the New York Court of Appeals itself in those few instances where it took time out to give us -- give us a few lines of opinion that was the final judgment. 
    Certainly that it's the final judgment under 28 U.S.C. Section 1257. 
    Now, if it's' a final judgment, then I submit that I exhausted state court remedies by trying to go to the New York Court of Appeals and the only two ways that I could go there, if it's a final judgment, (a) by docketing an appeal of the right because I have a constitutional question, (b) by making emotion for leave to go there supported by printed affidavits and a printed brief. 
    These were denied, dismissed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that I didn't have a final judgment. 
    If I didn't' have a final judgment, then I say I didn't have a right to go there and under those circumstances, I exhausted state court remedies by going to the Appellate Division, First Department. 
    So I say to the Attorney General of the State of New York and the courts of the State of New York, they can play games with words if they wanted. 
    Whether or not it -- they call it a final judgment, makes no difference, if it's final, I exhausted state court remedies by trying to go to the Court of Appeals. 
    If by some part of New York law that final judgment isn't the final judgment, then I exhausted state court remedies by going to the Appellate Division, Second Department. 
    But beyond all this, I say that what I really come down to here is the language of 28 U.S.C. Section 1257 and then under that, it is a final judgment and here, I would rely especially on the case that the New York Attorney General cites in his brief, Republic Natural Gas Company against Oklahoma and I deal with it in the reply brief on page 14 where this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Frankfurter, said, "There had been instances where the Court has entertained an appeal of an order that otherwise might be deemed interlocutory because the controversy had proceeded to a point where a losing party would be irreparably injured if review were unavailing." 
    If this Court does not give relief, my client, the petitioner, Gotthilf, can never go back to the State of New York because there is an order for body execution under which he'd have to go to jail for six months. 
    There is no escape from that. 
    He can't make bar.

    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    In the meantime, he'd be in jail. 
    Now, there is a second procedural question here. 
    The money execution statute which was Section 764 of the Civil Practice Act was superseded on September 1, 1963 by something that New York lawyers called CPLR, Civil Practice Law and Rules. 
    And if you look at the cross-reference table in the beginning, they tell you that Section 764 has been omitted. 
    But they cross-reference you to Section 6111 and I say that's even worse because that Section provides that in the discretion of the Court, this order of arrest may be granted without notice before or after service of summons and at anytime before or after judgment. 
    Now, they call that a provisional remedy. 
    I say what's provisional about that, because the same people can seize him, lodge him in the same jail for the same length of time. 
    This time I say to the State of New York, let's not play games with words. 
    You have the same situation today that you did before September 1, 1963, so that we really get down to the question whether my client is to have relief here and now by a holding that Section 764 violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    That's one it said in this particular case contrary to what -- contrary to its own language in any case where it had ever spoken out, but this wasn't something as of right. 
    Here, I would have to go to an Appellant Division to which I had gone twice before, first to try to get the default set aside. 
    And they affirmed no opinion, not a line of opinion, not a sentence. 
    I then go back to the trial court, an argue that Section 764 is unconstitutional at least in a memorandum opinion Mr. Justice Gellinoff gives me one sentence. 
    He said Section 764 of the CPA constitutional. 
    Once again, I go back to the Appellate Division. 
    Once again, there is an affirmance and ones again not a line of opinion. 
    Now, what the Attorney General suggests is that I could have gone to that Court if it were a non-final judgment and I say that looking at New York opinions up to that point and by any rational approach, this was a final judgment. 
    You couldn't get anything more final. 
    There was nothing more that remained to be done.

    To go to a court that has -- before whom I've been twice and they haven't given me a line of opinion. 
    And if you look at the opinions of the Court of Appeals up to this point if nothing more remained to be done and nothing more remained to be done, you'll have under any rational approach of final order because if the sheriff could have seized my man, he could have gone to jail immediately and he would have lodged there for six months. 
    Now, I submit that I did everything that could reasonably be affected, to exhaust state court remedy unless one has to file appeals in every reviewing court inside and I hope that you don't miss the right way.

    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    He -- what he has done, I don't have his address with me. 
    I have it at the office. 
    But here was a man who was a leading CPA and who is now as he can, trying to practice accounting in the -- and I think he's in North Miami. 
    And he's been there since this judgment was entered. 
    Now, I'd like to go back just a moment to the controversy itself. 
    The original controversy arose out of a factoring agreement and the one who actually lend the money was the corporation, the corporate defendant of which the petitioner was Chairman of the Board. 
    And there was at one time when the plaintiff corporation was embedded to the defendant corporation in the amount of sum $22,000 and for this, they had a collateral sum $28,000 which according to the defendant $23,000 that was worth was collateral. 
    They entered into an agreement by which the individual plaintiffs in that action were to pay $13,000 and I think they did and the defendant was to make certain collections and turn them over for taxes, and I understand he didn't. 
    However, that maybe, there isn't any question but what the judgment here is the result of a default order and that arose of a misunderstanding between counsels. 
    The, then, counsel for the petitioner Archibald Palmer swears that he had an understanding with counsel for the plaintiff that the default would only be entered as to the corporate defendant and not the individual. 
    Mr. Theodore Charnas whose admission I moved this morning and for whom I have a high regard says he never had any such understanding. 
    Now, it's inconceivable to me that a lawyer for a client who has a good defense and the defense there among other things despite all the charges and counter charges. 
    The defense among other things would have been to whatever the petitioner did, he did in a corporate capacity as Chairman of the Board, indeed the complaint itself have allegations saying that the defendant by Gotthilf, the petitioner here did certain things. 
    I mean it's conceivable to me that a lawyer would have consented to a default order not only to the corporation but also to the individual defendant. 
    However, that maybe, I don't know what the facts are. 
    They're disputed one side on the other. 
    Suffice it to say that the default order was entered as to both the corporate and the individual defendant. 
    And thereafter on an appeal to the Appellate Division to try and get that, default order set aside. 
    The Appellate Division affirmed without opinion.

    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    In that appeal to the Appellate Division, I argue that the default should be set aside. 
    I did not -- at that point, we still weren't faced with the motion for body execution. 
    Now, when I raised the point about Section 764, there wouldn't have been any point at that point. 
    I mean 764 is for body execution, not I think the body. 
    It was not raised there. 
    We now get back to the trial court. 
    And now, I do make a full scale argument and incidentally under the statute, they could have picked up the petitioner without notice except that, as I recall it, I had an understanding with Mr. Charnas that he would do it on motion so that I could make my constitutional argument, and he did make it on motion. 
    And at that point, I did have a full scale argument before on Mr. Justice Gellinoff that Section 764 violated the Due Process Clause. 
    And as I say, he gave me one line in his memorandum on that. 
    And I argued that same question in just as extensive of brief before the Appellate Division, First Department and they didn't give me a line.

    I, of course, go much beyond that or the five reasons that I've advanced here. 
    I think the only way to handle this situation and to declare of Section 764 violative of the Due Process Clause with the Fourteenth Amendment on one or more of the five grounds that I have mentioned.

    New York is one of that limited category cases which still has this out motive thing that you can either say to it better, the judge can. 
    Your Honor please, it's not handing to them on a silver platter, handing it to them a golden platter and that's what the plaintiff and plaintiff's lawyer wanted in this case. 
    They wanted the judge, there are ways you can go, I mean the rest of it where we try to collect that that there are supplementary proceedings, there are attachment, there are garnishments, there are these various ways in which we can find out whether the debtor has money or property or anything else and seize it." 
    But no, not here, the creditor wanted the whole amount handed on, on a golden platter and Mr. Justice Gellinoff accommodated him in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Theodore Charnas

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Charnas.
speaker="theodore_charnas" startTime="1503.028" stopTime="1654.874">
    Mr. Theodore Charnas 
    Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen, may it please the Court. 
    I have a very -- the remarked made by my adversary to the effect that the Court of Appeals was playing games. 
    That the creditor was playing games. 
    I say to you that if there were any games played here, they were played deliberately and willfully by this judgment debtor who is a common swindler, now residing in Miami sounding himself in Florida, safe from body arrest and who have the temerity in an action which we instituted on this judgment in Florida to assert as an affirmative defense that there was pending an appeal before this Court. 
    This appeal number 50 which he says in his answer is an appeal from the judgment, and there was nothing before you insofar as the petitioner is concerned seeking a review of the judgment. 
    The whole point of my adversary's remark has been that the Section 764 is unconstitutional. 
    The order for arrest should be vacated. 
    This is the kind of a swindler that we're dealing with. 
    This man got here. 
    If anybody is the suppliant before this Court, it is this poor creditor, Gotthilf swindler the creditor as I will show you by telling you the facts. 
    And it is the creditor who had to retain counsel through all these appeals, print records without any possibility of getting the cost back, while this better is down in trial that are defending the action on the judgment. 
    Now, it's very -- all very well to dismiss very hourly the threshold question of jurisdiction. 
    But I don't believe that my opponent can get by it. 
    In the first place, this is not a final order. 
    This is an order which is an organic part of the judgment. 
    It has to deal with the collection of the judgment. 
    This Court in prior decisions has talked about the unitary aspect of the judgment and the proceedings taken to effect collection of the judgment.

    I believe -- I believe I have such a case which is not quoted in my brief but which is referred to in another case heard by this Court and which again was not cited in my brief because all this was really taken up by the Attorney General who filed his brief amicus on the subject of -- of jurisdiction. 
    And I wonder if I might refer to the Court to the case of Fox against Capital Company, 299 U.S. 106, an opinion by Justice Cardozo where the question of finality of an ordered came up, in -- in proceeding supplemental to execution. 
    A debtor was arise it, and proceedings supplemental to execution because he failed to make an honest disclosure. 
    And Judge Cardozo said, "The rule is settled in this Court but except the connection with an appeal from a final judgment or decree, a party to a suit may not review or appeal from an order finding over imprisoning him for the commission of the civil content." 
    In other words, that's as far as it went. 
    Now, I'm not directly answering your questions and I realized that, but there isn't stainer case mentioned cited in these Fox against Capital case to which I like -- would like to refer to the Court.

speaker="theodore_charnas" startTime="1820.500" stopTime="2492.229">
    Mr. Theodore Charnas 
    (Inaudible) a moment and find it. 
    May I submit it in writing after the argument Mr. Chief Justice? 
    Now, I say it is clearly not a final order. 
    My opponent raises his hands and says, "What was the -- what was there left for the debtor?" 
    This is the ultimate thing, the threat of imprisonment. 
    There was no threat of imprisonment here if he told the truth. 
    Justice Gellinoff said, "Make bare your status. 
    If you make bare your status, tell us what you've got. 
    There will be no arrest provided you make a reasonable offer." 
    This, the debtor refused to do. 
    Now, the second point on the question of jurisdiction has to do with what was discussed a moment ago in connection with exhausting state remedies. 
    Now, what did my opponent do? 
    He didn't like the Appellate Division of the First Department of the State of New York. 
    They had -- they treated him summarily and while Justice Gellinoff had given him one line, they didn't give him any lines. 
    They had -- they denied his motion to vacate -- his appeal from the order of the lower court, denying his application to vacate the default. 
    So he bypassed them. 
    He bypassed them because he didn't like them and he -- he hedged -- he hedged in the Court of Appeals. 
    He filed one notice of appeal as of the right in the New York Court of Appeals asserting a constitutional issue and at the same time, moved for a leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals on the ground that substantial justice here called for an appeal. 
    Now, he had the right. 
    He had the alternative remedy at that time. 
    He had the opportunity to go into the Appellate Division and ask for certification of a constitutional question. 
    And here again I say that the general practice in the State of New York is that, when an application is made to an Appellate Division for leave to appeal on a certified question, it is the general practice for the Appellate Division if it believes that the question has any substance to certify the question. 
    And finally I would say, since that -- insofar as jurisdiction is concerned, that since this Court has a rule that only final orders are to be considered by this Court, nothing, no reason, no valid reason is given for departure, nothing at all, and very solemn indeed if ever has this Court given -- taken jurisdiction where a -- where a petitioner has failed to exhaust the remedies available to him in the lower court. 
    Now, this means this avenue, this ability to go to the Appellate Division and a certified question was opened to him, he rejected it. 
    Now, what really were the facts here? 
    For this -- this poor debtor that my opponent has been talking about, Sills of Cambridge is a small tailoring company. 
    They were factored by Charge-IT Systems Inc. 
    Mr. Gotthilf was Chairman of the Board and run Charge-IT Systems Inc. 
    Sills of Chamber to the Corporation deposited some $28,000 worth of accounts receivable with Charged-IT Systems and they paid well for the advances given by Charge-IT Systems against this collateral. 
    There came a time when there was a dispute. 
    Cambridge -- Sills of Cambridge Inc. said, "You're overcharging us" and there was a big fight and Charge-IT Systems raised the question about the value of the collateral and they agreed to settle it on this basis. 
    The two Sills brothers personally who have not previously been personally obligated agreed to pay $13,000 to Charge-IT Systems. 
    Charge-IT Systems agreed to continue to collect the collateral and because Sills of Cambridge was indebted to the Internal Revenue Service, Gotthilf, that's Charge-IT Systems, agreed to remit from the receipts from the collateral periodically to the Internal Revenue Service so that Sills of Cambridge could be credited with this payment. 
    Gotthilf drew the agreement. 
    It was executed. 
    It's a -- it was next of the complaint in this case. 
    The Sills brothers paid promptly and over a period of 10 months, they've paid the full $13,000. 
    And each month, they received their copy of a letter signed by Gotthilf reporting that the copy of a letter sent to the Internal Revenue Service which in substance ran something like this, "Dear Mr. Sprinson," Mr. Sprinson being the man in-charge of the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to our letter of so and so." 
    You will find enclosed here with our check, so and so for $400 ode covering the payments we received in September from the customer showing on the X list." 
    We got a thin copy of such a letter. 
    And in our naïve pay, we assumed that the check had gone out, that the original had gone to the Internal Revenue Service, and so the Sills brothers paid the money periodically. 
    And then lo and behold, it was discovered that no such payments were ever made for the Internal Revenue Service, nothing at all. 
    So Gotthilf got his $13,000, kept the money he collected from the collateral, is now residing himself in Florida and my opponent says, "Look what we are doing to this poor exhausted individual, this indigent man whom we are playing alive apparently in the Supreme Court of the United States." 
    But we started an action and that we alleged this in the action and we got a verified answer and Gotthilf, we sued Gotthilf. 
    We sued Gotthilf because there was separate torts committed by Gotthilf and committed by the Corporation that he was chair -- of which he was the Chairman of the Board. 
    And Gotthilf didn't deny our allegations that the checks and letters were never sent to the Internal Revenue Service, not at all. 
    He said that Sills of Cambridge had deceived him into entering into the agreement. 
    Therefore, he had kept the proceeds of the -- of the collateral. 
    He never disavowed the contract. 
    He continued very politely to pocket the $13,000, but this he asserted as an affirmative defense. 
    A motion was made to examine him before trial. 
    He default it. 
    We telephoned Mr. Palmer's office, he's then attorney that day. 
    Mr. Palmer said he had abandoned the case. 
    Now, the argument was raised subsequently by Mr. Palmer that an agreement has been made between Mr. Palmer and myself, that I would abandon the action as against Mr. Gotthilf personally. 
    I sworn then, I sworn the Appellate Division and I take oath before you gentlemen. 
    There was never such an agreement. 
    It would have been preposterous. 
    Why should I have tried to collect from a corporation which by that time I knew was the fund, Charge-IT Systems be fund? 
    Why should I chase Charge-IT Systems and not Gotthilf? 
    It would have been clearly idiotic. 
    But lower court believed me, the Appellate Division and I asked you. 
    In any event, we move to examine before trial, he defaulted. 
    We then move to strike his answer, all noticed, he defaulted. 
    We have served it with the order. 
    We then move for an inquest. 
    And an inquest is the taking of testimony before a judge with the presentation of proof of damage. 
    We did that. 
    We brought in -- we brought in the president of our cooperation of sales. 
    We brought in Mr. Sprinson of the Internal Revenue Service who testified that they've never gotten the money. 
    Now, strangely enough, Mr. Palmer was given -- who had been given notice of the inquest by me appeared at the inquest and the judge presiding turned to him and said, "We invite you to participate. 
    We invite you to take part in these proceedings." 
    He declined. 
    He turned and walked away and willfully defaulted. 
    Now, it may be argued that what else could he do? 
    Well, he could do this if there were no damages. 
    He was in a position to cross-examine and to present even such proof as he care to present. 
    But he walked away from the inquest. 
    So of course the judgment was entered, predicated upon fraud and when the appeal was taken on due notice, the Appellate Division of the First Department affirmed, so that the judgment stood. 
    Now, the question arose. 
    How do you get this judgment to like it? 
    We, then, found Section 764 of the Civil Practice Act which states to the Court may, in its discretion, incarcerate a debtor in certain types of actions. 
    One of those actions is an action for fraud. 
    This was clearly an action for fraud. 
    Now, we didn't go out and arrest this man and take him off the street. 
    We served him with notice and we went before a Supreme Court judge. 
    One would think that a debtor in this position would say to a court that, "This is what I have. 
    This is what I earn. 
    This is what I expect to pay. 
    This is how I expect to do the proper thing, the right thing. 
    This is how I want to win the approval of the Court." 
    All he did in his affidavit was say that it was a default judgment that it have entered against him, that it was improper, something to the effect that this was a great country and he didn't believe that this should be done to him.

    He would be available for examination something about the proceedings. 
    He would do the proper thing if the Court only was kind to him, but he's flat.

    Mr. Theodore Charnas 
    A notice was given to him in the order in which the Court handed down. 
    Let me explain. 
    When this man, Gotthilf, submitted this people affidavit in our position to the motion to -- for a body execution, the judge didn't say, "Send him to jail." 
    The judge handed down a decision, an opinion which is in the record at page -- page 44 or 45 -- 45 and the judge said, "The defendant will be granted an opportunity of a --" forgive me. 
    Let me go back a sentence. 
    All that he appeals to the discretion of the Court --

    The second line, although he appeals to the discretion of the Court, the defendant has neglected to bear completely his present financial status and future prospects and to present any plan for payment of the judgment. 
    Now, the Court said, "The defendant will be granted an opportunity to do so, by serving and filing an additional affidavit." 
    This certainly was no summary act on the part of --

    I say it does not and the -- I guess this is a crucial question in this appeal. 
    I say it does not, first, because the term imprisonment for debt would seem to exclude any alternatives except the payment of the debt or imprisonment. 
    In other words, either you pay or you go to jail. 
    This is not our practice. 
    All you have to do to avoid jail is to make an honest disclosure that you have no assets.

    Mr. Theodore Charnas 
    You are entirely correct and in preparing this argument, I may say very frankly that the question presented itself to me, how does this kind of procedure line up with the procedure for contempt? 
    I tried to see how I could present it to you in some credible fashion. 
    Now, take a man who owes money and as a judgment against him and he's examined in proceedings supplementary to execution. 
    The man is -- an inquiry has had and assumed that the man refuses to make a disclosure. 
    The attorney for the creditor takes him before the Court. 
    The Court says, "Tell a story. 
    The fellow is not candid." 
    The Court says, "I will send you to jail." 
    Now mind you, this is in the case of a judgment arising from an action ex-contract to whether there isn't the slightest question of any wrong doing inso -- or any malice which is founded in the judgment per se. 
    And yet, in this contempt, no one would question the authority. 
    At least, I haven't heard anybody lately question the authority of the Court to send this disobedience, this obstructive debtor.

    There is a -- that question points up this problem.

    -- if -- if the Court -- at the Court's discretion and the issue arises around when is the -- as when is the discretion exercised. 
    Now, up until 1936 or 1940, the words subject to the Court's discretion were not found in the law. 
    Early -- early in the century, courts interpreted this language that you may put a debtor in jail under these circumstances to mean that there was no discretion. 
    This was automatic. 
    In 1905, for example, there is such a case cited by my opponent in 1905 with any cites of -- with great (Inaudible) over the situation. 
    But the fact is that in 1940 that -- even before 1940, the case law that developed indicated that where the Court found that the debtor was being honest with the Court, the Court would exercise its discretion in not sending him to jail. 
    And in 1940, the words subject to the discretion of the Court were incorporated within the statute and they have been consistently so interpreted by the cases.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How would that -- suppose -- suppose it'd be true that the law is now, if the judge is restricted by five or what restriction is, by putting a man in jail for debt to his discretion, how would that enable you to escape the constitutional question you have presented, wholly it is limited to discretion? 
    Is that what you're saying your statute is that it authorizes the judge to use, say, a body execution, which I understand is put him to jail because of the judgment? 
    Is the fact that the judge cannot only does that in his discretion, does that save the statute from challenge?

   Rebuttal of O. John Rogge
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3556.069" stopTime="3556.256">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Rogge.
speaker="o_john_rogge" startTime="3556.256" stopTime="3774.332">
    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    May it please the Court. 
    I want to challenge the statements that there is any case either in the Court of Appeals or any place else in the State of New York which says that if you make a full disclosure, you don't have to go to jail. 
    There isn't any such case or I've overlooked it. 
    Now, when counsel says, "Full disclosure wasn't made them in this affidavit," he's also attacking me because I sat down with the client and helped him prepare those affidavits. 
    And Your Honors will find the first one at pages -- of the record, pages 10 to 15. 
    And I end up by saying there and I thought this was a good affidavit. 
    He has to point out he is a certified public accountant. 
    And he says, "I am present and available for any supplementary proceedings which the attorneys for the plaintiff may wish to conduct and I will continue to be present." 
    He offers to pull his bond to be present. 
    The judge said that it isn't good enough. 
    I prepared a supplementary affidavit and this is one at pages 21 and 22, and I think I know how to ask questions. 
    I asked him, "What's he got, does he have office furniture? 
    Does he have an automobile? 
    Does his wife have a fur coat?" 
    Incidentally, the judge asked all those questions in chambers too. 
    He didn't have anything except his income. 
    So I prepared a supplemental affidavit in which I -- in which I say to the judge in his file, "I have no assets and the only income that I received is from my business." 
    He puts in there what his income is for the last four years. 
    This was a disastrous venture form. 
    He lost everything he had and his wife had. 
    I then go in and I argued with him. 
    I said, "Let's offer a 25% of net income." 
    He then wanted -- before or after taxes. 
    I said, "Don't push with that, offer a straight 25% from now on of what you make." 
    But I said, "Let's put in a final paragraph." 
    And he did. 
    I said, "My heart pumps me to add two further flaws," and they both stand from the fear that I have not appealed. 
    He's only speaking, if you please, that I have not appealed through Your Honors' discretion despite the fact that I have offered to do a little more than I think I can. 
    The first thought is that he at my offer of 25% of my net income is not high enough in the Court's opinion that I will try to comply with what the Court suggests. 
    It ought to be. 
    And the Court wouldn't make a suggestion except yes. 
    The judge didn't say this to me. 
    He said, "From my experience, I know this kind of people. 
    They'll pay if I enter the order." 
    That was the judge. 
    He goes on here to say in this affidavit, the second thought is this, "If the Court does grant the motion for body execution, my life is through. 
    I'll have to leave the State or go to jail," and he does leave the State. 
    I challenged all the statements that he didn't bare his status because I was there with him in questioning. 
    And the judge put the same questions. 
    The judge asked about fur coat, about jewels. 
    The judge went further to ask some questions. 
    I didn't -- what about his sons? 
    Don't they have money? 
    Are there any relatives or families that have money and still in spite of all of these, the judge enters this body execution order under which he can either pay or go to jail for six months. 
    There isn't any alternative, at least there wasn't in the way in which this judge applied 764 and that's the question that is before this Court. 
    It was either you pay half now, you flip security for the balance or you go to jail for six months. 
    And that's what I'm challenging.
