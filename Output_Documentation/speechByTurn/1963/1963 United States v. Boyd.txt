    Yes sir. 
    The tax that we are talking about here enables us to proceed to the consumer to collect the tax in those instances where can't collect it from the vendor. 
    Now those instances are numerous. 
    They're not just what cases like we talked about here where the Government immunity might be ascertained. 
    They cover also the cases where you have an insolvent or a bankrupt seller. 
    And for that reason, you are unable to get the tax from him. 
    If we had only the conventional use tax, we couldn't reach it under that either because that covers only what's brought in from outside the state.

    No sir. 
    I don't think so. 
    I wouldn't go that far at all. 
    But to dispel any notion that this tax was involved for the purpose of reaching one particular class of user, I would mention these things. 
    Now, as far as the Government is concern, our pressing problem we've had with our sales in use tax statute from the very start is our political subdivisions, our cities and counties. 
    They decided after the tax have been in effect for a while that it could be avoided by the simple stratagem of having the city or the county go buy the building materials and then put it in the hands of the contractor and thereby insolate the whole thing from tax. 
    Oh, I -- because I think I mentioned yesterday I have cases in court right now where that is being resisted. 
    But on the authority of our Supreme Court's decision in these causes, I don't think they can get anywhere.

    The statute was prepared in -- in my office, and we drew it ourselves.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    When was it enacted, (Inaudible)
speaker="milton_p_rice" startTime="254.644" stopTime="367.109">
    Mr. Milton P. Rice 
    1955, after our sales tax have been in effect for some eight years. 
    And it was the product of experience that we had acquired and revenue that we had lost simply through inability for one reason or another to get to the seller. 
    Now, proceeding to the matter of the relationship between these contractors and the Atomic Energy Commission, it seems to me to be implicit in the decisions of this Court that a tax imposed upon a private person will not be struck down by this Court in the absence of circumstances that we referred to yesterday. 
    The only way that I can see under the decisions of this Court that this tax can fall is for this Court to find as a matter of fact that they exist between these contractors and the AEC, an agency relationship such as to make these contractors as I think they insist, and was insisted in the South Carolina case, the alter ego of the Commission so as to make them one and inseparable with the Commission. 
    Now, it is our position that the facts in this record simply do not bear out such a relationship. 
    In the first place, I think it must be emphasized perhaps the relationship of principle and agent between the Governor -- the Government and a private person is a most unusual thing. 
    The Federal Government in this country has let tens of thousands of contracts over the years of its history.

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="milton_p_rice" startTime="422.721" stopTime="594.861">
    Mr. Milton P. Rice 
    There are always controlled reserved, if Your Honor please, there were extensive controls in Alabama versus King &amp; Boozer. 
    The Government had the very right anyway to control virtually everything that took place down there. 
    I'd say down to the driving of a nail even if they saw fit to exercise it. 
    The point is that isn't convenient for the Government to exercise its supervision and they don't expect they're intended to. 
    But the right is there always. 
    For a Government, money is involved it's historically true, I think the Government reserves as much control as is necessary to prevent a wastage of Government money and -- and resources and wastage of time. 
    All of those factors are present when the Government contracts that are not necessarily present when private parties do. 
    And let's look to these contracts themselves. 
    Now this to me is something I had great trouble with all along. 
    We have the insistence made here that there is an agency relationship. 
    It's been made I might add ever since 1947. 
    That when we first commenced to assert any right, the taxes with respect to this contractors as soon as our Sales Tax Act was enacted in 1947. 
    The claim was instantly made that these contractors are agents of the United States Government and for that reason immune. 
    So, the thought was foremost in the mind of the AEC and -- and those representing it. 
    But over the course of the existence of this contract, it has been rewritten some 37 times at the outset of this litigation, 37 times. 
    The last rewrite is stated on the record testimony of their own witnesses was to reflect more accurately the operating relationship between AEC and its contractors, the 37th rewrite then was for that purpose alone according to their testimony. 
    Yet nowhere, nowhere in this voluminous documents, of these documents because we've got two contractors here, is there any phraseology whatsoever that would import agency. 
    Now, I realized and I wouldn't insist for a moment that labels are controlling. 
    But it seems to me that whether that questions has been at issue for as long as it has here and they wanted to spell out that relationship and make it clear if in fact it was a relationship of agents that they would have said so in terms that anybody could've understood. 
    That is a point I simply can't get away from. 
    All they had to do is to write that contract and agency terms but they didn't. 
    These parties are referred to throughout these documents as contractor not agent.

    Now, that was -- they recognized the limited agency as could exist anytime even between a contractor and a private party. 
    We don't dispute that at all. 
    But the agency for one purpose doesn't mean agency for all purposes.

    They're expected to exercise their skill and their care and their judgement, in those areas where they weren't given specific directions by AEC. 
    The record shows that there is a manual put out for the general guidance of the people at Oak Ridge that there was top level consultation between officials of Carbide and officials of AEC.

    Carbide carries the Social Security and Workmen's Compensation and that sort of thing. 
    These people are the -- there is no privity between these Carbide employees and the Government. 
    Nobody ever goes to a Carbide employee on the job and say, “You do this or you do that.” 
    Those orders are always transmitted through channels.

    But, even a conventional use tax, the taxable incident is use. 
    It's imposed as a compliment to a tax on procurement or sale or purchase. 
    But it's only to enable the State to get the tax on that which is used within the State which was not taxed because it was involved in the State. 
    Now, this tax we've got enables us to get the property even what -- that was acquired in the State. 
    But we make the taxable incident its use, without regard to the circumstances of procurement.

    So, I think we come to this. 
    We have to find here that for the general performance of this contract and in all respects, these persons are indeed agencies of the Federal Government. 
    If we'd also find, if we find as the Tennessee Supreme Court did that they are private parties, that they are private contractors operating for a profit just like any other, well then, the tax is applicable and is not -- is not boarded by the application of the doctrine of constitutional immunity because we're simply not taxing the Government. 
    We're taxing a private party who incidentally happens to be dealing with the Government. 
    It would make no difference at all if we were dealing with the City of Nashville or Shelby County or with any of the other instrumentalities in the State of Tennessee or the State itself.

   Argument of Archibald Cox
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1851.105" stopTime="1851.914">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1851.914" stopTime="2243.937">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First, may I simply say that there is no claim that Carbide or Ferguson is free of any other taxes on companies doing business in Tennessee, both are clearly doing business there under these activities with the Government regardless of their other -- they would be taxable. 
    Now this is a case where I think, it's very important to be precise in our use of words in all with it but there are too many slippery words here and I want to try and preserve the same meaning in hitting the high spots of the Government's argument. 
    First, we do not think that our case turns on the amount of control, the degree of control that the Government has over Carbide through Ferguson's activities. 
    To say the same thing in other words, we think it is irrelevant whether Carbide is a servant or an independent contractor. 
    Our first contention is that the beneficial use of this property in the sense that it was that time was used in the City of Detroit and other Michigan cases is wholly that of the United States sort. 
    To put it as Mr. Justice Harlan suggested yesterday that all these activities in which the property is used are the activities of the United States. 
    It's perfectly clear that everything that is done here is done with the property of the United States, at the risk of the United States and on behalf of the United State. 
    And I would say that it was perfectly clear that Carbide is the agent, not the servant, but the agent of the United States because everything it does, it does for the account of the United States in all liabilities of those of the United States, nor profits of those of the United States. 
    It's just as if I inherited say a retail store and I hired a man or to go down and say, "Now, you run that store. 
    Do everything in my name. 
    I will supply all the property. 
    I will supply all the operating expenses. 
    I'm not going to butt in with your running in. 
    I don't know anything about the retail business. 
    But that would be comparable to this and it would all be done for my account and use and benefit. 
    So that seems to us that this case is clearly distinguishable from City of Detroit and the other cases which emphasized that the -- a man couldn't get an exemption in carrying on his business for his entrepreneurial profit, not for a fee but for his entrepreneurial profit merely because the United States had the technical title to the property. 
    And I think that if these Tennessee cases that were mentioned here were examined, of course I'm speculating. 
    One would find that those contractors like the contractor in King &amp; Boozer, have brought their equipment to the job as if they were in a sense entrepreneurs that they could profit or could lose and that they didn't simply received a salary for performing services. 
    Then I come to the question which hasn't been decided except as it was decided in Livingston which we think clearly governs this case. 
    May Tennessee levitate tax as Mr. Justice Brennan put it earlier, on the privilege of rendering services measured by the volume of the property that you handle? 
    In that sense, use handled in rendering the services. 
    Because I say use for beneficial use, this just handling, that's all these people do in this property. 
    And we say that this isn't that kind of tax, that this is a tax on the beneficial use, on the activities and the fellow who gains from it and that that is a tax on the United States. 
    Now, an effort was made to compare this case yesterday to SO -- Standard Oil Company case which you will recall was a tax on the privilege of storing gasoline. 
    But that wasn't privilege tax. 
    That was measured by the volume of the gasoline's store and it didn't matter whose gasoline was stored. 
    It was the gasoline of anybody including the Government that quite properly it was held to be taxable. 
    To make that case comparable to this one, one would have to suppose that a tax were levied on a privilege of storing gasoline of where we can't reach the buyer or the seller to collect the sales tax. 
    And only, where one couldn't reach the buyer or seller to collect the sales tax. 
    Well in that event, it really isn't on the privilege of the storing. 
    It's an effort to substitute for the sales tax which is tax exempt or for the genuine use tax, which is tax exempt or if I can put this one other illustration. 
    This seems to me to be comparable to saying that we're going to lay attack on the privilege of occupying property as the man, “As I occupy my office if the court occupies its chamber.” 
    We're going to lay the tax and the privilege of occupying property but we will give credit. 
    We won't collect it at any case where somebody has paid a real estate tax on the ownership for the use of the property. 
    Well again, that's simply comes down to an attempt to collect the real property tax from the fellow who happens to be there knowing that he will have to pass it under the tax exempt owner. 
    It's a tax on the property. 
    Well now here, it's a tax on the use we submit by the United States that I think is a -- just the right case.

    General, before you sit down, did you just say (Inaudible)
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="2255.636" stopTime="2311.809">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I think that the sole effect of that appeal was to put the Atomic Energy Commission on the same basis as every other Government agency to leave us free to make the arguments that we have made here or -- and to free the State of Tennessee of the arguments that the court made in Ron Anderson, holding that it couldn't tax. 
    Now, I ought to in candor say that I have not made a quick (Inaudible) check. 
    As I understand it, we would claim that the tax situation is exactly the same as it was under that statute and that what Commissioner Strauss said was what the Government officials often do when they don't want to lose an advantage. 
    They argue it trying to do all kinds of terrible things.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, there's apparently some doubt about that Justice Stewart. 
    I would have thought that it did too and perhaps it did and I'll be glad to get more accurate information from the Commission but consulting quickly with Mr. Kramer, I must say that he tells me that he thinks that we would claim that the constitutional exemption was the same as the exemptions that were claimed under the statute. 
    But I would like to emphasize that there must have been many, many people in Congress who voted for the appeal on the theory that this agency should be like other agencies. 
    However, the chips might fall rather than vote it to subject these operations to pass.

    Quite right.
