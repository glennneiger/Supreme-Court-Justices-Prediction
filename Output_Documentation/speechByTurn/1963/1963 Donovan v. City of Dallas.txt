    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court. 
    The case which we are about to argue has been variously described as a contempt case and in the Monday's Washington Post under the calendar, it was described as a runaway construction case. 
    Actually, what we are here involved with is a question which I believe is of great importance federally because we are involved not so much with contempt but with the judicial power of the United States. 
    Briefly, how this case arose, in April of 1961, a group of people, small people, little people who live in the neighborhood of Love Field, a municipal airport in the City of Dallas, Texas, retained counsel in an effort to stop the expansion of that field and the construction of a new runway for the purpose of carrying jet traffic over their homes. 
    46 people were involved.We filed an action in the state court of Texas, the District Court, praying for an injunction against such construction. 
    As grounds for that injunction, we offered the Texas Constitution and its prohibition against seizure or damage to property without compensation in advance. 
    In the course of the temporary hearing, we discovered that he was proposed to support this and finance this new runway by the issue of revenue bonds. 
    There had been no elections so we amended our pleading and included that as a ground, an additional ground for an injunction. 
    In other words, the issuance, proposed issuance of revenue bonds without having submitted the proposition to an election as required by Texas law. 
    We had a motion for summary judgment which was granted against the plaintiffs. 
    We appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals which reviewed the case and rendered decisions supporting or sustaining the summary judgment. 
    We then applied for writ of error to a Texas Supreme Court which writ of error was denied, no reversible error. 
    We consider that the in re portion of the Supreme Court decision is important because of the rule in Texas which states that where a decision, where the Court, the Supreme Court is in accord with the result of the case, whether it's not wholly satisfied that the Court of Civil Appeals has correctly declared the law, then it is a reversible refused, no reversible error decision. 
    In other words, the result is right but the court of the -- the Supreme Court is not in agreement on all points of law mentioned in the opinion, which we believe is important in this case.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    No, sir, there is no way. 
    So that -- that -- we were incidentally denied a motion for rehearing in the original decision of the Supreme Court which denied or affirmed the judgment rather, no reversible error. 
    Following that action, we applied to this Court for review on certiorari. 
    During the period of the pendency of the case in the Supreme Court of Texas, the case of Griggs against Allegheny County had been decided by this Court and the decision handed down and it was upon the basis of that case so we came here for relief. 
    However, that relief was refused. 
    We made a motion for rehearing and went back to Texas. 
    In the decision of the Court --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="293.654" stopTime="430.899">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    Yes, sir. 
    The class is, perhaps, important because in the original suit, the class was described as "The homeowners, families and individuals who live, work, reside and attend schools, churches and other community centers in the area embraced with the approach areas of planned runway, 1331 (l). 
    Actually, the type of class is important because of the fact that it was not a taxpayer's action even though people that were involved in the suit were taxpayers. 
    Now, then in the interim, the action was pretty fast in this case. 
    The suit was filed April 3rd, summary judgment rendered July 16, 1961, certiorari denied by this Court in July of 1962. 
    And the motion for rehearing was denied in October 1962. 
    In the Court of Civil Appeals' opinion, on the question of the injunction predicated on the proposed issue bonds the Court stated that we were not entitled to the injunction and that no election was required on those bonds. 
    However, on examination of the authority cited by the Court of Civil Appeals established that the case has cited held that under the law of Texas, it was not possible to enjoin a proposed issue of bonds that the remedy available to the taxpayer and the citizen was to go in to Court after the bonds had been issued. 
    The rule says that the only way that you can attack it is to go in and seek to enjoin the payment of bonds. 
    The idea behind the rule is stated in those cases that if a bond issue is void, then there is no damage to the taxpayer, therefore, an injunction of a proposed issue will not be granted. 
    So in that situation reviewing the law and having learn the considerable amount about the operation and the interim between the beginning of the suit and the determination of the appeals, 30 of the original plaintiffs in the Atkinson case which was the first suit, joined by another 92 plaintiffs who were not in the first suit, brought an action in federal court which we refer to here as the Brown case.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="460.179" stopTime="565.335">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    That's right. 
    About the 10th of April, we had a temporary hearing, our hearing and an application of a temporary injunction. 
    Following that application, the city, which was the only defendant, moved for summary judgment. 
    The plaintiffs or petitioners then filed an amended complaint which was June 23rd, 1961. 
    And the amended complaint is the one that we were heard on and the judgment was granted on. 
    Now, then, in the federal action, we had not only some 90 new plaintiffs who were not involved in the original Atkinson state suit but we also had a new group of defendants. 
    We have the original defendant, the only common defendant to the Atkinson and Brown case, the City of Dallas. 
    We join the Attorney General of the State of Texas because of his obligation under law to certify to the legal issuance of bonds. 
    We join the mayor, the city manager, the city auditor, treasurer, secretary and counsel of the City of Dallas because of their activities in connection with the issuance of bonds and a bond issue which was not in existence at the time of the institution of the original case. 
    We join -- join the bond house which was handling the distribution sale of these bonds and we join the bond attorneys upon whose advised these bonds were being offered to the public. 
    So that we had a very wide difference in parties in the first action and in the -- in the state action and then the action subsequently filed in the federal court. 
    Now, the federal action was --

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    Because they did not sue as taxpayers. 
    His second action was not a class action. 
    The first action in the state suit claim to represent not the taxpayers in the City of Dallas but to represent the homeowners, the families and the individuals who live, work, reside and attend schools --

    Mr. James P. Donovan

    The plaintiffs in the second were 122 individuals who sought to represent themselves, all of whom were taxpayers.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="625.019" stopTime="627.351">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but were they also homeowners and things in that area?

    Yes, sir, they live in the area --

    None of -- none of them was -- at least one-half they were wearing was -- the fact was -- represented people that were representing the first action.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    They were a part of the class in the first action except that they were -- our first action was not a taxpayer's action and our first action did not attack any outstanding bonds because of the fact that there were no bond owners represented as defendants.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="655.037" stopTime="667.549">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, if there was no difference between the first and the second suit other than the -- than the identity of the defendants, would you -- would you say that res judicata was not to be imposed?
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="667.549" stopTime="676.066">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    Yes, I would, Your Honor, because I believe that when a group of people -- I mean these were not necessarily taxpayers, not first class. 
    We had every type of person --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="676.066" stopTime="677.538">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We're talk about defendants.
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="677.538" stopTime="681.324">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    About defendants. 
    Well, the only common defendant we have is the City of Dallas and --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="681.324" stopTime="682.491">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know but --
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="682.491" stopTime="684.349">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    And I think that the addition of the --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="684.349" stopTime="692.072">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Say the only case between the two -- since -- then -- in -- in the defendants. 
    Would you say that res judicata was there?
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="692.072" stopTime="770.708">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    I would say that still there would be no application of res judicata because there was no privity of parties. 
    We were not suing the same party or -- nor were we're suing persons who were in privity with that party. 
    In other words, we have attorneys and bond houses and everything in the second suit that we didn't have in the first. 
    Now, the prayer for relief in the second suit may help answer your question on that point because in the second suit, we -- we braced our action on the Civil Rights Law Title 42. 
    We also -- we predicated that upon the denial of the election provided by statute, Article 46 (d) (9) of the statute to Texas. 
    We also pleaded that the construction of an airway -- airport runway in violation of the United States statutes and regulations adopted pursuant thereto was a burden on interstate commerce. 
    And then further, we charge that the action of these defendants involving an issue which was not in existence at the time when the state suit was in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of the United States and was in violation of the postal laws because of the circulation of false and fraudulent statements relative to the sale of bonds. 
    Now --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="770.708" stopTime="773.112">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    None of these federal questions are raised in the first suit.

    None of those were raised in the first suit.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    The constitutional question of the first suit was the seizure of property without -- without compensation.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="782.310" stopTime="783.807">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That was raised in the second?
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="783.807" stopTime="964.979">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    It's also raised in the second suit merely for the purposes joined special interest. 
    Now, in addition to that fact, the original judgment was entered on July 16, 1961. 
    The federal action was not brought until September of 1962 and in the interim, there were considerable changes of fact on the basis of the pleadings under the federal rules which do not require you to -- to plead evidence. 
    It is impractical and impossible to determine an issue as being a matter of fact submitted in a prior judgment because it's pleading to plead your evidence and without particular reference to identical regulations and things you cannot say that a matter is res judicata. 
    Then he went -- this suit was filed in the federal court on September 24th and on September 25th, the City of Dallas came in appearing for all defendants in the action and filed what they designated as a motion to advance. 
    In that pleading, they pleaded the Atkinson case as res judicata and asked for an immediate trial on the merits. 
    Apparently, they changed their mind about wanting to contest the merits of our suit because on October 6, they went to the Court State of Appeals, the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas and filed an application for what they call a writ of prohibition. 
    Now, that application was directed to all of the defendants -- all of the petitioners in the Brown case and to the attorney for the Browns. 
    It did not join the federal judge, although under the Texas law, the normal practice under writ of prohibition is to direct that writ to a judge itself. 
    We were in federal court on October 10th after this application to the state court. 
    We went to the District Judge and we filed an application for injunction. 
    We said, "We have here of course before this Court, this Court has jurisdiction. 
    We want this Court to protect this jurisdiction and give us a trial before it. 
    We therefore asked that you enjoin the Court of Civil Appeals and the Supreme Court of Texas from any interference and that," I beg your pardon, "and that action was only the Court of Civil Appeals from interfering with our federal suit. 
    We want a federal trial." 
    Strangely enough, the Court of Civil Appeals adopted the answer filed by the defendants in the Brown case and came in and said that the -- the cause of the defendants was right even they were going to hear us within four days but they joined in the general answer filed and the Federal Judge turned down our application for injunction stating that she had confidence in the state court to do the right thing and that as a matter of comity, she let them continue. 
    We therefore went in the Court, the Court of Civil Appeals on this application for writ of prohibition. 
    We filed an application to disqualify the Court on the ground that it had intervened the federal action and prejudged the case. 
    That application was denied.

    In any event, that judgment became final and there was no more appeal to the Supreme Court. 
    Now, then, instead of accepting the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals as the final judgment from which there was no appeal, the city then applied to the Supreme Court of Texas for a writ of mandamus. 
    A writ of mandamus to reverse the judgment, the final judgment from which there was no appellate jurisdiction in the Court of Civil Appeals and to order the attorney for the plaintiffs in the Brown case and all of those plaintiffs to drop their suits in federal court. 
    We argued on that writ of mandamus. 
    We pointed out to the Court that the only authority, legal authority in -- in the Texas constitutional laws was for that Court to issue a mandamus in accordance with the principles agreeable to law or agreeable principles of law. 
    A final judgment involves judicial discretion and has been held in the 50 States of this union that a mandamus will not or issued order a discretionary act performed. 
    It may order the act performed but it will not dictate the manner in which the act shall be performed. 
    So that on that basis, there was no authority in the Court to issue such a writ.

    In the judgment, they said that -- I pointed out and I had pointed out an argument that there was no judge involved. 
    And the Supreme Court disposed of that by saying that's a technical rule of law so we'll just set it aside. 
    Well, it maybe technical but the legal effects are different. 
    Out of an injunction, you have to prove something irreparable damage and things like that.

    The original judgment was reversed without notice to anybody. 
    The judge signed an order which was not tested by the clerk, which did not bear the seal of the clerk and which was not mailed -- it was mailed out to everybody with no personal service. 
    That order was sweepy.

speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="1450.694" stopTime="1580.752">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    I think they could. 
    As a matter of fact at page 8 of their brief, they showed that on the day the suit was filed, this federal suit was filed in federal court September 24th, 1962, that there was pending in this Court the motion for rehearing. 
    So they were going ahead with the sale on September 24th when this Court did not turn us down finally until October 12th, 1962. 
    So that my belief is that much of this is just to avoid a hearing on the merits because the facts in the record show that this argument brought harassments and delay does not apply. 
    They prove it themselves. 
    The action was not good to stop it, as far as I know they sold the bonds. 
    But we didn't stop there. 
    We went to the federal court again and we filed an application, an independent suit for injunction, that's here on review too, again with the Federal District Judge saying judge that court -- Supreme Court of Texas and the Court of Civil Appeals had tried to decide this lawsuit. 
    We are here before your Court, the defendants have submitted the jurisdiction. 
    We want a trial by the federal court, not the state courts and we ask you to enjoin these two courts from any further interference. 
    Now, the judge turned us down on temporary injunction and gave us a hearing, and we have that hearing in federal courts in the record and that the cause of the -- of the hearing, the Court dismissed the case first on the ground that it was moot. 
    I've skipped the page here because going back to the Brown case, a minute this writ of prohibition was -- was filed and signed by the state court, the city then went into federal court on the Brown action and moved for a hearing, for a motion to dismiss and filed a supplemental motion pointing out that we are under injunction from the state court. 
    The Court heard the Brown case first even though we were trying to get a temporary injunction against interference. 
    And from the clause of the hearing state that we were under prohibition against further prosecution and therefore, she was going to dismiss the case which he did.Now --

    Yes, sir, we have called your attention to that Section which you -- you say that she held it was res judicata. 
    She said the issues that are sought to be litigated in the case in the federal court have been held by the Supreme Court to be the same as the issues which have been litigated in the Atkinson case. 
    Well, now, that's a holding by the Supreme Court of Texas. 
    We didn't want a decision of the Supreme Court of Texas on this. 
    We wanted it from the federal court, which had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter. 
    In any event, following the dismissal of the Brown case, we ask for a hearing on the injunction suit. 
    It was granted to us. 
    On the injunction case, she had -- the judge has stated that the case was moot and I called to her attention that it was not moot because we had that morning filed in appeal to the Circuit Court which made the case not moot and in any event she said, "Well, for the reason stated, I dismiss this suit." 
    Then we were brought in an order to show cause which was served personally on each -- on each of the parties here and upon the attorney as to why we shouldn't be punish for contempt. 
    We had a postponement granted. 
    We had a two day hearing. 
    Now, our position was that the order was invalid under the original writ of prohibition was invalid because it wasn't processed. 
    The rules quoted in my brief in the appendix show that no order or process out of the Court of Civil Appeals must bear the signature of the Chief Judge. 
    It must bear the signature of the clerk and the seal of the Court. 
    And it must be serve personally by a -- by a sheriff or constable. 
    All they did here, the record will show, was that the city took an order which had the judge's signature on it. 
    They duplicated it, put it in envelopes and mailed it. 
    And that never has the proof of mailing is not even in the record. 
    At page 173, it's -- we noted that the Court of Civil Appeals said it would reserve its opinion. 
    They -- they did reserve their opinion. 
    They never presented the proof of mailing again so that we were all convicted without any service or proof of service of an order without ever having an order introduced in the evidence. 
    And we contested the fact that there had been two orders.

    Mr. Kucera.
speaker="h_p_kucera" startTime="1896.321" stopTime="2033.636">
    Mr. H. P. Kucera 
    May it please the Court. 
    First, I should like to correct some of the things that have been referred to and what this meaning of the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals with reference to the Atkinson case and then let's talk about whether or not this was a class suit or a taxpayer suit. 
    Counsel has stated over here that the state law of Texas requires a referendum on the matter of issues or revenue bonds. 
    I defer with that and the cases that I've cited to you here in our brief that in the revenue bond cases, under the Texas law and even on ad valorem taxation, there is no constitutional requirement whatsoever that that be a referendum. 
    However, the legislation did provide that. 
    About 1899, that -- with reference to ad valorem tax bonds, their vote isn't necessary by the taxpayers. 
    But there is none required on the revenue bonds. 
    They -- keeps on doctrine over here and how that had been denied the civil rights of franchise. 
    Well, this is -- since this statute doesn't provide for a franchise, there was no civil right denied there. 
    And I think that question is whole of this side issue. 
    Now, then, the statement was made over here that the Court of Civil Appeals in Atkinson case held that the -- that these plaintiffs or taxpayers did not have the right or as residence to contest the bond issue and that there was no provision in the law to contest bond illegally issued until they're offered for payment. 
    With that, I disagree and I think those are in the brief. 
    I will support to my view on that.

    The Supreme Court of Texas in this very case solely stated, that these bonds could not be sold, that regardless how frivolous a lawsuit may be filed immediately, the sale of the bonds to which the city expect to of those related funds, it would reach to build their own way was equivalent to an injunction which the Court had decided he was not entitled to.

    Mr. H. P. Kucera 
    Your Honor, in the case of Princess Lida against Thompson, same situation happened there. 
    There was a suit filed in the Common Pleas Court in Pennsylvania litigating over a thrust of matter. 
    When some proceeding -- there is a certain stage in the state court. 
    One of the dissident fighters went to the federal court and sought to litigate the very same thing. 
    The state court of Pennsylvania issued a rule against these fighters to show cause why they should not be enjoined from prosecuting the case in the federal court. 
    The case proceeded on trial and that it did order them. 
    They joined the trial court and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which affirmed the injunction against the prosecution of the suit in the federal case -- federal court. 
    And this Court, in the opinion by Justice Roberts, affirmed that judgment. 
    Now, they have filed out --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2428.487" stopTime="2433.954">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You -- you are resting again on that point on what is the main issue on the Thompson.
speaker="h_p_kucera" startTime="2433.954" stopTime="2465.968">
    Mr. H. P. Kucera 
    The issue was this that these parties have headed them in court, litigating their problem that they have -- with the courts and having, the first of page -- jurisdiction -- they have the right to proceed to or judgment is in that case. 
    There, the case arose on the Fifth District within the last two or three years while the litigant was litigating in the state courts in Florida. 
    He lost all the way through, then he went to Houston.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2465.968" stopTime="2470.763">

    Mr. H. P. Kucera 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    But the -- they also say -- he has also says in there that the course of having competent -- common jurisdiction, state and federal, that one -- the Court can proceed irrespective to the other one until there is a judgment rendered which can then the final judgment. 
    Now, we had a final judgment in our case.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2496.368" stopTime="2499.962">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    It -- it doesn't say that. 
    I have it in front of me. 
    It says that at least until.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2499.962" stopTime="2713.068">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    At least. 
    Well, the intimation is little stronger, Your Honor, in the -- in the Kline case as in (Inaudible). 
    The -- the Blanchard case from the Fifth Circuit, their writ was denied. 
    He went to Houston and sought to litigate the very same thing. 
    There was a plea, a motion filed which called attention of the trial courts of two things. 
    One, that the Florida Supreme Court had enjoined him from prosecuting the case in this -- the federal court of Houston. 
    And second, the plea of res judicata. 
    The trial court sustained a plea of res judicata and dismissed the cause. 
    On appeal, the judgment was modified to the effect that the Court should not have pass upon the plea of res judicata but should have recognize the injunction issued by the Florida Supreme Court and dismiss the lawsuit on that ground and that was the judgment of the Circuit Court in that case. 
    The Court also say to the state that if the opinion or the judgment in the -- of the Florida Supreme Court were not satisfactory to this party, that he -- his remedy was to seek readdress in this Court by certiorari appeal which of the case maybe and not to -- to litigate elsewhere. 
    Similarly in this case over here, when the Supreme Court of Texas order the Court of Civil Appeals to proceed with the enforcement of the judgment which it had rendered in the Atkinson case by one of our -- writs were necessary, it was then moved to ask the state -- of this Court, well, they didn't do it. 
    They waited to 89th day to that -- after all the contempt proceedings and the final debate the -- the sentence was served. 
    So the point here is -- over here, that you tried to go to the Federal District Court over here to get Judge Hughes to stop the Supreme Court of Texas from proceeding with the enforcement of his judgment. 
    Now, somewhere down the line, we got to have some order over here if -- if they're going to have a rule of law particularly in its sue in a case of this order. 
    If a person can ad -- al infinitum proceed to throw a judgment -- I mean a lawsuit against proposed bond issue which the Supreme Court of Texas is -- cannot be sold while litigation is pending, then public improvement will stop from then on. 
    They of course, have little -- said that time and time again. 
    And this is -- this is the case that we're involved here. 
    They were not trying to protect their homes over here as far that goes in the second suit because the Texas Supreme Court and under their Constitution, guarantees these people over here, if when -- when they suffer damages that they will be paid. 
    We cannot go to Article 1, Section 17, confiscate or damage of property without legal responsibility. 
    But they use this device of -- the second suit. 
    They've waited about two hours to file the second suit before we readvertise for the -- for sale of the bonds and immediately, the bond issue was killed, so that -- that's the kind of lawsuit that we have over here.

    Justice Byron R. White

    That's -- that's true but at the same time there's a regular remedy of appeal to -- through certiorari to have the actions of the state court review it over here. 
    But he has exhausted that remedy and after the situation was over with, we were still stymying because every time we throw in a lawsuit, we -- we were stopped. 
    Those are the -- those are the -- that's the basic question. 
    Now, we're raising over here the question over here about the irregularity of the writs in there was not served with the writ of prohibition. 
    The writ would demonstrates and shows that the writ was partially handed over to the attorney here by the Chief Justice of the court who issued it. 
    There is an admission over there and that the people got it. 
    There's a long record of the hearing. 
    You -- in here on the contempt proceedings that he met with these people as of the name of the places, that he analyzed the decisions and that he told them it is not worth to play for the writ. 
    Here was a valid order of the state court prohibiting the litigation. 
    Somebody is on the line and should be avoided based just exactly like was in the (Inaudible) case, in the United Mine Workers case and quite a few others. 
    On the question of the irregularity or alleged irregularity of the service over here, I think the decision in the (Inaudible) case by -- Justice Harlan takes care of that. 
    There, the same question was raised to the effect of that he was not formally served with the interrogatories under which the -- the contempt proceedings were based. 
    The Court answered while he was in Court. 
    He heard him and that's all you need to know. 
    I object to the decision on that same thing or which we are cite here take care of that because here, they appeared, motion continues, they were granted 10 days leave and that's 10 days weren't asked to me. 
    They were individually called by name in the Court and told by the Chief Justice, "You can go ahead and purge yourself over here by dismissing the suit or obey the orders of the Court once you play here." 
    26 of them so took -- took that position. 
    Counsel had the keys to the jail in his pocket when he was commanded to dismiss the litigation over here to obey the orders of the Texas Supreme Court and the Court of Civil Appeals.

    Here, the -- the mere filing of the suit, although we're talking about -- there were securities involved in the Princess Lida case, but here, we got a bond issue over here.

   Rebuttal of James P. Donovan
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3744.611" stopTime="3748.615">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Donovan.
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="3748.615" stopTime="3868.607">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    If the Court please, on this question of the mere filing of a suit stopping sale bonds, counsel would like to call the Court's attention that the bonds that under attack in the Brown case had already been solved. 
    There were no problem there. 
    What we were trying to do is stop the city from paying them on the ground that there had been no election. 
    In that point, counsel says there is no law in Texas requiring an election. 
    I don't want to try the Brown case here. 
    I want to try it in the District Court, that's where I was trying to try it. 
    But for this Court's information, Article 46 (d) (9) in part reads for such purpose as your municipality may issue general or special obligation bonds, revenue bonds, the authority hereby given for the issuance of such bonds and levy and collection of taxes to be exercised in accordance with the provisions of Article 701. 
    That Article reads, "The bonds of the county or an incorporated city shall never be issued for any purpose unless the proposition for the issuance of bonds shall have been first submitted for qualified voters where property taxpayers of such counties, city and town." 
    Now, in the Brown case, it's our contention that this 1269j is an administrative provision, in other words, that specifies how the issuance is to be made after the authorization by the voters. 
    But that case, I hope some day to try in the court there, but this contention that this suit stopped the sale of bonds doesn't even fit with their own brief, on page 8 of the brief. 
    It's recited at the top of the page. 
    This Court, on June 25th 1962, denied a writ of certiorari. 
    On October 8th, 1962, a motion for rehearing was also denied. 
    This is as to the Atkinson case. 
    There was litigation pending. 
    Now, then, in the next paragraph, it says, "On September 24th, 1962, the day on which bids for the selling of airfield revenue bonds were to be open." 
    In other words, they were -- they say in their old briefs, they were selling the bonds while litigation is pending. 
    There is no statute in Texas that says that you can't sell bonds when litigation is pending, it's the same thing, it applies all over the United States that upon --

    Yes, sir, there's no prohibition against it. 
    It's a matter that comes out in a sale of bonds. 
    All the buyers want you to say that there isn't any litigation pending. 
    And there isn't any statute, it's submitted that there is no statute or any decision that says that that's got to be --

    What did the -- what did the Supreme Court of Texas mean when it says it?
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="3888.891" stopTime="3926.489">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    The Supreme Court of Texas, so far as I know, just was applying this rule as to -- shows in the record in the Civil Appeals that the Court asked him about that. 
    Incidentally, Mr. Justice Goldberg in that judgment denying prohibitions, October 24, 1962, Record 10 and the writ was issued, alleged to be issued, April 16, 1963 at page 78. 
    But in the -- in -- that question was specifically raised and appears in the argument before the Court of Appeals as to whether this was a statutory prohibition against sale while there was litigation pending. 
    And counsel answered to the Court there that no -- finally, it was just a matter they couldn't sell --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3926.489" stopTime="3927.778">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But you just couldn't sell the bonds.
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="3927.778" stopTime="3928.748">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    That's it. 
    That's what they're demonstrating.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3928.748" stopTime="3929.401">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="3929.401" stopTime="3988.918">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    Now, the bonds that I -- I didn't have any bonds in the first suit. 
    I was looking there for an issue to commonwealth, so I couldn't litigate anything. 
    I had no bond voters. 
    In the second suit, I had some seven outstanding issues of bonds which had been sold. 
    And all I asked for there was an injunction against the payment. 
    Now, I do have, I admit, certain pleadings in the second suit that appear to be identical with the first. 
    But let's conceive that they are. 
    Does that give the state court to right to throw up the whole federal suit? 
    Just because one possible issue was tried in the Atkinson case and decided?Our contention is that none were tried. 
    But even though it be true that there was one issue that had, can they still tell us that you can't have a federal court decide these other issues? 
    In other words, they're saying, you give one lawsuit as a citizen when you finish that against the City of Dallas, you're through. 
    We -- we don't think that's correct.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    The runway is under construction, everything is going along fine. 
    Money is being spent, presumably, the bonds have been sold. 
    Now, this -- the question is still there. 
    If this whole thing could've been resolved on a time base -- by having election, we there have about four. 
    Now, on the element of time coming up here, we're -- we had a motion available for summary judgment on October 6th, 1962. 
    The city didn't want to gamble on it. 
    So they tried this indirect route to get us out of the federal court. 
    They could've made a motion for summary judgment before Judge Hughes. 
    We could've argued it. 
    We were ready. 
    We could've gone in the Circuit Court in this area and then up here.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    That is a ruling by her but not on anything presented. 
    Now, prior in the record, you will find that when they brought in this extraneous matter on a motion to dismiss, I asked the Court for permission to treat it as a motion for summary judgment and of our continuance to submit affidavits and that motion was denied. 
    Now, then, she didn't have except our argument on the motion to dismiss as originally filed but rather on the motion to dismiss on the basis of the writ of prohibition.

    Well, let's assume -- let's assume that Judge Hughes had said, "Well, I know you've been -- you've been enjoined and you're not before this case.

    So consequently, I must deal with the first issue res judicata, I find that the suit was res judicata."

    As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to decide on the merits and I decide its res judicata and therefore, dismiss your complaint," then you still would have been in the same suit so to speak if -- because you would have been prevented from taking your appeal and required to dismiss your appeal under the threat and impact of the contempt order by the Texas state courts, is that it?

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    No, sir, I don't. 
    I don't think I was prohibited by the writ of prohibition from bringing a suit in federal court to try and enjoin the state courts. 
    Careful reading of it contains no such prohibition and those are technical things. 
    Now, I would like to mention along that line, the counsel state that I had the key to my -- to the jail in my pocket. 
    Well, I -- I am on disagreement on that point. 
    And he also stated that people were allowed to purge themselves of contempt. 
    Let me read from the judgment of the Court.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4287.852" stopTime="4288.505">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What page?
speaker="james_p_donovan" startTime="4288.505" stopTime="4372.476">
    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    At page 254 of the record and which is the conclusion after the Court had adjudicated everybody in contempt, it went on to say, "Respondents be and are hereby judged to be in contempt of this Court. 
    But punishment of each is a fine in the amount of $200 to be paid by each and everyone of them on or before the 27th day of May, 1963 at 5 o'clock in the afternoon at the clerk of this Court. 
    It is the further order judgment to the decree of this Court that upon failure of the said respondents to pay the fines and above assessed, within the time here and above specified. 
    Each of said respondents so failing shall be imprisoned in the County Jail of Dallas County, Texas without bail until such time as said respondent shall have purged himself or herself of said contempt by payment of the fine as here and assessed against him or her or until the further orders of this Court." 
    Now, then, let's get go on when to put me in jail." 
    It is further ordered the judgment decreed by the Court that the respondent, James P. Donovan be and he is hereby adjudged to be in contempt of this Court and that his punishment be confinement in the County Jail of Dallas County, Texas without bail for a period of 20 consecutive days beginning on this date and that he'd be remanded forth with to the custody of the sheriff of Dallas County, Texas for the purpose of such confinement." 
    Now, there is no opportunity to purge yourself there. 
    That's a flat commitment for 20 days.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    Yes, sir, there is an application filed by me in the Brown case with the United States District Court, which appears at 314 and 315 of the record. 
    314 is the petition to dismiss appeal where I made reference to the appeal taken and then I recited where some of the said appellants have been fined and their attorney jailed for 20 days for filing an injunction suit in the federal court against the Supreme Court of Texas in the said Court of Civil Appeals to test the validity of their orders restraining appellants for the prosecution of this suit. 
    And whereas the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas has wholly failed to protect the jurisdiction of these appellants and has dismissed this in the affirmance of injunction suit brought to test the validity of the state court orders. 
    And whereas the attorney for defendant, City of Dallas and Chief Judge of the Court of Civil Appeals have threatened these appellants and their attorney with further prosecution for contempt resulting in additional fines and imprisonment, now, therefore, under the -- the rest above stated appellants name and in those of appeal filed here and on May 16, respectfully request that the said appeal be dismissed.

    Yes, that's right. 
    Now, then, on this question of whether or not I had been served personally by the Court with this order of prohibition while it's not particularly, in my opinion, of greater importance here because I think it's a secondary question. 
    I would like to call the attention of the Court at the record at page 201 where I had Mr. Bickley, an Assistant City Attorney on -- on the stand or on this point. 
    Keeping in mind that we never had a -- of -- of writ that I was supposed to have violated or my people were supposed to have violated at anytime presented in evidence on this criminal trial. 
    No writ was ever presented. 
    But I was questioning on this point of whether I'd been served. 
    As to Mr. Bickley, I said, "Did you ever serve me with the laws of application to writ of prohibition?" 
    His toward -- bottom of page to 201. 
    “No, because you admitted having been." 
    Answer - "I don't care why." 
    Mr. Bickley given you and Chief Justice Dixon's office that morning when it was handed to you and said, No service would be necessary." 
    Question - "And that's the order you were prosecuting this contempt proceeding on, is that right?" 
    Well, Mr. Bickley didn't get the chance to answer, Mr. Kucera answered. 
    He said, “Yes.” 
    And then Mr. Bickley answered, he said, "No, he wasn't aware that was." 
    And the Chief Justice interrupted saying, "Wait just a minute, Mr. Kucera, I heard you say yes and answer the question. 
    Now, you're a -- not a witness, you keep quite." 
    Then Mr. Bickley answered again, "No, it is not that order Mr. Donovan. 
    It's the order that was amended by the Court and then as I understand it, given to you." 
    So I was never personally served with anyone.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    I -- I would be -- I will settle for that. 
    I think that if this Court makes it clear that the state courts cannot interfere with the federal courts' jurisdiction and that we are entitled to try our lawsuits, maybe we were wrong, I don't' know. 
    But I think under the law, we are entitled to have the benefit of a federal forum. 
    If we get that determined and once satisfied, then I hesitate -- well, I doubt that the state courts would again try to put us back in jail or fine us if we go ahead to try and enforce our rights.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    Well, if -- if this Court won't reverse, then I would say that the practice of laws become pretty hazardous because as it's stated in the Central Bank case against Stevens here, a person is left in this situation and that was anticipated in that case in 1897, that where one jurisdiction ends with -- interferes with another or it attempts to decide cases for it that the litigant is put in the position where either must abandon his rights or run the danger of punishment for contempt. 
    Now, that was the Court's opinion there. 
    They anticipated the problem and I got into it. 
    And I got just what the judges there thought could happen. 
    And I -- my argument now, I've been criticized here for -- for my language. 
    Maybe my language does give picture as of your time. 
    But this Court of Civil Appeals took the travel to condemn me for describing the order of the Supreme Court, as not being worth the favor, it was written on. 
    Well, I don't think that's unlawyer-like conduct.

    Yes.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I suppose that if we -- if this Court should decide that you are right, we would reverse those judgments of the state courts and then it would be clear that the Federal District Court should proceed on the merits of your cause unencumbered and uninfluenced by any -- by any writ of prohibition or anything else by the state courts and then would decide your cause on the merits. 
    Perhaps on the merits, the District Court would decide very promptly that you were foreclosed by res judicata.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    But we would have a decision from the federal court.

    Mr. James P. Donovan 
    Correct. 
    Now, this one other point I would like to comment on and that is whether this judgment of contempt is moot, it is definitely not moot. 
    There are $9000 in fines in the hands of the Court that were paid by these people and I think that they're entitled to get it back.
