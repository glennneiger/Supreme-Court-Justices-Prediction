Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company v. Stiffel Company
speaker="will_freeman" startTime="0.000" stopTime="207.001">
    Mr. Will Freeman 
    -- the Court. 
    Just before recess, I said to this Court that both of the patents below or the patents were held invalid is being within the public domain and yet the Court following the Illinois law or what -- how it interpreted the Illinois law, found that Sears was guilty of unfair competition. 
    In the sale of pole lamps which were a copy of that which was in the public domain. 
    There was some evidence of two buyers. 
    One, a buyer from Marshall Field, one of the large department stores in Chicago and the other is Smithe Company, furniture dealers, likewise a very high grade store, that someone had seen a cut of a similar lamp in the Sears catalog, listed at some $19 plus, whereas they had bought lamps from Sears at some $40 or $39.95. 
    The same was true with respect to the Smithe situation, except in that case, the complaining customer of Smithe's had seen one of the lamps in a Sears store. 
    That was the sum and substance of the evidence with respect to similarity and confusion by any customer. 
    It was ranked hearsay because the buyers were saying what had happened. 
    One of the buyers from Sear -- from Marshall Field wanted to know how to explain to the customer that there was this difference between a $19 plus product and a $39 plus product. 
    And we find in the record at page 91 a complete explanation by the vice president of the respondent, a Mr. Philips and I'm just going to read with the Court's permission, the third paragraph of the letter of explanation. 
    "As you know, it is common practice for many manufacturers to copy expensive designs and sell to retailers at reduced cost by reducing the quality through poorer materials and inferior labor." 
    Now, the granting of the perpetual monopoly to Mr. Stiffel gives him the opportunity of continuing to maintain his $40 plus price and precludes anybody that wants to buy a product at less money that will -- will serve the same purpose, it may not be finished quite as well. 
    But on the other hand, I think the public should be given the privilege of determining for themselves whether they want to buy a $20 item or buy a $40 item.

    Mr. Will Freeman 
    No. 
    I'm coming to that, Your Honor. 
    The injunction states and I'm reading now from page 68 of the record, which is item 3 in the final judgment. 
    "Defendant and its agents, representatives and employees are hereby enjoined from unfairly competing with plaintiff by selling or attempting to sell pole lamps identical to or confusingly similar to plaintiff's Exhibits 3 and 10." 
    Now to me, that means that Sears is precluded from selling a copy. 
    Just in so many words, that's the only thing that can be unfair, if it is legally unfair, and our position is that it is not. 
    Now --

    Mr. Will Freeman 
    That's a copy, yes. 
    Now, it's my position that even if Sears put a large tag on it or a neon light sign saying, "This is manufactured by, sold as a product of Sears", so far as the wording of this injunction is concerned, the commandment of this judgment is that we cannot sell a copy. 
    And anytime under state law that you are precluded from selling a copy, you are then stepping in to the federal patent system because you are giving to the Stiffel Company more than what they could have gotten had their design patent been valid.

    Mr. Will Freeman 
    Even after we're all long gone, to mean it would last for eternity. 
    They have what I would call a perpetual monopoly. 
    Judge Learned Hand, in one of his decisions in a case where some silk material was copied, made the statement that this would be the equivalent of giving to the first to come on the market a patent right, a common law patent right, that would last forever. 
    Now, the State cannot do that because the federal -- under the Constitution, "Congress can determine when it gives one the right to exclude others from copying or making one confusingly similar." 
    That right was given to Congress or by -- by -- it was given by our Constitution to Congress and that has been our patent scheme for over a 150 years. 
    Now, our -- conceding for a moment that the Sears lamp sold by Sears in a Sears store and has advertised, or listed in its catalog, did not have a tag on it. 
    Much has been said in this case by the respondent that Sears' product was not tagged. 
    I am sure no one would want a thing of beauty that should put in your living room or in your bedroom with a nameplate put on, "Manufactured by or sold through Sears." 
    Now, it's strange in this case, the Court of Appeal -- there was no finding in the lower court that there was a tag omitted or there was no nameplate on, no finding of secondary meaning. 
    And yet our Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit took upon themselves to say, "There was no tag on the Sears pole lamp." 
    Now, I'll concede that on the pole lamp itself, there was no tag but the container in which the Sears lamp was shipped to the respondent, it had a label on it saying, "Manufactured by." 
    And yet in this particular case, respondent here says, "Sears didn't put their name on it nor the name of the manufacturer." 
    And yet on the very page that they referred to in this record, four or five lines above, the vice president of the Stiffel Company said that when he received the lamp, he knew who the manufacturer was because he took the label off of the container in which the lamp was shipped to them.

    Yes, but it's -- but let's assume there was.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Inaudible) you got a perfect right to copy it. 
    The other man has no governmental protection of any kind that would keep somebody from copying unless he has a patent, trademark, copyright, something granted him by law.
speaker="will_freeman" startTime="813.843" stopTime="815.910">
    Mr. Will Freeman

    In other words --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="815.910" stopTime="828.005">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And if you can't be accused -- they can't accuse you of deceiving somebody simply because you copied any kind of a commodity that they -- they make. 
    You say that's not enough.
speaker="will_freeman" startTime="828.005" stopTime="878.600">
    Mr. Will Freeman 
    I say that as far as they might compel us under state law to label so that there would be a clear identification that this is the product. 
    This Court has many times said that you can copy a patented product after the patent has expired and you can't rely on unfair competition or anything else to extend the monopoly but you have to do so fairly. 
    Now, if it is unfair to merely copy, although we say it is not. 
    It is only unfair if you used some skullduggery, and I used that word here, palming off or the product that acquired some of kind of a significant meaning but that's not involved in this case at all.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="878.600" stopTime="890.695">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What you are saying is, as I understand it, that a State has a right to pass laws making it an offense or -- sub -- subjecting him on the damages, cheating and defrauding.

    That's not the issue --

    -- idea of monopoly by a patent and copyrights.
speaker="will_freeman" startTime="904.846" stopTime="977.033">
    Mr. Will Freeman 
    Right. 
    Now incidentally, in the copyright case that was referred to earlier in the preceding case, I'm just tempted to say what Mr. Ooms didn't point out, that in the copyright case, it too was a limited monopoly granted by the United States Government and not something issued by the State or made by the State. 
    I was in that case in this Court, Your Honors. 
    Now the Court of Appeals made a comparison of the two products and we'll concede that they are very, very similar. 
    There isn't any question about that at all. 
    Now, our position is that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit said that you'd no longer need palming off. 
    You don't have to acquire a secondary meaning. 
    If somebody is confused that -- and you have copied, that is sufficient to make out a case to enjoin the defendant, Sears in this case, from making and selling a copy.

    It is very unique with you -- with the State of Illinois. 
    I know of no other state that goes so far as to grant the equivalent of a common law patent or monopoly, especially a monopoly that requires no prerequisites as to meeting the standard of invention as laid down by this Court in the AMP case and other cases that had followed. 
    When you grant a patent monopoly, you give -- you give to that individual a monopoly on the basis that when the patent expires, all the good will and everything disclosed in that patent is free to be used by anyone that wants to use it.

    No, not that I know of, Your Honor. 
    Now, our Seventh Circuit turned to what they call old-fashioned honesty and they went to trademark law. 
    Now, they have injected and moved trademark law into design patent law. 
    And when they do that, they then move in to that which is exclusive, the States gave up the right to grant patents for monopolies a long, long time ago and it's only by our Court of Appeals moving from trademark law. 
    Now, trademark law doesn't keep you from making a product at all, it just means you can't use that particular name, the product is still available. 
    But in this case, the product is not available so far as this injunction is concerned regardless of what name or how large the tag is on the product that it is a Sears --

    Plaintiff, it was shipped to plaintiff, Your Honors, I misspoken. 
    Now, in conclusion, as I said, the States relinquished their power in patent matters and they gave that to the Federal Government. 
    Whenever you have something that's between state law and federal law, the state law must yield. 
    This Court held that in a recent case, Sperry versus the State of Florida, but that has been the pronouncement of this Court in many, many cases. 
    When a patent monopoly ends, the product is free for the public to use. 
    That's one of the conditions of the granting of a monopoly for a limited period of time. 
    In this case, the monopoly lasts forever. 
    Now, in a recent case by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, they wouldn't grant a trademark to someone because they said it might preclude others from copying and as far as copying is concerned, you can do that as long as you do it by fair means. 
    And it's our position that the only complaint that you have in this case is a matter of price. 
    Now, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals following state law cannot grant an injunction that is the equivalent of a perpetual monopoly. 
    That is exactly what was done in this case and I respectfully submit that the decision of the court below -- below in granting to Stiffel a perpetual monopoly, should be reversed.

    Mr. Warren C. Horton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices. Appearing for the Stiffel Company, the respondent here, I should like to emphasize or to assert really some matters of fact which are not mentioned by my opponent. 
    The Stiffel Company, at the time that it first brought out its pole lamp, which is plaintiff's Exhibit 3. 
    Certainly, in which they thought it was a new product, it was its own design and it did show that at the furniture show in Chicago in January 1956. 
    The Sears Company stated, by their own executives who testified that they observed -- they watched the advent of the pole lamp with great interest and when they saw, that they thought that it was moving in a mass market direction, they decided to move in. 
    Now, the manner in which Sears moved in was to take a picture of plaintiff's -- Stiffel's pole and take it to a manufacturer in Philadelphia and have him make what was almost an exact replica of the Stiffel pole lamp. 
    In this structure, there are of course functional elements, the elements which make the lamps operate, the switches, the connections between the sections, the springs at the top which hold it to the ceiling. 
    But there are also a good many decorative features which are not functional features, such as the particular handle, the size, the shape of that, the shape and size of the metal, the -- even the perforations on the metal which are strictly decorative. 
    Sears copied all those items exactly.

    Mr. Warren C. Horton 
    And -- that's correct. 
    It does have this -- a bearing however. 
    Petitioner says that the courts below held the patents in suit to be invalid and then granted to the plaintiff, the same relief under the guise of unfair competition, that is not wholly correct. 
    Before the trial court, there were 10 models of lamps made by or for Sears and sold by Sears which were charged to infringe both the mechanical patent and the design patent in suit. 
    The Court found that in fact all 10 models did in fact infringe both patents if they were valid, but said that both patents were invalid for lack of invention over the art which was found. 
    Now, in demanding the injunction against unfairly competing, the injunction ran only against one of those 10 models made for and sold by Sears. 
    So that as a matter of fact, 9 out 10 of the accused structures before the Court are not enjoined or restrained in any way. 
    Sears is perfectly free to make them, insofar as I know, it still does.

speaker="warren_c_horton" startTime="1792.920" stopTime="1855.185">
    Mr. Warren C. Horton 
    They were close enough copies so that the Court said that if the patents were valid, they would infringe both patents including the design patent but if the patents weren't valid and therefore, they did not infringe.

    Yes, that's correct. 
    And the -- it is up to the court. 
    In the -- it seems to me that the Stiffel Company who's -- ought not to be in any worse position than if it had enjoyed its patents for their full term and they had expired. 
    Actually, it didn't at all but in the Singer case where the patents had expired, the defendant was making an exact copy of the Singer sewing machine. 
    And it -- the Court said -- this Court said that it has -- the general public had a right to copy the subject matter of an expired patent. 
    Therefore, they have that right but that it had to be done fairly and there had to be such indications that the thing manufactured is the work of the one making it, as well unmistakably, inform the public of that fact but we think that's controlling here. 
    The same principle was applied by this Court in the Kellogg case versus National Biscuit Company, where they said that surely they had the right to copy the subject matter of an expired patent but they must do so fairly. 
    And fairness requires that it'd be done in a manner which reasonably distinguishes its product from that of the plaintiff. 
    We think that that is the rule which is applicable here and that it's only real issue in this case.

speaker="will_freeman" startTime="2446.302" stopTime="2578.433">
    Mr. Will Freeman 
    Counsel for Stiffel said, "There was a shipping label on the container and no one would be expected to read it and know who the manufacturer was. 
    I find no such statement in the record. 
    I do find, where the -- Mr. Philips of the Stiffel Company said, "I found out who manufactured the Sears lamp because I took the label off." 
    It doesn't say it's a shipping label or what it is. 
    It's the label with the manufacturer's name. 
    Now, insofar as Sears is concerned with respect to a -- going back for a modified injunction permitting us to put labels on. 
    Let's assume for a moment that Sears does absolutely nothing. 
    It doesn't sell this particular lamp, it just does nothing. 
    The precedent still stands that one who copies in the State of Illinois can be enjoined perpetually from so doing. 
    That's the injunction and insofar as counsel for Stiffel is concerned, they agree as a matter of law that once a patent has expired, you can copy the subject matter of the patent. 
    And they attempt to distinguish on page 12 of their brief where they say, "Sears copied the product." 
    But if Your Honors will look at a copy of the design patent which we find at page 71 of this record, you will find that the design patent in the product are one and the same, so we're quibbling over words. 
    So long as you copy the design patent, is -- which has been held invalid, you can be enjoined. 
    Now, that's exactly what this injunction means. 
    It means we can't sell a copy or one confusingly similar thereto. 
    This case should be reversed.

    Our position is that so far as the State is concerned, it can do nothing that it's in conflict with the patent statutes which are exclusively within the domain of the Federal Government. 
    And what it has done here, what the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has done has set up the equivalent of a perpetual patent instead of giving one that requires certain constitutional prerequisites, what constitutes invention. 
    And thereafter, saying that, "When the patent expires for any cause that it is free and within the public domain." 
    The -- the court below found the subject matter to be in the public domain so Mr. Stiffel never got any rights to start with.
