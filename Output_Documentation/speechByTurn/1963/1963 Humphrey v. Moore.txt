    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    These cases are here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the State of Kentucky to review a judgment and an order of that Court which judgment and order set aside a seniority determination made under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. 
    In case 17, the petitioners are a group of employees who are adversely affected by the decision of the Court of Appeals. 
    They are represented here by Mr. Ratner whose argument will follow mine. 
    Case Number 18 is the petition of the Local Union itself. 
    And I will -- to set the issue clearly before the Court attempt to expound the facts upon which the decision below was based or should have been based upon which was we think is controlling here. 
    The basic question presented of course is whether or not a state court or a federal court may set aside an interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement rendered by a Committee authorized to make such interpretation under the agreement because the Court is of the opinion that interpretation was erroneous or contrary to natural justice. 
    There are five parties actually or groups of parties involved in this case. 
    The petitioner in Number 18, as I stated is a labor union, Local 89 representing many employees in the Louisville, Kentucky area. 
    The Dealers Transport Company which was a party below, in the Tennessee Corporation which delivers automobiles and trucks and interstate commerce and it has a terminal in Louisville, Kentucky where the fourth company has an assembly plant. 
    The E &amp; L Transport Company similarly is a trucking company and interstate commerce delivering automobiles and trucks out of the four assembly plant in Louisville. 
    This company was not a respondent below. 
    The respondents Moore as a class are a group of employees of Dealers Transport Company employed by Dealers Transport Company in its operation of trucking away automobiles and trucks. 
    And this group is a mem -- are -- all of members of this group are members of Local 89. 
    The petitioners Humphrey are a class of employees of E &amp; L Transport Company, the competitor to Dealers and are similarly members of Local 89 and represented by Local 89 for the purposes of collective bargaining. 
    Dealers and E &amp; L, the trucking employers in this case are members of a multi-employer, multi-union bargaining unit and have been for many years. 
    These employers give their power of attorney to an employer's group known as Automobile Transporters Labor Division. 
    This power of attorney authorizes that Committee to negotiate and sign an agreement on behalf of the various employers who are members of that association.

    The board held that the unit appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining as evidenced by this contract was a multi-employer unit and dismissed the petition of the mine workers for a single employer election.

    It's a national unit. 
    It covers the truckaway, driveaway operations throughout the country wherever there are assembly plants. 
    This contract is a uniform contract and there are riders which are negotiated to take care of local conditions but basically it is a uniform agreement but the uniform grievance procedure and it is -- as I've said negotiated by a Committee representing the unions and employees and a Committee representing the employers.

    It is not the same contract. 
    In fact there is one very sharp difference insofar as the grievance procedure is concerned but it is patterned very closely after it. 
    This is a -- happens to be in the trucking industry. 
    A pattern type of contract which is modified from time to time depending upon the kind of freight that is involved whether it is dry freight, whether its petroleum, whether its cement or in this case whether it is new automobiles and trucks which are being moved from assembly plants. 
    As I said Local 89 is also for many years represented the employees of both Dealers and E &amp; L as well as other companies that are involved in this kind of transportation. 
    And that local union gives its power of attorney to an organization that is known as the National Truckaway and Driveaway Contracts for negotiation and signature. 
    Identical contracts are signed by each of the -- the individual employers but on the negotiation a master agreement is arrived at. 
    It is signed pursuant to the power of attorney by the employers -- by the employer's association on behalf of its members. 
    It is signed by the National Truckaway Conference on behalf of its members. 
    Then, subsequently, individual contracts are printed, distributed and signed by the individual local union having jurisdiction over the operations in a particular area and by the employer. 
    And the contract on record here will show the typewritten signature of the employer's association and I'll say for the employers and then the members of the employer's association who were on the negotiating Committee, let's say for the employees and then the members of the union who are on the union negotiating Committee. 
    I think this is important incidentally because the court below apparently cannot quite digest this kind of unit and the -- this Court will note that in its decision it seemed to think that in as much as two individual contracts were signed that people working under one contract like the E &amp; L employees could not possibly assert any rights as against those employees who are working under the other contract or the dealers contract. 
    This was essentially dispute of course it is out position that this is a multi-employer unit. 
    It is a uniform agreement. 
    It's binding upon all. 
    It applies to all employees in the unit and therefore the Court would actually in taking its decision attempted to fragmentize this multi-employer unit. 
    And actually it was doing that which we believe under the National Labor Relations Act is forbidden, it has no authority or power to do it. 
    The current contract expires in 1964 and I would like to take the Court's time to indicate some of the provisions of the contract because again I believe that they are very in strictly bound up in the issues in this case.

    It -- it -- well, it is not -- sometimes it maybe and I should say in this case there is one local seniority rider which predated this 1961 contract which dealt only with the seniority of employees of Dealers who had formally been employed at Memphis but had then been moved to Louisville when Dealers opened up its terminal in Louisville. 
    And that supplemental agreement said that as to those employees who were being transferred, they would maintain their overall company seniority at Louisville. 
    The Dealers employees relied upon that rider in the courts below but neither the Committee nor the trial court nor the Court of Appeals in Kentucky thought that rider had any relevance to this issue at all.

    Mr. David Previant 
    It is not necessary. 
    Each -- each had given powers of attorney to their respective negotiating Committees and each are bound by the negotiation. 
    Now this agreement does provide that the National Truckaway and Driveaway Conference is the exclusive representative of all employees covered by the agreement. 
    It provides that the employer is bound by all the terms and provisions of agreement by -- and by all interpretations of the agreement. 
    It provides that seniority rights for employers shall prevail and generally the rules set forth that seniority shall be by terminal. 
    It further provides that when there is a controversy over a seniority standing this controversy shall be submitted to the joint grievance procedure. 
    This joint grievance procedure again is similar to contracts which have before this Court in both (Inaudible) and Riss. 
    In that, it starts at the local level by an attempt to adjust between the union and the employer. 
    Upon their failure to adjust there is a local bipartite Committee consisting of equal representatives of the union and equal representatives of the employers in the area. 
    This Committee makes an effort to settle the dispute and if it does finally settle the dispute that is final and binding to the parties. 
    If they cannot reach an agreement at the local level, it then it goes to what is called a Joint Conference Committee. 
    This is a national Committee. 
    It is again composed of representatives of all of the national employers and all of the local union on a bipartite basis and equal number of each and this Committee does have the authority to make again final and binding determinations. 
    If this Committee should deadlock and this is where this procedure varies from the Riss case for example. 
    Then there is provided that there must be submission to an impartial board of arbitrators. 
    The -- the important thing in this procedure which marks it off from the problem which was before this case -- before this Court in the Riss case was the specific provision that the decision of the Joint Conference Committee shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the employer and the union and the employees involved. 
    The Court will recall that there was a -- at least that was considered an ambiguous statement in Riss where instead of saying the decision shall be final and binding the contract language go, "shall be submitted for final decision." 
    This is -- I think is clear as the intention of the parties can be expressed that the decision of a Committee particularly the Joint Conference Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the employer, the union and the employees involved. 
    Incidentally, in the Dealers' brief filed here and there is a suggestion that Dealers might have had a right to deadlock this case at the Joint Conference Committee level and take it to arbitration. 
    Contract is not give to any individual and employer or union that right. 
    Once a Committee makes the unanimous decision as was done in this case and -- and final arbitration is the final set only if there is a deadlock or there has been a deadlock and I believe that the mere reading of the contract will demonstrate that. 
    Now, the important provision of the contract which gave rise to a litigation here on the merits below reads as follows, it would be found at record 10, it's Article 4, Section 5 of the contract. 
    In the event that the employer absorbs the business of another private contract or common carrier or is a party to a merger of lines the seniority of the employees absorbed or affected thereby shall be determined by mutual agreement between the employer and the unions involved. 
    Any controversy with respect to such matter shall be submitted to the joint grievance procedure. 
    The contract further provided that it was the intention of the party to resolve all questions of interpretation by mutual agreement, factors and effort to preclude the Courts from making an interpretation. 
    The contract has a printed signature as I pointed out of the various parties and then the individuals' signature. 
    Now, the facts which gave rise to the grievance and litigation relief, as I've pointed out Dealers and E &amp; L were engaged in the business of transporting new automobiles and trucks from the Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant at Louisville to various parts of the country. 
    The court isn't -- is undoubtedly aware that this industry has been reset by automation problems also among which at least a form of automations effect that it has been found to be more economical than some instances to transport automobiles from what is called piggy-back. 
    That is by a multilevel flat car to which are attached rails, automobiles are put on and this transported in maybe 20 or 30 or 40 cars of such kind can be transported then from one part of the country to the other and of course each flat car carries many more automobiles or trucks that can be loaded onto the average truckaway trailer which up to this point have been doing it. 
    So these two companies were notified by the Ford Motor Company that because of its increasing use of this piggy-back operation, one of the two company services would no longer be required at Louisville. 
    Testimony up to that point was that Ford made no choice in the matter. 
    That all it had -- to have done was to announce to these two competitors, we will have use for only one of you in the future. 
    The companies then apparently entered into an agreement while -- I shouldn't say apparently, they entered into an agreement which was not apparent at that time that Dealers would purchase the E &amp; L rights out in Louisville, the industry commerce rights, the rights to transport at Louisville. 
    In turn, E &amp; L would purchase Dealers' rights out of Ohio, Lorain, Ohio. 
    And again in turn as a quid pro quo, E &amp; L would transfer to Dealers certain secondary rights which it had in Jackson, Mississippi, New Orleans and two or three other cities down south. 
    They had made this agreement and they have filed three separate applications with the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval of the transaction but the nature of this transaction had never been revealed to the union or to the employees. 
    At least not before the grievance was filed and was on its way up to final adjudication. 
    The union representative after receiving complaints and inquiries from members of the union had a meeting with representatives of both companies and he was told there flatly that there was no kind of a trade between the two companies and only that Ford had taken the business from one company and given it to another. 
    On those facts, the union advised the employees of E &amp; L which was then losing the business that it looked pretty dark for them and perhaps they better seek other employment. 
    And on those facts, it assured the employees of Dealers that they would have no concern. 
    Again the testimony is that they qualify this opinion on the facts which were then available to them. 
    Well, the E &amp; L employees then were laid off gradually and as they were laid off they filed a grievance. 
    They claimed that they were entitled to secure employment with Dealers because Dealers was taking over E &amp; L's business. 
    And that -- in that employment they were entitled to enjoy the same seniority rights which they enjoyed with E &amp; L, in other words, that the seniority board should be merged or dovetailed. 
    Now, in this industry when we talked of merging or dovetailing, we mean you take this -- in this case would be the seniority list of Dealers, the seniority list of E &amp; L and then you would make one master list depending upon the date of employment by either company. 
    Obviously, although it wouldn't be here, this matter of dovetailing is bound to prejudice and to injure some employees who may have thought they had prior rights with their own employer which they were now losing by the merger. 
    The grievance went to the local joint committee but there is also a provision of the contract that on all matters of interpretation whether they're raised by the union or by the employer, such matters must go to the Joint Conference Committee to the final step for determination or as it obvious that unless you have uniform interpretation of a uniform agreement it precludes its uniformity. 
    Well, because of that provision of the contract, the local union suggested at the local level that this matter be deadlock there and that it would sent to the next meeting of the Joint Conference Committee at the top level for determination as an interpretation. 
    This joint conference meeting was held. 
    The union was present. 
    Dealers Transport employees were represented by three stewards who were elected by all employees of Dealers and who attended the meeting at the expense of the union. 
    Similarly, the E &amp; L employees were represented by stewards who were elected by the employees of E &amp; L and whose expenses were also paid to the meeting. 
    Now, in the meantime, the union had made an examination of the federal registrar and had noted that these petitions were pending before the ICC and at that point the unions here changed because that it did appear that this was either a merger or absorption which would be covered by the provision of the contract to which I have referred. 
    So, when the matter got before the Committee, the chief officer of the union, Mr. Priddy, who normally sits as a member of the Committee, disqualified himself. 
    There's a Committee rule that no member of the Committee can sit on the case in which he is involved or which comes out of his jurisdiction. 
    Mr. Priddy disqualified himself and he made a presentation to this joint Committee. 
    And he maintained that on these facts that are now disclosed by the federal register, there's obviously in Louisville a merger or an absorption of the business of one carrier by another. 
    Under those circumstances and under this provision of the contract, the employees of the absorbed company were entitled to assert their seniority at the absorbing company. 
    And he maintained that the proper disposition of the grievance at that point would be to construct a seniority list in a manner which I have indicated where all employees of Dealers whether they were initially employed by Dealers or whether they came to Dealers from E &amp; L would find their places on that master seniority list in accordance with their total years of service with either company. 
    This of course as we've pointed out in our brief is not an unusual disposition of this kind of a dispute and generally is considered by the previous riders in the field at least and by some of the courts and some of the boards which have examined this thing as being the fairest kind of a disposition of this problem.

 Mr. David Previant 
 It is not necessary. 
 Each -- each had given powers of attorney to their respective negotiating Committees and each are bound by the negotiation. 
 Now this agreement does provide that the National Truckaway and Driveaway Conference is the exclusive representative of all employees covered by the agreement. 
 It provides that the employer is bound by all the terms and provisions of agreement by -- and by all interpretations of the agreement. 
 It provides that seniority rights for employers shall prevail and generally the rules set forth that seniority shall be by terminal. 
 It further provides that when there is a controversy over a seniority standing this controversy shall be submitted to the joint grievance procedure. 
 This joint grievance procedure again is similar to contracts which have before this Court in both (Inaudible) and Riss. 
 In that, it starts at the local level by an attempt to adjust between the union and the employer. 
 Upon their failure to adjust there is a local bipartite Committee consisting of equal representatives of the union and equal representatives of the employers in the area. 
 This Committee makes an effort to settle the dispute and if it does finally settle the dispute that is final and binding to the parties. 
 If they cannot reach an agreement at the local level, it then it goes to what is called a Joint Conference Committee. 
 This is a national Committee. 
 It is again composed of representatives of all of the national employers and all of the local union on a bipartite basis and equal number of each and this Committee does have the authority to make again final and binding determinations. 
 If this Committee should deadlock and this is where this procedure varies from the Riss case for example. 
 Then there is provided that there must be submission to an impartial board of arbitrators. 
 The -- the important thing in this procedure which marks it off from the problem which was before this case -- before this Court in the Riss case was the specific provision that the decision of the Joint Conference Committee shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the employer and the union and the employees involved. 
 The Court will recall that there was a -- at least that was considered an ambiguous statement in Riss where instead of saying the decision shall be final and binding the contract language go, "shall be submitted for final decision." 
 This is -- I think is clear as the intention of the parties can be expressed that the decision of a Committee particularly the Joint Conference Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the employer, the union and the employees involved. 
 Incidentally, in the Dealers' brief filed here and there is a suggestion that Dealers might have had a right to deadlock this case at the Joint Conference Committee level and take it to arbitration. 
 Contract is not give to any individual and employer or union that right. 
 Once a Committee makes the unanimous decision as was done in this case and -- and final arbitration is the final set only if there is a deadlock or there has been a deadlock and I believe that the mere reading of the contract will demonstrate that. 
 Now, the important provision of the contract which gave rise to a litigation here on the merits below reads as follows, it would be found at record 10, it's Article 4, Section 5 of the contract. 
 In the event that the employer absorbs the business of another private contract or common carrier or is a party to a merger of lines the seniority of the employees absorbed or affected thereby shall be determined by mutual agreement between the employer and the unions involved. 
 Any controversy with respect to such matter shall be submitted to the joint grievance procedure. 
 The contract further provided that it was the intention of the party to resolve all questions of interpretation by mutual agreement, factors and effort to preclude the Courts from making an interpretation. 
 The contract has a printed signature as I pointed out of the various parties and then the individuals' signature. 
 Now, the facts which gave rise to the grievance and litigation relief, as I've pointed out Dealers and E &amp; L were engaged in the business of transporting new automobiles and trucks from the Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant at Louisville to various parts of the country. 
 The court isn't -- is undoubtedly aware that this industry has been reset by automation problems also among which at least a form of automations effect that it has been found to be more economical than some instances to transport automobiles from what is called piggy-back. 
 That is by a multilevel flat car to which are attached rails, automobiles are put on and this transported in maybe 20 or 30 or 40 cars of such kind can be transported then from one part of the country to the other and of course each flat car carries many more automobiles or trucks that can be loaded onto the average truckaway trailer which up to this point have been doing it. 
 So these two companies were notified by the Ford Motor Company that because of its increasing use of this piggy-back operation, one of the two company services would no longer be required at Louisville. 
 Testimony up to that point was that Ford made no choice in the matter. 
 That all it had -- to have done was to announce to these two competitors, we will have use for only one of you in the future. 
 The companies then apparently entered into an agreement while -- I shouldn't say apparently, they entered into an agreement which was not apparent at that time that Dealers would purchase the E &amp; L rights out in Louisville, the industry commerce rights, the rights to transport at Louisville. 
 In turn, E &amp; L would purchase Dealers' rights out of Ohio, Lorain, Ohio. 
 And again in turn as a quid pro quo, E &amp; L would transfer to Dealers certain secondary rights which it had in Jackson, Mississippi, New Orleans and two or three other cities down south. 
 They had made this agreement and they have filed three separate applications with the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval of the transaction but the nature of this transaction had never been revealed to the union or to the employees. 
 At least not before the grievance was filed and was on its way up to final adjudication. 
 The union representative after receiving complaints and inquiries from members of the union had a meeting with representatives of both companies and he was told there flatly that there was no kind of a trade between the two companies and only that Ford had taken the business from one company and given it to another. 
 On those facts, the union advised the employees of E &amp; L which was then losing the business that it looked pretty dark for them and perhaps they better seek other employment. 
 And on those facts, it assured the employees of Dealers that they would have no concern. 
 Again the testimony is that they qualify this opinion on the facts which were then available to them. 
 Well, the E &amp; L employees then were laid off gradually and as they were laid off they filed a grievance. 
 They claimed that they were entitled to secure employment with Dealers because Dealers was taking over E &amp; L's business. 
 And that -- in that employment they were entitled to enjoy the same seniority rights which they enjoyed with E &amp; L, in other words, that the seniority board should be merged or dovetailed. 
 Now, in this industry when we talked of merging or dovetailing, we mean you take this -- in this case would be the seniority list of Dealers, the seniority list of E &amp; L and then you would make one master list depending upon the date of employment by either company. 
 Obviously, although it wouldn't be here, this matter of dovetailing is bound to prejudice and to injure some employees who may have thought they had prior rights with their own employer which they were now losing by the merger. 
 The grievance went to the local joint committee but there is also a provision of the contract that on all matters of interpretation whether they're raised by the union or by the employer, such matters must go to the Joint Conference Committee to the final step for determination or as it obvious that unless you have uniform interpretation of a uniform agreement it precludes its uniformity. 
 Well, because of that provision of the contract, the local union suggested at the local level that this matter be deadlock there and that it would sent to the next meeting of the Joint Conference Committee at the top level for determination as an interpretation. 
 This joint conference meeting was held. 
 The union was present. 
 Dealers Transport employees were represented by three stewards who were elected by all employees of Dealers and who attended the meeting at the expense of the union. 
 Similarly, the E &amp; L employees were represented by stewards who were elected by the employees of E &amp; L and whose expenses were also paid to the meeting. 
 Now, in the meantime, the union had made an examination of the federal registrar and had noted that these petitions were pending before the ICC and at that point the unions here changed because that it did appear that this was either a merger or absorption which would be covered by the provision of the contract to which I have referred. 
 So, when the matter got before the Committee, the chief officer of the union, Mr. Priddy, who normally sits as a member of the Committee, disqualified himself. 
 There's a Committee rule that no member of the Committee can sit on the case in which he is involved or which comes out of his jurisdiction. 
 Mr. Priddy disqualified himself and he made a presentation to this joint Committee. 
 And he maintained that on these facts that are now disclosed by the federal register, there's obviously in Louisville a merger or an absorption of the business of one carrier by another. 
 Under those circumstances and under this provision of the contract, the employees of the absorbed company were entitled to assert their seniority at the absorbing company.

    Mr. Priddy argued it to the Committee that all these men were doing -- was following their work. 
    And since this was a multi-employer unit, they had a right to preserve their overall seniority within the unit itself without regard to individual employers that in the long run this would be for the benefit of all the employees because it would be a condition of that industry. 
    It might be the next day that in other company might come in to Louisville and the Dealers employees might be confronted with the same problems and under this kind of formula, the Dealers' employees would be protected and they would not go to the bottom of new seniority list.

    A local union. 
    Now, this -- this joint Committee is not a union Committee and there's also a suggestion of the brief said perhaps this was the union disposition of the matter. 
    It is a Committee which comprised of equal number of employers and equal number union representatives and no one sits on that Committee who is actively interested in the particular grievances that have come before it. 
    In that -- in that manner, I believe it fits every test of an arbitration panel or board. 
    As a matter of fact, this Court held in Riss that it does whether it was -- whether that itself is called an arbitration board or not.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="david_previant" startTime="1791.359" stopTime="2004.181">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Yes. 
    The record shows that they did. 
    The -- I think that on cross examination they said well very little but they did make a representation to the Committee. 
    They were asked if they had anything further to present to the Committee. 
    Apparently, there was no objection made at that point that they didn't have notice that the union was going to change its position. 
    Incidentally, I think there is a serious question whether in -- in an interpretation case or in a bargaining case as this becomes subsequently as we shall see, that a right of representation is necessarily there at that point but I don't think we need to reach that point although it isn't discussed in the brief. 
    At this -- incidentally and this is a -- significant, the general manager of the Dealers and Vice President who is present at the Joint Conference Committee hearing testified with respect to the transaction between Dealers and E &amp; L and acknowledged that Dealers had and I quote, "absorbed a certain portion of E &amp; L business." 
    Absorbed a certain portion of E &amp; L business which is the language using the contract clause, nor that Dealers at that time although now belatedly, a claim is made in the brief, protest that it had no advance knowledge of the union position or apparent change in position. 
    On the contrary, it made what was apparently a frank disclosure of all of the facts. 
    When the Committee decision came down from two or three days later after which I had complete notice of the union possession, it made no protest but immediately proceeded to book the Committee decision into effect. 
    Now the -- the case then started. 
    The Dealers employees started to file a suit in the lower courts of Louisville, in which they claimed that they had relied on the union to present their grievance at the union that changes position. 
    Therefore, it deceits them that the decision of a joint Committee was planned and contrived, that the decision was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the bargaining contract although the case actually was argued throughout mostly in the context of whether the decision is a violation of the contract. 
    It does smack in some areas, the pleading down in the decision of the court below that perhaps some arbitrary or capricious action but were satisfied that on the record, neither does the complaint plead an adequate cause of action nor was such cause of action be sustained by the record. 
    Now, I have perhaps taken too much time in the exposition of the facts but we do feel that these facts really are the operative facts and should dispose of the case on the decided law under the trilogy, under Riss, under cases dealing with the right of the collective bargaining agent to negotiate seniority problems and other problems based of that kind. 
    That aspect of the argument and as much as I've taken as much time as I have I will turn over to my associate Mr. Ratner. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Mozart G. Ratner
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2004.181" stopTime="2005.534">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Ratner.
speaker="mozart_g_ratner" startTime="2005.534" stopTime="2461.479">
    Mr. Mozart G. Ratner 
    May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    In our view, the question presented by this case is whether Section 301 encompasses individual claims to future work opportunities which the exclusive bargaining agent in the collective interest allocates to others. 
    This is one of the problems that was mooted in Westinghouse. 
    The Court said there, when the employee and the union are in disagreement, the question is not which may sue but rather the extent to which one may conclude the other. 
    Unless Section 301 is now to be held to have subordinated the collective interest to the individual interest in such matters as allocation of future job opportunities, the unit in which seniority is to be computed. 
    And the uses of seniority deserved. 
    The exclusive representative must be able to conclude the individual in all such manners to the extent that the collective interests predominance. 
    Then whenever there is a conflict or disagreement between the individual and the exclusive representative, Section 301 must respect the collective authority. 
    We start then with this Court's recognition in Westinghouse that any federal substantive law collective bargaining contracts which may be developed must necessarily absorb the federal policy of supersedure of individual authority by collective authority when the majority selects an exclusive bargaining agent. 
    And of course we find this to be totally stated in the Lincoln Mills decision itself in which the parties are told but for the substantive federal law collective agreements is to be founded upon the National Labor Relations Act. 
    This Court said in Westinghouse that rights "which under state law are distributed among union members" become vested under federal law "in a legal entity recognized by federal law." 
    Of course the rights so vested in the exclusive representative by those and only those in which the collective interest predominant. 
    The distinction between areas in which the collective interests predominate and those in which the individual interest predominate is drawn of course in Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern versus Burley. 
    Burley distinguishes between individual grievances on one hand and matters within the realm of collective bargaining on the other. 
    The distinction is drawn in terms of whether the particular claim is monetary, whether it is fully vested, whether the remedy sought is wholly retroactive. 
    The individual seeks future status or prospective benefits so that the remedy and its negotiation will affect other members of the bargaining unit and future administration of the agreement his claim is not "uniquely personal" in the Westinghouse sentence and the collective interest predominant. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas suggested in Footnote 9 of Lincoln Mills decision, an analogy to the Railway Labor Act cases where the individual's interest is deemed to predominate in a suit for damages for wrongful discharge, but the collective interest prevails where the individual seeks reinstatement. 
    Those cases rest on the view that reinstatement affects the course of future collective bargaining whereas an award of damages for wrongful discharge is not. 
    The legislative history of the 1947 Amendments to Section 9 (a) shows that Congress thought it was acting in accord with the Burley decision. 
    As we see it, this Court has always assumed that Section 301 embody the Section 9 (a) 8 (d) allocation of authority between collective and individual interest. 
    In its dissenting opinion in Westinghouse, Mr. Justice Douglas with whom Mr. Justice Black concord observed, in short, the union represents the interest of the community of employees in the collective bargaining agreement. 
    The wide range of its interest are envisaged by the Act would give the collective bargaining agency exclusive authority to bargain in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment or other conditions of employment. 
    The range of its authority is the range of its interest. 
    In this context, we turn to Smith and Riss. 
    Smith, of course, was an action by an employee to collect wages in the form of damages. 
    That is of course the classic grievance in the Burley sentence. 
    In relation to such a suit, this Court held no more than that Section 301 does not exclude all suits brought by employees instead of union to vindicate individual employee rights arising from a collective bargaining contract. 
    Mr. Justice Black thought there should be no question at all about the power of an individual to sue or enforce such a claim for money damages for wrongful discharge. 
    Now Riss, it is true was a suit for reinstatement as well as for back pay. 
    But there the individual plaintiffs in the union were not in disagreement so that no question of allocation of authority under Section 9 (a) and 8 (d) could have been presented. 
    Moreover, on the assumption made by the Court in that case that the contract had been finally construed by the tribunal designated by the parties to construe it. 
    The case appeared to represent the equivalent of a suit by an individual to enforce rights vested in him by a final and binding arbitration award. 
    Riss, it seems to us stands for the proposition of the E &amp; L petitioners here have a Section 301 right to enforce by suit the Joint Conference Committee award against Dealers. 
    In this sense, they have the right to enforce the benefits that they achieved under an arbitration award as they would under a Court decree. 
    But neither Riss nor Smith implied that a suit will lie under Section 301 to set aside an agreement arrived at through collective bargaining allocating prospective job opportunities on the basis of seniority to entertain such a suit would be to use Section 301 to defeat instead of to enhance collective bargaining in respect for collective agreements.

    Mr. Mozart G. Ratner 
    Well, no, I hardly think that any section of my brief needs to put aside. 
    I -- I'm with petitioner in Section -- in Number 17. 
    I do not treat this as an arbitration rule. 
    I treat this as a product of the grievance procedure which is an indispensable part of the process of collective bargaining. 
    And I say that to use Section 301 to defeat a product of collective bargaining, which reflects the performance of the duty of fair representation is to pervert instead of effectuate the policy of Section 301. 
    And then I don't think it's what you want to do with Section 301. 
    It's -- this is -- it's an entirely different question. 
    He said, "What is it that an employee has a right to do against the union that doesn't represent him fairly?" 
    And it's another thing entirely to say, what rights under a collective agreement does the employee have a right to enforce? 
    What individual rights can be recognized? 
    I think that Burley answers the second and that Steel and Huffman answer the first. 
    But I do not that by next step can be taken and that step is that because individuals have a right to enforce claims which they derived under arbitration awards that it follows that they also have a right under 301, a suit to set aside arbitration awards they don't like.

    It's not because he has a vested right under the collective agreement that he has a right and a state in going to courts to enforce.

    Correct. 
    The problem here is -- is -- is shaping the framework of federal laws of 301 doesn't become a sword with which to annihilate the collective bargaining process. 
    It's not a problem of giving individuals adequate recourse against fraud and deception and -- and maltreatment on the part of bargaining agents to which there isn't a scintilla of evidence in this case. 
    We say that Teamsters Union versus Oliver controls this case because collective bargaining is a governmental process. 
    And the resolution of conflicting interests among constituents is the federal function of the exclusive bargaining agent. 
    The decision of a joint Committee in this case whether you wish to call it an arbitration or not and I see no basis or justification, whatever for calling in an arbitration. 
    The decision of the joint Committee is simply a resolution of a dispute over interest which the parties decided to resolve through the grievance procedure. 
    And having resolved it through the grievance procedure, their decision, their resolution is the fruit of the exercise in Oliver terms of collective bargaining rights on the National Labor Relations Act.

    Mr. Mozart G. Ratner 
    Exactly so. 
    As a dispute involving interest, the resolution of interest in prospective in point, the classic collective bargaining in the Burley sentence. 
    We said that to envisage a right on the part of disgruntled or disaffected employees who are disadvantaged by that decision to attack it in the corners is to destroy that freedom of collective bargaining which is the essence of Congress's policy and which is exactly what Oliver upheld. 
    The only difference between what Kentucky did in this case and what Ohio did in Oliver as we see it is that the Kentucky courts relied on a state statute -- the Ohio courts relied on the state statute and the Kentucky courts relied upon common law notions, natural law notions that they devised themselves. 
    The case for the opposition that the seniority rights of Dealers' employees are immune to the authority of the collective bargaining representative rest on either or both of two false premises. 
    One, that the bargaining unit is limited to Dealers' employees because Dealers and Local 89 signed a separate copy of the master agreement. 
    And two, that seniority rights are irrevocable during the life of a collective agreement. 
    The short answer to the first point that's been made by Mr. Previant, the answer to that is that under federal law, this is a multiemployer unit so that case is no different than it would be if the decline in job opportunities resulted from closing down one plant to one department of a single employers business. 
    Only yesterday, we found the recently published proceedings of the 16th annual meeting of the national academy of arbitrators published by BNA in 1963. 
    It carries an article and only the second article that I've been able to find directly in the law of literature, direct to the problem with merging seniority list. 
    It's an article by President Thomas Kennedy entitled Merging Seniority Lists in this Labor Arbitration and the Industrial Change volume of the proceeding. 
    At Page 43, Professor Kahn, who had previously written the authoritative work in this field comments about the following work principle, which as you will recall Mr. Priddy invoked, to justifying it stand before the joint Committee and he says that it's application -- the application of that principle have followed the work comes at the outset to determine whether or not and if so, to what extent. 
    The employees of company A are entitled to share in the seniority rights of the employees in company B. 
    A clear statement on the part of the (Inaudible) reflects how usual and normal and customary and honorable and honest and normal the union's position was when it found out finally when it broke through to the miasma and the fog and found out what the facts really were.

    Mr. Mozart G. Ratner 
    Surely, it's the -- its Labor Arbitration and Industrial Change. 
    The Bureau of National Affairs' publication in 1963, page one, I was quoting from page 43 of the volume. 
    The second argument that seniority rights are irrevocable during the light of a collective agreement, it is shortly answered with the observation that there are no individual rights created by a collective bargaining agreement which are immune to prospective modification by the bargaining agent, none. 
    The reason is, that collective bargaining is a continuous process and to hold the product of collect the bargaining, the contract gives rise to the irrevocable individual right terminates collective bargaining after its first performance the making of the contract and destroy all subsequent stages of process. 
    This Court it seems to me, would have to reverse a long line of cases to reach that.

    Totally indistinguishable, Mr. Justice Goldberg and the problem basically, in all of those cases, whether it's a single plant case or a multi-plant case or two employers or six is with the fairness with which the collective bargaining agent is acting in the collective interest. 
    The real difficult, if there is, is to assure that the collective bargaining agent does not add hastily invidiously on arbitrary or irrational grounds prejudicially against the interest of one group and in the interest of another of its constituents but rather as, as best to concede within the Huffman scope of authority that it unquestionably has and must be to promote and effectuate the collective interest of all of its constituents which of course, at any given time, may react adversely to the momentary interest of some. 
    In fact, inevitably will as this point was self observed in the Huffman case when it said that the satisfaction of all who are represented is hardly to be expected.

speaker="john_y_brown" startTime="3326.240" stopTime="3670.874">
    Mr. John Y. Brown 
    Their argument was pretty much like it is here made by Mr. Ralph Logan sitting over here. 
    I want to take the issue with the statement of my friend here from Milwaukee on his statement of facts. 
    To this extent, the record is presented to the Court of Appeals, the transcript of it showed beyond any doubt that the two representatives of the Union, one named A. D. Berry, misrepresented to these employees and dealers, will all demand the security that the other fellow, the president of the Local goes over and makes a speech to the -- and shows in that record, to the E &amp; L workers, tell them, find a job some other place because the contract provides -- saved it for these men and dealers. 
    And if you read that contract, you will find out it says that, seniorities shall prevail at all times and they make one exception, that's when a terminal closes down. 
    Now, this argument that they make here that -- they balled out and Mr. Justice Goldberg, you asked the question, “What happened over at Lorain, Ohio?” 
    And here's the distinction. 
    Over at Lorain, Ohio, E &amp; L bought the terminal of Dealers. 
    Over at Louisville, Dealers didn't buy a solitary thing, they had an auction sale and Dealers didn't buy a thing. 
    And let me show you that that's true. 
    When they hand down this decision in Detroit and they -- in Detroit, in the heading of it, they give us their reasons because of the discontinuance of operation in Louisville for E &amp; L Transport Company. 
    Now at that time, you didn't know it was going to be in a lawsuit filed. 
    And you gave the true reason that the E &amp; L was pulling out. 
    And that's why, and I'll tell you why they pulled out.Dealers came in 1955, a new organization. 
    Their men belonged in the union just like E &amp; L. 
    The chief business was all the Ford products. 
    Ford doesn't care anything -- why they say there's nothing in the record to show that. 
    You don't have to have anything in the record. 
    You gentlemen wouldn't be on the Court if you didn't have intelligence enough to know that a hardheaded business concerned like Ford Motor Company, doesn't care and think about the name of the company that they do business with. 
    They do it with the ones that do the best job. 
    And Dealers' employees got the job. 
    And here's the condition -- I'm glad you asked Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    It was argued before the Court of Appeals. 
    I want to tell you this answer in that argument. 
    My friend Ralph Logan has the floor and John Palmore who wrote that (Inaudible) -- who wrote that opinion said, “Mr. Logan, if you win on this contention, court would prevent this situation from arising? 
    I'm a young, intelligent, aggressive employer, and I come in and hire me a bunch of young aggressive employees. 
    And you have a concern out in Washington, it goes out of business. 
    And your union files a complaint. 
    If we can't look back at that complaint to see whether it's right or wrong, what would keep those employees from out there from being sandwiched over here? 
    And Ralph -- now Ralph said, "Well, I would see anything to it." 
    Now, here is an equity in this situation. 
    This Court ought not to miss. 
    You've got a group of young employees who did such a fine job and used to the same union, you refer the fact that the union took them up to Detroit, (Inaudible) home, and paid their way. 
    They are paying the dues of -- bring all this band of lawyers here all the way from Saint Louis, Detroit, Milwaukee, maybe Detroit sir, these -- these men because of their very efficiency in their jobs find themselves in position whereby a union ruling, they lose their jobs. 
    The first week, 96 of them are displaced. 
    And it wasn't until they came back here that they hired a lawyer. 
    And they -- this is a matter of just -- that you'd have to use your judgment on. 
    But, if the union hadn't pulled them, they'd had a lawyer a long time before them. 
    And we've got a declaratory judgment back in our state and I noticed in -- and the reason I was a little intrigued by the -- the opinion in Textile Mills against Lincoln Mills is because my friend Bardon, who was a congressional sector when I was over there in the House. 
    Bardon says I want this to be a history, of this act. 
    And he goes down there and asked, "Could employees", he didn't say Mr. Justice White, can just the unions and can just employers? 
    Are they the only ones that have a right to a cause of action? 
    Now, there'd been two dissents that brought this thing up, yours Mr. Justice Black and yours Mr. Justice Douglas, recent dissent in which you -- you say that the conventional method of writing a wrong ought not to be denied and that's in substance to your example. 
    Ought not to be denied and you say Mr. Justice Douglas that the National Labor Relations Board is too far away in substance there. 
    And Mr. Justice Goldberg handled that almost as well as anybody else because I am not a stranger to this labor movement. 
    Phil Murray was the one that employed me in United Mine Workers and we never envisioned a day when a group of loyal hardworking employees could be put out of a job just because they are efficient and that is exactly what you've got in this case.

    As late as a few minutes before, they thought the union was representing them. 
    And then they're told, “We've changed our minds”. 
    Now in the transcript, to show you that they've been fooling these men, the testimonies in the original transcript where Paul Priddy, told a representative of Dealers in Louisville, Kentucky at the time he filed this spurious grievance, that I know the thinking of Jimmy (Inaudible) and he wants these men sandwiched in but he didn't left them know that.

    That's not in the record. 
    We contend it is not. 
    The Court of Appeals found that it was not. 
    They found justice, it says in on the phase of their agreements up there when they thought there would not be a lawsuit and this is because E &amp; L is withdrawing. 
    Now, even though you had an absorption as they claim and our Court of Appeals found there was no absorption because it didn't take over a single piece of equipment. 
    They simply made application for the rights when this company withdrew. 
    They don't get anything unless the Interstate Commerce Commission gives them those rights. 
    Now I don't know whether they got them in the mean time or whether they haven't got it. 
    Our Court of Appeals in substance said that you cannot claim that these men had representations at that conference in Detroit when they're lulled into security, when they're fooled by their employ -- by their union representatives and when they're left standing there frivolous in the face of this Committee with no one could say anything in their behalf. 
    Now, (Inaudible) all about this when he filed the first -- and incidentally Mr. Justice Goldberg, you will note that this is an unusual thing. 
    He skips the first step in grievance procedure. 
    The first step under that Section that they rely on says that they must take it up with the company. 
    They never did take it up to the company. 
    They jumped over the company and went up to Detroit and there they make their decision without considering any conference. 
    I -- I'd like to pose you what for the time being may be considered as a hypothetical question. 
    If they are right on that quote, that when you buy out a company and you take over their employees, would this Court say that if this joint conference in Detroit should make this decision, an old company buys out a new one -- now Mr. Justice Goldberg, I want you to listen to this, this I'll state to the court is very important. 
    An old company buys out a new one in a locality, let's say at Saint Louis and the new employees file a grievance and take it to Detroit and that conference Committee proves that the new employees have seniority over the old. 
    Would this Court say there's no court you can go into and get relief? 
    If -- if he it didn't, we'd come to a sad state in this country where the individual doesn't amount to anything and only the collective group is to be considered. 
    The old group has a seniority on the contract but the union that -- Mr. Hoff's (ph) union in Detroit rules that these new ones get the seniority over the old ones. 
    And the old ones already lost half a million dollars. 
    I'm not telling you any hypothetical case. 
    I just got thrown out of Court in Saint Louis with exactly that picture because there's no relief in Court. 
    I don't think we've reached that point whether there isn't any relief in Court.

    And I was right -- interested in reading the part of the McClellan Report there and the part of the legislation, of the last Congress, in which they required the unions to get each individual employee a copy of the contract which many of them were not doing. 
    Now there wasn't any reason for giving a union man a copy of the contract if he hadn't got a any patience to go over it and violate it.

    Mr. John Y. Brown 
    And this misrepresentation of their union agents and in 1960 from -- in the case of Clark versus Hein-Werner Corporation where the facts are very much like the facts in this case, court refused to take certiorari on that case and there the local court, that's Wisconsin case, 94 362 U.S. 962, here's what the lower court said. 
    In most situations where the union is performing its fiduciary duty of fair representation in an arbitration proceeding presents a question of fact. 
    However, where the interest of two groups of employees as here are diametrically opposed to the evidence and the union espouses the cause of one in the arbitration, it follows as a matter of law, that there has been no fair representation of the other group. 
    The old is that one cannot serve two masters is particularly applicable to such a situation. 
    And this Court refused to take certiorari on that. 
    Now, what I'd like to pose is this, when a union representative in Wisconsin can't do that, shouldn't the rep -- the working people, the employees in Kentucky have the same break that the employees in Wisconsin had and you wouldn't take that case because there the Court found that the union was trying to represent two diverging entries and you didn't take that. 
    Now, here the union is representing, not represent one but being paid to represent two divergence but they can't do that. 
    And it's on that basis that our Court may be finding a fact that they didn't have any representation there and our Court further made a finding of fact that there's nothing involving the Labor Relations Act in -- in this. 
    Here, we've got only an old labor dispute here. 
    Here we simply got an action to construe and enforce a contract under the plain provisions which the complaining employees as follows have certain rights opinion. 
    Now, our Court held that this was a matter of construction of a contract. 
    In your steel workers cases Mr. Justice Goldberg, you had a different situation. 
    You had no -- none -- no question in that about the union representatives not fairly looking after the interest of the ones they represent. 
    You do have it here. 
    It's the whole backbone of this whole thing and on the case that I refer, I've used as a hypothetical situation. 
    I know of no court would want to establish a precedent that if an individual in this country is wrong, he hasn't got a forum to go. 
    I have heard -- and in the briefs, I read about what Congress thought. 
    Well I know a little about what the average Congressman thinks and no Congressman and no Senator in their right mind will create a situation where an individual can be wrong and not have any court to go to. 
    And if that's circumstance is here, that you've got to go to the National Labor Relations Board, you can't file an action in court. 
    I know that no sensible legislator would ever want to do a thing like that. 
    This is a pretty husky bunch of men that work for Dealers. 
    Every decision of our Court of Appeals except this one is on the other side but they let the loophole unless there is a capital injustice and I told them when they started that this thing is going to be hard to do because the Court's decision in Kentucky are against you. 
    The Court of Appeals set a $50,000 bond for these men to get the injunction, to get their jobs back. 
    And the lower court ruled that that had to be in a case, shall all -- they all offered to sign their homes so now it's got the intakes. 
    And between Friday and Monday, they bring in the $50,000 cash and lay it on his desk and they got the 96 back to work. 
    Now, men ought to know. 
    I don't -- I can't understand the statement of my opponent here that the individual has no rights under this. 
    I think an individual does have a right under it. 
    I think that the Labor Management Act meant for him to have a right. 
    I think it wouldn't say you got to give him a copy of the contract. 
    They didn't expect him to know what he had and be able to rely on what he's got. 
    And this is a -- I don't -- I read my opponent's brief here. 
    What I'm -- it got a 128 cases in it, the other doesn't have -- he's got about a hundred in there. 
    And I'm a country lawyer. 
    I've tried a murder case one day and an automobile accident case the next day or a will case the next day and I don't know as much about labor laws as you but I know as much about this as they do. 
    I know as much about right or wrong and I know here is a situation where these people were being mistreated, these people who built business for Dealers. 
    And that mistreatment was already in effect until the Court of Appeals said that we will vary from our former judgments. 
    You can't do a thing like this under the guise of a spurious grievance. 
    And this is a spurious grievance. 
    And their own report shows it before they knew there would be a lawsuit when they said it's because of a withdrawal of E &amp; L from Kentucky territory.

    I gave you the other illustration because this same agency completely disregarded the contract in running young men overall and the old men now have no court that they can go to. 
    And I'm simply saying to you that they ought to have a court and I'd like to say that this to me is very much like the situation that the age wide of a great king was then when he had deserted her after she had devoted her life to him. 
    And her parting on the map was that in this world, justice is a name and not a fact. 
    These men had been loyal members of Teamsters Union and they find themselves displaced by misrepresentation of those they thought ought to represent -- represent them and they are searching for a spot where the wrong can be righted.

    I represent Dealers Transports who is the innocent third party in this dispute between members of one local union. 
    The question presented so far as we're concerned is what would be our rights under the interpretation of this contract. 
    It is quite true that the grievance was presented by the E &amp; L employees to a business agent of the local who in turn took the dispute up with the -- at the local level in Louisville. 
    The matter was deadlocked and referred to the central Committee in Detroit. 
    There had been ramblings and of course, we took no position as to what we should do about it. 
    After the decision of the joint councilor who came down, we complied our way in the process of complying with the decision. 
    And shortly up to that time, the injunction suit was filed. 
    We took the position there that we would not take one side or another that we would first obey the decision or follow the decision of the joint national counsel and of course with necessity we must obey the injunction of the state court.

    I don't think in a series dispute -- a dispute, Mr. Justice Goldberg, except for the interpretations in the industry as to the meaning of all of these things. 
    Now, the fascinating thing about it is basically what happened was that Ford Motor Company told Dealers and E &amp; L in Louisville that were was not enough business for two transport companies out of Louisville. 
    And one of them would have to get out or Dealers was obviously far more efficient. 
    So Dealers sold its terminal at Lorain, Ohio where there's another Ford plant. 
    And sold the equipment, trucks, trailers, everything, just at Lorain then E &amp; L was out of business in Louisville. 
    They had some secondary runs out of Louisville. 
    Lorain had no market value except probably for bookkeeping purposes, the cost of getting them transferred on the application, they were pretty much up for grabs to anybody that could justify -- could get them but we paid E &amp; L for the cost of the transfer and those over and that was the only consideration. 
    So the thing that fascinates me and has from the beginning on this thing is, is this a merger or a consolidation or a transfer of what or an absorption of business? 
    We didn't absorb anything. 
    We took business that E &amp; L had been given to Ford. 
    I mean, Ford had been giving to E &amp; L but we had that already. 
    The only difference was we got more business from Ford. 
    We didn't get anything from E &amp; L.

    As I understand it, the assertion that the union misrepresented the situation in defiance to the Dealers employees is based on the assertion that Mr. A.D., Berry and Mr. Priddy told the employees that the rider to the Dealers' contract would insulate them absolutely against this grievance. 
    Now there is not one word, not one scintilla in this record or in the typewritten transcript which supports that statement. 
    What the record shows is that what A.D., Berry and Priddy relied on was the absence of a merger or absorption and that they so stated to the employee.

    How does it become a grievance between E &amp; L employees and Dealers? 
    Well the same way employees is not limited to the employees of any employer under the National Labor Relations Act and it isn't limited to the employees of any particular employer under this agreement anymore. 
    Obviously, when there is a clause in the contract that says in the event the employer absorbs the business of another private contract carrier, the seniority of the employees affected shall be determined by mutual agreement between the employer and the unions involved. 
    That kind of a clause, it simply got to contemplate the existence of a dispute between employees of an employer other than their own and the employee and the absorbing employer. 
    Now in that kind of a situation you may or may not under certain circumstances have a question if it's timely and properly raised as to whether the first step in that kind of a grievance procedure required the filing of a grievance by the employees of the -- of the company that's being put out of business against the company that's doing the absorption maybe or maybe not but that certainly was not raised in this case.

    But if the Committee -- the local union had said that this is a matter pertaining to the interpretation of Section 5, then as I read paragraph B they were required to submit it and both the local union and the local employer Committee thought that this involved the question of interpretation and the record says that, that's why they submitted it to Detroit.

    As a matter of fact when he did take it up with Dealers management and he asked them what the facts were, what he was told by Dealers' management was that there is no kind of a trade or understanding between these two companies at all. 
    And that was the impression that Dealers gave to the union and it was on the basis of that misrepresentation that the union advised the employees of what it thought the joint Committee might ultimately decide and it wasn't --

    Mr. Attorney 
    Mr. Justice White, I suspect that when I have to answer is that they agreed that it was beyond their power to differ. 
    At that point in any rational way at all they were in agreement that the person to whom they take any difference is there might be involving the interpretation of that agreement before it was a joint Committee. 
    I certainly do.I cannot understand how -- why parties would write a provision that say that all questions of interpretation have to be referred to the Joint Conference Committee that consists of the elected delegates of the contracting parties. 
    In - in an obvious attempt to obtain uniformity of the interpretations throughout the country and then say that when a question of interpretation arises, what we will do is to let the local Committee and the local union, the local employer resolve it to their own satisfaction and have different interpretations throughout the United States. 
    I would suppose that the same considerations that underlie this Court's desire and insistence upon the preemption doctrine and the field of labor relation would quite ration to lead a labor organization and an employer to make a similar -- similar kind of collective bargaining contract, and similarly best in a single expert administrative agency if Your Honor please, the power to interpret and to apply the collective bargaining contract. 
    I would think that it would be just exactly as disruptive device of national policy in the administration of this collective bargaining policy. 
    For the parties to permit or to allow a local employer and a local union to make their own interpretations of whether this is a merger or absorption under this agreement is it would be for this Court now to hold that the procedure that was actually followed here was a denial of fair representation.

    Mr. Attorney 
    As I read the complaint, it does allege that the union misrepresented to the employees of Dealers that it would protect their interests in the sense that it believed that under the facts, the decision should go in their favor, namely, that there should be no sandwiching. 
    I understand that that is alleged. 
    I also understand that they alleged in the complaint, that when the event came, the union did not take the position in favor of the Dealers employees, but instead to a position against them. 
    It is concluded, I believe on this record, that that constitutes fraud. 
    I say it doesn't --

    Mr. Attorney 
    Well I don't see the word fraud used, but I think that it's fair to say that the tenure of the allegations is that somehow we were wrong. 
    We were misled by the union. 
    Now as a matter of fact, we are correct, that this entire process as a matter of perspective employment involves collective bargaining as a legislative process that even reading their allegations as a statement that the union told us they were going to be on our side but when it came to the bargaining table, they turned out to be against us. 
    All this does is to allege that we have a faithless legislative representative. 
    Our Congressman didn't tell us what he was -- that he's going to vote for the bill.It turned out he got in the floor, he voted against it. 
    We were relying on him to vote for it. 
    That's the most. 
    But the fact of the matter here is that what's omitted and carefully omitted from the complaint is what comes out in the evidence and that is that the union predicated whatever statements it made to these employees upon misrepresentation and concealment by Dealers transit to the union as to what the facts were. 
    They said that there was no trade and no understanding of any kind between these parties concealing the fact that there was the trade. 
    Now when the union found out what the true facts were, it did its job as a collective bargaining representative as we understand it under federal law. 
    What's the job? 
    It's to represent the collective interest, fairly and honestly and truly as the union understands it. 
    That's all that any representative can do. 
    That they did when they found out what the facts were, they said and argued this on these facts that this isn't absorption and now wen go to the question of what we do about it when we merge the seniorities.

    This of itself is enough to destroy the traditional presumption in favor of an arbitration award.

    On the first place I say that they have no right on this kind of a matter to demand that the union be an advocate of their views. 
    If that's what they're relying on that the union told him it was going to be advocate of their reviews, there's something wrong with their position in the first place because they don't understand the function of a bargaining representative which is not to be in advocate of an insular view of one section of its constituency.

    If the union told them -- if the union told them that it was going to act as their advocate of their special interest, the union was very bad and very wrong. 
    If it told them that it was going to serve as their lawyer to protect their interest against the collective interest, the union would undoubtedly be betraying, not them but collective interest. 
    I don't see that they would have a cause to stand and complaint at all in that kind of a situation if the union had a locus poenitentiae and then said, "Well by God, no we're not going to do.

    Mr. Attorney 
    Mr. Justice Black, I think that in order to come to that conclusion, you would have to say that when the union makes a misrepresentation and I don't concede for a second that the union in this case told these employees, no matter how you read this record that the union was going to act as their advocate before the Committee in the Detroit which is what this Court is talking about and it's just not supported by the record. 
    But I think for five seconds that unless you take the position that such a statement is made, removes this from the area of collective bargaining completely so that the union looses its statutory authority to adjust the grievance and to participate in its adjustment that you can turn around and say and if you say then, you're depriving the entire collectivity, the entire collective bargaining union of the benefit of the collective bargaining process that Congress provided for the resolution of just this kind of seniority and merger and absorption dispute.

    It seems to me that in union life, as in political life, the elected representatives may on occasion tell their constituents to see things that may not be true or as in this case they may act on this information and give them a report that turns out to be inaccurate or a prediction of their position, what their position will be when the matter comes up for vote and it turns out that when they additional information, they find that they can't vote that way at all in honesty and in candor and justice to the collective interest that they represent.

speaker="attorney" startTime="8304.343" stopTime="8376.846">
    Mr. Attorney 
    Well now Mr. Justice Black, I don't know where in this record you may have gotten the idea that there is anything in it that suggest that they got word from Detroit that they know how it's going. 
    What Mr. Priddy testified and my brief contains an error and have placed to the -- of a quotation mark at the first part of that quotation because it does -- it -- it's four words to the left of where it ought to be. 
    But what he said was that I know Mr. Hoff is thinking on matters of this kind. 
    There isn't a scintilla of evidence in this record and if he knew -- if Mr. Hoff was the only one who voted and of course he wasn't, the employers voted, there -- this is a bipartite group. 
    But if the union had the problem to resolve alone and I hardly think that this Court could decide the case of it of whether Mr. Hoff would have decided it (Inaudible), if the union had a policy and a practice in cases where there were trades and agreements of this sort, an integrating seniority, I suggest that the literature in collective bargaining is such that they are to be commended for the integration of seniority list in these situations that it castigated.

    As I understand it, your question was directed to the proposition that what if these people had gotten word from Detroit that they or had known from Detroit how the union -- how the Detroit Committee was going to decide it. 
    I say that once the facts came up that there had been, the companies had lied that there had in fact did an understanding of the trade.

    Even though -- even though it's been decided -- even though it's been decided in advanced without hearing any -- any argument or any evidence, do you say it be all right if they decide it according to what you say is right?
speaker="attorney" startTime="8414.857" stopTime="8516.184">
    Mr. Attorney 
    Mr. Justice Black I can't -- I -- there is -- I can add only this. 
    There's not a scintilla of evidence in this record, not a hint that supports a finding that this case had been decided in advance without hearing evidence by the people in Detroit. 
    There is evidence that would leave one to conclude that the experience of the Detroit Committee and prior decisions in other cases was such, that anyone familiar with them could predict the result just as most people can predict results that this Court will reach if there is an adequate body of authority in the cases cold leave within the line. 
    But I don't suggest either that that's arbitrary and capricious to seek forward dishonorable. 
    Of course there's going to be a body of precedent developed which people are going to be able to rely on a basis to which they're going to make predictions or else you're going to have a wilderness instead of rational collective bargaining and a rational process of adjudication. 
    That's what this record shows. 
    Presigned or printed -- I know what he's thinking on matters of this nature once he finds out about what's in the federal register. 
    And the fact is Mr. Justice Black that Mr. Fowler stood before this Court at this bar and said that the reason that the company didn't participate at earlier stages of the process was what? 
    That their are local officials knew that if the facts came out and were known, of course the absorption provision of the contract would apply. 
    That's how little fraud there was on the part of the union. 
    The moment the union found out with the facts really work. 
    They invoked that provision for absorption and sandwiching as the company knew they would. 
    Now I suggest that what this record shows that knowing that, the company deliberately concealed the facts from the union so that it would be able to make this kind of a mis -- of a deceit argument.

    A far more significance is the fact that the union probably never hears a lawyer in one of these things. 
    Mr. Previant would know that better than I.

    But to the extent that what is being considered here is the legislative matter of the disposition of these jobs in the future, the only people who have a voice as of right compatibly with the national policy in the disposition of that problem is the representatives of the employers and the unions involved they are engaged in collective bargaining in a classic Burley sentence. 
    They do it to through the grievance procedure all the time particularly and are they entitled to this to the grievance procedure where they provide in the grievance procedure that that's the way they're going to do it when a problem of this kind comes up. 
    The fact that they have a practice that permits interested employees to sit in and listen or to speak up doesn't change the nature of a process from a legislative to a judicial one and it doesn't mean that the union is acting as the advocate of one interest rather than the other
