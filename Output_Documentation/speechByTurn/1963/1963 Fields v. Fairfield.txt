    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Thank you, sir. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    On the facts of this case as I related them yesterday, the question that's presented to the Court now for its decision is whether the appellants' plain right to exercise and enjoy their First Amendment rights of speech and assembly can be suppressed in advance by an injunction, the worst kind of prior restraint. 
    We think it begs the question to talk about this case in terms of the Mine Workers case which was the ostensible basis for the Alabama Supreme Court's injunction decision and we think that it also begs the question to talk about it in terms of the concepts that have flowed from the Mine Workers case such as the jurisdiction -- to determine jurisdiction, void orders, substance of void orders, frivolous void orders and all the rest. 
    We think these are all irrelevant where First Amendment rights are asserted.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Is that beyond limitation for them (Inaudible) not with your case but what do you think of (Inaudible) limitation under the jurisdiction?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="88.239" stopTime="638.425">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    I think that very little is left under the case, Your Honor. 
    The rule of law that we urge the Court to adopt in this case is that essentially, that the First Amendment simply will not tolerate injunctions against political speech and political assembly. 
    Now, in the way this case comes up to this Court, it comes in a novel context. 
    And although it is novel in this case, in -- at this stage of our history, I think it's safe to say that there's been a proliferation of the use of injunctions of this sort, temporary restraining orders against speech and that other cases that raise the same question promised to come before this Court. 
    Now, I think the facts of this case dramatically -- excuse me -- demonstrate why the rule that we urge can and ought to be adopted by this Court. 
    The injunction which the appellants are held to have violated and of which they were convicted was based on three local ordinances of the City of Fairfield and we can discuss this very quickly, I think. 
    Two of them, together, constituted a flat prohibition against the distribution of leaflets, handbills and any other kind of literature in the public streets and in the -- all the public portions of the City of Fairfield. 
    This wasn't a permit requirement which would be unconstitutional on its face as well, this was a flat prohibition and Lovell v. Griffin, Jamison, Talley, all of them, together, make this ordinance unconstitutional on its face indisputably. 
    The other ordinance that was -- that which -- which was the basis for the injunction in this case was one that required a permit from the mayor in order to hold a public meeting. 
    Now, this ordinance, based on the (Inaudible) in Kansas also unconstitutional on its face, clearly so. 
    It has no standards in it as those two cases require, nor have any judicial standards been imported into the case, so it is unconstitutional on its face. 
    Moreover, it's unconstitutional as applied in this case because it was applied not against the meeting that was to be held in a public street or in a public park. 
    It was applied against the meeting that was to be held in a private hall in Fairfield, private hall that had no connection at all with the -- with the municipality. 
    And we assert that the State or local municipality has no power whatsoever to require that a permit be applied for before any individual or any group seeks to hold a meeting in a private auditorium. 
    Although the context is different, it is as if somebody who wanted to hold the political meeting in Carnegie Hall would have to ask for permit from the Mayor of the City of New York or from the police commissioner, I think it's unthinkable. 
    So, the three ordinances that are involved in this case and which were the basis for the injunction or I think without dispute unconstitutional on their faces. 
    The appellee seems to have conceded this and the Government's amicus curiae makes this -- grants likewise. 
    We then come to the injunction which was based on these three indisputably unconstitutional ordinances and I suggest that on the basis of Near versus Minnesota particularly and from other sound constitutional principles from cases in which the questions of reason and been articulated by this Court that it necessarily follows that speech, that political speech, political assembly cannot be enjoined in advance. 
    If any description at all can describe the effect of such an injunction on speech, I think that it must be described as the most pernicious kind of prior restraint and this Court has condemned prior restraints over and over again. 
    Now, this isn't a -- an abstract right that is the right to be able to speech freely without prior restraints because as this Court has said and as many people have recognized over and over again, speech and assembly in our nation is the very foundation of the nation. 
    It is upon the right of speech and assembly that all of our political activity rests. 
    It is upon speech and assembly that the determinations about how society is to be ordered rests and if political speech and political assembly can be enjoined in advance, then I fear that the very firm foundation of the First Amendment will be seriously weakened. 
    I think it's instructive to point out several of the -- several examples which we have in our brief about the way in which the temporary restraining order and injunctions have -- have been invoked in very recent times against speech. 
    And this case, as well as these examples which I set out, I think will persuade the Court that any injunction issued or temporary restraining order issued against speech and assembly can, as Justice Frankfurter said in the Mine Workers case, be treated as if it were nothing other than alluded to the newspaper and can be disregarded with impunity. 
    Now, in our case, the ordinances on which the injunction was based are unarguably unconstitutional. 
    The injunction itself is unarguably unconstitutional as a prior restraint that is based on unconstitutional ordinances. 
    If the face of all this, the Alabama Supreme Court said that the ordinance that the injunction must be obeyed by the appellants in this case and what they were saying in effect was that no matter how unconstitutional the injunction is that these appellants must pay sterile homage and it was nothing more than that to a court order which was not a court order but which was mere usurpation of the court's power. 
    There are other examples, at page 30 in our brief, of temporary restraining orders which courts have in the past year or so all over the country, not merely in Alabama, not merely in the South but in California and New York in which courts have issued temporary restraining orders, ground was temporary restraining orders, to enjoin in two cases which we have cited in our brief at note 15. 
    The distribution of political literature in the California gubernatorial campaign in 1962, one judge issued TRO against the distribution of some literature which suggested that Governor Brown and the other democratic incumbents were sought on communism and another judge issued a restraining order prohibiting the distribution of two pamphlets which were critical of -- of Mr. Nixon. 
    And the TROs were issued before the -- before election day as I understand it they were obeyed and several days after election, each of the complaining parties went into the Court and asked that the TROs be dissolved and they were. 
    And --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="638.425" stopTime="644.956">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What grounds -- on the grounds that they were unconstitutional or the grounds that it was moot? 
    Which was it, do you recall?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="644.956" stopTime="653.817">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    On the grounds that it was moot, Your Honor, I believe. 
    This was -- this were the complainants themselves who went into -- complaints were gotten the TRO went back to court and asked that they be dissolved.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="653.817" stopTime="656.434">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, I see, yes.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="656.434" stopTime="1091.697">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    And in New York, a judge of the New York Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the appearance of Herbert Aptheker at the University of Buffalo on the ground that he was a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party and this was at a forum at University of Buffalo, where such diverse people as Oswald Mosley from England and (Inaudible) Thomas from New York had spoken freely as they probably should. 
    And -- but once they -- when the TRO was issued against Aptheker, he defied to speak. 
    The board of trustees refused to allow him to speak and that case is now on appeal in the New York courts. 
    And there are other cases cited in the footnote and there are cases cited in the NAACP amicus brief which is filed in this case which give other examples of the same kind of use of the temporary restraining order to interfere with constitutionally protected activity. 
    And again, the pernicious thing about it is that in a normal case, as far as I know in every case except this case, the defendants against to whom the TROs run have acquiesced in these because they believe that if they violate them, they will be subject to criminal contempt convictions and will not be able to challenge the constitutionality of the TRO. 
    So that the effect of the proliferation of the use of these kinds of court orders has had a very serious and substantial effect on -- and has impaired the rights of free speech in a wide variety of context. 
    And in the case at bar, although the bill of complaint alleged that the reason that this meeting or to be enjoined was because its purpose was to create tension, ill will disturbances and disorderly conduct between the races and that would be a public nuisance injurious to the health, comfort or welfare of the City of Fairfield and would create a disturbance, incite a riot, et cetera. 
    It just so happens that the evening before this meeting was scheduled, the appellant, National States Rights Party had held another meeting in Fairfield which was perfectly peaceful at which the public attended without any question whatsoever of disorder. 
    And there was no basis in the present bill of complaint for the city to go into court to say that there were -- there was a danger of inciting to riot and disruptions of peace and good order. 
    The fact that they also said it wasn't going to create tension, ill-will, et cetera, is not, of course, by itself any grounds whatsoever upon which to interfere with the speech and the trial court, of course, gave the real reason why this TRO had been issued. 
    He said that, they in that county, “We're going to do everything they could to maintain the status quo.” 
    So they weren't fearful of disorder. 
    They were not fearful of any kind of disorderly conduct. 
    They were just fearful that the status quo was going to be disrupted, but certainly, that's no basis whatsoever on which to enjoin a meeting. 
    Professor Paul Floyd had said in a little excerpt from -- that we have in our brief, he speaks of the chilling effect that injunctions have in First Amendment rights and he says it particularly obtains, if disobedience of the interim order is ipso facto contempt with no opportunity to escape by showing invalidity of the order on its merits. 
    And as I say, there has been a chilling effect on political liberty in the United States because of these TROs in a large number of different cases. 
    And of course, if the appellants here rather than having been enjoined in advance by the Circuit Court had been prosecuted directly under the ordinances which were the basis for the injunction, there's no question whatsoever that if convicted, their convictions would necessarily have been reversed if it were necessary as it may well have been to have brought those criminal cases to this Court. 
    Certainly, since Stau and prior to Stau, they could have tested the constitutionality of these ordinances by violating them and could have raised as a defense in a criminal prosecution the ordinances' unconstitutionality. 
    So, the crux of the denial in this case is that the right to enjoin your First Amendment rights was delayed because I think that that right is an immediate right and that its delay is tantamount to its denial. 
    And that the only way to exercise that right immediately, as one ought to be able to do, is to violate an unconstitutional and oppressive court order, again, as Justice Frankfurter said in order that's no different than a letter to a newspaper, then that route must be allowed. 
    And of course, the appellee speaks about the possibility of disorder or violence or incitement to violence, but that was mere speculation. 
    They -- they had no reason to believe that there was going to be any outbreak of violence, can be based on the meeting held just the previous evening they had every reason to believe that the meeting was going to be perfectly peaceful. 
    So simply by it's asserting that there was a speculative possibility and very remote at that of disorder, they -- they still did not justify at all the issuance of the temporary restraining order.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So there might be that.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="1126.645" stopTime="1417.891">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Yes, my position would still be no different, Your Honor. 
    Of course, the Alabama Supreme Court pointed to -- based their decision upon the decision of Mine Workers, the rule of law enunciated Mine Workers and as we have said, we don't believe that Mine Workers really has anything to do with this case. 
    As Mr. Justice Goldberg has suggested, in re Green last term or the term before, I think it has seriously impaired the authority of that case. 
    And there were earlier cases, the Gas and Coke Workers which we cite in our brief which allowed state injunctions to be -- to be violative. 
    And Mine Workers, of course, is entirely different case because it had to do with the assertion of rights that were -- could be regulated by statute. 
    It concerned a very, very complex problem of statutory interpretation, namely, whether the Norris-La Guardia Act applied in the situation where the Government stood in the role of the employer or owner or what have you and third, of course, it was in the context of an industrial dispute. 
    But we think even in Mine Workers own terms that if this Court is going to give any credence to the -- to the Mine Workers' rule, that of the seven -- that of the nine justices that sat on the case, seven of them recognized that there was such a thing as an order which Mr. Justice Frankfurter called a frivolous void order as opposed to a substantial void order that could be violated with impunity. 
    Seven of the justices said there was such -- such an order. 
    Justices Black and Justice Douglas did not because they didn't think it was right for discussion in that particular case, but if there is any such thing as a frivolously void order, this order is it. 
    It was an order issued upon three unarguably unconstitutional ordinances. 
    It was a prior restraint. 
    It was in the context of the impairment of First Amendments rights which stand high in our social order and whatever assertion of jurisdiction that the Circuit Court made was entirely frivolous. 
    There was no -- there was no question here of his having to -- have time to determine whether he had jurisdiction because it's perfectly clear that he had no jurisdiction whatsoever. 
    And the appellee again suggests that, well, this was alright because if he had followed the orderly appellant procedures, he could've gotten -- he moved to quash in the -- in the Alabama Circuit Court, he could've gotten a -- if his motion to quash was denied and if he took a prompt appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court, he might have had this determination within a minimum, a minimum of 13 days assuming that both courts would decide the -- well, assuming the Alabama Supreme Court had decided the matter off the bench. 
    I suggest there might be more than that, but in any case even if it was a day, this would be 14 days after the meeting was originally scheduled, but even if it were a day, I say that this delay is tantamount to a denial. 
    Our last point is that this is another one of those cases like Thompson v. Louisville and Carter versus Louisiana, where the record is so devoid of evidence that the conviction cannot stand and I think the record speaks so clearly for itself on that point and I spoke to him yesterday when I was reviewing the facts of the case that I will rest on the -- on our brief as well as the Government's brief as amicus curiae. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Burke Marshall
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1417.891" stopTime="1427.866">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Marshall.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1427.866" stopTime="1680.349">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Most of Mr. Wulf's argument in this case raises questions that the Court need consider in this case only if Fields disobeyed the order that was issued by the Circuit Court of Jefferson County. 
    So I would like to address myself to the last point that Mr. Wulf made which is whether or not Fields did disobey the order and so the questions and problems that come up if he did disobey the order whether those are really before the Court. 
    The pleadings in this case alleged that Fields was going to hold a specific public meeting at a certain address in Fairfield on the evening of October 11, 1961 and that that meeting had been announced by bills which were been flammatory nature. 
    It attached the copy of the bill which appears at record pages 3 and 4. 
    The relief that was sought by the complaint which appears at record 3 was to enjoin and restrain the party in Fields from holding the said meeting at said time and place and from distributing said handbills in the City of Fairfield, Alabama. 
    That was the relief sought by the restraining order. 
    The injunction that was issued was in those narrow terms, that appears on pages 5 and 6 of the record and was there a restraining order from -- against Fields from distributing further in the City of Fairfield handbills announcing such meeting until further orders of the court and from holding the meeting as announced. 
    The complaint did also allege not only that ordinances existed in the City of Fairfield prohibiting the distribution of handbills and the holding of the meeting without a permit but also as Mr. Wulf has said that the meeting was among other things calculated to create a disturbance, incite to riot, disturb the peace and disrupt peace in good order in the City of Fairfield. 
    The judgment of contempt that was entered by the District Court, which appears on page 8 of the record, did not make any findings of violation of the specific terms of the order. 
    It -- only findings were in conclusory terms. It did not find that there was a distribution of the handbill covered by the order and it did not find that the meeting was held. 
    What it did find was that Fields and Lyons knew the terms of the injunction and willfully and contemptuously distributed literature and held or attempted to hold said meeting. 
    The opening statements of counsel in the case did not really claim that a violation of the order was involved. 
    The opening statement by Mr. Parsons was that Fields and Lyons came to the vicinity of the place where the meeting was scheduled, contacted the people there about the meeting and distributed literature. 
    It did not refer to having a meeting and it did not refer to the distribution of the handbills.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The -- is that opening statement in the record?
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1682.738" stopTime="1685.781">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    That's on pages 16 and 17 of the record.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1685.781" stopTime="1688.236">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Thank you.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1688.236" stopTime="1879.053">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    The proof consisted of four witnesses and six exhibits. 
    The exhibits were a copy of the Thunderbolt which was the literature referred to and that appears on page 21 of the record, a rifled slug and three shotgun shells which were introduced, though they don't appear to have anything to do with the contempt and a copy of the handbill which was introduced and appears at page 42 of the record. 
    It was admitted, it is admitted, I think, that that handbill was not distributed after the injunction. 
    The witnesses were, first, Chester Poke who is a member of the Fairfield Police Force. 
    He testified that he saw Fields distributing a copy -- copies of the Thunderbolt in the vicinity of the place where the meeting was going to be held about half an hour before it was going to be held. 
    And he testified that Fields was telling the people that were there that the meeting place had been changed to Lipscomb, Alabama which is outside of the jurisdiction of the court that issued this injunction. 
    The arrest, Poke made the arrest, was based on these activities and none other. 
    And in his testimony describing that the – Poke repeated again that Fields told the people there that the meeting had been called off. 
    He also testified that there was no trouble and no literature distributed except the Thunderbolt. 
    The next witness was another policeman who had arrested Lyons, his name is Mithso. 
    He testified that he was there at the time before the meeting was to be held that Lyons was passing out copies of the Thunderbolt. 
    Someone called an officer. 
    He went across the street and arrested Lyons. 
    The officer hadn't read the Thunderbolt at that time, Thunderbolt's in the record, Thunderbolt does not refer to the meeting at all and that's the only thing that was distributed. 
    Mithso testified that there was no meeting. 
    The next witness was, Clyde Morris, a member of the Bazemore Police who were called into assist. 
    He served the injunction on Fields and informed Fields that he could not have the meeting. 
    He was present at the scene where the meeting was supposed to take place, but the only testimony he had about that was that there was a crowd there which included 15 -- 12 to 15 officers of the Bazemore Police Force. 
    Fields later testified, at page 49 of the record, that there were 40 to 50 police officers there. 
    The final witness was Charles Wood.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1879.053" stopTime="1881.452">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How large was the crowd, did he say?
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="1881.452" stopTime="2050.072">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    He did not say, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    He said a good crowd but he did not estimate it. 
    I think Fields testified that he passed out about 12 copies of the Thunderbolt and as I said that there were 40 policemen there, sizeable crowd in itself. 
    Woods was a member of the Fairfield Police, testified that he saw the arrest, nothing more about the activities of Fields that he'd searched the car nearby and found these shells and about 100 copies of the Thunderbolt in the car. 
    He did not see Fields do anything and Mithso and Woods were recalled to identify this -- the car that was searched as one in which Fields had been seen. 
    That was the total of the prosecution evidence. 
    There was no evidence that the meeting was held. 
    There was no evidence the handbills were distributed. 
    There was no evidence that Fields said anything to anyone except that the meeting had been moved to Lipscomb. 
    There was no evidence that Lyons did anything at all except pass out copies of the Thunderbolt. 
    The defense called four witnesses. Smithson who is Mayor of Fairfield, Fields, Mrs. Fields and a man named “Short”, who testified that he had gone to the -- to a meeting at Lipscomb that night after having been informed that the meeting place had been changed, that's at page 60 of the record. 
    In summation, this evidence, defense evidence, the prosecution evidence didn't prove any elements of the contempt that was charged. 
    The defense evidence did not advance the cause of the prosecution. 
    The mayor testified nothing about what happened at the place of the meeting except that he did not know whether or not handbills were distributed. 
    Fields testified that there was no meeting, that he went to the place of the meeting only to change the location. 
    He was not permitted in. 
    They were surrounded by police officers but he did not intend to violate the order and that no handbills had been distributed after the order was issued. 
    Mrs. Fields confirmed that.

speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="2143.202" stopTime="2244.051">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Mr. Justice White, the meeting that was enjoined is the meeting that was called by handbill. 
    The handbill appears at page 3 and 4 of the record. 
    A meeting that is held solely to call off that meeting I say is not covered by the injunction whether you call it a meeting or not. 
    The trial court did not find any evidence of the distribution of handbills at all. 
    In fact, it said that there was no evidence, page 72 of the record, “While there is no evidence that pamphlet was redistributed, the writ of injunction says distribute further handbills announcing such meetings as were distributed.” 
    Then he referred to the copy of the Thunderbolt which is in the record and which does not refer to the meeting at all said that he was impressed by the tone and the context of the paper that was admittedly distributed and I simply think that was an artifice on the part of someone to bring home a fact that the meeting was going to be held. 
    Now, the trial court found that despite the fact that the only evidence was that Fields, when he distributed these copies of the Thunderbolt which did not refer to a meeting, the only evidence was that when he did that, he told the people he distributed to them that the meeting had been called off, it's going to be held in Lipscomb, Alabama where he had permission from the mayor to hold the meeting in public park. 
    And as I say that he -- one of the witnesses for the defense testified that he went over there to go to the meeting that was held.

    Lipscomb was beyond the jurisdiction of this Court though.

    The Supreme Court of Alabama did not review the evidence as such. 
    It did indicate in its opinion that it thought that there was evidence -- that there -- that there is evidence to support the finding that they did violate the terms of the temporary injunction, but they did not discuss what evidence that was and they said -- in saying that the Court does not review questions of fact but only questions of law. 
    I take it by that that the Supreme Court of Alabama, in fact, applied the Thompson Rule itself and came to conclusion contrary to the one that I urge on this Court. 
    The rest of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama is concerned with the question of whether or not Fields had a right to test the validity of the order by disobeying it under the United Mine Workers case. 
    The short of the matter, may it please the Court, is that I think this record conclusively shows that there was no evidence at all that either Fields or Lyons did what they were enjoined from doing and that on the contrary, the evidence is all the other way that they obeyed the injunction.

speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="2746.591" stopTime="2777.654">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    That's correct, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    Particularly since the evidence not only shows that there was no meeting held but that he told people he rescheduled it for another place whether it wasn't enjoined. 
    It wasn't just that he met there and -- and sort had made a speech and passed out the handbills outside the building instead of inside.

    The Bazemore police officer who was there, who was named Morris, testified that there were 12 or 15 officers from Bazemore, that's at record page 28.

    Mr. Frank B. Parsons 
    I appreciate that, Your Honor. 
    Yes. 
    The -- the other question was whether or not there is sufficient evidence to uphold the conviction of -- of contempt -- of the finding of contempt. 
    Now, in that -- in connection with that, it's my contention and our position that the Court must take into consideration the whole of this thing. 
    We ask you to consider and considering that question, the handbill that had been handed out, the handbill that precipitated this action of the city. 
    Now, if -- if Your Honors will examine that handbill, you will see it has already been classified as a -- that it is a highly inflammatory and objectionable piece of paper. 
    It was handed out indiscriminately in our city. 
    It -- it worried, it frightened our officials and they -- they took this action. 
    Now, Fields in his testimony said that this handbill accurately reflected the tone of the meeting that was called on a handbill, that it accurately reflected the approach that would be taken to the subjects to be discussed at the meeting announced by the handbill. 
    Now, it's true enough that they came or Fields came, he didn't send someone else, he came himself after having been served with the injunction, he came himself and Lyons came who was an employee of the -- of the National States Rights Party and just shortly prior to the meeting, he mixed or -- or mingled with the crowd within among the crowd, spoke to them as he says telling them that the meeting was to be at another place over in Lipscomb, other city in the Bazemore cutoff and he handed out the Thunderbolt. 
    Now, let's go to this question of how many people were there. 
    Chief Morris says as -- as the Attorney General says that -- Mr. Marshall says that there was a large crowd across the street. 
    This crowd was across the street. 
    If you examine the testimony of the officers who testified, the officers say, “across the street.” 
    The officers were on the side where the building was. 
    The crowd was across the street. 
    I don't want you to get the impression that there were only 52 people there. 
    Mr. -- Mr. Fields -- Dr. Fields handed out 12 Thunderbolts himself, Mr. Lyons was also is handing out Thunderbolts. 
    There is nothing in the record to say how many he handed out, but he handed out those Thunderbolts. 
    Now, the Thunderbolt is filled with the same venom, the same agitation, the same of invitation to disorder and riot of that was foretold in the handbill.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Of course.
speaker="frank_b_parsons" startTime="3234.755" stopTime="3451.941">
    Mr. Frank B. Parsons 
    It's our holding that the Court is not going to depart from the principle that an injunction issued by a court having general jurisdiction with equity powers in which your -- they're -- jurisdictions has been aroused or raised by a proper application and in which the parties are before the Court and the subject matter is before the Court that the Court is not -- this Court is not going to see it in such an event that the persons served with the injunction and against to whom the injunction or is -- is directed don't have to in -- or to obey the injunction if they believe in their minds that it -- that the -- the thing enjoined or the act of injunction or the -- the laws out of what the injunction comes are unconstitutional or affect their First Amendment rights or any other rights. 
    To us, that is a dangerous proposition that is urged upon the Court here because to us, it appears that you are then saying to each man or each person, you be the judge of whether or not -- of what is the law. 
    And of course, this Court has reserved to itself the question of what is the law and to say to a person that he or she may decide for himself what is the law is to an effect, make no law. 
    To carry that reasoning on, the criminal might say, “Well, this criminal law in its -- in this particular situation that I find myself is inapplicable to me and I will go ahead and break the law.” 
    We have anarchy but we have no law. 
    Now, this -- the -- the Supreme Court of Alabama, in deciding this case or -- or decided it on the basis of the Mine Workers case. 
    It also decided, as was mentioned here, on the proposition that this is a certiorari. 
    It was -- the matter was before them on certiorari, that in certiorari, it would only go into the question of law, the question of the jurisdiction of a court. 
    Of course that involved a question of whether or not there were sufficient facts to uphold the finding of -- of contempt and the Court said that in its judgment there was. 
    So I want to point out to you to Your Honors, to the Court here that the finding of the Alabama Supreme Court which is appealed to this Court was based on these two propositions of general law and not upon a proposition involving a federal question, either of interpretation of the Federal Constitution or the interpretation of federal statutes. 
    And that -- therefore, under the authority of Lee versus Thomas, Lee versus Thomas which said that the general well settled rule is that the case coming from a State -- any case coming from a state court, the Supreme Court can consider only federal questions and it can entertain -- it cannot entertain the case unless the decision was against the -- the plaintiff and they are on these questions. 
    And that is further been applied in cases where it was said that if -- if the finding of the Court is based upon several propositions of one of which is a proposition of general law not involving a federal question and if that proposition standing alone which supports the finding of the Court and that this Court would not entertain the question. 
    We suggest that that -- for that reason, the Court should leave the findings of the Supreme Court of Alabama and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama where it is. 
    Now, we further urge --

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    May it please the Court. 
    There's only one point that I would like to discuss very briefly and that is the last one raised about the adequate state ground. 
    Of course, I understand that doctrine of preliminary to determination whether a state ground is adequate, and whether it's independent of the federal ground and I think it's very plain here that this is not the case and with the Court's opinion last term in Fay versus Noia discussed this at some length in a different kind -- different but related context and Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion that said while the Court is deferred to state absolute grounds so long as they're are not taking evasively discriminatory against federal rights. 
    And sometimes it's used to differ a state procedure ground only because they made burdens in the vindication of federal rights and I think that's applied with the case here that the so-called rule of state law has -- plays such a heavy burden on the assertion of federal rights that it simply cannot be brought up in terms of being either independent or adequate state ground.

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Well, if there was a wrong route, then there were no other routes, as I understand it, Mr. Justice Harlan. 
    I don't -- well, what the Alabama Supreme Court said was that they -- under its certiorari procedure it would only undertake to review the law and not the facts. And they said that this would also include the question of whether the particular order appealed from was void on its face. 
    And I think, it could have examined the -- the question that I'm raising here under its certiorari procedure because -- because we're claiming that it was void on its face. 
    But as I understand the Alabama procedure in a matter like this, if it isn't certiorari -- they -- they were saying that in effect was that they couldn't really raise any substantive questions at all on the -- on the certiorari proceeding (Inaudible) to review a criminal contempt (Voice Overlap).

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    It's -- it's to say -- the Alabama Supreme Court did quote from its own opinion in NAACP versus Alabama without noting that it had been reversed. 
    But I think that is somewhat different because what this Court said in NAA versus Alabama was that this was a rule of law in the civil contempt context that the NAA case came up and -- that had never before been applied and that the petitioner there had been adequately forewarned. 
    I can only repeat what I've already said that the appellees, City of Fairfield's claim that all they were doing here was trying to maintain the peace and good order of the City of Fairfield is hardly -- is no justification whatsoever for the suppression of the meeting which is at issue here and the right of the appellants to exercise and enjoy their First Amendment rights.
