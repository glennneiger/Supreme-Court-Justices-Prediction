    Mr. W. M. Sutton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    As I was pointing out yesterday, we have involved here two touchable transactions, I say, involved here. 
    We only have one involved and that is the estate tax on the estate of Lowell Stapf. 
    The other taxable event or transaction that will give rise to taxes would be the gift by Mrs. Stapf to the trustees of a portion of -- for community property as a result of her election. 
    That would be subject to such gift taxes as -- or imposed by the gift tax statute. 
    So -- but that is not what we are here concerned with, it's not involved in this case and it's not an issue. 
    We have only the issue of the estate taxes in the estate of Lowell Stapf. 
    Now, of course, prior to 1942 and since 1948, the community property States, only the one-half share of the community property of a decedent is included in his estate for estate tax purposes, that is the -- the share and part of the community property of the decedent. 
    Of course, during the period from 1942 to 1948, the entire community property, both halves, was subject to a federal -- estate tax. 
    Now, in 1948, the marital deduction provision was adopted to the remedy and the situation that existed and put all estates on a parity. 
    In that, there would be only one-half of the property tax either in a community property State or in a non-community property State to the extent that the property passed from the deceased spouse to the surviving spouse. 
    Now -- and that was put in by putting in the marital deduction.

    It's free of tax?

    Beg your pardon?

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Marital deduction is free?
speaker="w_m_sutton" startTime="183.184" stopTime="549.694">
    Mr. W. M. Sutton 
    It is deductible, yes. 
    In determining the estate tax, it is deducted just like administration expenses or funeral expenses or debts and claims. 
    It is deducted to the extent of one-half of the adjusted gross estate. 
    Now, the adjusted gross estate, to determine that, you take the total estate both halves in the community, deduct from it all community property, makes other adjustments for administration expenses. 
    And the substance of -- roughly, what you come out with, the adjusted gross estate is that -- is -- in a community property State, only the property that is a separate property of the spouse. 
    Now, in a non-community property State, you do not have that -- you do not have that limitation. 
    It's amounts to the same thing because it's one-half of the gross estate, adjusted gross estate that is the limit of the deduction. 
    Now, that was adopted. 
    The marital deduction was passed in 1948 to equalize the community property States and the non-community property States by allowing this deduction of one-half. 
    The -- what we're concerned here with today is the value of the property that passed from Mr. Stapf to Mrs. Stapf. 
    For a property to qualify for the marital deduction, there are several things that must occur. 
    First, the property -- the -- or value which is to be deducted and qualified for the marital deduction, it must be included in the estate of the decedent. 
    That's the first requirement. 
    The second requirement is that the property must pass from the decedent to his surviving spouse. 
    Of course, there are other limitations such as the terminable requirement but we're not concerned with that because the property that passed to Mrs. Stapf, passed to her absolutely -- excuse me. 
    In Mr. Stapf's estate, he owned real property in the City of Amarillo, value that $65,000. 
    He also owns some hand properties described in the will, his hand tools, value at $100. 
    He owned one-half interest in community property of a total value of $258,000 that is, both halves of the community. 
    Now, the hand tools passed out of the picture because they were -- it was subject of a special request. 
    Then he left to Mrs. Stapf one-third of the gross estate, both separate property and community property and put her to an election to take under the will or not to take under the will. 
    So, one-third interest in this real property valued at $65,000 passed to Mrs. Stapf under the will, that's the separate property. 
    Additionally, she took or retained a one-third interest in the total community estate, both halves. 
    Now, there is no question about the separate property being included in Mr. Stapf's estate and being subject to estate taxes. 
    There is no question but what the one-third interest in this separate property passed to Mrs. Stapf. 
    It passed to her absolutely, so you'll have the first two requirements under the gift tax -- under the marital deduction statute. 
    Then you come to a question of determining how much is to be deducted in determining the estate that is subject to estate taxes. 
    Now, we submit that the full $22,000 or one-third of the $65,000 is deductible under the statute. 
    It's by virtue of a regulation of the Commissioner that it is claimed that the property so passing to Mrs. Stapf cannot be valued at its full value for the purpose of the deduction.

    No, sir. 
    We take the position of the regulation is invalid. 
    It is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="559.818" stopTime="566.435">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I repeat my question. 
    You concede that the regulation, that the words of the regulation cover the facts of this case?
speaker="w_m_sutton" startTime="566.435" stopTime="1006.409">
    Mr. W. M. Sutton 
    Yes, it -- it's designed and directed at the -- at this. 
    The -- of course, the trial court and the Court of Appeals both held the regulation to be invalid and an extension beyond the statute. 
    Now, turning -- turning to the -- the statute itself, 812 (e) (1) (E) (ii) is the part of the statute that refers to the valuation of the property that passes here. 
    It says, "Where -- where an interest or a property is incumbered or any manner -- in any manner or whether the surviving spouse incurs an obligation imposed by the decedent with the respect to the passing of such interest, such incumbrance or obligation shall be taken into the account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to such spouse of such interest were being determined." 
    Now, we have here a question of determining the amount that is passing. 
    Mr. Barnett puts emphasis on the words to such spouse. 
    But that is not the subject matter of the section of the statute. 
    It is the amount that presses. 
    Now, the regulation has a specific provision in it that deals with a community property estate that is section -- Regulation 81.47c. 
    After referring to an interest that is subject to a mortgage or other incumbrance, they say the passing of a property interest subject to the imposition of an obligation by the decedent does not include a bequest, devise, or transfer in lieu of bower, curtesy, or other statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy or other marital rights in the decedent property or estate. 
    Then, specifically directed out of community property State, the regulation says, "The passing of a property interest subject to the imposition of an obligation by the decedent does not include a bequest in lieu of the interest of his surviving spouse under the community property laws unless such interest was immediately deprived of the decedent's death a mere expectancy. 
    Now, that is -- that regulation is directed particularly toward community property States. 
    Under its language, it would apply, as far as the language is concern, only in a community property State. 
    In answer to the question that was asked yesterday as to whether or not this problem could rise in a non-community property State, I'll say that it cannot arise except where the surviving spouse has property of her own over which she has control except for the property of her own and can dispose of it by will gift for the other one. 
    As in other words, that's -- it would be something that would occur in other States but only where the wife has property of her own is subject to her control. 
    Now, the question here is the amount of the property that passes and it is to be determined as if a gift was being made -- being valued for gift purposes. 
    Now, the Commissioner takes the position that what Mrs. Stapf gave to her children should be offset against what she received in determining the benefit from her. 
    Now, there are two things wrong with that. 
    In the first place, if that is allowed to zero out the value of the property that passed under the estate tax, you're going to be subjecting that property to two estate taxes, one, when Mr. Stapf died and the other, when Mrs. Stapf dies. 
    That is contrary to the expressed purpose and intent of the adoption of the marital deduction provision. 
    So, if -- if the Government's position is maintained, you'll be taxing this property, this separate property of Mr. Stapf. 
    You'll be taxing it for estate tax purposes twice. 
    Once in Mr. Stapf's estate and again, when Mrs. Stapf dies. 
    There is one other fault and trouble with that. 
    Actually, what she would be -- what the Government is saying should be done is that a tax should be levied upon what Mrs. Stapf gives to her children. 
    Now, if that is subject to any tax at all, and we don't deny that it is that it's a gift and it's subject to such gift taxes as are applicable to it. 
    Alright. 
    If it is a taxable gift, it is taxable at gift tax rates. 
    Yet, if you take that value and put it over in the estate, you're going to be taxing that gift, not at gift tax rates but at estate tax rates and subjecting it not to a gift tax but subjecting it to estate tax in Mr. Stapf's estate. 
    Contrary, we submit to the clear intent purpose and language of the marital deduction provision.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1006.409" stopTime="1012.544">
    Justice Potter Stewart

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1022.253" stopTime="1023.430">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    More -- more of a difference, is that it?
speaker="w_m_sutton" startTime="1023.430" stopTime="1026.976">
    Mr. W. M. Sutton 
    More difference in the lower brackets but in the higher brackets it is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1026.976" stopTime="1029.327">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    All the way to the gift tax rates are lower, of course.
speaker="w_m_sutton" startTime="1029.327" stopTime="1727.416">
    Mr. W. M. Sutton 
    That's right. 
    Now, the -- the statute says that you're going to tax this and determine the value as if in the same manner, as if the amount of a gift to such federal of -- of an interest was being (Inaudible). 
    Now, when you go to the value of the property for gift tax passing from a donor to a donee, you tax that at its market value. 
    It's full value. 
    Now, of course, there is a provision in the gift tax statute that authorizes if it's purchased for a bona fide consideration, it's taxed only to the extent of the above the amount for which it has given. 
    Now, this Court decided some years ago in the Wemyss case, I take it that's the way you pronounce it, W-E-M-Y-S-S, that a -- in valuing a gift from a donor to another person, that only a consideration moving back to the donor and measured in money or money's worth, was to be deducted. 
    In that instance, in that instance, the donor gave to his intended bride certain stocks in consideration of her agreement to marry. 
    As a result of her marriage, she gave up a beneficial interest in a trust that had been created for her by her former husband. 
    So, when they got ready to determine the value of the gift from the husband to his intended bride, it was the taxpayer's contention that what she gave up should be offset against what she received to determine the value of the gift. 
    But this Court held that that was not the situation. 
    That it had to be a consideration passing to the donor and measured in money or money's worth. 
    And therefore, the value of the stock that passed from the donor to his intended bride was to be valued at its full market value. 
    Now, the Court held that the mere deposition to the donee didn't satisfy the requirements of the gift statute. 
    Now, that is the statute obviously that Congress is referring to in the adoption of the marital deduction provision and the provision where it says that it shall be determined as if a gift was and if an amount of the gift was being determined. 
    That was the basis of the holding of the trial court and that was the basis to the holding of the Court of Civil Appeals in this case relying upon the Wemyss case. 
    Now, we have that kind of situation here because when Mrs. Stapf elected to take under the will and therefore, surrendered a part of her property to the trustees for the benefit of her children, there was nothing that passed from her back to the donor or -- or the testator in this case, Mr. Stapf. 
    It was a benefit that passed from her to a third party and not a consideration that moved from her back to the donor. 
    So, the Wemyss case would certainly require the valuation of the interest that passed from Mr. Stapf to Mrs. Stapf under the will at its full market value. 
    That's the only question we have is how to value this property of the passed. 
    There's no question about what it passed and qualifies in every other respect for the marital deduction. 
    Now, when Mrs. Stapf elected to take under the will, her half of the community property did not go back to or become a part of the estate of Mr. Stapf or subject to estate taxes in his estate for gift tax purposes. 
    There is a GCM ruling on that that has been in effect for many years that where a widow is put to an election, her property, her half of the community does not become a part of the community of the decedent for estate tax purposes. 
    So, that property passed to -- passed to third parties and it's not included into the estate -- estate tax purposes. 
    Now, the Government takes the position that the election was an obligation, I mean the provision in the will requiring Mrs. Stapf to exercise an election, was an obligation imposed upon by the decedent with respect to the passing of this interest under the statute. 
    We submit that the word "obligation", as there used, refers to an obligation in the nature of a -- in the incumbrance or a charge upon the specific property that passes under the will. 
    We think that the Senate Report and the House Report explaining this provision makes that clear that it is an obligation or a charge that is on the property itself. 
    And since this is not a charge upon this particular property, it is not an obligation within the meaning of the statute. 
    We think that the Senate Report upon -- upon that point makes it clear. 
    And the trial court concurred with us in that view. 
    The Court of Appeals didn't reach the question on whether or not the obligation was in -- in the nature of a charge upon the specific property, because the Court of Appeals concluded that under the direction in the statute that the amount of the gift be determined as if a -- I mean amount of the property passing, qualifying for the marital deduction, would be determined as if a gift were being made. 
    And that therefore, they did not find it necessary to reach and decide the question of the obligation because they thought the question was concluded and decided by the Wemyss case. 
    The Wemyss case has been followed and report that we're contending for here, is illustrated in some tax court decisions. 
    The Bartman case, it has a situation parallel to what we have involved. 
    Now, in the petition for writ of certiorari and in the brief, counsel for the petitioner puts emphasis upon what he says would be a loss of revenue if the opinion of the Court's -- Circuit Court of Appeals is followed. 
    The Circuit Court recognized that under the decision in Segal versus Commissioner by one of the Circuit Court of Appeals that in valuing the gift for gift tax purposes that passed from Mrs. Stapf to the children that she was entitled to deduct the amount that she gave up being her one-sixth part of the community estate or the difference between one-third and one-half which she would've had, had she elected to take against the will. 
    If that be true and the Segal case had been followed in a number of several other cases by the tax court, even if that be true, that is no reason for imposing an estate tax where the statute does not impose estate tax.

    Well, it will be deducted under the marital deduction and there will be no estate tax paid in his estate. 
    But when she does, that property will still be in her estate, assuming she had disposed of it and it will be subject to estate tax at that time.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="1795.494" stopTime="1801.344">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Counsel, do you assume that the property (Inaudible)
speaker="w_m_sutton" startTime="1801.344" stopTime="2125.478">
    Mr. W. M. Sutton 
    Of course, of course. 
    I think the -- that assumption is made in the marital deduction and the whole theory of it is to put it in two piles and tax half of it in the first estate. 
    And then if anything is left, tax it in the -- in the second estate. 
    No, I -- I -- that is just an assumption, of course, if you -- for me, necessary to there, of course. 
    But it will be subject to a one -- it will be subject to one estate tax, that property and not two which would be the situation if the Government's position is sustained. 
    Now, whatever -- whatever are the tax consequences for gift taxes and how much gift taxes Mrs. Stapf owes on her gift is, as I say, another matter, it's not here involved. 
    We have here the valuation of the property passing from Mr. Stapf's estate. 
    It qualifies in every way for the marital deduction. 
    In that, it is a part of his estate and it passed from him to her the value -- to be valued as if a gift were being made and it's not the benefit to the donee but it is the amount of the gift that passes. 
    The Wemyss case, we think, requires that this property valued -- be valued at its full value. 
    Now, turning to the question of the deductibility of the debts and expenses of administration, the estate tax statute allows as deductions funeral expenses, administration expenses and claims against the estate as or allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction under which the estate is being administered. 
    Now, under such a statute, you are not going to get uniformity in deductions because the deductions are determined by the state laws. 
    So you're going to have a -- a divergence. 
    We have cited in our brief a number of instances in community property States where funeral expenses are -- or administration expenses are allowed in the -- in -- entirely in some States and in others, only one-half. 
    So, you don't get uniformity and it's not to be expected in deductions in the federal -- estate tax because of the difference of the different state law. 
    Now, in Texas, in the absence of a will provision, only one-half of the administration expenses in a community property -- in a community estate are deducted in the, as I say, in the absence of a will provision. 
    Now, will provisions whereby a decedent assumes all of the expenses, all of the funeral charges are valid and have been recognized as making those expenses deductible or claims, deductible in their entirety where the will so provides. 
    That's been holding at least in the couple of tax court cases and those are the only cases that have been able to find on it is two tax court cases holding, except in the Court of Appeals, I believe it's for the Ninth Circuit, Lang versus Commissioner recognizes the right, although they didn't there apply it because the -- that's -- didn't qualified under other provisions of the statute that a will provision can change the debts and administration expenses from being charged partly to the -- to the survivor and partly to the decedent and can be assumed by the decedent in his will.

    Well, if you wish to qualify it in that manner, it could be in a sense -- that's true.

    And in any sense, in any sense that is -- what you asked is certainly true. 
    Whatever the children got, they got $16,000 more than -- had she elected to take against the will and kept her own money and dispose of it as she wanted to at a later term. 
    That is correct.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2622.315" stopTime="2627.445">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Yes.
speaker="w_m_sutton" startTime="2627.445" stopTime="2998.733">
    Mr. W. M. Sutton 
    Now, the point here is upon the -- the marital -- on these debts and claims. 
    The Court of Appeals did not hope that all debts should be deducted from estate by a virtue of the provision in the will, I mean, it should be deducted in the determining estate taxes by a virtue of provision in the will, for the reason that the statute, authorizing these deductions, says, with respect to claim, that it maybe deducted only with respect to the -- the -- where there is a consideration in money or money's worth. 
    Now, the debts and claims in this instance are in the main if not totally debts that arose by operation of law. 
    Now, a claim to be deducted has to be a claim that is based upon a -- and based upon a promise, can be deducted only to the extent that the consideration was received in adequate consideration. 
    Therefore, where you have a community debt, you would only deduct one-half of it under this statute even under our position as -- and under the holding of the Court of Appeals because a community debt is chargeable to equal -- to each half of the community and so you would only include one-half of the community property or interest in that estate of the decedent that first died and so you would only deduct and charge -- I mean, you would deduct only one-half of the -- of the debts that are founded upon a promise and consideration. 
    The -- that fact alone will prevent there being the opportunity for a person as to -- to manipulate the debts and liabilities to where it would zero out property or as far as estate tax purpose is concerned. 
    That was a matter of concern to Judge Wisdom in his dissenting opinion that illustrates -- it was used in the petition for certiorari. 
    But when you read the Circuit Court's opinion in light of the consideration required, the situation or illustration given where a person owned a million dollars and went out and bargain another million dollars and then took the $200,000 or two million dollars and bought two million dollars worth of stock and then the husband assumed all of the indebtedness and this property supposed to -- to pass tax free, it doesn't -- it doesn't work out that way, the mathematics doesn't work out that way because only one-half of that debt would be deductible in the husband's estate, so you would have -- you have half a million dollars -- they originally had a million dollars from "inde" and they bought another million dollar worth of stock, wait a minute, they had bought two million dollars worth of stock, so there'd be a million dollars under this example that would subject to tax in the estate and you would have a deduction of only half of the indebtedness or $500,000 and so, there is not the chance of tax avoidance that is feared in the deduction of the statute. 
    Now, in conclusion, let me say on the marital deduction that we have only the amount of the property that passes, the only question of valuation. 
    Government counsel says that that just got a zero value simply because she gave away the property. 
    Now, we are not concerned here with the benefit to her but the question is what are we going to tax in Mr. Stapf's estate?

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    As to the other reasons for reversal, I have a -- a few comments. 
    First, the mathematics of the marital -- the mathematics of the marital deduction, a question, assuming that the assumption of the debt is to be treated as a legacy, the question raised by Justice Harlan and Justice White. 
    They're actually very simple. 
    The figures I used yesterday to state for bargain made by the will, started with the net figure of $111,000 as the wife's share of the property. 
    That was after the deduction of the debts and expenses. 
    Now, starting with the gross value of her share of the community property and restating in the bargain in those terms, the bargain that is offered by the will would be this. 
    You have $129,000 worth of community property, gross community property, $129,000. 
    If you will convey all but $85,000 of that, let's say, you convey $44,000 of that to the trust for the children, I would do two things. 
    I will give you $22,000 worth of my property and I will also pay $18,000 worth of your debts and expenses. 
    Therefore, if you will give to the children $44,000, I will give you the benefit of $40,000, so she still comes out $4000 down.I hope that's clear.

    Well, his argument -- there's a double tax here because the husband gave her a specific piece of property, blackacre, and blackacre is going to be in her estate and be taxed in her estate. 
    Now, we accept the assumption he makes that what she receives will remain her estate. 
    I think that's a valid assumption to make these purposes. 
    But problem is -- or the blackacre will be in her estate.Securities of the same value are now out of her estate, so it washes out and what the estate tax taxes is economic value, it's not -- not specific pieces of property, blackacre or stock, and it is -- she gets a deduction but his estate gets deduction only for transfer of economic values to -- to the wife and here there was no such transfer.

    That's right. 
    Of -- of the $26,000 that ends up in the children's trust. 
    We say that $22,000 of that came from the estate indirectly by the exchange but it came from the estate and should be subject to estate tax. 
    The additional $4000 was the wife's contribution and she is liable for gift tax on that amount. 
    Thank you very much.
