    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Loeb.
speaker="stanley_e_loeb" startTime="15.425" stopTime="214.398">
    Mr. Stanley E. Loeb 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    Mr. Brumfield has stated the facts of the case and I would like to pick up in the discussion of the Dick versus New York Life Insurance Company decision, which as Mr. Justice Goldberg pointed out, has left open the question of whether the sufficiency of evidence is -- could be measured by state law or by federal law. 
    That might be an open question but in the same decision, there is found the falsity of statement that under the area rule, presumptions and burden of proof in the diversity case are substantive in the matters of state law. 
    And the law of Louisiana, the substantive law of Louisiana presumes that a motorist or everybody else obeys the law. 
    There is no presumption of negligence, presumption as it -- just to the contrary. 
    And the decisions of our Supreme Court are clear that in a case of this kind predicated on Article 2315 of our Civil Code which is cited on the first page of respondent's brief in a footnote puts upon the plaintiff the burden of proof of all the elements necessary to establish liability. 
    In a case like this where there was no witness to the accident, the first element of proof is that this -- the defendant was a party to the accident. 
    And the second element, which had -- the defendant was negligent. 
    Now, this case, after the jury found for the plaintiff was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and Chief Judge -- then Chief Judge Hutcheson wrote the opinion for the Court. 
    And he carefully avoided reference to any State decision in arriving at the conclusion that the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdict, number one. 
    And second, that the record was literally thought with reversible error. 
    Apparently, the reversible error question is not before Your Honors. 
    It was not raised in petitioner's brief and I comment it in respondent's brief, that such was the case on page 14. 
    I -- the comment is made that petitioner has not discussed in her brief the holding of the Court of Appeals on the first appeal that there was reversible error. 
    But --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="214.398" stopTime="216.825">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But that would be before us anyhow, would it not?
speaker="stanley_e_loeb" startTime="216.825" stopTime="747.796">
    Mr. Stanley E. Loeb 
    I believe so. 
    I believe it's before you. 
    Perhaps I used the wrong word Mr. Justice Black. 
    It's before you, the whole case is before you but I meant that the issue hasn't been raised in petitioner's -- either petition or in their brief in this particular case. 
    The problem now seems to be directed toward the mandate of the Court of Appeals in the first appeal. 
    And it is as Mr. Brumfield has pointed out a most unusual mandate. 
    And it seems to me that this Court's attention was attracted by the mandate in its respect to the Seventh Amendment. 
    With the permission of the Court, I will read the mandate." 
    Because however, evidence as distinguished from rumor and speculation as to the why and how of the death of plaintiff-decedent and as to the responsibility of the defendant for it, may have been or maybe discovered. 
    We order the judgment reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter a judgment for defendant. 
    Unless plaintiff, within a time and under considerations to be fixed by the district judge, makes a satisfactory showing that on another trial, evidence of sufficient probative force to justify submission of the case to the jury will be open. 
    In which case, the judgment shall be for a new trial." 
    So what the Court of Appeals did was to remand the case to the District Court to allow the plaintiff to make out to the satisfaction of the district judge, with Judge Wright, that on another trial she could produce evidence of sufficient probative force -- force to take the case to the jury. 
    Now, what happened was, plaintiff timely filed an appropriate motion for a new trial and in support of that motion and on the order of the District Court, some nine or 10 depositions were taken including the depositions of some of the witnesses who had testified on the trial. 
    In addition to that, there was an ex parte report from an accident technician or purported accident technician which was all submitted to Judge Wright. 
    Judge Wright considered the motion and the evidence submitted in support of the motion in light of the mandate and ruled that there was nothing in the evidence submitted in support of the mandate to -- to support the conclusion that on another trial there would be probative evidence that could go to the jury. 
    Therefore, he refused the new trial. 
    Plaintiff asked for a rehearing and the rehearing was granted. 
    The argument was heard. 
    And if the Court please, that was when I came into the case. 
    My predecessor, who is Mr. Robert G. Hughes, was elected to the bench after the case was tried and after the case was argued and after the Fifth Circuit had ruled on it. 
    And I came into the case when he was elevated to the state bench and picked it up at the second -- at the first rehearing, the second argument on the motion for a new trial before Judge Wright. 
    Judge Wright again considered and refused a new trial. 
    Thereupon, plaintiff appealed again to the Court of Appeals seeking review and getting review of Judge Wright's rulings. 
    That case was argued to a panel of the Court and a few weeks thereafter, counsel were notified that the panel would submit it to the whole court en banc and additional briefs could be submitted, that was done and the whole Court considered the matter and rendered the opinion in the second appeal affirming Judge Wright's refusal of a new trial by a divided court, five-to-four with Chief Judge Reeves filing a dissent. 
    In his dissent, it's leveled with the Seventh Amendment and that raises in my mind the notion that that is the crux of this case whether the mandate, the original mandate, has done violence to the Seventh Amendment, because I know this Court is busy and has not concerned itself with the particular facts of a particular diversity suit. 
    But the -- the Seventh Amendment feature of the case is the important one as I see it. 
    Now, in the Slocum case, this Court speaking through Mr. Justice Van Devanter said in 19 -- I think 1930 that, "Everything of a phiso -- philosophical nature concerning the Seventh Amendment which could be said at that time had been said. 
    And there was little to be added to it. 
    That the Seventh Amendment restricted the scope of appellate review to the -- that is in -- in federal court, to the common law as it existed in 1791, which interpreted means that where the suf -- insufficiency of the evidence is grounds for a reversal. 
    The Court could grant a new trial and nothing more." 
    That was the rule of common law in effect in 1791. 
    Now, it is quite apparent that the mandate which I just read does not order a new trial, nor does it deprive the plaintiff of their rights guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment because in the case of Gasoline -- and it's cited in my brief, Products Company versus Champlin which is 380 -- 283 U.S. 494. 
    This Court held that the Seventh Amendment guarantee did not restrict the appellate courts to the procedure of the common law of 1791. 
    And the opinion says, "We're not concerned with form, we're concerned with the substance of the Amendment." 
    And the modern practice even then, was not to be circumscribed because of just blind adherence to the old forms. 
    Now, in 1960, when this case was remanded, it was remanded with -- and thought in mind that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provided the mechanics, the tools whereby the District Court could ascertain in advance of another trial whether the judge would be constrained to direct the verdict at the close of the plaintiff's testimony. 
    And that's exactly what happened. 
    The plaintiff had unrestricted opportunity and did produce all of the witnesses he could possibly find. 
    Those witnesses, as counsel told you in his argument, testified -- well Officer Prudom (ph) said it. 
    And Officer Prudom (ph) testified that Officer Gidrey (ph) said it and it was a hodge-podge of conflicting rumor, speculation and guess work. 
    The whole record is here, the original depositions of those witnesses are in the record. 
    And on the second appeal, the -- which even the dissenting opinion of Judge Reeves pointed out that it was just a conglomerate mass of hearsay which would be inadmissible. 
    However, Judge Reeves thought that there was one piece of evidence there that was sufficient to take the case to the jury. 
    And that was apparently the reason for his dissent. 
    But --

    There was no evidence at all to support the verdict. 
    And beyond that, there were many instances of reversible error.

    I think there is and I would differ with the counsel there. 
    There is because whereas all appellate courts have the power, the constitutional power in our state constitution to review findings of fact by the trial -- by -- by the finders of fact, judge or jury. 
    There still is a standard of sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of fact, be it a verdict or finding of fact by a judge.

    (Voice Overlap)
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1030.262" stopTime="1039.959">

    Yes.
speaker="stanley_e_loeb" startTime="1046.281" stopTime="1134.687">
    Mr. Stanley E. Loeb 
    But, there is the uniform rule established by the jurisprudent that the power will never be exercised except in case of palpable error. 
    Now, if there's no error shown by the record, the -- the appellate courts under the jurisprudence and the recent jurisprudence of Louisiana Supreme Court. 
    The -- under that rule, which is firmly established, the appellate courts shall not interfere with the finding of fact unless there is apparent error on the part of the trier of fact. 
    So you do have a rule, a very real rule, which is adhered to. 
    Now, of course, in Louisiana we have four Circuit Courts of Appeal, the intermediary courts and one Supreme Court. 
    Now, I don't mean to tell you that every case where one of the Circuit Courts of Appeals might undertake to reverse a jury or -- or a judge -- trial judge. 
    That in every case there is palpable error that the Court thinks so because they are -- they are bound, they did -- the Courts of Appeal are bound by the decisions of our Supreme Court on the Circuit. 
    So we do have a rule and I doubt as I say it again, except for the scintilla rule which I don't know whether that constitutes a federal rule or not.

    Mr. H. Alva Brumfield 
    Mr. Chief Justice, as was pointed out by Mr. Justice Goldberg the -- the real issue in this case is whether there was substantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant killed Byrd (ph) Mercer. 
    Now, in -- in viewing the entire record, it is our position that there is that evidence in this record regardless of -- of the depositions and other steps that were taken like the report from the accident analyst and the deposition of witnesses that didn't appear at the trial. 
    Irregardless of that, the evidence as educed on the trial with the merits of this case before the jury was sufficient to -- to make a jury question to be submitted to the jury. 
    There was a conflict in the evidence. 
    There were denials by the defendant. 
    There were -- there was testimony to the fact that he was not telling the truth. 
    There were circumstances, there were physical evidence, there were photographs, there was a timing, there were all of these -- the evidence from which a jury could draw inferences and wherever you have that situation as I appreciate the countless decisions handed out by this Court that where you have a conflict of evidence and you -- you have it at that stage where the jury can draw inferences and arrive at a decision and reach a decision as to the fact then that should be submitted to the jury and as a jury question.

    Mr. H. Alva Brumfield 
    Over on the shoulder of the road and you have the deceased there. 
    That it -- that if you prove that, say that you had a witness that was out there in that swamp and saw Theriot drove -- drive off onto the shoulder of the road as Mercer was walking along on the shoulder of that road, that would be direct proof of negligence under the law of Louisiana. 
    Because he wasn't keeping a proper lookout and because he had the last clear chance if nothing else, even if -- if the deceased was negligent himself in walking along on that dark road. 
    The duties is up on the driver of the vehicle in Louisiana to keep his car on a proper control to see what he should've seen, to see all -- to be able to stop his car within the range division of his lights and by not doing that then that would be a preponderance of the evidence showing negligence, which negligence was approximate cause of his death.

    The right -- and you see it all fixed because he's walking on the right hand side of the road and the car is coming from his back and the right fender and the right headlight was what was damaged and the right portion of the hood. 
    So when that body hit the fender and headlight hit the body, it slipped him apparently because when he went right on over the -- the -- there's a big dent in the hood near the windshield as the body was clipped -- clipped over.

    Because it's -- it's just not the same and -- and just like Judge Wright said, when he denied the motion for a new trial in this case after the verdict came in from the jury, he says no one who sat through this case and heard these witnesses could come to no other conclusion but that what the jury did. 
    And then when he came back down and after it was remanded with his mandate and after it went through these other depositions trying to find some evidence that had been destroyed by this someone -- one pointing to the other. 
    Judge Wright made this statement and I -- I would like to read it for you because to me that -- even if he had tried this case without a jury, there had been no -- no question of what decision he would have rendered because here's what he said. 
    There isn't any question in my mind that that there was a denial of justice in this case. 
    There isn't any question in my mind either that Paris Theriot killed this man.
