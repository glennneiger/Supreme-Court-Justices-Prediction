    Mr. Michael C. Meltsner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is a capital case here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama and it involves the question whether the courts of that state can refuse to give petitioner an opportunity to put on evidence and then affirm his conviction because he failed to carry a burden of proof. 
    The facts are these, petitioner John Coleman is a Negro, who was indicted and convicted for the murder of a white man by juries of Greene County Alabama. 
    Greene County is in the Western part of the state, a very rural country. 
    Approximately 80% of the population is of the Negro race. 
    At petitioner's trial, it was represented by Court appointed white attorney, who failed and did not assert his constitutional rights. 
    The juries chose him without systematic exclusion of Negroes. 
    After conviction, a Negro attorney was called into the case by petitioner's family. 
    He filed a timely motion for new trial explicitly alleging systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand and petit jury, and a hearing was held on this motion for new trial. 
    But at the hearing, counsel was not permitted to introduce testimony establishing systematic exclusion of Negroes because the trial court, at the urging of the prosecutor, took the view that the question could not be raised for the first time on motion for new trial, that it -- it had to be raised under Alabama procedure prior to the trial. 
    On appeal --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is it both (Inaudible)
speaker="michael_c_meltsner" startTime="155.153" stopTime="412.878">
    Mr. Michael C. Meltsner 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    On appeal, the Supreme Court of Alabama held that petitioner had had an opportunity at the hearing on the motion for new trial to introduce evidence of systematic exclusion that he had the burden of proof and that he had not placed into evidence sufficient evidence to prove jury discrimination. 
    The Court said absolutely nothing about any waiver and quite clearly decided the case on a ground which made waiver moot. 
    Now, as the ruling of the Supreme Court of Alabama which we ask this Court to reverse is the opportunity which that Court said petitioner had on the hearing for motion for new trial to introduce evidence. 
    I refer the Court to that hearing which is in the record, pages 15 to 23, and mainly we're concerned with that portion of the hearing which begins on page 18. 
    Let's expose what happened at that hearing where the Supreme Court of Alabama says petitioner had an opportunity to carry a burden of proof and to introduce evidence of systematic exclusion. 
    Petitioner's counsel at the hearing attempts to place on the stand the two Circuit Solicitors who had tried petitioner in order to prove the allegations of the motion for new trial. 
    And on page 18, we see the response of the Circuit Solicitor. 
    He argues that the question has been waived and there on the 11th line at page 19, he urges to the trial court, we don't think any evidence along that line would be legal and we would object any evidence because it would just be a waste of time. 
    Now at this point, the trial judge says he doesn't know what petitioner's counsel would put on. 
    Petitioner's counsel attempts to offer proper -- the kind of proof he's willing to put on. 
    He argues that the trial court has the discretion to hear that evidence. 
    The trial judge says, “No. 
    You put your witness on the stand. 
    If there are any objections to the questions you ask him. 
    I'll rule on the questions, on the objections. 
    In that way, we'll determine the issue.” 
    So on page 20, the Solicitor is placed on the stand and the foundation is laid. 
    He -- he testifies that he's practiced law on the county for a number of years, that he is familiar with Negroes and Whites in the county, that he has never missed the grand jury in the county. 
    But when the question comes now, “What's the population or the ratio -- population ratio between the races?” 
    Bang! 
    Objection, the issue can't be raised for the first time on motion for new trial. 
    And on page 22 of the record, the trial court clearly sustains that objection on just that ground. 
    Petitioner's attorney asks two more questions, how many Negroes if any were on the grand jury, same objection, same disposition. 
    How many Negroes if any were on the petit jury, same objection. 
    He can't take advantage of the Fourteenth Amendment this way, same disposition. 
    Now, it's elementary I think that -- that this is not a hearing consummate with due process. 
    There was no opportunity to introduce testimony. 
    And I don't understand the state now to take the position that -- a position contrary to that. 
    Although the state opposed rehearing and the Supreme Court of Alabama on that ground, that petitioner did have an opportunity. 
    But now the state seems to be arguing something different that -- it was in fact the waiver. 
    I don't believe that the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama, the judgment here on review, is susceptible to that interpretation. 
    First, the Court said absolutely nothing about waiver.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But the Court didn't mention it.
speaker="michael_c_meltsner" startTime="445.654" stopTime="808.816">
    Mr. Michael C. Meltsner 
    The Court didn't mention it. 
    The state cited waiver cases to the Court. 
    They were not cited in the Court -- in the Supreme Court of Alabama's opinion but fairly easy idea to convey. 
    There are many opinions in -- in Alabama where -- where the waiver holding is the one which disposes of the case, nothing like it in this opinion. 
    But most important, the Supreme Court of Alabama decided this case on the ground which is totally incompatible with the finding or holding of waiver. 
    In other words, what the Supreme Court of Alabama did and it's right here on pages 32 and 33 of the record, in its opinion, it held that petitioner had a burden of proof and he hadn't -- haven't met, it held on the evidence. 
    Now, if you don't have any right, it makes no difference whatsoever, how much evidence you put on. 
    What the -- what the trial court did was say you had no right, so you can't put on any evidence. 
    What the Supreme Court of Alabama does, put that -- put the waiver argument to the side and decide completely on the basis of evidence. 
    Now, I don't think it's important whether or not the Supreme Court of Alabama had any power under Alabama law as viewed from prior cases to do what it did. 
    The judgment in this case is bottomed on a finding of the evidence, not on a finding of waiver. 
    The -- the judgment of the -- in this case is bottomed on petitioner's opportunity to introduce proof. 
    But nonetheless, there are Alabama cases, the Clark and Arrington cases which are cited on page 12 in our brief, where the Supreme Court of Alabama has done exactly what it did here. 
    In other words, the jury question was raised for the first time on motion for new trial, the case came up from the Supreme Court of Alabama and it decided the case on the evidence or indicated that it had the power to decide the case on the evidence. 
    There is even a -- a very recent case on coram nobis where the Supreme Court of Alabama said we know in deciding this case that the petitioner here did not raise this question prior to trial or on motion for new trial, that's the Howard case in 151 Southern Reporter. 
    And there's another one where the same statement is made, the Sills case, 126 Southern Reporter. 
    So as we view this case, it comes clearly under the rule of Cole versus Alabama, recently reaffirmed by this Court, I think about two weeks ago in the Shuttlesworth case, that a Supreme Court of a state must dispose of a case upon consideration of what happened in the trial court. 
    Now, in Cole the -- the conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas on the basis of a violation of law which was not tried below and this Court reversed it because the -- the criminal defendant did not have an opportunity to defend himself to put in evidence. 
    So here, petitioner has not had an opportunity to put in evidence establishing a constitutional defense. 
    The reason he hasn't had that opportunity is because the trial court took the view totally incompatible with the view taken by the Supreme Court of Alabama, that he had no right, no right to establish. 
    Now, I think coming to this record Cole, the Court might have some question about why the Supreme Court did what it did, even though it's totally explicit, what it did. 
    And I think the answer is in two cases briefly discussed in our brief, the Sills and Golsby cases in which the Fifth Circuit has held that in situations like this, where a Negro is represented by a court appointed white lawyer in the South, and the state does not show that he knowingly and intentionally waived his constitutional rights that if the Fifth Circuit is held that it will not be precluded from examining the evidence of the jury question. 
    And the Supreme Court of Alabama knows about this cases and it is modifying what -- what we might call its traditional policy of -- of being fairly hard on litigants who don't raise the question early in light of these cases, in light of its knowledge that the same issue was going to be relitigated in the Fifth Circuit if the Supreme Court of Alabama holds waiver. 
    But I want to make it perfectly clear that I don't think any analysis based on those cases is involved here. 
    The Supreme Court of Alabama did what it did, and that's the judgment here for review. 
    The only -- the only way I can rationalize the State's argument is that they are saying to this Court, Alabama's Supreme Court could've held waiver. 
    It could've decided in this case on nonfederal grounds, and if -- because the Supreme Court of Alabama didn't do it, it could have, this Court should do it. 
    Now there are a long line of cases where this sort of position has been argued to the Court and it's always been rejected. 
    The leading case is -- is Grayson versus Howard -- Harrison in 267 U.S.I would like to reserve my time.

    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    I think I should start out by pointing out to the Court the provisions of the Alabama Code that would deal with this particular situation. 
    Title 15, Section 278, provides that no objection to an indictment on any ground going to the formation of the grand jury which found the same can be taken to the indictment except by plea in abatement to the indictment. 
    And no objection can be taken to an indictment by plea in abatement except from the ground of the grand jury who found the indictment were not drawn by the officer designated by law to the draw the same and neither this objection or any other can be taken to the formation of a special grand jury, someone direct -- direction of the Court. 
    And Section 279 of that same title, provides any plea in abatement to an indictment must be filed at the first session at which the indictment was found. 
    If the accused has been arrested or if the accused has not been arrested, such plea in abatement must be filed at the first session at which it is practicable after the defendant has been arrested, and in all cases, such plea in abatement must be filed before the plea to the merits.

    In this case, after the trial court refused to allow evidence on the question of the formation of the grand jury in connection with the motion for a new trial. 
    Because of the fact that no plea in abatement had been filed prior to the time that the defendant was arraigned then the defendant who was represented on his motion for new trial by a different counsel appealed to the Supreme Court of Alabama and argued that question before the Supreme Court of Alabama and the Supreme Court of Alabama said there was no evidence.

    They mentioned the case of Willie Seals. 
    That's the case of United States on a relation to Willie Seals, Jr. versus Wyman. 
    I'm somewhat familiar with that case. 
    It came in a little bit late but I -- I do know that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed his conviction on a habeas corpus proceeding. 
    And he went back and was reindicted and was retried and resentenced this time to a life sentence rather than to the electric chair.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1359.354" stopTime="1360.717">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why did they reverse it the first time?
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="1360.717" stopTime="1419.232">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    The -- the reason why they reversed it the first time, because he was represented by a white court appointed attorney. 
    And the evidence showed definitely in that case that this white attorney did not know and made no reasonable effort to ascertain the population ratio as far as persons eligible to serve on the grand and petit juries of Mobile County was concerned. 
    He so testified on the stand that he had no idea. 
    That was Judge Johnson brother by the way, Judge Frank M.Johnson's brother who represented him. 
    And -- so the -- the evidence showed clearly in that case that he had no means of knowledge, late -- least he failed to be diligent about obtaining the knowledge in order to -- and properly inform his client as to what his rights were.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1419.232" stopTime="1425.038">

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It was the other one also.
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="1427.774" stopTime="1510.340">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    In the Mississippi case, the case of United States on a relation of Golsby versus Harpole. 
    That was another case decided by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and Judge Reeves wrote the opinion in that case. 
    And it -- it just so happens the facts are these, at the time of the arraignment of this man, he was represented by a Negro counsel. 
    But, some reason or another, between the time of his arraignment and the time of his trial, the -- a white counsel were employed to represent him. 
    And, the Court said that this Circuit Court of Appeals said in that case, that his Negro, retained counsel had effectively waived the question at the time of his arraignment. 
    So he was a little different -- when in fact quite a bit difference from the Willie Seals case where they said that his white appointed counsel did not effectively waived the question and therefore, the Court reversed. 
    But in -- in the Harpole case, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said that his counsel had properly and effectively waived the constitutional question forwarded.

    Mr. Hall, I just want to ask you one question. 
    I reviewed this para -- short paragraph from the brief of the petitioner. 
    He says, this opinion of the Supreme Court suggest that the Court shows to ignore that failure to raise the question of systematic exclusion, because the case came to that Court under the automatic appeals statute compare Arrington versus State, 253 Alabama 178, where the duty of the Court is, “to examine all evidence for reversible error without the necessity of seasonable objection.” 
    Why do you have to say that?
speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="1734.976" stopTime="1748.148">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Well, that is due to the statutory provision that we have in Alabama that all capital cases are -- are automatically appealed to the Supreme Court of Alabama and the Supreme Court is required to look at the whole record and determine --

speaker="leslie_hall" startTime="1759.642" stopTime="1778.956">
    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    If they found no reversible error, I don't know whether it was necessary for them to even point out wherein they failed to find no reversible error.

    Mr. Michael C. Meltsner 
    Well, I think, there, we have to draw some distinction between the -- the interpretive function of this Court and -- and what this opinion says is Alabama law. 
    Now, that perhaps I should indicate that -- that this -- the rule of these statutes is hardly inflexible. 
    The Supreme Court of Alabama in the Clark case cited in brief, in 1940 faced with the identical situation, the question was raised for the first time by a new lawyer on motion for new trial.

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Well, I have that opinion in front of me and I don't agree with you reading that, I must say. 
    What the Supreme Court of Alabama did in that case was this, it's another (Inaudible) 
    It said that the motion was not timely. 
    Then it went out and said, “However, we've looked at the evidence and we don't think that the evidence in the record sustains the report.” 
    And that's (Inaudible) and in the paragraphs on page 386, that's not (Inaudible) 
    The Court is claiming that the motion was not timely made and therefore it hasn't any proper motion. 
    However, we've looked at it and we don't think there's any (Inaudible)

    He makes clear that the evidence (Inaudible)

speaker="michael_c_meltsner" startTime="2191.967" stopTime="2244.852">
    Mr. Michael C. Meltsner 
    Well it -- if the Supreme Court of Alabama had the discretion to decide on the basis of the evidence then -- then our problems are solved because -- then this Court has discretion to review the federal question. 
    And also, it's -- it's easy to see why the Supreme Court of Alabama did what it did in this case because it had the power to decide the case on the evidence alone. 
    Whether or not it did in the Clark case, it certainly indicated that it had the power to do so. 
    And there is like language in the Arlington case and there is like language in the Sills and Howard cases. 
    But, I reiterate, I don't even think that's important because this judgment is bottomed on a finding that you can raise the question on motion for new trial for the first time.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2244.852" stopTime="2259.319">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, now what -- so -- so you asked us to set aside the judgments of the Supreme Court of Alabama, remand this case to the trial court for a full hearing on -- whether or not there was a racial discrimination in the selection of the grand jury, is that correct?

    Yes.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Alright. 
    Now, taking it -- let's assume that we do that that. 
    That we think you're right and we do just that. 
    And then let's say the -- the trial court in Alabama has such a hearing and -- and decides that there was -- here's -- here's a lot of evidence and then decides on the evidence that there was no -- no such racial discrimination. 
    Then it comes up to the Alabama Supreme Court which then says, “Well, it's a matter -- matter of Alabama law. 
    We're not even going to look at that evidence because it was too late.” 
    All I had to -- has been done by a plea of in -- plea in abatement.

    Mr. Michael C. Meltsner 
    Yes, we filed application for rehearing and in two briefs filed to support that application, pointed out that we did not have an opportunity in the trial court to introduce evidence. 
    At that point, the states switched its ground that it had been arguing waiver all the time, and it said, “You did have an opportunity", something which -- which counsel of the State here today agrees that we did not have. 
    The rehearing was denied for that opinion. 
    May I say this Mr. Justice Stewart, I -- I think that the problem you poses is perhaps inherent in -- in this Court's jurisdiction. 
    And whenever it decides a -- a question of -- whenever it decides what a Supreme Court of a state has done with respect to state law, this problem is involved.

    It says that in all cases of automatic appeals, the appellate court may consider its discretion in a testimony that was here to be prejudicial to the rights of the appellants may reverse thereon even though no lawful objection or exception was made therein. 
    They might have construed that to mean that that's related to the -- an offer of new testimony and that was prejudicial.
