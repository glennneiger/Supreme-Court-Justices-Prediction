    Mr. Charles Clark 
    May it please the Chief Justice of the United States and Honorable Associate Justices. 
    At the outset of my portion of the argument, I would like to recall to the Court's attention that what we are dealing with here is criminal contempt, not civil contempt. 
    We are not looking to a procedure in the court below which has, as any of its intention, the enforcement of orders of the court. 
    These orders have been enforced. 
    James Meredith has attended the University of Mississippi. 
    He has graduated from that institution. 
    The function of judicial process in this case has run its course to completion. 
    The possibility of frustration or nullification of that process has passed. 
    This is criminal contempt. 
    The species or variety of the contempt power of the court that looks to punishment, criminal punishment --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Do you seek testing the case is moot?
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="104.762" stopTime="294.655">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    No, sir, Your Honor. 
    Criminal contempt is a term-honored form of the contempt power. 
    We are here concerned with how that power can be exercised under the constitutional safeguards of the United States of America, and the point that I make is that, while civil contempt is a procedure in which the court is seeking to have its decree enforced and to bring the parties who might be thought to be recalcitrant into compliance with this decree, this form of civil contempt has none of the procedural safeguards that this Court has been willing in the past to apply to criminal contempt and what this Court is seeking to do is to punish, is to inflict a penal sanction, is to vindicate, reek vengeance upon someone who it says it has reason to believe has, in the past, violated its decree or come across its decree. 
    This is the point that I would make, sir. 
    On page -- well, Your Honors don't have this. 
    We ask that the argument yesterday be transcribed and we were furnished last night with the copy of the transcript, and the Honorable Solicitor General points out in his argument that, in this particular situation, we are less concerned with punishment than with further compliance. 
    This causes me to want to begin at the point of urging to Your Honors that there is a very vital distinction between civil contempt which seeks to bring about compliance, which imposes a conditional sanction. 
    Just as the Court of Appeals did here when it said to the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor "now, if this order is not complied with and your compliance is not shown to this Court by the 2nd day of October, then fines of $10,000 a day and imprisonment will be imposed upon you. 
    Bring yourself out of the area of conflict with our decree." 
    This was a civil sanction for the purpose of this argument. 
    I think that they departed from the statute when they imposed both fine and imprisonment, but that's an entirely side issue. 
    I think they exceeded their statutory powers. 
    But, that was civil contempt and as Your Honors pointed out in your questions to counsel opposite here yesterday, I believe it was Mr. Justice Goldberg, this civil decree was entered and after its entry, Meredith did attend the university and did graduate there from.

    (Inaudible) contempt, it's described.
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="299.849" stopTime="393.090">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    Your Honor, the criminal contempt proceedings were not commenced until an order was entered by the Court of Appeals on the November, 15, 1962. 
    At the time of the entry of this order, James Meredith was enrolled in the University of Mississippi and had been, since the 1st day of October, 45 days. 
    The Honorable Solicitor General also says that the constitutional phase of our argument is controlled by the decision of these Court in Green versus United States. 
    We take a contrary position. 
    We say that it is not controlled by the Green case for the reason that, in this situation, the Congress of the United States, at the instance of the Attorney General of the United States, passed a law. 
    It was part of the Criminal Code Section 1509 of Title 18. 
    It made that interference with court decrees by persons who were not parties to the proceedings a violation of the criminal law of the United States of America and permitted the imposition of criminal sanctions. 
    This was not so in the Green case. 
    Bail jumping was not an offense at the time that Gilbert Green left the area of the courtroom.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What do you do with the case of United States against Shipp?
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="397.119" stopTime="427.421">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    If Your Honor please, the distinction that I would make to you immediately in the Shipp case, borne out from my examination of the records of the case in this Court, is that Shipp did not demand a jury, as was his constitutional right and of course, it was his constitutional prerogative to waive his right to jury which he did because the record of this Court shows that the Shipp-defendants considered to the taking of the testimony by a commissioner. 
    So, I would --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="427.421" stopTime="431.344">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Did that case turn on a procedural point?
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="431.344" stopTime="713.689">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    No sir. 
    They just -- the constitutional issue which I make to Your Honors here this morning just wasn't erased. 
    Of course the defendant does not have to be accorded a trial by jury where he's willing to waive that right. 
    I think this is acknowledged by everyone, sir. 
    I believe that that is the vital distinction between what we urge to Your Honor here and the Shipp case as controlling precedent. 
    Shipp was not tried with a jury and I might say, it would be appropriate at this time to comment on the fact that the Solicitor General pointed out that, at one page in his brief, he had delineated approximately 15 cases of criminal contempt tried in the courts of appeal. 
    I have done my best to become acquainted with every one of those cases and I make the statement without any fear of contradiction to Your Honors that not single one of those cases involved the demand for a trial by jury. 
    There were two really comparable cases or a group of them. 
    One of them was not actually cited by the Solicitor General in his argument. 
    They both drew out of the matter that was here before this Court, styled in re McKenzie. 
    A receiver had been appointed in State of Alaska around the turn of the century, I believe it was in 1900 exactly, to become -- to operate certain gold claims in the State of Alaska. 
    Then the Ninth Circuit granted an appeal from the order refusing to dissolve the receivership and in the course of its granting of that order by a single judge of the Court of Appeals, it issued a stay. 
    Then, the claim was made that Mr. McKinley, the receiver had violated the stay order of the single judge of the Court of Appeals by refusing to turnover to the other defendants, in the -- the other parties in the receivership proceedings the gold dust and gold nuggets that he had possession of at that time. 
    Out of this refusal and by the way, Mr. McKenzie had a conflict between the orders of the District Court and the orders of the Court of Appeals but, out of this situation, there grew two criminal contempt cases in the Ninth Circuit, one in which Mr. McKenzie was jailed for six months and one in which his attorney was jailed for three months for giving him the advice that the order -- the stay order did not mean that he had to turn over the gold. 
    These two cases, I say, grew out of that, but I have examined the records that are here before this Court, in your library upstairs, and there was no demand by Mr. McKenzie or by his attorney for a trial by jury. 
    So, again, the issue was not raised in that case. 
    The other comparable case was In re Door, D-O-O-R. 
    This was a case in which the use of the mails to transmit obscene matter was charged in connection with an investigation by the postal department, and Door was acted upon by the Court of Appeals in the sense that he was enjoined pending the time the appeal of this case was to be tracked and they claimed that he violated -- again, the Ninth Circuit claimed that he violated that injunction that was on him. 
    Door did not demand a trial by jury and the opinion of the court and the Court of Appeals expressly says so. 
    I do not think that there has ever been a situation in which a demand for a trial by jury of an offense -- correction -- a demand for a trial by jury in a criminal contempt proceeding where the subject matter of the alleged contempt was clearly a true crime, as opposed to amounting to a crime under the common law or equal to a crime, was a true crime if proved where a demand for a constitutional trial by jury was made and refused. 
    I do not believe that this Court has ever had that question before and I believe that it is a question of first impression and not controlled by the Green case.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There are such cases where the man put to trial by jury was made and it was granted?
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="720.456" stopTime="731.097">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    Your Honor, in the Court of Appeals, I do not know. 
    Of course there have been many criminal contempt cases tried by jury under the terms and provisions of the Clayton Act.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="731.097" stopTime="732.472">
    Justice Potter Stewart

speaker="charles_clark" startTime="732.472" stopTime="798.172">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    But I know of none -- I know of none in the Courts of Appeal. 
    The other cases cited by the Solicitor General in his brief all involved appeals for administrative procedures. 
    and of course, the very first time that these matters ever reached a court of law is when they come into the Court of Appeals and of course, there is no such thing as contempt of an administrative proceeding and where NLRB or FTC enters a requirement that a person perform a certain thing or do a certain act and then an appeal is made from that and the Court of Appeals says, "Yes the order is valid now, obey it.” 
    Then the only type of contempt power that could be exercised would be a contempt of the order of the Court of Appeals. 
    and this is what was involved in every other one of the proceedings cited by the Solicitor, none of which bore any evidence of a demand for a trial by jury.

speaker="charles_clark" startTime="835.317" stopTime="861.534">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    It could be punished under the statute. 
    It would be crime. 
    But, here, we are talking with, again, a species or subspecies of the contempt power in which the court itself, with its own eyes, sees the matter. 
    It -- it's in the focus of the court's hearing and in the focus of the court's eyes. 
    We do have a case that control that, in re Terry, in which --
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="861.534" stopTime="865.960">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Wouldn't it be punishable? 
    Can the court punish the statute here?
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="865.960" stopTime="1399.285">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    Yes, sir. 
    and the only point that I make to Your Honors is that there is a need for the immediacy of the remedy in that case which I think differentiates it from any other claim of a right to proceed summarily where something has happened hours, days, weeks, or months later. 
    There is not the same urgency to correct the situation that interferes with the administration of justice. 
    I know that Your Honors are familiar with the works of Mr. Edward Livingston. 
    Mr. Livingston would have only, Your Honor, taken this person out of the way of the court. 
    Where his obstreperousness was interfering with the conduct of a trial, he would have just had him physically removed for the day and then, if he came back the next day and persisted in his conduct, he would have removed him again. 
    He would have never imposed a penal sanction. 
    I would not go that far with Your Honors. 
    I recognize that this creates a situation that could break down a trial, and the point that I would make with you above all is that what I am urging here is not anything that's going to keep a court from functioning. 
    What I am urging to you is that, when you impose a penal sanction in a criminal trial, it ought to be done under the Constitution of the United States by a jury procedure where the defendant demands it. 
    This, I think, is a simple summation of what my constitutional point is to you. 
    If I may, I don't want to be presumptuous to the Court but, just for emphasis, Article III Section 2 Clause 3 of the Constitution says, and of course has said since the day it was written, that the trial of all crimes, except in impeachment cases -- except in impeachment cases, shall be by jury. 
    There's only one exception in that statue. 
    It's an exception of a procedure that is sui generis, if one ever was. 
    I mean, the trials of impeachments are really peculiar animals under the law, but that's the only exception and I make the point with Your Honors that it's a much stronger point in my favor because the exception is there, that it would be if it had not been there, even though trials by impeachment are clearly provided for elsewhere in the Constitution. 
    Here, they thought it necessary to call out this right in the Savings Clause that save to the citizens the right to be tried by juries in this country for crimes. 
    From a great dissatisfaction with the way the Constitution was originally written, the Congress, in its first meeting, put into the Constitution the Bill of Rights and here again, in the Sixth Amendment. 
    In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. 
    I submit to Your Honors that they are words that leave absolutely no room for any other construction in a case such as we have here where a court is seeking vengeance, where a court seeks to punish a past act. 
    I think that the Constitution very elaborately and very precisely defines exactly what my client's rights are and I think that this Court should make a holding in this case which will enforce those words of the Constitution in cases of this type. 
    The prosecution has been able to develop absolutely no history that will support any other construction, except for the fact that, in old cases, this Court ruled that criminal contempt was not within the purview of these sections. 
    If Your Honors please, this is a different case from those cases even because this is a statutorily defined crime if the defendants are guilty of this act, and that issue has never been before you. 
    But, assuming for the sake of this argument, the validity of Terry and Debs and the other cases that have made these holdings, I say to Your Honors, the error is one of the commodities that does not improve with age and this Court, I urge with the utmost deference and respect, should recognize that older decisions which do not grant this right are error. 
    The Constitution has meant different things at different times in this nation's history and yet, its words have never changed. 
    So, what I urge the Court to do here is not an unheard of thing. 
    When I urge you to depart from the spirit of past decisions in the constitutional field, I'm not urging something that's never been argued to you before and I am very sure, will not be argued to you again. 
    I don't think that the Constitution is a dead document and I think that this Court will constantly be asked to examine its decisions in the constitutional field. 
    But, let me emphasize that I make this point only in argument because I do not concede that this case that we have here today has ever been before this Court before, and I make the point only that the spirit of other decisions which would indicate a contrary result ought not be allowed to control this case because I don't think that they are on all fours with the case. 
    I don't think that they were the issue that we have here before us. 
    One bit of support comes from Mr. Madison in his original argument to the Congress for the adoption of the Bill of Rights, and I have never seen it quoted heretofore, and if I may ask Your Honors indulgence to call it to your attention. 
    He said in Congress, “In the declaration of rights which England has established, the truth is that they've gone no further than to raise a barrier against the power of the crown. 
    The power of the legislature is left altogether indefinite. 
    Although I know that whenever the great rights trial by jury, freedom of the press, or liberty of conscience come in question in that body, the Parliament, the invasion of them is resisted by evil advocates. 
    Yet, their Magna Carta does not contain any one provision for the security of those rights. 
    Respecting which, the people of America are most alarmed.” 
    He included the right to a trial by jury under the Sixth Amendment in his demands for First Amendment protection and in his differentiation of the Law of England and the Law of the United States in this regard. 
    Continuing, "But, although the case may be widely different and it may not be thought necessary to provide limits for the legislative power in that country, yet, a different opinion prevails in the United States.” 
    This quotation is from 1 Annals of Congress, page 436.

    Well, Mr. Justice Moody spoke the same thing for the court in Twining versus New Jersey when he said that if the procedures of England were brought to this country by our Constitution, then the procedures of the first half of the 17th century would be fastened upon American jurisprudence like a straitjacket, only to be loosened by amendments to the Constitution.

    Mr. Charles Clark 
    No, sir. 
    Debs -- in the Debs case, the jury issue was involved. 
    And in the Debs case, the thing that I pointed out to Your Honors, the distinction that I would make would be that the case, here, is an area where Congress has defined the acts as crimes, as true crimes. 
    In the Debs case, this was an injunction granted to allow the mails, they said, to continue to flow. 
    I think that the quotations in the case from the leaders of the strike from Eugene Debs and his so-called lieutenants indicate that they considered it to have a strike-breaking effect rather than the effect of preventing or allowing the mails to continue to flow. 
    I made that issue in my --

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    It was defined (Inaudible)
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="1643.735" stopTime="1967.045">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The -- the court issued an injunction. 
    And of course, in the labor field, I think that with Clayton and then reinforced by Norris-LaGuardia when this Court's decisions concerning Clayton were thought to be not adequate enough to suit the wishes of Congress later, by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, they strengthened the rights of labor to be exempted from the types of procedure that we have here, but this is only in labor cases. 
    In the Kennedy versus Mendoza decision, the court quoted from Ex parte Milligan and if I may, again with the Court's indulgence, just add a sentence or two immediately following the Court's quotation there, “Because of the fact that the Eminent Solicitor argues that the courts need to have this power.” 
    This is -- this is why it should be done because, without it, we are not going to have satisfactory administration of justice. 
    I'd like to reply more in detail to that argument in just a minute. 
    But, for now, let me say I address myself only to the question of whether need can create a right. 
    The court in Ex parte Milligan said no doctrine involving more pernicious consequences was ever invented by the will of man. 
    Then, that any of its provisions to the Constitution can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. 
    Such a doctrine not only leads to anarchy or despotism but the theory of necessity, on which it is based, is false. 
    The Government, within the Constitution, has all the powers granted to it which are necessary to preserve its existence. 
    I say to Your Honors, further, that the Constitution impliedly recognizes the right to trial by jury in addition to the direct recognitions that I have just referred to, in that, the Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. 
    I think that this Court's holding in Griffin versus the People of Illinois clearly indicates what this Court means by due process of law. 
    and I am not urging that I would write the Equal Protection Clause into the Constitution of the United States for the federal prerogative sub silentio. 
    But, I say to Your Honors that you have already decided in the Detroit Bank case and in others, such as Griffin, that when an action establishes or when a procedure establishes a markedly different path for two people that are identically circumstanced and situated, that it does not accord due process of law. 
    and I think that this is exactly what happens. 
    On the first day, when the Government had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendants in this case were interfering, in anyway, with the orders of the District Court of the United States or of the Court of Appeals, they had the right to take the information that they filed with the Court of Appeals, and form an affidavit, and make a criminal charge against these persons. 
    This was their prerogative and I submit to Your Honors, their only prerogative, insofar as criminal sanctions were concerned. 
    And I -- let me again emphasize, I do not speak of civil contempt. 
    I do not speak of any of the multiple ways that a court might choose to say to a person who is obstructing its orders or interfering with compliance with these orders that “unless you move aside, this court will impose a civil sanction on you.” 
    I'm talking about now punishment. 
    I'm talking about punishment for the past. 
    This is something that should be processed under 1509, and I think to say to the Government, “well, if you don't feel like proceeding under 1509, just go back to the court and start an independent ancillary action in the Court of Appeals that has no original jurisdiction, and then cite the defendants for criminal contempt and you get around to trial by jury that way.” 
    I just don't think that this can be made to square up with due process of law and --

    Surely, this Court, the Court of Appeals, the District Court, any court has the right to impose civil sanctions and say to a defendant “now, unless you comply, you will find yourself punished thusly by imprisonment. 
    You go to jail until you are ready to comply or you pay a daily fine.” 
    This is a very theoretical distinction on fines which I think the courts have not gotten around to making, but it's too far-fetched to go into here. 
    But, these civil sanctions in which the defendant carries with him the power to avoid the punishment by correcting his action are not in any way encompassed within what I argue to Your Honors today. 
    I'm talking about solely punishment. 
    and I submit to Your Honor, and I don't want to evade the issue with you, I submit to you that if your procedures, insofar as Mr. Justice Black's injunction had been concerned, had been criminal procedures, then I certainly would have -- would think that we were as much entitled to a jury in this courtroom as we would be to any -- in any other courtroom in the land.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Let me reiterate my question into the context of the present case. 
    Assuming you are right and you prevail, your argument would have been the Governor is entitled to a jury trial. 
    Where would the trial take place, in Louisiana District?
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="2164.838" stopTime="2238.700">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    If Your Honor decides, with the point that I urge here, that the Constitution of the United States accords a right to a trial by jury, then it would have to be, in my opinion, in the State of Mississippi. 
    and we have additionally urged, I might say, to Your Honor that the matter awe upon the proper judicial administration to be remanded to the District Court for the conduct of the trial. 
    This is a criminal action. 
    The court as the -- as the Eminent Solicitor argues in his brief, the court is not involved in any way. 
    It simply sits as the judge, as the arbiter of the courtroom, and governs the proceedings. 
    So, I see absolutely nothing to the claim of the Solicitor that only the Court of Appeals could preside at the trial. 
    I think the court could do just exactly what was done by the District Court in Texas and send the case to any court having jurisdiction for a regular criminal processing. 
    I think this is what the Constitution means when it accords due process. 
    I think this is what the Constitution means when it accords the right to trial by jury.

    Those are of a Court of Appeals which sits in Atlanta, and in New Orleans, and in Houston, and in other points in the Fifth Circuit.

    Yes, and I just don't know whether when the Constitution means -- when the Constitution says where the crime shall have been committed, it means, in the case of the contempt of a court order, the place where the acts were done, which occurred in both the Northern and the Southern District of Mississippi or whether it means the place where the court that issued the order sat. 
    In other words, does the contempt occur in the act or does the contempt occur to the presence of the court?

    In other words, when the court is on the bench and someone creates a disturbance in the presence of the court, which will not allow the trial to continue, then whether you call it criminal or civil, I think this is probably the real problem, the court has the right to get this obstruction out of its way summarily.

    Yes sir, and the only thing that I say, Judge, is my basic puzzlement is whether or not it's truly penal or civil.

    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Well, doesn't the court adjust this issue?

    Mr. Charles Clark 
    Let me just say this then, Mr. Justice Goldberg. 
    I pray to admit that point from my argument. 
    I agree with the rationalization that you make entirely and I think that, as I say, that the need is -- must answer to civil sanctions. 
    and if Terry -- if I were arguing to this Court in Terry, I'd take the same position I take here today if my client had been sentenced to six months in jail as Terry. 
    I believe Terry was sentenced to six months. 
    Mr. Justice Field was involved and I -- that's my recollection. 
    They had a continuing fight and of course, as a result of this matter, the case of In re Neagle came up, which has been cited in the Court in another connection. 
    But, continuing Mr. Justice Black, this section of the Constitution provides in the district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have previously been ascertained by law. 
    and my only question about where it would go, whether in New Orleans or one of the other spots where the Fifth Circuit sits or into Jackson, Mississippi. 
    and by the way, they were sitting in Hattiesburg, Mississippi at the time that they originally issued the amicus order to the United States. 
    The panel of the Fifth Circuit which issued the order was sitting in Hattiesburg which is in the Southern District of Mississippi, which is one of the points where the alleged contempts took place.

    No, sir. 
    I think if Your Honors decide that it's a constitutional right, then, of course, there's the Constitution and the court below must interpret the Constitution, commence it with the other decisions of this Court in that area. 
    If you say we have a trial -- a right of trial by jury under statutes -- under the Clayton Act statutes, then this leaves the district question open completely.

    This would be my contention if I were here in the Terry case. 
    I would contend that Terry was unconstitutionally dealt with by being sentenced to six months in jail. 
    I would urge to Your Honors the adoption of the philosophy of Mr. Edward Livingston that these contempts ought to be pushed aside -- these contempt orders are ought to be pushed aside immediately by the court, so it can get on with its business. 
    But, when it comes to dealing with a true crime that the court ought to deal with that person charged with that crime under the regular criminal processes of law and not summarily without a jury.

    Mr. Charles Clark 
    Well, Mr. Justice White, I'm not making myself clear to the Court and it concerns me. 
    If I will make the appearance here that counsel did in the Terry case, I am bound to claim, and I believe emphatically, that the Constitution of the United States would have demanded that Terry be sentenced to six months in jail only after he had been found guilty by a jury, if he had demanded a jury. 
    And --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But if you're suggesting that there are some contempts of Court which aren't subject to the jury trial provisions of the Constitution, you have to arrive at some way of construing those out of the words of the Constitution.

speaker="charles_clark" startTime="3152.376" stopTime="3169.324">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    It's not a question of construing a matter of the words of the Constitution. 
    It's a -- it's question of differentiating between what is a civil sanction and what's a penal sanction. 
    I say that anytime a penal sanction is imposed, it must be imposed under the terms of the Constitution providing for punishment crimes.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    It had the same case, wouldn't you?
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="3255.871" stopTime="3545.722">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    Yes, sir. 
    This Court has said though, Your Honor please, that where time and circumstances do permit, and I think that the rule says so too, that where time and circumstances permit, that the matter of contempt should be referred to another judge for hearing where it's going to be a summary trial. 
    Let me, at this juncture in the argument, if I may, make a retort or rebuttal to the Solicitor's argument of yesterday. 
    He admits that the United States had no right to participate in Meredith versus Fair on behalf of either of the private litigants. 
    But, he says, when it occurred to the Government that a violation of Section 1509 had occurred that “they,” and I quote him literally here, “accordingly, went to the Court of Appeals and there, commenced” what on page 33 of my transcript he describes as this, “a supplementary ancillary independent action." 
    I believe that these words are self-contradictory. 
    I don't believe that you can have a supplementary, ancillary, independent action. 
    If it's ancillary, it's not independent. 
    If it's independent, it's not ancillary. 
    I would also take issue, completely and categorically, with a statement made by the Eminent Solicitor in the course of his argument that he was faced with the dilemma of a District Court which would -- which either couldn't do anything during the time of Judge Cameron's stays or, after he had been given the opportunity, it declined to act. 
    As I read the federal rules, and I have reference to Rule 7 (b), any time that a person moves a District Court to perform an act, it being a court of record, that motion must be made in writing. 
    and if any article of this argument of the Solicitor is to be taken so as to prejudice the least of my client's rights, then I think that this Court is required to get the full facts. 
    I have here on the table a certificate from the Clerk of the District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi which says that there never was a motion filed by the United States of America for leave to intervene in the District Court of the State of the Southern District of Mississippi as amicus curiae throughout the entire history of the merited proceedings. 
    We are here on this prong of his argument contending about conversations that are completely deposed of the record. 
    Later in his argument, he says that, at a stage in the procedure, the Court of Appeals required him to make a second entreaty to the District Court to be allowed to act in that court, and that that second entreaty was denied and that it is shown in the certified record here before this Court. 
    When Mr. Jaworski replies to my argument, I would ask him to enlighten both the Court and myself as to where this second appeal occurred. 
    The only thing that I am able to find in any part of the certificate before this Court relating to an intercession or a motion or a plea for the District Court to perform any act that it did not perform was that the Court of Appeals said that it "ascertained" that the District Court was unwilling to admit the United States into it's court as amicus curiae. 
    I find nothing else in the certified question, and I made the point in my brief that this matter is not in the record.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="3545.722" stopTime="3556.354">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Are you questioning that that is the issue, whether it's in the record right now? 
    Do you say that the Court must be able to, certifying the question in this Court, misstate the fact?
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="3556.354" stopTime="3576.563">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    Mr. Justice Goldberg, I am saying that if a man is to be treated with -- for a criminal offense that could result in the deprivation of his property and his liberty, that whatever is going to affect his rights are to be shown in the record of Court.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="3576.563" stopTime="3582.886">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    I understand. 
    That's your legal concession but I ask you whether you're questioning the accuracy of the facts you have stated.
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="3582.886" stopTime="3763.071">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    I am unable to do that, sir. 
    I think that, whatever judge of the court would be involved would be the final arbiter of that. 
    I know nothing of it. 
    and I only point out to you that if it's to have the slightest affect on the defendants rights, then I think the Court ought to get the record before it and I think the record ought to be the basis for its action because I do take firm issue with the Government. 
    The only time that Judge Mize was asked to do something by the Government in the form of written plea that he acted on, he granted the injunction against Meredith's arrest. 
    He proceeded on one-day's notice to try the Chancellor of the University, the Registrar of the University, and the Dean of the School for civil contempt. 
    He did arrive in an acquittal of civil contempt that day. 
    But, let me point to Your Honors that those same three people were immediately taken before the Court of Appeals and charged in that court with the contempt of an identical order, and there's an order on the records of the Court of Appeals finding that those people are not in contempt and were never in contempt of the court's order. 
    So, he's been affirmed in that action and he did not refuse to act. 
    He did not delay justice, and I make that in the most positive manner that I can make to state. 
    I have gotten too verbose. 
    I think that the Court should consider the basis for the decision that it's asked to make here in this case and I think that the Court should be cognizant of the fact that, so many times, you've pointed out yourselves that this Court doesn't have the power of the sword or the purse. 
    The way that this Court brings about its desired results is by appealing to the minds and the hearts of men as a basis that what we say is right. 
    You don't just write a decree out and say “judgment for the defendant.” 
    The Court tries to say why a judgment for the defendant ought to be issued. 
    The Court tries to say why a case ought to be tried in a certain way. 
    This is because the basis for enforcement comes from an appeal to reason. 
    This is nothing but a piece of paper. 
    The Mendoza decision, nothing but a piece of paper, except that when people read the words on it, it appeals to them. 
    It has a meaning to them and they are willing to abide by it. 
    I -- I say --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3763.071" stopTime="3763.258">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Suggestion --
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="3763.258" stopTime="3763.672">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    Also --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3763.672" stopTime="3772.019">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is it your suggestion that they should be willing to abide by that decision, or any other, only if the reasoning appeals to them?
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="3772.019" stopTime="3792.840">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    No, sir, but I say that this is the basis of the judicial power, Mr. Stewart -- Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    This is how it functions. 
    It doesn't function because the judiciary has the right to call up the Army. 
    In every case, if it's going to involve that, it has to get over into the Executive Department. 
    You're familiar, of course, with --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3792.840" stopTime="3793.600">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, yes.
speaker="charles_clark" startTime="3793.600" stopTime="3879.459">
    Mr. Charles Clark 
    With Hamilton -- I mean, with the statement that Jackson made. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall had made his order, let him enforce it, and Mr. Justice Warren put it more aptly than I can. 
    We must remain vigilant to preserve the principles of our Bill of Rights lest, in our desire to be secure, we lose our ability to be free. 
    and I think that this is the rational principle that I would appeal to the Court on, that necessity is not the governing doctrine. 
    That this Court has the power in civil contempt, just as every other court does, to deal with any contemptuous act and bring about compliance. 
    Nobody nullified the decree. 
    This is not -- this is not the situation that we have. 
    The Solicitor talks of jury trials which would deny a court its right to vengeance, but I would speak of the glory of the English law. 
    He speaks of whims of unsympathetic jurors, and I would talk to you about this principle, excellency. 
    He speaks of the certainty of enforcement, and I would speak to you of the birthright of free men. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Leon Jaworski
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3879.459" stopTime="3890.838">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Jaworski.
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="3890.838" stopTime="4108.318">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    In the few minutes that remain for argument, I should like to emphasize the points that we consider to be controlling of the answer that's to be given to the one question that was certified to this Court. 
    I went on September 10, 1962, Mr. Justice Black vacated the several stays that were granted by Judge Cameron to the mandate of the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Black further ordered, in very plain language, that the judgment and mandate of the Court of Appeals shall be effective immediately. 
    and of course, there was added also that, pending final action by this Court on the petition for writ of certiorari, the respondents be, and they are hereby, enjoined from taking any steps to prevent enforcement of the United States Court of Appeals judgment and mandate. 
    Bearing in mind now that there was this order that the judgment and mandate of the Court of Appeals shall be effective immediately, it was found that there were efforts to obstruct. 
    It was not until eight days later, September the 18th, after these efforts to thwart became apparent that Meredith's enrolment at the University would be interfered with in every way possible, that the United States applied to the Court of Appeals for an order allowing it to appear in the case. 
    Now, this was the act of a government that was deeply concerned about the preservation of the administration of justice and the upholding of the integrity and authority of the judicial processes of the United States courts. 
    The Court of Appeals entered the order, allowing the United States to appear in the case. 
    And while the court, in authorizing the United States to appear, did designate the United States as amicus curiae, it went much further. 
    The designation of the United States as amicus curiae in cases similar to this situation had occurred in both the Fahlbusch cases and the Bush cases, and it was used again in this case. 
    But, the order of the court is the instrument to which we will look to see what authority the United States was given to appear as amicus curiae in the case. 
    In every respect, may it please the Court, the United States was given precisely the same rights, the same authority that any party to a suit could be accorded. 
    It was authorized to enter the case “with the right to submit pleadings, evidence, arguments, and briefs and to initiate proceedings for injunctive relief and proceedings for contempt of Court.” 
    So, in a real sense, may it please the Court, the order entered and here involved emanated from an action brought or prosecuted in the name of the United States.

    Mr. Justice Black, I would say that it has been done in other cases, of course, in the Fahlbusch and Bush case.

    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    I'm not familiar with that, Mr. Justice Goldberg. 
    I should add of course that, in both, the Fahlbusch case as well as the Bush case, this Court refused the writ of certiorari. 
    Now, perhaps the word “amicus curiae” was not the choice that's almost accurate designation to use. 
    But, are we going to disregard what the Court actually said on the power that was given and if we did, of course we would be substituting a form for substance.

    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    The record here, may it please the Court, that we have that shows the matter that was brought into issue is contained in what the Court -- the four members of the Court who wrote the opinion of the four contains and it does set forth.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4411.270" stopTime="4422.926">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What does it say?
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="4422.926" stopTime="4468.185">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    On page 5, may it please the Chief Justice, it has said that, on September 18, 1962, this Court Judges Brown, Wisdom, and Bell, after first ascertaining from the District Court that it declined to enter an order in this form, entered its order allowing the United States to appear in the case. 
    The order is cited. 
    It -- appearing from the application, United States filed a stay that the interest of the United States to the due administration of justice and integrity of the processes of its courts should be presented in these proceedings, and so on. 
    And then, the order specifically set forth what I've mentioned a few minutes ago as to the power and the authority that was given. 
    I should like, because --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4468.185" stopTime="4470.008">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's in the record, is it?
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="4470.008" stopTime="4561.989">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    It is sir, yes. 
    And I should also say that in the question certified the Court specifically points out that the amicus curiae in this case was given the right to initiate proceedings for injunctive relief. 
    That is a part of the certified question that is here submitted. 
    There has been, from the time that this Court first commented upon the question of contempt trials -- criminal contempt trials, there has been followed the belief of principle that there was an inherent in the Court the right to vindicate its authority to enforce its orders, to protect itself from insult, as one of the cases of this Court says, without the necessity of calling upon a jury to assist in the exercise of its power. 
    and this Court has always considered that the exercise of such a power was necessary so that the lawful judgments of the Court maybe respected and enforced. 
    It has pointedly said that, to compel obedience to its orders, it must have the right to inquire whether there has been disobedience and that the submission of the question to a jury would operate to deprive the proceeding of half of its sufficiency, as it was said in the Debs case.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In order to --
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="4619.060" stopTime="4678.685">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    I very much appreciate it because there's one thought that I wanted to convey to the Court. 
    There is no greater menace, no greater threat, in my opinion, to the proper and orderly administration of justice than the willful disobedience of court decrees. 
    Isolated but notorious instances of contempt that are not effectively dealt with, with every possible deterrent being used, will soon multiply to common place occurrences and I submit that our system of justice should be insulated, as was done in the Green case, against this threat by retaining the effective deterrent that the Green case pronounces. 
    Now, I have a high regard for the trial -- right of trial by jury, Mr. Chief Justice and other members of the Court, but if the court decrees are not to be evade --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4678.685" stopTime="4683.692">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I presume you would give it in every kind of case, except a crime that involves the courts.
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="4683.692" stopTime="4692.946">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    I would give it in every kind of case, except in the cases where I saw that the very administration of justice will be completely destroyed --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4692.946" stopTime="4693.092">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    and I --
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="4693.092" stopTime="4695.090">

    Unless there are effective means found --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4695.090" stopTime="4695.268">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is my statement --
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="4695.268" stopTime="4696.021">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    -- Mr. Justice Black.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4696.021" stopTime="4707.045">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- wrong that you believe in the trial by jury, as the Constitution guarantees it, in the case of every kind of crime except one which involves a crime connected with the courts?
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="4707.045" stopTime="4728.987">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    That is certainly true, Mr. Justice Black, and this Court has so said itself in the Green case, as it did in one or two other cases. 
    And I would say, again, that if court decrees are not to be evade, what is the right of trial by jury worth? 
    And if court decrees are not to be evade, may it please the Court, what is the Constitution worth?

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4737.296" stopTime="4743.549">

    -- kind of court order so that the jury couldn't decide the case if it's too dangerous.
speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="4743.549" stopTime="4804.253">
    Mr. Leon Jaworski 
    I don't think it's too dangerous, Mr. Justice Black, but I just think that there is needed every sort of insulation and every sort of deterrent against the violation of court orders. 
    It is that vital to the administration of justice. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
