    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Members of this Court. 
    This case, Baggett against Bullitt, Number 220, is a loyalty oath case involving test oaths as a condition of academic employment at a state university in United States, the University of Washington. 
    This case presents many issues but one of them which is of paramount significance and one to which I wish to attract my attention and one to which I shall confine the bulk of my argument is whether or not these test oaths function as a prior restraint on academic freedom , freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of conscience. 
    Specifically, does the State have constitutional power under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to require that all professors give up certain of their rights for academic freedom, free speech, association and conscience as a condition of academic employment at a state university? 
    The facts of the case can easily be stated. 
    As to the class action brought by 64 people who are intimately connected with the University of Washington, 64 of the -- of the 64 appellants, 56 of them are professors and members of the academic faculty having teaching and/or research duties. 
    This is set forth in the record at pages 151 to 156. 
    Thirty-one of the professors have tenure at the University of Washington and 25 of the professors have academic appointments usually for a three-year duration. 
    Now, these 25 professors do not have tenure but they are not probationary employees in the usual sense of the term but instead they have a three-year appointment that is renewable for another three years at the end of which they will acquire tenure and this is set forth in the record at page 294. 
    Many of the professors have security clearances from such agencies of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the United States Air Force, the Navy and the Boeing Company. 
    Of the eight remaining appellants who are not members of the academic faculty, four of them are students of the University of Washington, two are secretary typists, one is a micro-meteorologist and another is an assistant editor of the University of Washington Press. 
    Many of the professors at the University of Washington, three of whom are before this Court today, Professor Usinger, Professor Kenneth Reed and Professor Paul Didrickson are aliens. 
    As set forth at page 102 of appellants' briefs, these oaths have been demanded of the aliens who were involved in this case.

speaker="arval_a_morris" startTime="202.934" stopTime="213.546">
    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    I say as set forth at page 102 of the appellants' brief, the aliens have been demanded that they execute the oaths involved in this case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="213.546" stopTime="214.112">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="arval_a_morris" startTime="214.112" stopTime="255.717">
    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    That's also supported by the record at pages 159, page 303 and page 176. 
    The context within which the professors assert their rights is, of course, the University of Washington. 
    It was -- it was early founded in our nation in 1861. 
    It is now in its 2nd century of academic endeavor. 
    It is older than the State of Washington having been found prior to that. 
    At the present time on its Seattle campus, it has the faculty of over 1500 professors, a physical plan of about 100 permanent buildings located in area of about 600 acres. 
    Beyond its Seattle campus, it --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="255.717" stopTime="257.404">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is it involved in the record?
speaker="arval_a_morris" startTime="257.404" stopTime="583.718">
    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    Yes, sir. 
    They're -- the educational research activities of University of Washington are fully described in the record on pages 89 to 150. 
    I should only point out that the size of the University, although it has a total of 32,000 students that the size alone is not a measure of its quality but rather the measure of its quality tends to be in the quality of its graduate students, the quality of its professorial staff and, of course, in the physical plant. 
    It is the 14th largest at the present time. 
    It is one of the three on the west coast that happened to be members of the American Association Universities and only 40 universities in the nation can claim this membership. 
    Before turning directly to the materials with respect to prior restraint, I should like to clarify two points, one, raised by the Attorney General in his reply to our brief, namely, that the definitional sections of this oath are not an issue. 
    I should like to direct the Court's attention to page 160 of the record. 
    The Attorney General's brief at page 26 argues that the definitional sections of the oath are not before this Court. 
    In fact and I quote, he says, "One search is the pleadings and pretrial order in vying for a clear request that the definitional sections be declared unconstitutional." 
    Now, agreed fact 12 on page 160 states, "The other statutes material to this cause and whose constitutionality are contested here require the oath." 
    These statutes are here and after referred to as requiring the 1955 oath and it was agreed that this would be a shorthand way of expressing what follows. 
    And our part of the Subversive Activities Act of the State of Washington being Chapter 377, Laws of 1955, Amending Chapter 254, Laws of 1951. 
    And then following, as reproduced there, a -- the definitional sections so that it appears very clearly at agreed fact 12 that the definitional sections are before this Court and this Court will not search in vain in order to find a request. 
    Also, this was supported by paragraph (66) of the complaint as that paragraph is buttressed by the Appendix B of the -- appended to the complaint found on page 15 and also as buttressed by page 165 of the record and the District Court opinion on page 239 where the District Court says that these statutes are in issue. 
    The second point I should like to make is the general one with respect to be these oaths and that is that these oaths are current and prospective. 
    At page 245 of the record, there is a paragraph from the District Court's opinion. 
    I shall quote it, "These plaintiffs here are simply required to state that they do not now and will not, in the future, engaged in the proscribe subversive conduct nor become a remaining members of a subversive organization as defined in the statute." 
    That means that a professor then must swear that he now and for the future, he will restrict his activities to what's required by the statute. 
    And that which is required by the statute strikes directly at the teaching functions strikes to the heart of the classroom because these also are not a search for data, they are not a request by the legislator -- pardon me, the Legislature of the State of Washington asking the professors whether or not they might be members of the subversive organizations, but what these oaths do in fact is to require that each professors give the right answer, only one answer, namely, that they are not members of a subversive organization or they are not a subversive person. 
    And then and then only will they qualify for the possibility of hiring so long as they are further substantively qualified in their disciplines. 
    So that the point I should like to make here is that distinguishing all of the congressional investigation cases, the Committee cases and the State Committee Investigation cases, these statutes do not present the question of whether or not a State may search for data and it's not before the Court and our position is, of course, the State has large powers, strong powers to search for data in a committee inquiry. 
    What these statutes do is to strike at the very heart of the teaching function. 
    Now, if I may direct to the Court's attention at page 15 of the record, I should point out what it is that was circulated to the members of the faculty at the University of Washington, that is the oath in question here, Oath Form A. 
    There are basically two oaths, one is the 1931 oath, which is reproduced in the first paragraph, and the other one is the disclaimer oath in the second paragraph.

    Yes. 
    The first oath requires that a professor by precept and example will do certain things, that is by doctrine, by his speech, by his classroom lectures. 
    And this was -- this oath applies only to teachers. 
    It does not apply to any other state employee. 
    It's aimed right up the teaching function. 
    It says that, "I will by precept and example promote respect to the flag, the institutions of the United States of America, State of Washington, reverence for law and order, and undivided allegiance to the Government of the United States."

    Well, as set forth on page 195 of the record, Professor Stull Holt who is a professor of American foreign policy, requires -- states that this requires that he must teach certain probable untruth with respect to United States conduct in the Mexican War and with respect to the United States conduct in acquiring the Danish West Indies and with respect to United States conduct on the occasion of the revolution in Hawaii in 1893.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I don't quite get your basic argument. 
    You say these strikes at the part of the teaching profession and as a matter of policy, we might -- and we might agree with you that -- but isn't up to a State to -- to prescribe the kind of qualifications its -- it wants for its teachers as teachers? 
    In others words, if a State were benighted enough to do so as a matter of your views of right policy or mind to say that, "I promise if I take a job in this university, I won't take no more graduate courses." 
    Is -- isn't that up to a State to do -- to prescribe such qualifications as that?
speaker="arval_a_morris" startTime="735.331" stopTime="745.746">
    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    Perhaps I can answer your question this way, Your Honor. 
    Underlying that notion is the idea of an employer-employee relationship, the master-servant relationship, that the master hires a servant, the servant shall do exactly what the master says.

speaker="arval_a_morris" startTime="753.325" stopTime="782.243">
    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    Yes. 
    I believe it's undeniable that the claims of academic freedom, which are recognized by this Court in Sweezy, run counter the usual prerogatives of an employer in the master-servant relationship. 
    Outstanding example of that is that this Court is hired by the United States by -- by Congress in that sense. 
    Congress doesn't direct this Court how to decide a case. 
    And I would suggest to the -- to you that the freedom of universities is just as important as the freedom of judges.

    So you don't think it would be competent to a State to say, "Well, you can make and teach all you want about the way other societies are organized but if you're going to teach here in the University of Washington in the United States of America, we'd rather have you devoted, primarily, to our institutions of -- including all our institutions rather than devoted to a tribal organization and society where -- where the witch doctor is the answer to all of everybody's problem."

    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    Again, we come back to the employment relationship underlying the State's case as the notion that this is a master-servant relationship and this Court need not consider the context within which the rights are exhibited. 
    And the counsel admits that the claim of academic freedom runs contrary to the usual prerogatives of an -- of an employer but that the claim of academic freedom and freedom of speech being embodied within the First Amendment, limits the State as an employer. 
    If these were a private school not subject to State action, then we wouldn't see the problem. 
    But being a public school subject to State action, it appears that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporating the First is a limitation, denying the State's power.

speaker="arval_a_morris" startTime="1640.326" stopTime="1708.089">
    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    Well, first, it seems to me that this is a case where the initial screen is an attempt to produce a group of people who will be then qualified to teach at the University of Washington. 
    That initial screen requires that by precept and example, they teach certain doctrines and then that they will not teach by any means to certain other doctrines. 
    So that we really have two groups, we have the large group from which people may very well be selected but the State, using the condition of freedom of speech, of association, says that on the basis of these conditions, you have to agree that you will do certain things and that you will not teach other things, that you will associate in a certain way and that you will not associate in a certain way, then you will be able to teach at the University of Washington. 
    Now, it seems that that is our point because it requires that the faculty member have a preordained conception of mind that he has to agree with the -- what might very well be a transit whim of the majority of those Legislatures of the State of Washington as to what is proper and preceptive.

    Mr. Morris, getting back to promoting institution, I notice that one of your witnesses at 197 testified, "If I were to sign the oath, I would feel that I had forced -- declared falsely that I hold a number of important beliefs to which, in fact, I do not strike." 
    For example, although I support the general concept of the law as part of our social system, there are many specific laws which I do not support any sense, this include the McCarran Act, the Smith Act, the stricter immigration and passport laws, the Landrum-Griffin Act and other labor laws and most legal provisions which outlawed gambling, prostitution, abortion, contraception and the use of certain narcotics.

    The foreign subversive organization -- organization section is not qualified by the terms "revolution, force or violence" and any student who should listen to a professor teach by any means and then commit an act intended to overthrow, it can basically makes the professor a captive of his student.

   Argument of Kenneth A. Macdonald

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. MacDonald.
speaker="kenneth_a_macdonald" startTime="2558.290" stopTime="2748.648">
    Mr. Kenneth A. Macdonald 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Honorable Chief Justice and members of this Court, I should like to speak briefly to the religious aspects, which several of you have already inquired about, that is -- is -- either of these oaths, the 1931 oath, which you have been talking about mostly or the 1955 disclaimer oath, in any way invade the free exercise of religion of these plaintiffs or indeed invade their conscience, which I believe is also protected by the -- the First Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And I suggest, if the Court please, that several cases of this Court point that way, that is first, Barnette, it seems to me which is cast somewhat in the complexion of this case where there was a compulsory oath of allegiance or a compulsory act whereby these children were sought to be patriotic or to be nationalistic and the Court struck this down as a violation of the free exercise of, of course, the religion, the Jehovah's Witness religion, of these children. 
    It seems to me that this concept has been carried forth recently here, in this Court, in the case of Sherbert against Verner, which we have not cited in our brief, although we did cite Schempp, which I think also carries forth this concept. 
    And it seems to me that herein, the present context of this case, we have conditioned of employment that the professor will give an undivided allegiance to the United States from oath respect for reverent -- in reverence of law and order, etcetera, that we have talked about earlier. 
    In addition, under the disclaimer oath, these professors are asked to say that they are not subversive persons or have not knowingly joined a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization, which we believed, and the professors have stated this on pages 188 and 189 of the record in an agreed statement of fact, on agreed fact, first, that they believe all of the professors, I'm now talking about all of the professors rather than two, to whom I will address myself in a moment, that all of the professors feel that the oaths are a violation of their conscience. 
    The preceding finding of fact on page 188 relates solely to two professors who are Quakers, one of whom Professor Matchett is tenured, one of whom Professor Orians who is non-tenured. 
    They have asserted that in an agreed statement -- in an agreed fact that the oath violates their religion specifically, the Quaker religion. 
    Now, Quakers, as I understand it, don't have an undivided allegiance to temporal power. 
    These gentlemen have an allegiance if we use that word of that strength or they have a feeling or a devotion or a sympathy for people, for human beings, for human needs.

    If Your Honor please, I suggest that Barnette, a simple flag salute, which I think most of us would agree with accepting for the religious overtones that people would be able to salute the flag in that case. 
    These youngsters and their parents stated that it was against their religion that they not have a graven image. 
    Now, this case as in Barnette, if these gentlemen assert that they cannot sign because of reasons of conscience, their assertions of First Amendment freedoms is not running into or colliding with the assertions of anybody else. 
    Everybody else, if they wish, can take this oath. 
    The only persons who would not be taking it would be as in Barnette, those people who felt that it was contrary to their religion. 
    Now, secondly, I think that the extension, if you -- if I may so call it, of the free exercise in Sherbert takes up this case, that is if the Seventh Day Adventist in North or South Carolina, I -- feels that her free exercise of religion has in anyway been prohibited by reason of her losing her employment and not under state statute being eligible for unemployment compensation benefits, then I suggest that the condition imposed upon these professors is precisely the same type of condition and is indeed a prohibition of the free exercise. 
    Now, question, of course, is what is religion? 
    Does religion run over into conscience and is conscience protected? 
    I suggest that both under Barnette, under Speiser against Randall, certainly under Cantwell against Connecticut that a person's free conscience is protected by the First Amendment as absorbed by the Fourteenth Amendment and applicable to the States. 
    And I suggest that if this is, if it is indeed, a violation or an intrusion upon the rights of these professors, then I think that the mandate of the First Amendment should takeover even though this Court might think that this is but a limited invasion. 
    The Court has spoken. 
    Justice Madison has spoken in the past of the dangers of what is now a limited invasion and later maybe a torrent. 
    Now, I feel that the literal interpretation of the First Amendment, and I regarded as a charter of our Government, is applicable to this case that we are faced with state action and that the rights of conscience of all of the professors as opposed to the -- were limited, I may call them, religious rights of two of the professors have, in fact, been affected as by what we call an unconstitutional condition of employment. 
    Now, we are not asking, I am not asking that the oaths should be declared unconstitutional as to all persons, only as to those persons who seek to raise the issue of conscience. 
    I mentioned to Justice -- Mr. Justice Stewart earlier on the question of what difference does it make and I think that it makes some difference in the environment in which we're acting again --

    This has come up before this Court, has been sent back for a determination as to whether or not there is a hearing under the disclaimer oath and the Supreme Court of the State of Washington said, "No." 
    When your remand went down, it asks the Court there to act -- to assert if there was a hearing at which these professors could explain or defend. 
    The answer was no. 
    Although the Court said, as Mr. Fuller will advise you that there was a hearing for tenured professors under the University of Washington tenure program. 
    However, we have asserted in our brief what -- that this is -- in essence a sham hearing because the Board of Regents of the University of Washington acting under their delegated authorities, as pointed out by Mr. Justice White, have said, if the answer is that such a hearing that I will not sign then that the State, through its Regents, will follow the law and will discharge these professors.

    I should like to reserve the balance of our time, if the Court please, for Mr. Morris on rebuttal. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Herbert H. Fuller
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3137.568" stopTime="3155.413">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Fuller.
speaker="herbert_h_fuller" startTime="3155.413" stopTime="3441.427">
    Mr. Herbert H. Fuller 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, distinguished counsel. 
    It's true that we must safeguard our constitutionally guaranteed liberties. 
    It is also true that we must protect ourselves against the dangers of subversion. 
    Now, having said this, we've said very little toward assisting the Court in determining case before it because what is needed is not generalities, however, true these generalities maybe. 
    But a detailed analysis of the statutes, a consideration of the context out of which they overruled and an understanding of the statutes and how they've been applied and interpreted by the courts in our State. 
    Now, the course of my argument, I would like to deal first with the Subversive Activities Act, passed in 1951 as amended in 1955 and devote the latter part of the argument to the 1931 oath requirement. 
    Well, I don't purport to go into detail in the 1951 Act. 
    I would like to very quickly present a bird's eye view of what it requires. 
    As the Court knows, the Washington Legislature did not simply shoot an arrow into the blue when it passed the Subversive Activities Act of 1951. 
    Prior to this Act, the Governor of the State had requested that it be passed. 
    Prior to the Governor's request, extensive hearings had been held by a state investigating committee. 
    Now, when the Act was finally passed, it was patterned in large part after the so-called "Ober Act" in the State of Maryland, consisted of some 22 sections. 
    The first section is, perhaps, the most important in the entire act, it's the definitional section. 
    And in a few minutes, because if the importance of this section, I would like to drawback to it. 
    The next three sections relate to criminal sanctions and they are not before the Court. 
    The following five sections relate to the appointment of a special assistant attorney general. 
    Now, these are not before the Court because four out the five have been vetoed by the Governor. 
    The one remaining of these five sections merely requires that the Attorney General report biannually to the legislature on subversive affairs. 
    This brings us then to Section 11 which is one of the key sections as far as the state loyalty program is concerned. 
    I'm not going to attempt to quote directly from the statutes but only to paraphrase them. 
    Section 11 lays down the base rule that no subversive person shall be eligible for public employment in the State of Washington. 
    Section 12 establishes an administrative program which places a certain amount of power in the hands of agency officials to determine whether those and their employee are subversive persons within the meaning of the 1951 Act, as amended -- later as amended. 
    Now, Section 12 is one of two sections, which was amended by the 1955 Act. 
    Section 13 provides that this requirement as to those who are employed, as opposed to applicants, shall not be applicable to non-sensitive areas of state government. 
    Now, at this point, I should advise the Court that in the entire State of Washington, I know of not one area which has been declared non-sensitive. 
    I think we should be frank about that. 
    We say that this is evidence of the very poor level of enforcement which the Act has received. 
    Section 14 requires a, what we will call, a one-shoot affidavit requirement, a disclaimer as of -- for all employees who are employed as of June 1, 1951. 
    In Section 15, sets up a rather elaborate hearing procedure for those who have been accused of being subversive persons under the Act. 
    Again, I should be frank with the Court and tell the Court that I know of not one instance on Section 15 has ever been employed. 
    The next section requires an affidavit from a candidate for election. 
    The last section which I would like to mention is Section 19 of the Act. 
    This is a key section because it is a mandate. 
    As we see it, it is a mandate by the legislature that the Act be strictly construed with an idea of not infringing upon a person's constitutionally guaranteed liberties. 
    This Section is very short. 
    I'd like to read it.

    It was a declaratory judgment action. 
    Again, I can say, being frank with the Court, that in the entire State of Washington, I do not know of one instance when an individual has refused to sign the oath.

    No, Your Honor, not a single one and the reason is this. 
    The University of Washington has been protected from the operation of the 1955 Amendatory Act which requires the disclaimer requirement almost from the time that the Act came into force. 
    Before the oaths could actually be distributed and -- and -- in other words, before a person had a chance to make an operative refusal, there was an injunction and there's been an injunction -- prohibiting the University from demanding the oath.

    There's been an injunction by the -- first by the -- by the State Supreme Court. 
    Now, after the case was sent here, remanded back, again appealed to this Court and this Court dismissed for one of the substantial federal question, there was no injunction for a short time. 
    Now, during that short time, the mechanics were started to demand the oath of the --of the University professors and the other employees but it was such that the they couldn't demand the oath until October, a number of them were away and the mechanics were such that it would've required four or five months to demand that the oath be signed. 
    So what the University said in effect, and here I'm paraphrasing it, they said, "You shall sign the oath by October 1st, demand is hereby made that you sign the oath by October 1st." 
    And I believe it was June, possibly July, but I believe it was June, injunction was issued by the three-judge court stating the hand of the University from demanding that they sign the oath. 
    It's true there are many statements of intentions where some of the appellants, in this case, state that they certainly have no intention of signing the oath but there's nothing to prevent them from changing their mind. 
    There has been no refusal on which a hearing could be predicated.

    Mr. Herbert H. Fuller 
    At that time a number of issues were raised in the -- in the brief of the appellants in that case. 
    There were First Amendment arguments, there were Fourteenth Amendment due process arguments, bill of attainder arguments and I'm not sure about some of the other arguments. 
    But they were -- I think it's fair to say, substantially, the same as the arguments in this case. 
    There maybe some others which is religious aspect, but I think it's fair to say that they were substantially the same as the arguments in this case. 
    I said a moment ago that the University of Washington has had a judicial umbrella in the form of an injunction virtually from the time that the 1955 Act has been passed. 
    The result of this is that the University of Washington provides a test tube example on how a state agency might operate under the 1951 Act without the 1955 Act. 
    We submit that the level of enforcement has been sufficiently low. 
    That checks as to an individual's loyalty have been sufficiently desultory to justify the legislature. 
    In passing the 1955 Act, I'd like to quote a couple of examples to that effect. 
    Turning to the record, I would like to quote part of a statement by Professor Reed who is one of the appellants in this case, on page 200. 
    Now, Professor Reed, the Court will recall was a visiting professor from Australia, who decided to burn his bridges behind him and teach at the University of Washington. 
    Was he informed of the oath requirement prior to his coming to the University of Washington? 
    On page 200, before the bottom of the page he says, "When I accepted this visiting appointment, I was not informed that an oath of any nature might be required to me." 
    Less -- thus, would seem to be a mistake on page 201 about three-quarters of the way down the page, he says, "I was at no time informed that an oath of any nature might be required at me as a condition of my employment by the University." 
    I now direct the Court's attention to a statement by Professor Birnbaum during the course of his deposition. 
    The Court will recall that Professor Birnbaum was a member of the personnel committee of the Mathematics Department. 
    Now, a duty of the personnel committee is to -- is to recruit new members for that particular department. 
    What sort of checks do we have as far as loyalty or membership in a subversive organization? 
    Well, on page 62 of the record, in response to counsel -- question from counsel as to the activities of the committee and more particularly Professor Birnbaum's rule, counsel for Professor Birnbaum asked the following question, question, almost to the bottom of that page, "Do you have any knowledge of any instance in which there has been an exploration of a candidate's loyalty to the State of Washington? 
    Answer: "No." 
    Question: "Do you have any knowledge of any instance in which there has been an exploration of a candidate's loyalty to the United States of America?" 
    Answer: "I don't know of any preliminary exploration of that kind." 
    Question: "Were you directed by anyone at the University of Washington to apply such standard?" 
    Answer: "A matter of clarification, before the loyalty oath issue or after." 
    Question: "Well, have you been directed by anyone at the University of Washington at anytime to apply any such standard?" 
    Answer: "I've not been expressly asked, no."

    This is one of those old interpretations and nobody can find the source of it but the oath has been applied in such a way and interpreted it in such a way as long as we know, perhaps, from the time it was first passed so that it would not apply to aliens. 
    Now, it is true that a similar oath is requested of aliens. 
    But in the similar oath as the record will show, I'm sorry, I can't point to the exact page, but there's an example by Professor Aldenderfer in which Professor Aldenderfer in a memo to the people in this department or that one particular alien said, "I will support allegiance -- undivided allegiance to the United States insofar as this is consistent with my citizenship blank country," or something to that effect.

    And the same thing is true with the 1931 oath, as I'll try to explain in a few minutes. 
    We say that a state high court should be able to pass on those definitional sections.

    Let me say first of all that I'm the first to admit that these words are susceptible of different interpretations. 
    I think that the word "institutions" is particularly susceptible with the number of -- of interpretations. 
    We feel -- let me start with the word "flag" we feel that word "flag" really means the United States of America. 
    After all, the flag is nothing but a cloth -- piece of cloth with the insignia of country on it.

    Well, that -- that looks to me or I must suppose the vagueness, the very form of the oath itself.
speaker="herbert_h_fuller" startTime="4764.773" stopTime="4861.277">
    Mr. Herbert H. Fuller 
    I appreciate the fact that there are number of objections with regard to vagueness in the oaths. 
    Our point is that the Washington High Court should have the opportunity to pass upon this vagueness point. 
    Four years ago, almost to the day, I came before this Court when I was representing the State of Washington in an action, Nostrand against Balmer, it recalled Nostrand against Savelle, stated to this Court that the two professors, Professors Nostrand and Professor Savelle, would very probably be entitled to a hearing which they could explain or defend their refusal to take the oaths required by the 1955 Act. 
    Now, four years later, I come before this Court and I say that as this case was remanded to the State of Washington for determination of that very question and when the case was argued before the Washington Court, the office of Attorney General argued that the statutes of the State of Washington would seem to allow such a hearing counsel for Professors Nostrand and Savelle argued that the statutes would allow and no such hearing. 
    Now, the Washington Court held that the professors would be entitled to a hearing. 
    We, very strenuously, disagree that it will be a sham hearing. 
    We say at the very least try us, let us see. 
    We think the Supreme Court of the State of Washington would not sanction a sham hearing.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    If that was all there was, wouldn't -- wouldn't the University were required to discharge him automatically under the terms of the statute?
speaker="herbert_h_fuller" startTime="4900.228" stopTime="5019.596">
    Mr. Herbert H. Fuller 
    I don't think that -- that university in every case is required to discharge an individual if he refuses to sign the oath. 
    I can't answer your question because of the particular factual basis of it but let me take another example. 
    Let me take an example of whether an individual belong to the Communist Party, say several years ago. 
    And the individual attempted to resign from the Communist Party but a number of years had gone by, he no longer had contact with those individuals that he had once known, he did write a letter to somebody and yet he wasn't sure whether he could sign the oath or not. 
    We say that such an individual came forward, demanded a hearing and at this hearing, stated that he had written a letter to the last person he knew, he did knew whether he was still mailed back his membership card. 
    He didn't know whether he was still carried on the membership rules. 
    We say that if such a person would kept for employment that it might well be affirmed by the Washington State Supreme Court that ever came before it. 
    We say, in other words, that would not be a sham hearing. 
    It would be a hearing with a very real meaning. 
    Now, there are two other categories. 
    Not only those of academic tenure but those with civil service tenure and those who, for one reason or another, have no tenure at all. 
    The real significance of the Court's decision in Nostrand against Little, the real significance was the fact that the Washington Court held that they could not interpret the 1955 Act without reference to any other act. 
    They took the 1955 Act on the hand and interpret it along side of the Act which gave the Board of Regent certain powers. 
    They read them together and came out with the hearing requirement. 
    We say if the Court did this with that particular statute, they might well compare it with another statute such as the civil service statute passed in 1951 or the Administrative Procedures Act passed in 1959. 
    They compared it with one statute. 
    They might well compare it with another.

speaker="herbert_h_fuller" startTime="5024.318" stopTime="5039.089">
    Mr. Herbert H. Fuller 
    Let me take them one at a time, Your Honor. 
    Let me take first of all, those who are not teachers at all, those who are non-academic personnel and who would be covered by, let us assume, this classified service of the State Civil Service Act, Section 5 --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5039.089" stopTime="5043.241">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

speaker="herbert_h_fuller" startTime="5043.241" stopTime="5044.231">
    Mr. Herbert H. Fuller

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="herbert_h_fuller" startTime="5044.354" stopTime="5804.977">
    Mr. Herbert H. Fuller 
    That is correct. 
    They would only -- the non-academic personnel would only take the 1955 or if not, the 1951 oath. 
    The Section 5 of the State Civil Service Act authorize the various institutions of higher learning to set up the personnel committee. 
    This was done at the University of Washington. 
    The personnel committee met and it passed rule -- Rule 14, which actually adapted rules and procedure which are set forth in the Civil Service Act, so this would prepare the hearing for those. 
    Now, the key question is, what about those individuals that have neither civil service tenure nor academic tenure, would they be afforded a hearing? 
    Now, the going gets rough. 
    We say that they would be by virtue of the State Administrative Procedures Act passed in 1959. 
    State Administrative Procedures Act, in Section 9, provides that in any contested case, all parties shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice. 
    Now, what did they mean by contested case? 
    Well, Section 1 defines a contested case as a proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties are required by law or constitutional right to be determined after an agency hearing. 
    Would there be a constitutional right to a hearing? 
    We don't know. 
    We say it would be better to err on the side of allowing too much due process rather than allowing too little due process. 
    We propose to grant them a hearing and I don't know who can raise the question of a hearing would be improper. 
    I'd like to add that the office of Attorney General is very much aware of the serious nature to an individual who has been discharged on security reasons. 
    I don't know that this has ever been done but we recognized that it is serious. 
    For that reason, along with the mandate contained in Section 19 of the Act, we propose to construe the definitional sections very strictly. 
    We propose whenever there is a doubt or a question to allow a person a hearing and a fair hearing. 
    We cannot meet the objections to those who feel that the loyalty act such as this is unwise. 
    We can meet the objections of those who claim that there is a procedural deprivation. 
    We can meet the objections of those who claim that we are interpreting the Act in too broader fashion. 
    Next, I would like to deal with those definitional sections very briefly. 
    But before I do, I've already discussed the 1951 Act. 
    I would like to remind the Court that in 1953, the Washington Legislature amended the definition of subversive person to make the element of scienter even more explicit. 
    In 1955, we say because it may be had been dissatisfied with the level of enforcement, the Washington Legislature amended the Act in two places and added two new sections. 
    Section 12, if the Court will recall, set up an administrative program. 
    As the Court knows, the first section of the 1955 Act added to disclaimer requirement that a person must disclaim his present membership. 
    I emphasized the word "present membership" in the Communist Party or other subversive organization. 
    The second section brought us into conformity with the non-sensitive provision which was Section 13 of the original act. 
    Now, the third section was a very harsh section. 
    It required that those organizations which were on the United States Attorney General's list be deemed subversive organizations within the meaning of the Washington Act. 
    I hasten to add that this Section was declared unconstitutional by the Washington States Supreme Court. 
    The last section simply states that Communist Party is declared to be a subversive organization and membership is a subversive activity thereunder. 
    As far as the oath form itself is concerned, I've already stated in response to a question that the oath, so far as the 1955 portion of the oath is concerned, is made by the Attorney General's Office. 
    It is, by and large, followed by state agencies even though there is no absolute requirement that they do so. 
    A city or a county may choose to follow the -- an oath of their own choosing. 
    We have supplied them with an oath and I can say that by and large, they have adapted our oath form. 
    Now, an examination of the oath itself shows that not all of the oaths comes from the 1955 Act because the mandatory portion of the 1955 Act only requires that a person state whether he is a member of a Communist Party or other subversive organization while, in fact, more is asked in the oath. 
    A person is asked, for example, whether he is a subversive person. 
    This stems from the 1951 Act. 
    I'll also hasten to add that this is a request for information. 
    This is not a -- a particular requirement of future behavior. 
    The State does have a right to request this information. 
    It is true that under Section 12 of the 1951 Act, the State may, in the future, request more information. 
    Now, I come to the key part of the 1951 Act, which are the definitional sections. 
    I think the first thing that is apparent when we consider the definitional sections is the fact that each definition must perform a double duty. 
    On the one hand, it defines a subversive organization, membership of which maybe a crime. 
    And on the other hand, it defines a subversive organization membership in which it cause one to lose his public employment. 
    Now, of course, it's actually a mandate that criminal statutes are strictly construed, although the criminal portions of the statutes are not before the Court. 
    We say that these strict constructions, since there's only one definition of subversive organization, since there's only one definition of subversive person, since there's only one definition of foreign subversive organization, we say that this strict criminal construction benefits those who come under the loyalty portion of the Act. 
    The strict construction is, of course, buttress by Section 19 which I read to the Court earlier, the mandate by the legislature that the Act be strictly construed. 
    What is a subversive organization under the Act? 
    We did not claim if these terms are self-defining, since they are defined in the Act. 
    This is one of the difficult areas of this case but I think that it is better to discuss it. 
    I will paraphrase the definition of "subversive organization" rather than read the expressed statutory definition. 
    Subversive organization is any organization, purpose of which is to, to do what? 
    To engage in a type of activities or to advocate, abet or advise a type of activities. 
    What type of activities? 
    Activities intended to assist in the overthrow, distraction or alteration. 
    Alteration of what? 
    The constitutional form of Government of the United States, of the State of Washington or of any political subdivision of either of them. 
    Now, the definition of subversive person is a little more involved. 
    Who's a subversive person? 
    According to the statute, any person who aids in the commission or advocates, abets, advises or teaches by any means, any person to aid in the commission. 
    Commission of what? 
    Any act intended to assist in the overthrow, distraction or alteration. 
    Answer the constitutional form of Government of the United States or of the State of Washington or any political subdivision or either of them. 
    How? 
    By revolution, force or violence. 
    In addition, according to our statute, one is defined for purposes of the Act as a subversive person who with knowledge that the organization is an organization as defined on the section relating to foreign subversive organization, as relating to a subversive organization becomes or remains a member of such an organization. 
    Perhaps the most controversial is the definition of "foreign subversive organization". 
    This is quite similar to subversive organization except that it's further defined as an organization directed, dominated or controlled directly or indirectly by a foreign government. 
    Further, although the Section does speak in terms of overthrow, distraction or alteration, we've got to face the fact that it does not have the qualifying words by revolution, force or violence. 
    Now, we interpret this to, nevertheless, mean by revolution, force or violence. 
    And by revolution, we're not talking about a peaceful revolution such as the industrial revolution. 
    We understand revolution to be a popular armed insurrection in the sense in which it's popularly used. 
    Where do we base this on? 
    We based it on the fact that, on the one hand, it is a foreign organization. 
    In other words, being a foreign organization, it maybe less likely to rely upon normal democratic processes. 
    It may be more likely to rely upon an army which maybe the fist or the spirit of the foreign organization. 
    When the foreign niche of the organization and the fact that it may be relying upon a foreign army is combined with the words "overthrow, distraction or alteration", we feel that it is clear enough that this means by revolution, force or violence. 
    Now, this Court has often held that if will uphold the statute if it can be given a constitutional construction. 
    This portion was given a constitutional construction, we submit, by the State of Maryland with the Ober Act, which as far as the definitional provisions are concerned, are identical to those in this case. 
    In the case of Shub against Simpson, Maryland court held that the purpose of the law referring to the Ober Act, was to prevent infiltration in our State, referring to the State of Maryland, county or municipal government by persons who are engaged in one way or another, in the attempt to overthrow the Government by force or violence. 
    Now, when the Gerende case came before this Court, Attorney General Hammond, I believe it was, gave the Act such an interpretation and seem to require change by violent means. 
    We say if it was done in the State of Maryland, it could be done on the State of Washington. 
    Again, our interpretation is buttressed by Section 19 of the Act asking that it be given a constitutional interpretation. 
    Now, my final point is this, with regard to the 1931 Act, it maybe true that as the (Inaudible) said, most questions eventually come before this Court. 
    This is also applicable to the 1955 Act. 
    But that does not mean that legal questions are involved, we submit that the real questions involved are not so much constitutional questions as there are questions of wisdom. 
    And we say that the solution for the appellants is with the Washington State Legislature, just as a solution for those who've just like Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act, was with the Congress of the United States. 
    We say that the Legislature in the State of Washington is the proper area in which the appellants should seek their remedy. 
    Thank you.

speaker="arval_a_morris" startTime="5808.895" stopTime="5914.371">
    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    The State has argued several points. 
    I should like to address myself to one or two. 
    The first, as the State correctly argues, the subversive person section of the disclaimer oath does not originate in the 1955 Legislation but it originates in the 1951 Legislation. 
    I have it before me. 
    It states, "Every person who shall be in the employ of the State of Washington shall be required to make a written statement subject to the penalties of perjury that he or she is not a subversive person." 
    Then it goes on to state, "Any such person failing or refusing to execute such a statement or who admits he has a subversive person, as defined in this Act, shall immediately be discharged." 
    It does not afford the opportunity of a hearing. 
    This is further corroborated by the agreed fact on page 169 of the record where the -- the counsels have agreed that execution of the required oaths on Forms A and B, described in the paragraph immediately above as "Oath Form A", is made by statute and action of the defendant regents a condition precedent to any and all employment at the University of Washington. 
    That means that if a tenure professor should ask for a hearing, he should be granted a hearing. 
    The only question is who is -- did he signed the oath? 
    If he failed to sign and if this is, as stated here as it is, an absolute requirement work -- employment, then it is clear that it's a sham hearing. 
    There simply is no hearing for the tenured professor. 
    There are --

    -- lower court in the State of Washington. 
    That was appealed to the Washington State Supreme Court that reversed but they maintained the injunction pending appeal to this Court. 
    This Court heard argument, had briefs and then sent back the case for decision on the hearing question. 
    The lower court -- pardon me, the State Supreme Court of the State of Washington wrote a very broad and discursive opinion in which the Section 19 was argued and what have you -- and that the lower -- the State Supreme Court refuse to take that into account. 
    And then they came back here --

    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The point I'd like to address myself to now is who has to sign the 1931 oath? 
    The section of the statute is very clear and by definition it says, "Every professor, instructor or teacher must execute the oath." 
    It uses the term "professor". 
    Secondly, on page 303 and 304, there was an actual demand and refusal made upon Professor Didrickson, an alien, a citizen of Norway. 
    The -- the President of the University of Washington, his testimony was introduced by the State, has stated that the demand of May 28th was a demand that all members of the faculty execute the oath. 
    And what actually occurred was that we have a new president as of 1958. 
    I take it that he made the decision not to continue the old policy but this was unknown to Professor Aldenderfer.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Does the president have discretion?
speaker="arval_a_morris" startTime="6292.876" stopTime="6322.659">
    Mr. Arval A. Morris 
    No, Your Honor, there is no discretion here. 
    It's a statutory oath prescribed by the legislature that the second section says that it will apply to every professor, every instructor. 
    And as I understand it, the new president, President (Inaudible) came in 1958. 
    He simply stated that everyone has to sign. 
    I don't know whether he planned to continue the old practice but it would appear to me that it would be misfeasance of office to have him scratching out the statutory wording of a statute of the State of Washington.
