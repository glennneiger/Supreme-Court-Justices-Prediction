    Yes.
speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="24.188" stopTime="197.615">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    And may it please the Court. 
    Before I get into my principal point, which will be that it was improper for the Court of Appeals to invoke its mandamus power in this case for the reason that -- that there was a remedy available under the Interlocutory Appeals Act and the plaintiffs, the respondents here, failed to seek relief under that Act. 
    And for the further reason that the district judge, in passing on this transfer motion, in no way act that in excess of his statutory prescribed jurisdiction and for that reason, his decision on the transfer motion was not a controllable by mandamus. 
    Before I reach those reasons with respect to my main point, I would like to advert to the question the Court was exploring yesterday afternoon. 
    That is the question as to whether, first, there will any substantial prejudice resulting to the plaintiffs as the result of the transfer of this case from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts and whether or not that prejudice effect, if the contingency of prejudice materializes whether that factor by itself constitutes the type of abusive discretion that should've precluded the district judge from effecting the transfer. 
    I would like to say with respect to that point preliminarily that so far as the Government, so far as the United States is concerned, that problem has no -- no relevance at all. 
    The Unites States is exposed to liability for compensatory damages irrespective of any state statutory ceiling on wrongful-death actions. 
    Under the Tort Claims Act, this Court in the Massachusetts' Bonding case held that the federal government cannot avail itself of the limits of liability under the Massachusetts' law even with respect to a death occurring in Massachusetts. 
    And the district judge realized this and -- and noted this in his opinion, and noted that that if there ever should be ultimate liability adjudicated as against the Unites States, the United States, whether the case is tried in Pennsylvania or in Massachusetts and irrespective of whether or not the Pennsylvania Courts accept or reject Kilberg, the potential liability of the United States is -- is unlimited. 
    That is it will be based on compensatory damages suffered by the plaintiffs.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What is the conflict (Inaudible)
speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="261.942" stopTime="355.779">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    Including its conflict through. 
    It's exactly what they say including its choice of law rules. 
    This is on page two of their reply brief and they cite a -- a host of cases. 
    Now the -- the district judge -- the district judge went into this problem. 
    It's not that he cavalierly brushed aside the -- the problem of potential prejudice resulting to the plaintiffs as a -- if the transfer were effective in a -- a very comprehensive, a very well reasoned opinion. 
    He goes into detail with respect to this problem and takes into consideration both of the factors that I had mentioned, namely the potential unlimited liability of the United States. 
    He takes into account the rule of law upon which the corporate defendants rely, namely that the transferee forum takes the case in it's entirely with all of the legal incidents surrounding it and just as if it had been tried in the transferor forum. 
    He also points out, the district judge that the -- all -- the case hasn't been adjudicated so far as liability is concerned. 
    It maybe that -- it maybe and we have reason to believe that there will be no ultimate determination of liability on the merits as against some, if not, all of the defendants. 
    So that the question as to how much the plaintiffs will recover depends on a --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="355.779" stopTime="361.519">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I don't follow that. 
    Why will there not be a determination against some of the merits?
speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="361.519" stopTime="458.281">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    It may be that the district judge trying the case under the Tort Claims Act against the United States and the jury trying the case against the corporate defendants will conclude that there has been no showing of actionable negligence. 
    The Court will remember that this was somewhat unusual accident, the basic claim of negligence is against all of the defendants is that the engines on this Lockheed were negligently designed so that they were conducive to bird ingestion and that the United States Government somehow should've cleared the airways of -- of birds before the plane took off. 
    Now, it may be -- it may be that the -- the defendants will be able to convince the judge and the jury respectively that there was no negligence in which event, all of these broad questions is to transfer, applicability of the damages recoverable in Pennsylvania as opposed to those in Massachusetts will never become pertinent in this litigation. 
    The district judge also noted that the specific question as to whether or not Kilberg will be followed by the Pennsylvania courts was in active litigation in the Pennsylvania state courts. 
    And he thought and I think quite -- quite correctly, that it would be appropriate for him to stay his hand and defer any ruling on the damage questions until the State Supreme Court had spoken.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="458.281" stopTime="466.646">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And this is on the premise as you suggest that the Pennsylvania conflicts will really have to be applied by the Massachusetts court if the transfer goes full?
speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="466.646" stopTime="608.575">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    That was his -- that was his -- that was his plain view. 
    Now, of course, this question was not passed on by the Court of Appeals. 
    It was not -- the parties do not directly touch on it in their briefs. 
    Our record was not designated with the view to developing all the record we designated for the -- for this Court after the petition for certiorari was granted, it was not developed along the line they're focusing on this point. 
    If it had been, we would have included in our -- in the record an opinion handed down by the district judge after the opinion which is included in the record. 
    He was asked to amend his transfer order and in denying the motion to amend, he said that this question as to whether or not the transferee forum is required to follow that law of the transferor forum including the choice it brought. 
    He said that it was not clear in his mind -- it was not -- there -- there was a conflict of authority, but he did continue to say, it would appear to this district judge that the conflict of laws, rules of the transferor district would govern the trial of these cases in the transferee district. 
    This is -- in his opinion, immediately after his original opinion granting the transfer. 
    He also want -- he also felt that the damage question does present some -- some delicate -- some very difficult questions as to constitutional objections to the carry over of Pennsylvania public policy if it ultimately -- it should be determined that the Pennsylvania would follow Kilberg. 
    The defendants had raised for example the question as to whether or not the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires a Pennsylvania court to apply not only the -- that part of the Wrongful Death Act of Massachusetts that creates the cause of action for wrongful death.

    Well, most of the -- most of the cases that we cite or at least all of the cases that are cited by the corporate defendant actually imposes a condition for transfer or they are – they are premised on the notion that there is such a federal conflict through all -- that's part and parcel of the statutory authority to effect the transfer and --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="734.807" stopTime="969.018">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    It would be entirely -- it would be entirely reasonable. 
    It would be entirely reasonable to fashion such conflicts rule on the basis of the transfer authority vested in the District Courts under 1404. 
    Now, I think in these circumstances and in view of these problems, the presence of the constitutional question of the fact that the state courts were going to pass on the problem the fact that the district judge thought that the transferee forum was bound by the law of the transferor forum, the fact that the United States as exposed to unlimited liability, all of these considerations it seems to me make it perfectly clear what the -- that when the district judge, nevertheless effected the transfer, he was not acting in such a fashion that it could be properly said he was abusing his discretion. 
    Indeed, when this question of applicability of -- some supposed Pennsylvania Kilberg rule to the cases, if the cases have been transferred to Massachusetts. 
    When this question was the sole question which formed the basis for an attack on the district judge's transfer order by certain of the plaintiffs involved in this litigation, they filed petitions for mandamus with the Court of Appeals limiting themselves just to this one question concerning which my remarks this morning had been addressed, the substantial prejudice resulting from the transfer or the possible prejudice resulting from transfer. 
    When that was the only ground raised in a petition for mandamus in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the panel, a very distinguished panel, Judges Biggs, Chief Judge Biggs and Judge Goodrich and Judge Hasty, when they were considering only that contention, they denied mandamus and implicit in their rejection was the view by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that there had been no abuse of discretion committed by the District Court so far as the substantial prejudice argument resulting from the transfer to Massachusetts was concerned. 
    It was only after additional, additional plaintiffs raised, they might have been brought argument requirement namely that they're failure to have a sort appointment as administrated in Massachusetts before they filed suit in Philadelphia, they argued that that precluded the transfer because their failure to seek (Inaudible) administration in Massachusetts prevented the Massachusetts forum from ever becoming a district in which the actions might have been brought. 
    It was only after the additional plaintiffs raised that particular question or contention in their petitions for mandamus in the Court of Appeals that the Court of Appeals decided to reexamine the issue and then came forth with the opinion that we had thought was the one principally involved on this petition for certiorari. 
    The Court of Appeals of course in that opinion held that is a result that they might have been brought requirement and the district judge was precluded from effecting a transcript. 
    We think that -- and it might have been brought requirement restrictive interpretation of 1404 (a). 
    The -- the consequences are -- and in truth, disastrous so far as that litigation is concerned. 
    A -- a single airplane accident has a -- given rise to as many as 60 or 70 different suits just against the Government in about 19 or 20 different District Courts.

    I don't think that it's the sole criteria and there are after all many additional far reaching considerations. 
    One of which I think turns on the effective functioning of the federal judiciary. 
    It -- it seems to me to be unseemly to have 19 district judges particularly in view of the tremendous congestion in so many of Metropolitan areas to have 19 different district judges.

    The cases started in 1960. 
    The district judge transferred the cases about a year and a half later. 
    Still a year later, the Court of Appeals decided the cases should stay in Massachusetts and Philadelphia. 
    Today, four years after the accident and approximately three and a half years after the suits were filed, we're still troubled by the question as to where the cases should be tried, not whether any of the defendants were negligent and if they were, how much would the damages be. 
    But we haven't -- has yet solved the question as to where these cases should be tried and that factor I think -- that factor I think is of extreme importance with respect to -- in the -- in the question I had set in my opening remarks, I did want to address myself to and that is whether or not the writ of mandamus is at all available in the Court of Appeals to challenge and to upset a District Court transfer order.

    The District judge in Massachusetts is waiting for this Court to decide whether he's going to have all of the cases as Judge Van Dusen ordered or whether he should go ahead and try just the 114. 
    That's entirely understandable because he's afraid that if he goes ahead even with pretrial, the transferred cases, if they ultimately are transferred, the lawyers in those transferred cases will contend that they're not bound at all by any of the pretrial orders of proceedings because they had opportunity to participate.

    I think that rather than sending this case back to the Court of Appeals with an opportunity to them to go again into this problem. 
    I think the case should go back to Judge Van Dusen with an instruction to reinstate his transfer order and then after these case has had been finally adjudicated, if there is any prejudice at all resulting or that will have resulted to the plaintiffs because of the transfer, then I think they can challenge the interlocutory transfer order and any prejudice flowing from it. 
    They can challenge it as the traditional federal policy against the piecemeal appeals indeed requires them to challenge it after -- after a final adjudication of liability, after a complete wrap up in disposition of the case by means of a final judgment, it will still be open to them to challenge it.

    Massachusetts? 
    No, Mr. Justice Clark, and the reason for that is that that Massachusetts' district judge is reluctant to go ahead and try these cases and in the event that this Court reinstates or in event the District Court's transfer order is ultimately upheld or reinstated, it would be necessary for him to go through extensive pretrial and perhaps trial procedures because if pretrial and trial procedures through which he would now go through with respect to the 114 cases now pending would of course not be binding on the plaintiffs in the Massachusetts cases.

    Now it seems -- seems to be immaterial. 
    In both instances, they felt that the district judge -- judge's order should not be set aside on mandamus but that if there -- still will be any prejudice or harm resulting to the plaintiffs, the determination of this entire proceedings, the appropriate time to raise the question of the propriety of the transfer is after final judgment has been entered.

    If the Court of Appeals is of the view as it apparently indicated in its opinion in this case that the interlocutory or the failure to exhaust the Interlocutory Appeals Act is not a bar to their issuance of mandamus, I would suppose that it would be entirely proper to imply from the Court of Appeals' refusal to issue the writ that they were not relying on that ground but that they were relying on the ground that there has been no abuse of discretion.

   Argument of John R. McConnell
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2322.105" stopTime="2323.197">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. McConnell.
speaker="john_r_mcconnell" startTime="2323.197" stopTime="2509.815">
    Mr. John R. McConnell 
    Good morning Your Honors and with permission of the Court as Your Honors know, I am here on behalf of the respondent plaintiffs to ask Your Honors to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals which held in effect that these actions maybe tried in Philadelphia where they were commenced. 
    The precise question of law to be decided in this case as I see it is whether or not a District Court Judge has the power as a matter of law to transfer an action to another District Court in which it could not have been commenced because of lack of capacity of the plaintiffs. 
    We advance to Your Honors three reasons why this question should be answered in the negative and the decision of the Court of Appeals affirmed, they are these - First, the decision of the Court of Appeals was in accordance with the express intent of Congress as construed by prior decisions of this and other courts. 
    Secondly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is in accordance with the policy of the states and the federal government as embodied in the rules of civil -- Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
    And thirdly, that decision should be affirmed because to reverse it would be to work grave prejudice to the substantive rights of these plaintiffs. 
    Now, if Your Honors will permit me before referring to those arguments in detail, I would like to make a brief reference to the facts. 
    In all of these cases, we have as plaintiffs, fiduciaries who lived in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 
    Each one of them was appointed fiduciary by an Orphans Court in Pennsylvania. 
    Each one of them represents a decedent who also lived in Pennsylvania and whose estate will be administered under the laws of Pennsylvania. 
    Each one of those decedents was a resident of Pennsylvania and started on this journey from Pennsylvania. 
    Now, if I may allude for one moment to -- a particular one of these cases, the case of Mrs. Frankenfield. 
    She is typical. 
    She happened to be a client of mine. 
    She came to me under these circumstances and asked me to take her case. 
    I agreed to do so. 
    I recommended that suit be commenced in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania because I learned that each of the defendants involved -- each of the defendants involved that I thought she had an action against did business in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 
    She agreed. 
    That was done. 
    Now, at this point in a small parenthesis, I would like to submit to Your Honors, I do not think it's fair to describe that conduct as forum-shopping. 
    That was a natural and normal thing for a -- a Pennsylvania fiduciary to do with respect to suits against the corporate defendants doing business in Pennsylvania.

speaker="john_r_mcconnell" startTime="2586.477" stopTime="2969.501">
    Mr. John R. McConnell 
    I agree with Your Honor but if we passed that point, then my opponent say that forum-shopping is a thing which this Court should -- should account on the negative side in deciding this case. 
    Now, I don't think it should but in any event, this wasn't forum-shopping it seems to me. 
    In the same parenthesis, I'd like to say this. 
    I do not think it's fair to say that when we took this action, we failed to qualify as ancillary fiduciaries in Massachusetts. 
    It seems to me that the word failure implies a duty. 
    I didn't notify the Prime Minister of Australia that I was going to make this argument this morning and I don't I think I failed to. 
    I could be said to have failed to notify him because I had no duty to notify him. 
    And in this case, I stress this point because 50% of a government's brief is built around the word "we failed to qualify" as ancillary administrators in Philadelphia. 
    We have -- in Massachusetts, we had no duty to do so and therefore, I think any consideration or failure in that regard ought to dropout of any consideration of this case. 
    Now, having commenced these suits, the defendants made a motion to dismiss and that motion was considered by the -- Judge Van Dusen, the District Court Judge and the motion was granted. 
    We applied to the Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus because the judge had not certified this was a -- and a -- eligible for interlocutory appeal and we could find nothing under the rules which suggested it would be proper to make a motion that he so certified. 
    Your Honor knows that the interlocutory -- if Your Honors know that the Interlocutory Appeals Act provides that it cannot be used unless the District Court judge certifies that it is an appealable question under the Interlocutory Appeals Act. 
    He didn't do that. 
    There is no precision -- procedure whereby we could ask him to do that so that's why we chose a writ of mandamus. 
    And thus the question became in the Court of Appeals, did the Court exceed his power in transferring these cases to a district in which they might not have been brought. 
    Therefore, the -- we get the first legal question and Your Honors have to consider. 
    Might these cases had been brought in the District Court of Massachusetts, what's the test? 
    If these plaintiffs had brought these actions in the District Court of Massachusetts and the defendant had moved to dismiss under the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17 (b), the Court must -- was required to dismiss them for this reason. 
    Rule 17 (b) as these defendants would have argued in Massachusetts says that the capacity to sue shall -- I'm just quoting only that much of it as it applies to our case, capacity to sue shall be determined by the law of the court of the state in which the court sits." 
    Therefore, the Massachusetts district court judge would have looked to the law of Massachusetts under that rule to determine whether or not we had capacity to sue. 
    We had not qualified, it never -- there was no reason for us to qualify as ancillary administrators up there and the law of Massachusetts is very clear that a foreign fiduciary may not bring an action in the State of Massachusetts and if he does his action without a qualification up there, if he does, his action should be dismissed. 
    So there is no doubt about what these cases could not have been brought in Massachusetts and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit so found. 
    Our opponents, the Government concedes that they would have had that defense in Massachusetts, but they -- but all of the defendants attempt to circumvent that conclusion by saying, "Well, if we had tried, we could've qualified up there." 
    Now, as a matter of fact if Your Honors please, qualification of an ancillary administrator in Massachusetts requires much more than a ministerial act. 
    It requires application to the probate court in Massachusetts which will -- after due notice of 30 or 15 days, depending upon whether it's a -- a -- an executor or an administrator which is applying, it requires application to the Court which will consider the appointment of the ancillary administrator and will normally follow a certain list of priorities which are -- in -- in making these appointments which are rather strictly followed. 
    The list of priorities in Massachusetts is, first, the widow or the husband; secondly, next of kin, thirdly, creditors, fourth, the public administrator. Some of our plaintiffs do not come within any of those categories. 
    In any event, cases cited in our brief show you that the Massachusetts court in this situation does not always appoint those who are otherwise ostensibly qualified, but appointment -- ancillary appointment in Massachusetts is a matter addressed of the discretion of the court. 
    So I say to Your Honors and our brief will elaborate this, there is very grave doubt whether or not -- even if we had applied, we would've qualified in these cases. 
    In addition to that fact Your Honor, we had no -- we never -- there was no reason for us to try, if Your Honor please. 
    And if one more went -- before I get to that one. 
    In -- in addition to the facts that I've just indicated, these suits which we’re now considering were commenced with -- some of them were commenced with only a few weeks of the expiration of the 1-year-statute limitations. 
    One of them was commenced on the very last day that suit could've been commenced. 
    Now, in Massachusetts, we are required by law to advertise our application for letters of -- ancillary letters up there for either 15 or 30 days. 
    So that there wasn't time to do the things required up there before the statue of limitations expired. 
    But in any event, Your Honors have told us clearly in the case of Hoffman versus Blaski that the test as to whether or not a -- an action could've been brought in the transferee district is not to be applied as of the time of transfer -- the application for transfer, but rather the test is to be applied as of the time the suit is commenced. 
    That was the square holding in Hoffman versus Blaski as Your Honors will recall and this is detailed in my brief. 
    So the only proper test in this case is, were these plaintiffs qualified to bring this action in Massachusetts as of the day they commenced them in Pennsylvania and there is no room for argument, they were not.

    Mr. John R. McConnell 
    Now, I have indicated that the -- up to this point of -- it discussed what the statute says and the test by which that statute is to be applied. 
    Now, let me consider the -- the construction of that statute as construed by other courts. 
    In the first place up to this point, I've pointed out that Hoffman versus Blaski requires the applications that were vindicated up to now. 
    Has this exact problem ever been considered before, not by this Court? 
    This Court has never considered exactly the set of circumstances involved on this case, but it has -- the same set of circumstances namely, a fiduciary with the problem of capacity to sue has been considered in other situations. 
    In the case of Felchlin versus American Smelting for example cited in our brief, exactly this situation was considered and the Court held that it could not be transferred because the plaintiffs lacked capacity to sue. 
    I know very well that those decisions in no way bind this Court and yet I think it's significant that other judicial minds having considered this problem have reached the same conclusion. 
    And no other court having considered this problem has reached the opposite conclusion and so I feel confident in saying that the -- the -- this construction for which -- which was reached by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is correct. 
    I also have said to Your Honors that the second reason why this -- the judgment ought to be affirmed is because it is in importance with the policy of the federal government and the law of the state as exempt -- as embodied in Rule 17. 
    There are very good reasons why the states provide that foreign fiduciaries should qualify before they bring a suit.

speaker="john_r_mcconnell" startTime="3344.972" stopTime="3401.970">
    Mr. John R. McConnell 
    No sir, on my position and -- I would say it sir is that the federal statute 1404 (a) and Rule 17 (b) control the situation and by Rule 17 (b) which says that capacity shall be determined by the law of the state in which the court sits. 
    By that rule, this Court has said, our test will be the law of the state. 
    And there are very good reasons for such a rule and such a policy, where the states have said, certain plaintiffs may not sue, the United States would not want to circumvent the policies of those cases by saying, "Well in our case, in our courts, you can sue anyway." 
    It is an honest matter of fact Mr. Justice Harlan, that if we have started these suits in Massachusetts, they would've been dismissed beyond any question. 
    Why therefore should we have -- would regard them as actions which could've brought up there now, when we bring them in another district?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3401.970" stopTime="3404.535">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What about the (Inaudible)?
speaker="john_r_mcconnell" startTime="3404.535" stopTime="3513.296">
    Mr. John R. McConnell 
    Yes sir. 
    But in Hoffman versus Blaski, you said it didn't make any difference at all whether the defendants would be willing to waive their defense. 
    This Court said that in Hoffman versus Blaski that the test was whether or not the plaintiffs had the right to bring the action without -- yes, that was (Inaudible), yes sir, (Inaudible). 
    Now, if Your Honor please, I come to the third and the point which -- which are upon -- which our opponents have relied the most. 
    They say to Your Honors, consider the consequences of a decision in accordance with the -- with precedent in this situation. 
    They say, consider the consequences this would have on the administration of the federal courts because it would mean that fiduciary cases could not be transferred under 1404 (a). 
    I think if we're going to look at the considerations that they suggest, the practical results which will follow from an affirmance of this decision, we have to look at them all. 
    And I think the first consequence we ought to look to is the consequence to the plaintiffs. 
    This is not -- this is not a -- a multiple litigation as far as Mrs. Frankenfield is concerned. 
    She has one case and to her, this is a single case. 
    As a fiduciary, it's far easier and far cheaper for her to bring the suit in the district where the defendants did business with her rather than to go up some place up to Massachusetts. 
    And in that connection Your Honors may recall, this is one of the shortest plane distance you could get. 
    If we're considering rules for plane cases, remember Philadelphia to Boston if you don't think it's very far, it is not the normal -- is not the average I mean to say, plane trip. 
    So that this is the minimum if you're considering inconvenience to the plaintiffs, but that these plaintiffs are not --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3513.296" stopTime="3516.335">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I didn't understand that. 
    I don't understand --
speaker="john_r_mcconnell" startTime="3516.335" stopTime="3517.002">
    Mr. John R. McConnell 
    It will be --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3517.002" stopTime="3517.496">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- your point, I heard what you're saying.
speaker="john_r_mcconnell" startTime="3517.496" stopTime="3609.973">
    Mr. John R. McConnell 
    Yes, it will be a great inconvenience to Mrs. Frankenfield to have to conduct her case up in Boston, but that is a short plane trip. 
    In the average plane crash case, the fiduciary will have to go much further than from Philadelphia to Boston. 
    And if Your Honors are considering the rule by this test, you ought to bear in mind that these cases may involve fiduciaries going from San Francisco to Philadelphia for example. 
    In other words, this is a minimum case on that aspect. 
    Now, if we're going to consider the consequences of the decision here, let's consider it's affect on the witnesses. 
    The trial judge did an odd thing in this respect. 
    He counted up the number of witnesses which the defendants could call, not would call, which they could call, who lived in the vicinity of Boston and he found there were 66. 
    And he counted up the number of witnesses who'd -- eye witnesses who didn't live in the vicinity of Boston and found there were 17. 
    And he said, "That shows that it's more convenient for the witnesses that this case be tried in Boston." 
    He overlooked the fact that there were -- in our -- I represent 28 different estates and there's seven admiralty case -- 23 different estates and there's seven admiralty cases. 
    In our cases, there are 30 plaintiffs who will be witnesses and if we allow them only one other witness on damages, that makes 60 plus the 17, would make 77 witnesses will have to go up to Boston as against -- at the very most and it wouldn't be that much, 66 coming down to Philadelphia.

    That's right and the -- opportunity for advancement and so forth. 
    Now, that is leaving out of any account expert witness whom you might call and other fact witnesses. 
    Well, who would tip the balance still further? 
    And if Your Honor please, it was suggested to you by my opponents that all of these -- that the issue in this case is going to be the birds into the engine. 
    That maybe the issue but we really don't know the other issues that will be involved in the case because we have not been permitted to pursue discovery in this case through all these years. 
    The Circuit Court or the District Court, the Court of Appeals and this Court has ruled that we may not pursue discovery while this preliminary litigation is in progress. 
    So we don't really know what the issues are going to be and therefore, we don't know where the witnesses are going to come from. 
    Now, let me get now down to the real heart of the case and the one which was discussed to the greatest length yesterday. 
    A part from this inconvenience to witnesses and to the party's plaintiff, what about the grave impairment of the de -- of the plaintiffs' substantive rights? 
    Here's the situation on that aspect of the case as I see it. 
    As Your Honors know, under Klaxon versus Stentor, a District Court must apply the conflicts rule of the state in which it sits. 
    Now, in Massachusetts as you know, there's a limitation of damages in this action of $20,000. 
    In Pennsylvania there is no such limitation and there is very strong constitutional -- there is very strong Pennsylvania policy embodied in two places in its Constitution indicating that Pennsylvania would not enforce a limitation of that kind within the State of Pennsylvania. 
    Judge Van Dusen has indicated correctly that this question has not recently been decided in Pennsylvania. 
    There are old cases in which the court has refused to enforce penalties. 
    Your Honors know that the conflicts law on this point is in the state of flux. 
    The old rule was that the damaged law of the site of the injury would be the law applied. 
    But under the redraft of the restatement which has not yet been adopted and in fact, maybe isn't even published yet. 
    And under the Kilberg case and the Pearson case, it is evident that the law is changing so that someday in the not too distant future, the conflicts of law rule is going to be the law of damages will apply which is the law of the state having the most contacts with the event. 
    Pennsylvania has not recently passed on that point but because of its constitutional policy, I believe that the best probabilities are that Pennsylvania would adopt the so-called Pearson conflicts rule. 
    That means then that a District Court sitting in Pennsylvania under Klaxon versus Stentor obliged to follow the conflicts of law rule of Pennsylvania, would have to consider what Pennsylvania Supreme Court would decide on this question. 
    If we send this case up to Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Court will do what? 
    Which conflicts of law rule will he apply? 
    Under Klaxon versus Stentor, this point is not decided and as Your Honors know better than I, there are cases each way on this point. 
    They're cited in our brief. Some cases say that transferee court should apply the conflicts of law rule of the state of the transferor. 
    Other cases say that the transferee court should apply the conflicts of law rule of the state in which it sits. 
    This is uncertain therefore, --

    Yes, I'd like to address myself to that. 
    First, note that if you don't settle that there is grave hazard in our going to Massachusetts and it's not settled unless you settle it in this case. 
    Now, if we do go to Massachusetts, I mean if it is settled, we do go to Massachusetts and this Court directs the Massachusetts court in the sense to follow the federal rule and apply the conflicts of law rule of the transferor state, then the District Court judge would decide what to do, would decide that it was Pennsylvania law that applied therefore that in our cases the limitation would not apply and then what would he do? 
    Would he submit our cases to the same jury that would decide the -- the Massachusetts residence cases and tell them that for your neighbors, you find the limitation of $20,000 and for us, for the Pennsylvania strangers, there is no limitation? 
    Do you not believe Your Honor that our case would be at jeopardy and hazard under that situation? 
    Now you may say to me, "He can solve that problem by saying, we won't try these cases before the same jury, we'll try them before separate juries."

    If you do settle that point and incidentally as a member of the Bar, I hope you will because this -- the better rule is that the transferee court were to apply the conflicts law rule of the transferor state and the bench in part needs to be in enlightened on that need to be --

    Mr. John R. McConnell 
    It necessarily follows if Your Honor please, but that's another reason for affirming the decision of the Court of Appeals. 
    If you let these cases be tried in Pennsylvania, we don't have to go through this extremely complicated business. 
    This -- the very complication is to the prejudice of the plaintiffs in these cases. 
    There's no problem as far as we're concerned if we stay in Pennsylvania. 
    Now, I say -- I would like to say one thing at the end and then stop. 
    If Your Honors please, I hope -- I feel that my duty to my clients to say this, this is not an academic question. 
    We are not engaged in an academic exercise. 
    I represent 28 different plaintiffs and the captions and complaints show that at least 17 of these plaintiffs are widows who lost their husbands and bread winners in this case and a number of them have a number of children under five years of age that they're going to have to raise. 
    When I say to Your Honors that transfer to Massachusetts is in mitigation of their substantive rights, that's a lot nice phrase. 
    It floats very trippingly from the tongue. But if you translate that into Anglo-Saxon, that is the difference between $20,000 and $200,000 to a widow who has young children to raise. 
    So I say, if you're going to consider extraneous circumstances such as the convenience of the Government or the courts, let's remember that the convenience of the courts in the process of litigation necessarily is secondary to the rights of the individuals and this is the Court that establishes that. 
    And therefore, if Your Honor please, I urge you to affirm the decision of the Third Circuit and -- and let this case end here and these cases be tried in Philadelphia. 
    Thank you.

    And by the test of the law therefore, to send this to Massachusetts would be in litigation of our rights and therefore transfer should be refused.

    What if you stayed in the United States District Court of Pennsylvania and that court after canvassing the state law, including the -- including the state conflict of law -- law decided that that required a limitation of $20,000 in these cases. 
    At the end of it, we couldn't -- this Court couldn't do anything about it.

    Mr. John R. McConnell 
    In the case of Gulf Oil Corporation versus Gilbert, Your Honors pointed out the considerations which should be given weight on these matters. 
    And one of them that you pointed out was that it's better for the local judge to determine local law. And this Court knows that it always prefers to have law decided by local judges. 
    This is what you said in the Gulf Oil case. 
    There is an appropriateness too in having the trial of a diversity case in the form that is at home with the state law must govern the case, that's Pennsylvania in this situation rather than having the court in some other forum, Massachusetts, untangled problems in conflict of laws. 
    That's our case, our position.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I understand that but why is it more of -- that maybe better as a matter of jurisprudence but why is that -- follow that it is more favorable to you or to your -- or to your chances of -- of convincing the Court that the $20,000 limitation should've -- shouldn't apply to your plaintiffs.

    Because we think -- to answer Your Honor precisely, we think that this will be clearer to a Court of Appeals judges for the Third -- Third Circuit for example that Pennsylvania would apply its own law in this situation than it would be to a Massachusetts judge who has been trained and has grown up and lived under the rule that -- of the older conflicts rule, (Inaudible), and the limitation there.

    (Inaudible)-- if Massachusetts could, if the suit were filed in Massachusetts, constitutionally apply its law by reasons of the contract so as to render a judgment for 200 -- for $20,000 only and while Pennsylvania by reason of its conflict, could constitutionally apply its laws so as to give $200,000 --
