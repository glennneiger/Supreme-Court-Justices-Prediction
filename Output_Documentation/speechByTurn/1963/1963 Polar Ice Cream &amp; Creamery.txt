    Mr. Johnson S. Savary 
    -- may it please the Court. 
    Before the lunch recess, I had finished summarizing my argument as to point one that Polar claimed was the reason that this order or the regulation on the statute of the Florida Milk Commission violate the Commerce Clause. 
    Now, the second point that they urged in their mini complaint was that because Florida Milk Commission had them pay the Florida producers 61 cents per gallon for milk that after they did that it economically, they were unable to go out and compete for milk. 
    And very briefly, I state that because they readily admit in their record, in the testimony and this is the record back at the trial as they are able to go out and buy milk at any time for 30 cents a gallon or 35 cents of gallon, 36 cents a gallon, that economically they have not been heard at all by virtue of the requirement that they pay the Florida producers, a Class I producer price. 
    Now, in summary as to the Commission position as to whether or not it violates the Commerce Clause, we steadfastly and affirmatively state, may it please the Court, that we are dealing only with a local problem, that we're not in any way attempting to regulate commerce, that we're not in any way attempting to go into Alabama or Mississippi or Arkansas or Wisconsin, any other state and this circle back buys his milk. 
    We are not going in that state of regulating it. 
    We are merely dealing with a local problem in Pensacola that is similar to the problem we have in each of our other four milk marketing areas. 
    Now, --

    Mr. Johnson S. Savary 
    May it -- Mr. -- Mr. Justice Black, we feel that it is not a -- a burden on interstate commerce in any respects because we're dealing with only a local problem first under our police power and that is to ensure a wholesome supply of fresh milk to the consumers in the State of Florida and to promote the dairy industry in the State of Florida which is -- which were charged with under our law, which has been upheld by this Court -- the (Inaudible) law which has been upheld by this Court many times before. 
    We don't --

    Which -- which case -- which case do you refer as upholding that power?
speaker="johnson_s_savary" startTime="256.026" stopTime="348.249">
    Mr. Johnson S. Savary 
    As I understand the -- the original case of Nebbia versus New York upheld the right of a State to impose a Milk Control law, to promote the dairy industry within the State of New York and the Florida laws model quite substantially after the New York law. 
    Also it is quite similar to the Pennsylvania law and the Virginia law. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Goldberg asked me right before lunch about this base plan and wanting to know if were there any decisions on it. 
    There is a decision in the State of Florida which has been cited our brief which is the Borden Company versus Odham, the previous milk -- Chairman of the Milk Commission and that's cited in 121 So.2d 625. 
    And that case upheld the right of the Florida Milk Commission to -- as a -- as a measure of putting the producers and distributor together, upheld the right to assign bases of a producer and a plant. 
    And that would throughout the State of Florida and the four areas with the exception of the Pensacola area at that time, Pensacola was not under the Florida Milk Commission so there was no burying of that case on Pensacola. 
    But again the Florida Milk Commission, the right in the other four areas to pass such a base order that we have passed and we have an application in those four areas and it's the same base order that we have now passed for the Pensacola area.

    Why?
speaker="johnson_s_savary" startTime="524.335" stopTime="547.977">
    Mr. Johnson S. Savary 
    The effect of our statue is that we will license a distributor. 
    For instance, a new distributor could come into Pensacola today and be licensed as a milk distributor, if the otherwise meets the -- the requirements of our law. 
    He is not got any previous producers tied to him in effect until there is a base building period in his plant. 
    He is free to buy his milk where he wishes to buy.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    When he gets the license under this, you say he's not. 
    He's got to buy from them at 61 cents I understood you to say, until all their milk's exhausted and during that time, he can't buy any from outside of the State to supply his need.
speaker="johnson_s_savary" startTime="564.388" stopTime="584.877">
    Mr. Johnson S. Savary 
    Yes sir, except that going back prior to the time the Milk Commission went back into jurisdiction, these are the same producers heed by contract with buying and paying the same price for prior the time we went into control, and we merely picked up where that left off and assign these producers a base in that plant which they had already previously earned.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What effect does that have on the interstate commerce question involved?

    Mr. Johnson S. Savary 
    In -- in the Pensacola area, I don't think it has any effect on it Mr. Justice Black, because you have a deficit area and secondly, because you have a -- a guarantee of milk from Florida producers to a Florida plant to be sold locally in the State of Florida. 
    You're dealing only with a local problem under the police power. 
    I don't think that that Milk Commission may -- could tell Polar they had to sell Florida milk in Alabama or had to sell Florida milk in Mississippi or any other State.

    Now there are two cases which I have found on this base system of allocation. 
    Now, in the case in this Court had before the Lehigh Valley Coop versus United States which came out of Pennsylvania. 
    In that case, this Court was asked to decide whether or not the -- the milk administrator had the right under the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1937 to pay as you order, the compensatory payment order which it attempt -- which it passed and attempted to enforce and that order was struck down because the administrator did not have that authority. 
    Now under that case, the Section 8 (c) (f) (g) of the Act, states that no marketing agreement or order applicable to milk and its products in any marketing area shall prohibit or in any manner, limit in the case or products of milk, the marketing in that area of any milk or product of any other production area -- area in the United States. 
    Now, in that case as I understood the Court's decision, it suggested that even though the "compensatory-payment” plant in that case was struck down, that nonetheless an administrator under the provisions of this Act could still pass an order which stated that the "compensatory-payment" could be based not as the base in case, but be based upon the difference between what he pays for the milk and a Class I price in effect in the pool of that particular time. 
    Now, in the case of case of Bailey Farm Dairy versus Anderson and this case is not in our brief and I like to give the Court citation to this case.

    We with that, say that in order to ensure to our citizens a wholesome supply of fresh fluid milk that the police power in the station be exercised to regulate the milk industry. 
    Because of the peculiarities with the milk industry which is not present in -- in any other industry that I know of as it is present with the milk industry. 
    And secondly in with that, we're interested in not protecting but promoting the economic industry of milk in the State of Florida. 
    In the Bailey case and very briefly, the Milk Order stated that a milk handler must allocate to his milk producers, I believe its 85% or 90% of all of the milk produced by those producers into Class I sales before he can bring in out-of-state milk into that area and give it a Class I sales price. 
    That the only difference between that base order and the base order we have is 10% and that is the only difference.

    In summary, I would like to say that position of Florida Milk Commission that in the exercise of police power granted in the statute that we do not feel the we are burdening interstate commerce but if we do is only incidental and it's promiscuous in the exercise of our police power to govern and control merely a local problem.

    And I want to correct something that I said here this morning by any plaintiffs and I want to apologize. 
    I said the case with just cause, was the Odham case. 
    The Odham case which is reported in 121 So.2d 625, considered the same problem but it was the case which made the Milk Commission go to the Legislature and have the just cause redefined so that the case that considers that squarely and says that he cannot terminate that relationship without just cause is Florida Dairy versus Florida Milk Commission reported at a 149 So.2d, 867. 
    And I cite that at page 23 of our main brief, so I did want to clear that up but they -- they touch on the both -- on the same problem but this later case was after the Legislature had amended this to see that they could not terminate the relationship without just cause. 
    And the point that rose in that was the distributor came in and said he was losing money and he wanted to terminate the relationship. 
    And the Court said, “No, there's been no abuse of discretion because sufficient just cause has not been shown even though you are losing money by having to take this milk from them, you cannot terminate the relationship so that there is another part of the same scheme that forces a milk distributor into a permanent marriage which he cannot terminate except upon the Milk Commission giving him the permission so to do and he --

    Mr. Joe J. Harrell 
    Yes sir, I would like to straighten you out and there again, instead of conjecture -- if we will go to the record, I think that might be heavy. 
    The Administrator of the Milk Commission, Mr. Fisher, testified at pages 147 and 148 of the record, that if he uses Florida milk for the military, it would be Class I and he would pay 61 cents a gallon. 
    And the next question was, “You know that's true?” 
    And Mr. Fisher says, “Yes, I know it and you do too.” 
    Mr. Fisher was the Administrator of the Florida Milk Commission. 
    He was the headman in-charge and that is as clear as the record can be. 
    So that leaves us with this. 
    Your question Mr. Justice White, all throughout this argument, has been to determine whether or not there is any requirement if a gallon of Florida milk goes into the military to pay 61 cents for it. 
    That has been as I understand the problem. 
    And I tell you that the record says exactly that's what is required to be. 
    Now, there's nothing --

    Mr. Joe J. Harrell 
    Alright, let me -- let me tell you how this came about. 
    There was a proposed military order which they talked about but the producers voted not to be bound by that so that that automatically took that out of the case and left in the 61 cents price.

    Insofar as the Pensacola area is concerned, there is not. 
    So that the only order and the only requirement for military milk used in the Pensacola area is 61 cents a gallon.

    Mr. Joe J. Harrell 
    That is not absolutely correct.

    Mr. Joe J. Harrell 
    I'm frank to say that the record is devoid of that particular subject because if the Milk Commission took the position that because the producers voted down the Military Milk Order in effect that the only thing logically to draw from that was that military milk was of no concern in this case, that is the position make taken today. 
    But yet, the other side of the coin is if you use a gallon of Florida milk for our good Florida boys based at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, you must pay 61 cents a gallon for it.

    Mr. Joe J. Harrell 
    Yes sir, yes sir. 
    There's only one other thing. 
    There've been several references that Polar is paying the same price to producers that after the Milk Commission came in that he paid the four. 
    That is incorrect in our site for -- so that the Court will understand that page. 
    The record at page 135 which clearly said that and that is this, 61 cents was paid only for an agreed amount of milk and all over that amount of milk which was furnished by these producers we're paying for at $4 a hundred weight or 35.5 cents per gallon. 
    So that's a big difference as opposed to the contention, otherwise and the record bears that out and I would like to call the Court's attention. 
    Another thing is this, the Court might have some puzzle as to how could -- how did this problem arise now when opposing counsel said the Milk Commission had previously been in the Pensacola area and then was out of the area. 
    The answer to that is this. 
    This is the first time since the establishment of the Milk Commission that there's ever been a base system of allocation which takes that Pensacola area. 
    This was the first time. 
    And when they were in the Milk Commission -- when the Milk Commission was in before, there was never a based allocation system and of course that's the whole bias of the thing. 
    And I think this Court safely understands it and I appreciate your time.
