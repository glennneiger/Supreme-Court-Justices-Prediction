    Mr. Isaac N. Groner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The issue in this case which is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is the validity under the Constitution under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, of the action of the Fifth Circuit in granting the motion of the government to dismiss the appeal on the ground that no notice of appeal had been received by the District Court within 10 days after petitioner's sentencing. 
    Petitioner was convicted on three counts arising out of a post office robbery, upon a trial in which he was represented by court appointed counsel. 
    On January 15, 1962, petitioner was sentenced to consecutive terms aggregating 20 years. 
    The court appointed counsel was physically present at the sentencing. 
    The record of the sentencing shows that petitioner himself asked the Court “May I appeal this case as an insolvent?” 
    The District Court replied, “Oh yes, you always have a right to appeal. 
    The government provides for that.” Thereupon the sentencing proceeding was terminated. 
    After the sentencing, petitioner and his court appointed counsel had a talk. 
    The record before this Court contains letters from both the counsel and the petitioner relating to this conversation. 
    The counsel's letter contains the following. 
    At that time I told Mr. Fallen that the firm with which I am associated, did not wish me to undertake any further criminal matters either by appeal or otherwise and therefore I suggested that Mr. Fallen secure another attorney without delay so as not to forfeit his right of appeal. 
    Counsel then departed out of the case so far as he was concerned at that time.

    Mr. Isaac N. Groner 
    He did not notify the Court Your Honor that he was withdrawing so far as this record was concerned. 
    In fact Your Honor he was reappointed under the circumstances, I'll come to shortly, which indicates very clearly that the court recognized the propriety, evidently under the terms of its original appointment of his disassociating himself from petitioner at this point. 
    There is no indication that there was any other communication with the District Court after this conversation by the counsel until he was reappointed. 
    On January 29, the fourteenth day subsequent to petitioner's sentencing, the District Court received two letters, each dated January 23, written by petitioner, the one constituting a motion for a new trial and the other a notice of appeal. 
    These then were the first papers received by the District Court subsequent to the sentencing, so that prior to January 29 and between January 15 and January 29, there was no communication with the District Court by the petitioner or by his court appointed counsel. 
    Petitioner had been incarcerated during the trial in Jacksonville, Florida where the trial took place. 
    The day following his sentencing, he was removed to the hospital at the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta and it was from the Federal penitentiary that the letters were transmitted to the District Court. 
    On January 30, the day after the letters were received, pursuant to a request from the District Court, the court appointed counsel sent a letter to the court, summarizing the facts to which I have already referred. 
    On February 1 --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="330.327" stopTime="332.814">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean that fact that he could no longer --
speaker="isaac_n_groner" startTime="332.814" stopTime="696.379">
    Mr. Isaac N. Groner 
    Yes, yes Your Honor. 
    The fact that he had told petitioner that he and petitioner had had a conversation subsequent to the sentencing, that he had told petitioner that his firm did not permit him or would not permit him to undertake any further criminal matters and that petitioner ought to do something else about getting another attorney. 
    On February 1, the District Court filed an order which expressly reappointed this court appointed counsel as counsel for the limited purpose of presenting the question whether petitioner's motion for a new trial was timely filed, and if so whether it should be granted. 
    The District Court found, in this order, that while appeal was discussed on January 15 with Mr. Fallen, the provisions of the rules with respect to new trial were not discussed with him, nor the requirements of law with respect to appeal in forma pauperis. 
    The District Court found that the representation of petitioner by court appointed counsel had ended on the date of the sentencing. 
    Under these circumstances, it is undoubtedly an undeniably the fact that this court appointed counsel took no action and felt himself under no assignment or responsibility to the petitioner with respect to either the motion for new trial or the notice of appeal. 
    This counsel does not claim that he advised petitioner as to the time limits, specified in the rule. 
    Nor does he claim that he provided petitioner with any assistance whatsoever. 
    The record before the Court is sufficiently complete to be absolutely clear and unquestionable that this court appointed counsel did not represent petitioner and did not afford him the assistance of counsel at any time during the 10-day period subsequent to the sentencing or at any time prior to his being reappointed by the Court. 
    On February 21, the District Court denied the motion for a new trial on the merits. 
    It expressly did not decide the issue of timeliness. 
    On the same day, the court appointed counsel filed the formal notice of appeal and the requisite papers for appeal as an indigent. 
    On February 26, such an appeal was allowed by the District Court. 
    In the Court of Appeals, after the government had filed its motion to dismiss, another counsel was appointed to represent petitioner for the purpose of the government's motion. 
    The Court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal by a two to one vote. 
    The majority found that the petitioner had raised no constitutional issues, but Judge Reese, in dissent, called attention to the fact that the defendant did not have counsel of his own choice or court appointed counsel throughout the 10-day period allowed for filing his notice of appeal, that he was not adequately advised of his rights, was recognized by the District Court. 
    Upon these facts, petitioner's first contention here is that the Court of Appeals' judgment cannot stand because it is in violation of petitioner's right to counsel. 
    This appeal was dismissed on the basis of papers filed by petitioner himself without the assistance of counsel during the time when he had no court appointed counsel and when he had not waved, in any way, his right to counsel. 
    Here we are dealing with the Federal system where as this Court had pointed out in Hardy against the United States, the appeal is a matter of right and where the appellant is entitled to the aid of counsel unless he insists on being his own. 
    The cases of this Court in our view, leaves no room for doubt that the right to counsel under the Constitution as well as the Federal statues and rules extends to trails on the one hand and to appeals on the other. 
    A Court may not constitutionally convict if the defendant has been deprived of his right to counsel at the trial and appellate court may not constitutionally affirm if the appellant has been deprived of his right to counsel on appeal. 
    It clearly follows that an appellate court may not dismiss the appeal if the appellant has been deprived of right to counsel in the submission of the appeal papers. 
    This case itself is a most eloquent illustration and demonstration of the consequences of failing to accord the right of counsel, during the period immediately after the sentencing.

    There is no appointment of counsel either by a document or by an oral statement of the Court. 
    The fact is that he departed from the petitioner's subsequent attempting and the fact is that he was reappointed by the court.

    No, this is not such a situation. 
    On the other hand, Your Honor this is a situation where petitioner is confined to a wheel chair, where he was confined under guard in a hospital during the trail at Jacksonville Florida. 
    This conversation that we are speaking of, took place on January the 15th, the very, his own statement indicate that subsequent to this conversation he was taken back to the Jacksonville hospital, not permitted to have visited. 
    The record shows that on the very next day, he was transported by the government from Jacksonville to Atlanta and the record indicates from his statements that he was ill and it was in the hospital at Atlanta and that the first day that he felt well enough to write, he did write the letter on January 23rd and --

    Now the only reply to the extent that I understand the government's position is that the record does not disclose with a certainty or with that increased certainty that would accompany a remand that the letter was mailed on the January 23rd, I am sure that the government can express its own position. 
    What is indicated in the record is a statement by petitioner that he did deposit the letter in the hospital, prison hospital mail box on January the 23. 
    The record also indicates that the district Court assumed that the letters had been mailed or at least that the petitioner had made evidence a desire for a new trail, asked for an appeal on the eighth day. 
    The government without indicating in anyway on what bases it speculation or its position indicates that the case ought to be remanded --

    On which basis?
speaker="isaac_n_groner" startTime="993.190" stopTime="1073.700">
    Mr. Isaac N. Groner 
    I was very interested in sitting and listening to the previous case, that the Solicitor General of the United States called attention to the fact that testimony after the event did not have to be helpful, and he called attention to the fact that such testimony is have to be highly speculative and that those involved would be very, would be very likely to try to defend what they have done. 
    And we submit that that would certainly happen on this point, would there be a remand on whether or not the letter was mailed. 
    But in any event, Your Honors, our primary thrust here is on the right to counsel and as to that there is not dispute in the record, there can be no material fact to be explored upon any remand. 
    And we would submit to Your Honors that had the court appointed counsel promptly, had he felt that he was under a continuing obligation under a continuing responsibility and had he filed within time the very notice of appeal and other appeal papers which he later filed after reappointment by the Court, this case would of course have long since disposed up on its merit.

    Mr. Groner is there any rule of that District Court stating the time that the appointment to represent a defendant that his trail terminates? In other words after he was sentenced, was this lawyer obligated to represent him or had he, had he fulfilled his obligation of assignment?

    Mr. Groner isn't your real (Inaudible) basic charge that a rule is not a constitutional thing for this Court, you got have some looseness in the joints to see that justice is done in the end as the rule prescribed.
speaker="isaac_n_groner" startTime="1127.276" stopTime="1257.484">
    Mr. Isaac N. Groner 
    Well, that certainly is a position, that one of the positions that we take. 
    There is no question about it and we would strongly submit Your Honor that is a case which very dramatically and forcefully illustrates that there must be some plan to join. 
    The special factors here including the absence of the right of counsel, including the writing and mailing of the letters within time although we seek by the District Court outside of time and the action or inaction by the District Court all add up to the conclusion that it was very unjust to deprive this appellant of the right of appeal and even the majority below were moved in what I at least say as a very unusual expression. 
    They were moved to express their sympathy with this defendant and certainly I would think that they would not express sympathy unless they felt absolutely ironbound by a rule of law. 
    We certainly submit that they are not to have so felt that the rules involved, the Federal rules of criminal procedure there are rules which do permit some flexibility for the obviously exceptional case. 
    Now we would submit on the right to counsel, that the right to counsel extends to all the stages of the criminal proceeding, that the concept of right to counsel is that there is a right to the assistance of counsel unless there is knowing waiver of that right we would submit that, under the Sixth Amendment, under Rule 44 that there is with absolutely clarity that the right extends to all stages, this is the phrasing of Rule 44, but there is no need to show prejudice although of course in this case there was prejudice and that if this right does apply on all stages, the record is clear that at this particular stage and this particular case that right was denied, and therefore the judgment below should be reversed. 
    If there are no further questions I would like to reserve the balance of time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Justice Clark, the mail procedures today are that the mail is picked up five days a week in the Federal penitentiaries. 
    At the time that this case takes place, January of 1962, mail was picked up twice a week, this is the result of fairly offhand investigation and that time seems, this is the Atlanta penitentiary where appellant was, that time seems to be Tuesdays and Fridays.

    At the time of this case, when -- at the time of sentence and he was immediately removed to the Atlanta penitentiary where he was said he was sick, this was primarily a bad case of flu. 
    He went to the Atlanta penitentiary with flu, and he was put immediately in the prison hospital. There are mail facilities in the prison hospital.

    Right. 
    Now this case of course involves only one issue and that is whether Fallen's appeal was timely within the meaning of Rule of 37 (a). 
    There are two subordinate questions under that. 
    One is whether Fallen did everything that was required of him within the meaning of the rule, that sort of the basic question. 
    The second question the petitioner has made the basis of his oral argument seems to me to be something that you only arrive at if he didn't do everything he should have and that is whether what failures of counsel there may have been excused is not taking all the actions he should have taken. 
    The basic facts have been stated by Mr. Groner, a notice of appeal arrived in the District Court along with new trial motion on the fourteenth day before a date put on it by the prisoner Fallen which is the eighth day after sentence. 
    He had been represented by counsel through trial and its sentencing and for that reason the District Court did not advice him of his right to appeal or asked if he wanted an appeal noted forthwith.

    The new trial step is almost automatically in the hands of lawyer appointed for the trial. 
    A new trial must be filed, a motion for new trial must filed within five days after verdict, not judgment since sentencing rarely comes within five days of verdict, prisoners almost always have -- defendants almost always have counsel for those five days during which the new trial motion must be filed.

    One of those is when Fallen in fact gave his notice of appeal to the prison authorities and another is what he discussed with counsel during the conference of an indeterminate length that took place after sentencing. 
    The counsel said that conference took an hour and a half, Fallen suggested it was few minutes, we have no idea what was discussed there.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1826.711" stopTime="1837.731">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    (Inaudible) had filed a notice of appeal, one of the perfectly obvious was that the man wanted to appeal and he wouldn't have a lawyer.
speaker="philip_b_heymann" startTime="1837.731" stopTime="1854.317">
    Mr. Philip B. Heymann 
    I suppose there are two answers Mr. Justice White, one is that the clerk probably took quite seriously the language of the rule that says he shall only file notice of appeal with his signature and not with the defendant's signature if the defendant without counsel at sentencing.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1854.317" stopTime="1860.916">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well the general fact with these lawyers is not to do anything and just file a motion for a new trail and he did say that?
speaker="philip_b_heymann" startTime="1860.916" stopTime="1867.360">
    Mr. Philip B. Heymann 
    No, no. 
    I was suggesting, I did say that but I was suggesting that generally the defendant very regularly the defendant files a --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1867.360" stopTime="1871.097">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the county clerk is supposed to think that this lawyer will or won't take care of these appeals.

    Mr. Philip B. Heymann

speaker="philip_b_heymann" startTime="1872.475" stopTime="1875.396">
    Mr. Philip B. Heymann 
    I suppose he should think that the lawyer will not.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1875.396" stopTime="1878.100">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And why shouldn't he file the notice of appeal?
speaker="philip_b_heymann" startTime="1878.100" stopTime="1893.729">
    Mr. Philip B. Heymann 
    Because he is only authorized to sign a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant when it's been – when he is not represented by counsel. 
    Now this may not be -- this may be an overly technical reading of the rule, but that's probably the way he read it. 
    I have a second answer and that is --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1893.729" stopTime="1901.028">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That is in there, as a matter of fact its – well, he probably won't have counsel, he was dead right, he didn't --
speaker="philip_b_heymann" startTime="1901.028" stopTime="2091.357">
    Mr. Philip B. Heymann 
    I don't really want to be pressed too far on what the clerk thought about Fallen's counsel. 
    The counsel was there. 
    The clerk saw Fallen with a counsel. 
    That's probably all he saw. 
    Also I don't think it's clear from Fallen's question that he wanted to appeal. 
    He wanted to know if he could appeal in forma pauperis if he wanted to, and the answer was yes. 
    We have suggested in our brief that there are four rules that state the time within which a prisoner must act and the actions he must take to file a timely appeal within Rule 37 (a). 
    Rule 37 (a) says an appeal should be taken within 10 days. 
    Only one of these do we believe could be decided on the record that was before the Court of Appeals. 
    That construction of Rule 37 (a) is the one adopted by the Fifth Circuit. 
    It said the notice of appeal must arrive in being the clerk's constructive or actual possession within 10 days. 
    Now, that is an entirely reasonable construction we believe in the case of everyone except prisoners. 
    The rule itself says an appeal was taken by Fallen in notice with the clerk and shall be taken within 10 days that seems to mean that the notice shall be filed within 10 days. 
    This is the general rule for civil cases. 
    It's also a rule that gives maximum of certainty and that maybe the most important characteristic of a rule for appeals so that everyone would know when the criminal prosecution is over. 
    We did not defend that judgment in our memorandum on the cert petition and we don't defend it now for the reason that was simply stated by Judge Shawn in a case for himself in the two Judge hands. 
    The prisoner's right to appeal cannot be left in the hands of his jailer. 
    It's one thing to say to an ordinary defendant who is out of bail or who has counsel that he has an absolute obligation of getting his notice of appeal to the Court within 10 days, all he has to do is write a letter and say I want to appeal. 
    He has that power and having the power, it can be required of him. 
    The Robinson case that neglect in taking his action is not excusable. 
    It's an entirely different thing to say that to a prisoner who is a penitentiary behind bars. 
    He has no power to get his notice for appeal to the Court. 
    He is required to use a courier and he can't choose his courier, his only courier is his jailer, the government which succeeded in obtaining the prosecution. 
    For that reason we think that timeliness of appeal for a prisoner must be decided by when he takes an action within his power that is when he gives the notice for appeal to the prison authorities for forwarding. 
    Now, that's the very when, that's the very when that we don't think was before the Court of Appeals in this case, and that's the reason why we believe a remand is necessary and a hearing.

    In that way the Court of Appeals did not overturn Judge Simpson's decision. 
    We do think that Court of Appeals has the right to make that finding of timeliness and it's never been faced with question also as the right to send it back for hearing. 
    We discussed in our brief three alternatives we thought which could state the time when a prisoner must do everything within his power to get a notice of appeal to the Court. 
    One would be to require him to act and exercise all due care in light of the delays that prison mails often have. 
    Well, today they don't have any delays, but in those days they were delivered twice a week, there could have been a delay of several days. 
    We haven't --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think in construing rule of timeliness, the Court has the right to consider rule two, said that these rules are intended to provide for the just determination with every criminal proceedings, they should be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustified events and delay.

    The -- I started to say that we don't recommend that the defendant here required to take due care in light of prison procedures for two reasons. 
    One is we think a notice of appeal rule should be as mechanical and as certain as possible due care may involve litigation that would certainly be obnoxious to the prisoner, the prosecutor, and the Court. 
    We discussed two other rules either --

    Mr. Justice Black I think you are too, I am not quite, I can't separate two questions you maybe asking. 
    One in light of the facts that I have given you were not in the record and were not before the Court of Appeals, I would not think it was beyond the bounds of reason for this Court to say that he in fact appealed on the eighth day. 
    I would think that would be permissible. 
    These facts were not before the Court of Appeals, but they are, we have checked them and that's what seems to have happened.

    Mr. Philip B. Heymann

    The -- a Court of Appeals -- there should be a termination date for a criminal proceeding. 
    There should be a date at which everyone can say this proceeding is over or I should add Mr. Justice that the proposed new rules would allow an extension of 30 days for excusable neglect. 
    It doesn't, if they want, if the date is 10 days plus 30 days for excusable neglect then 40 days is the date when everybody knows that it's over, but I do believe there should be a rule and I think we both agree --

    We would think that if that was construed or amended so that the District Court would make clear that if the defendant did not avail himself of these services at once he had 10 days to write a letter to the clerk or to get a letter to the clerk, telling him he wants this appeal noted now, we would think that would completely dispose of the counsel question for all future cases, without completely disposing the questions presented in this case, the rules could and would take care of it.

    Well I meant to say that that the prisoner now stands, this is another advantage of the rule suggested by Justice Harlan, that if he acted within 10 days, he could use the prison authorities as his clerk. 
    The mail is now picked up on a five-day a week basis, Monday through Friday and when it's forwarded, which is presumably the same day it is stamped with a date even if the franking privilege is used.

    Well is suppose if it went back and all, you did was to ask him these questions and he answered them favorable to himself, the Court would be obliged to -- on not having relief would it not --

    Mr. Philip B. Heymann 
    Unless, yes Your Honor, unless United States attorney has more imagination than I have on what could be brought up. 
    I thought that I have had trouble thinking of what could he possibly bring out.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, this would be useless procedure limit in the long run?
speaker="philip_b_heymann" startTime="2934.021" stopTime="3055.300">
    Mr. Philip B. Heymann 
    I think so Your Honor, yes. 
    Now I think at this point the last thing I have to say becomes rather obvious and that is that it seems to us every reason not to decide a right for counsel question in this case. 
    The government believes that if felon is telling the truth his notice of appeal is timely. 
    Even a felon is not telling the truth, whatever loss may have come to him from and absence of counsel which, which does not appear, we don't know what counsel said to him, we would have that remand on that, for whatever loss may have come to him from the absence of counsel would be, we believe made up by the Fifth Circuit's later decision in Flora which says the 10-day rule doesn't begin to run, until the prisoner is informed by Court or counsel. 
    So Fallen is protected, coming and going on the counsel point, on the timeliness of this appeal on the counsel point. 
    As to future cases, we believe that the pending revision of the rules is a far superior place to go into this question. 
    It's been going into in-depth now. 
    I wanted to mention three rules I think I have mentioned two of them, one is that the District Court would be (Inaudible) proposals, one is the District Court would be required to inform every defendant of his right to appeal and to ask every defendant if the clerk were to make available to every defendant the services of the clerk in noting the appeal immediately, another is the provision for 30 days for excusable neglect, and third is a proposed revision of the rules for counsel. 
    The new rules would make clear that counsel stayed with them all the time through I think. There are two bills now before Congress that are in conference that would make that clear, and these are the places for disclosing of a counsel issue.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Can I go back to one thing again just to make sure that I understand it. 
    You are authorized to say for the Solicitor General Mr. Heymann as I understand it that for the purposes of the disposition of this case the government is willing have the record supplemented by stipulation that this notice of appeal was handed to the jailer on January 23.

    Yes, Your Honor and unless the Court has any other questions I will leave it there.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Can you imagine any other service that could possibly be performed (Inaudible)
speaker="philip_b_heymann" startTime="3103.945" stopTime="3148.057">
    Mr. Philip B. Heymann 
    I think it will be better perhaps to decide it now. 
    The only service would be that it would make clear that the general -- the general disposition of these cases that is most appropriate is a hearing in effect finding by District Judge. 
    If that can be made clear without sending it back I don't think there would be any purpose in sending it back. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Isaac N. Groner
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3148.057" stopTime="3153.222">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Groner, do you have anything further?
speaker="isaac_n_groner" startTime="3153.222" stopTime="3154.862">
    Mr. Isaac N. Groner 
    Just one or two things Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3154.862" stopTime="3157.170">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yeah, go right ahead.
speaker="isaac_n_groner" startTime="3157.170" stopTime="3393.803">
    Mr. Isaac N. Groner 
    Just so the formalities maybe tidied up and however naked my motivation may now be, certainly petitioner would stipulate to the facts which have been added here by the representative of the Solicitor General. 
    We would stipulate that they ought to be and shall be considered part of the record before the Court and of course we would agree with the conclusion which of course we agreed with before that there now can be no doubt whatsoever that on the eighth day, this petitioner did deposit in the mail this notice of appeal. 
    And so on the first ground we think now it conceded on the first ground in terms of what we argued in our brief, it is now conceded that for the purposes of this case it maybe stipulated that he deposited on the eighth day, we believe therefore that on that ground the Court should hold that he has done all that he can do and therefore should reverse the judgment. 
    On the right to counsel point, however we do believe that there are or might be some utility in the Court discussing that. 
    We do not believe that there is any need for remand. 
    It is absolutely clear whatever was said between them that the counsel did not act on behalf of the petitioner and the petitioner has not waved his right to counsel and we would therefore say that the right to counsel has been violated. 
    The notes to the new rules use the same phrase at all stages that Rule 44 does and so we would say it is the present rules that we are concerned with, and rules 44 guarantee that there would be in fact available the assistance of counsel at all stages. 
    And we certainly would join the government in commending to Your Honors the case of Boroff against the United States. 
    Now, we certainly would agree that the reasoning of that case is a persuasive guide to the principles which ought to apply here. 
    Now, there is one further point because there were questions asked by Justices Goldberg and White at least with respect to the duty of the Judge except that the answers or the discussion seems to be the context of the duty of the clerk. 
    Our position is that it's a duty devolves upon the Judge and if the Judge was put on notice here that the petitioner wanted to appeal, Rule 37 (a) (2) as it now stand says, that when a Court after trial imposes sentence upon a defendant not represented by counsel the defendant shall be advised of his right to appeal and if he so requests the clerk shall prepare and file forth with a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant. 
    We say that that imposes an obligation upon the Court and that that obligation was not satisfied here. 
    We don't construe that rule as bearing upon the authorization of the clerk as the government does. 
    We think it bears upon the obligation of the Court and the Court obviously did not satisfy it here. 
    For those reasons and for the reasons that the rules ought generally to be interpreted so as to do justice, we would strongly urge the Court that the judgment below be reversed and that the case be remanded not for any further hearing whatsoever, but with directions to reinstate the appeal and to decide the appeal on it's merits.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Groner before you will take your seat on behalf of the Court I should like to thank you for having accepted the assignment to represent this indigent defendant. 
    The Court is always comforted by the fact that lawyers will accept such public service and so we are very grateful to you. 
    And Mr. Heymann, I want to say to you that the Court is really appreciative of the frankness and fairness in this case. 
    I think it's a matter we can all derive pleasure out of in this last argued case this term have an end on a high note for counsel on both sides are as frank to the Court and as fair to each other as you had been in this case, both of you. 
    We'll adjourn.
