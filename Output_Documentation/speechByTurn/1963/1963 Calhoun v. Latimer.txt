    But before you -- before you start, there -- where you in somewhat stated confusion because of the different approaches that you and -- and counsel for the petitioners have -- the -- the basis of your arguments and so I'm going to extend your time for 15 minutes to explore these things and Mrs. Motley, you may have 10 minutes to -- additional to reply and Mr. Marshall, you may have 5. 
    And we'll see if we can get down to a basis where we're all talking about the same things.

    Mr. A. C. Latimer 
    Mr. Chief Justice Warren, I wanted to say at the outset that I do not think -- do not contend that Mrs. Motley is in anyway misquoting the record. 
    The difficulty of this in -- in most of these cases isn't this record is what we say is ancient history, it's two years or more older. 
    And that in the meantime, Atlanta has been discharging what it considered to be the requirements of the Brown decision, wherein this Court said that the speed of a plan and how it waits and so forth, is first, addresses itself to the local school authorities and second, to the local district courts. 
    So, I make that statement, I don't know that anybody would consider that Mrs. Motley has misquoted the record and I'm sure she is -- has not and would not. 
    But that these depositions were taken sometime along in June of, I think, 1962 and since that time, we have tried to move forward with our plan.

    Mr. A. C. Latimer 
    Yes, sir. 
    The official records and minutes of the Board of Education would contain that portion of this argument that we're talking about which concerned those applicants in 1963 who had been turned down on the testing criteria, who were called back in and told that they could go to the school of their choice if they live closer to it.

    It suggest as such an immediate reassignment of all students on the basis of proximity alone.

    Yes, sir, bottom of page 14, Mr. Justice Clark. 
    Admittedly, Atlanta has recently resorted to proximity as a factor in making transfers. 
    But for administrative reasons, Atlanta has never used either inflexible zones or proximity as the sole criteria either at the first of the high school level. 
    It does not want to resort solely to inflexible zones or proximity now. 
    It based with the choice, would prefer, probably prefer a system of complete freedom of choice conditioned only upon availability of space would resort to proximity to settle priorities between two applicants where facilities were available for only one. 
    Such a choice, obviously, there is no relation to integration or segregation and would be consistent with either.

    Now, we are in the transition period. 
    There'd been few -- few headlines about the trouble in Atlanta because we've tried to maintain law and order and do this in a -- in a fine way, which I think we've done. 
    But we are still in the transition period -- again, I say, starting in 1961, motion for further relief filed in April of 1962 and we are trying the case here in this Court nearly April 1 of 1964 based on 1961 and 1962 facts, that's where the confusion comes in. 
    But, Your Honor, the -- we are in -- still in our spin-off of greater years. 
    We have come down now through the high schools. 
    But it would take another six years to complete that course for the elementary schools. 
    And then at the end of that time, every child entering the elementary grade, the first grade, would receive an initial assignment just as we've outlined, choice, space, proximity.

    That is stated because we understand that if we have administrative problems, the Court is often been sympathetic to the fact that the size of the school system makes a great deal of difference is what do you do to them by way of a plan, roughly, 100,000 to 115,000 students in Atlanta. 
    And we think and our educators tell us that it would be chaotic indeed to reassign initially, all at one time, the entire school system on some plan of choice or some plan of proximity or what else. 
    Now, the other reasons unconnected with race, their transportation patterns, their school associations, their academic reasons, extracurricular activity reasons and such, why we think that the process that we are in now would best serve education of the children of both races if allowed to continue to the plan once out.

    Yes, and also though, the children new to the -- to the school system, as Judge Bell pointed out, must receive an initial assignment on a nonracial basis. 
    He would be put, as Your Honor asked the question, in the school nearest to him or of his choice. 
    Now, and may it please the Court, on the question of faculty desegregation, we recognize that that is something that will ultimately take place in Atlanta. 
    We have started. 
    It is not an extensive program. 
    I'll state to you quite categorically, there are no Negro teachers teaching all white classes. 
    I think maybe there's one in -- in the trade school, I'm not certain but I ask you as to any extensive use of a Negro teachers in White schools that has not come about. 
    As you will recognize, we may require children to go to school but we cannot require teachers to teach. 
    And we have the problem that's universal to every major school system in the country that is the teacher shortage. 
    We actually send our people to recruit teachers. 
    They go into the colleges and the classrooms and try to sell them on coming to Atlanta. 
    We've tried to up our wage scale to attract them there. 
    And for the time being and until this -- until this plan runs its course, we would much prefer, if it please the Court, to differ that as the local District Court did and as the Fifth Circuit did, bearing in mind please that the Fifth Circuit has not been timid about this question. 
    In the Jacksonville case, they ordered on a finding of fact there that the Jacksonville School Board proceed forthwith with the desegregation of the faculty for reasons which they understood. 
    The Fifth Circuit deferred the matter of desegregation of the faculty in Atlanta. 
    Gentlemen, if there are anymore questions, I -- I would be most pleased to answer. 
    I would say this that in all fairness to all concern, record-wise, we could not come here and defend this cold record. 
    We couldn't do it. 
    But we have thought that our obligation was to move, that is to push forward to use the assignment plan which you -- in a preliminary way approved in Shuttles Way as a method of means of getting over some rough places in the road. 
    And we've got some more to go. 
    But we feel that educationally, that we have progressed in the fields of extracurricular activities, there is no distinction. 
    We've eliminated all distinction as to designate schools by race. 
    But in passing, we would say that arbitrarily reassign some 100,000 children would sacrifice some great educational reasons, we think for speed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Constance Baker Motley
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1463.460" stopTime="1476.889">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Ms. Motley, you and -- and the Solicitor General may speak in any order that you wish and you could rebuttal just -- just as you -- if you please.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="1476.889" stopTime="1618.374">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, first, Your Honor, I would like to read from the record to settle once and for all this question of whether there are zone lines on the elementary school level. 
    Now, on page 62 of the record, preceding this on page 61, I went into this matter with the Superintendent as to zone lines. 
    I first went back to 1960 before the plan took effect and asked him how the students were assigned. 
    And then, we finally got to the end of it after several questions. 
    And he -- I asked him this, "And you still have separate lines which relate to the Negro schools and separate lines which would relate to the White elementary schools, is that right?" 
    And he said, "Roughly, yes." 
    Now, prior to that on page 61 at the bottom -- near the bottom, I asked him, "Now, in the areas where the housing is mixed racially," that is the areas where Negroes and Whites live in the same area, "these lines would overlap so to speak, wouldn't they?" 
    And then he said, "Well, formerly, the lines were drawn separately for White and Negro schools," and I said, "And how are they drawn now?" 
    He said, "They're drawn on the basis of the pupil assignment law." 
    And I said, "Do you mean by that the law of the plan," and he said, "The plan," top of page 62. 
    And then we went on and I said, "And you say the lines are drawn pursuant to that?" 
    Answer, "The same lines that were in existence in 1960 aren't existence at the present time". 
    "I see," and then I went on to the question and answer I read before. 
    And Judge Reeves, in his dissenting opinion, points out that the District Court and the majority simply overlooked the record and he put this testimony in a footnote, I think it's Footnote 4, if I'm not mistaken, regarding the fact that there are zone lines. 
    And he's -- he points out in his dissenting opinion, this majority opinion represents a step backward for the Fifth Circuit because they had just said in Augustus and in Bush that you must do away with the dual school zone lines and he says he --

speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="1622.328" stopTime="1627.622">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That's right. 
    He says there were none and that's why Judge Reeves quoted this testimony in a footnote.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1627.622" stopTime="1630.750">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know but under the fact is the District Court didn't find there were some zone lines.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="1630.750" stopTime="1783.520">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That -- that's right. 
    He -- he just didn't make any finding at all. 
    He just approved the plan which had been approved in 1960. 
    And we complained of course to the Court of Appeals and pointed that out and Judge Reeves quoted and said, "You're just overlooking the record. 
    Here it is." 
    Now, as to the Negro high school situation, we put in the exhibit, which is plaintiff's Exhibit 7, which came up here in its original form which has every elementary school and beside the names of the elementary schools, I put an end for those schools which are Negro elementary schools. 
    The Superintendent agreed those were right in the record. 
    Then the last page of the record contains the high schools in Atlanta beginning with Archer, Bass and so forth. 
    And the check marks on that exhibit are the Negro high schools and it shows five Negro high schools. 
    Now, as he said, they have built one since that and that's Harper, so that's six Negro high schools. 
    Then they have one Negro vocational school which is Karp. 
    Now, that's in the record as to the number of Negro schools. 
    Now, the problem here is, as you can see, is a case where the facts were always changing. 
    The District Court, we had one set of facts. 
    We had a plan with 12 -- 17 criteria and so forth. 
    As to the Court of Appeals, they had abandoned all the three or four of the criteria. 
    So we had another situation. 
    In their brief, they said the sole criterion is proximity. 
    On this argument for the first time, we hear its free choice. 
    Now, there has never been published, as far as we know, any document by the School Board which says what the plan is going to be in September 1964. 
    We have not seen any. 
    And if the lawyers can't keep up with the changing facts and different plans in this case, you can imagine the situation of the parents at Atlanta. 
    But what is the School Board's plan? 
    And that's why this Court must establish standards based on this record. 
    So that for once and for all, we can have standards to guide the district courts with respect to what kind of desegregation is acceptable at this point.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes. 
    Our first objection is that it's a still a 12-year plan which, in fact, is an 18-year old plan before it's entirely desegregated that is until students are assigned throughout the system on a single criterion or the same criterion.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1818.538" stopTime="1823.051">

    We opposed that kind of delay 10 years after Brown. 
    That's our first objection to their plan. 
    They have never abandoned the 12-year featured any point. 
    So that's our first objection. 
    Our second objection is that Negro students have to apply for transfer in grades 9 to 12 or make some request or do something to get out of a Negro school and one that's over crowded particularly.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's -- that's why I was asking you to discuss the -- your ideas on the basis of what he said. 
    There's the plan that they intended to carry out now.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="1870.076" stopTime="1958.215">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, if -- if -- he has now changed what's written on page 14, that is the second paragraph on that page which I read -- read to require some kind of transfer on the part of Negro students in grades 9 to 12. 
    Now, if he has now changed that and you no longer have to apply for transfer in grades 9 to 12, you have this free choice business. 
    We object to that because we think that any free choice business in this situation will not carry out the intent of the Brown decision. 
    This will shift to the Negro community the burden of desegregating the schools which we say Brown has put on the School Board. 
    And you see, what they would then be relying on is the momentum of 100 years of segregation whereby habit and custom, Negroes have traditionally gone to Negro schools and that's the way it will be. 
    And they're saying in effect that if you want the schools desegregated, Negroes will now have to apply for admission to White school. 
    And we say that Brown put on them the duty to reassign everybody on some reasonable nonracial basis to disestablish the segregation which the State established. 
    Now, I want to point out --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1958.215" stopTime="1971.527">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Are you saying -- are you saying that we should strike down as unconstitutionally the idea of the freedom of choice on the part of the children and the parents? 
    Is that it?
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="1971.527" stopTime="1987.021">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Well, in this situation, we're dealing with what a School Board must do to satisfy the requirements of Brown. 
    I say that a free choice system would not satisfy those requirements. 
    It doesn't --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1987.021" stopTime="1994.767">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Then you -- then you do say that we should hold that they should not be given freedom of choice by reason of the argument of --

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    That -- that's right because --

    -- you put us on.
speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="1996.852" stopTime="2043.012">
    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    -- because what we then do by that is to shift the burden of desegregation to the Negro community from the School Board. 
    We understood that Brown put on the School Board a duty to disestablish segregation which the State had set up. 
    Free choice will operate to shift that duty to the Negro community to come forward and to now apply. 
    Now, there's a conflict, as I see it, between the circuits. 
    The Sixth Circuit in the Northcross case, which we cited, dealt with this. 
    And they said that Negro children cannot be made to apply for that which this Court has already said they were entitled to. 
    And in that case, the Sixth Circuit --

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    It's -- it's free choice and it doesn't operate to do what Brown intended the decision to do and that is to make the school authorities which had established the segregated system. 
    As the Eighth Circuit said, “Disestablish it.” 
    And then you can put free choice or anything else you want on that disestablished system. 
    But you have to undo a century of segregation. 
    And you can't say to the Negro community, “You undo it.” 
    By now coming forward and what happens is a Negro child applies to go to a White school and he is maybe the only one and then he is in an isolated situation. 
    Whereas Brown, we say, guaranteed him not the right to apply for admission to a White school. 
    Brown guaranteed him the right to go to a nonracial school system. 
    And in way you have free choice on top of 100 years of segregation. 
    What you're doing is preserving segregation and giving a Negro child a right to apply for admission to a White school.

    Well, in -- in this line of situation, as Mr. Latimer has described before us, the matters of (Inaudible) within the briefs of the record, as he described for us, what is it that you think we should do?

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    In the Atlanta situation, I think this Court should now require Atlanta to draw a school zone line related to capacity without consideration of race, that is they have so many children to accommodate in the 22 high school. 
    And they should draw a school zone line to accommodate this high school population to fill all those schools to its capacity.

    Ms. Constance Baker Motley 
    Yes. 
    Once drawn on the basis of capacity not proximity alone.

    Now, there maybe something that can be done later to facilitate more integration which we don't have yet in this case. 
    But I think that in this Southern school system, we've got to first get a standard which eliminates the dual school system.

   Argument of Burke Marshall
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2605.169" stopTime="2612.140">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Marshall.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="2612.140" stopTime="2831.219">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to return to a comment that Mr. Justice Brennan made as Mr. Latimer was closing and that is as he understood it, if the plan worked the way that it is working as Mr. Latimer described it that the entire school system would be desegregated by 1971. 
    As I understand this, even accepting the way Mr. Latimer states it, Mr. Justice Brennan, that is not correct, that it would still take until the fall of 1977 for the -- a school system, the school system as such to be desegregated and that is because of the effects and the remnants of the initial racial assignment. 
    Now, as Mr. Latimer described it, it is easy for Negroes who live closer to a White school than to a Negro school to get out of the initial racial assignment which they are in because they went to that school the year before when the -- in the grade that was not desegregated at all. 
    But that's all he said that was -- that it was easy for the Negro student to get out. 
    However, he does it, whatever the physical arrangement is, by going to the near White school or whatever else it does, he has to make a move which shifts him from a school that he has been going to because it was a Negro school to another school because he's closer to it and he meets whatever other requirements the School Board put on top. 
    Now, it seems to me that no matter how easy that transfer system is, that it does not answer the requirement of a desegregated or a nonracial school system. 
    For one thing, it -- it does not in itself answer the point that Mr. Justice Goldberg made earlier which is the question of a White school to which the Negro student is close, which is already fall. 
    In answer to that, the question of Mr. Justice Goldberg, Mr. Latimer said that a Negro student close by that went into that would displace White students already in and they would presumably have to go somewhere else. 
    But that is not a school system working on a -- on a nonracial system necessarily. 
    It -- it has racial facts -- factors to start with. 
    The -- and a related point to that is that it seems to me that in preserving Negro schools as such was -- which it does through this initial racial assignment, it is going to maintain systems of overcrowding, conditions of overcrowding, a Negro schools that a School Board normally were not for racial considerations would cure of itself by rezoning, by changing attendant systems or by whatever means they chose, they would -- it would at least be a situation that a School Board would normally look to and try to cure. 
    And in -- in this -- this period of remnants --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible) 
    I mean one has to register before the school year begins in speaking of high school. 
    Everyone registers and as I understand it, he registers wherever he pleases at that junction and -- except in the incidence where there is overcrowding because of too many application receipts in that particular school, he's going to go to the school of his choice.
speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="2859.118" stopTime="2871.576">

    -- Mr. Latimer told us was that -- that there's no business of assignment, and as I understood him this is all on the premise of -- the way it's going to work as Mr. Latimer described it for us, all bets are off for the past. 
    You start in September 1964 and you go to any school you want to register. 
    There's nothing else you have to do, you don't have to go back to the school you've been attending, there's no application for transfer of that school involved. 
    You merely go to the school and register where you want to.

speaker="burke_marshall" startTime="2929.847" stopTime="3030.133">
    Mr. Burke Marshall 
    Well, I think, Mr. Justice Brennan, it would be easiest if I described it in terms of the -- the opinion of the court below. 
    What Mr. Latimer was describing was a change which the School Board was making or was going to make in response to Judge Bell's per curiam opinion after the original opinion of the Fifth Circuit to correct the record. 
    And Judge Bell, at that time, said that the School Board had to eliminate all factors in dealing with transfers that made it more difficult for a Negro who had already in a school because he was a Negro to get out, then it would make it to -- for a White student to transfer from one school to another. 
    And if I can put it this way, Mr. Justice Brennan, the opinion of the Fifth Circuit in approving that is wrong then because they are talking in terms of transfers. 
    They are talking about a school system which is perpetuated by -- in terms of initial racial assignments but in which they have made it easy, as easy as possible for Negro students who are still or put into school or go to a school because they went there last year. 
    And they went there last year because it was a Negro school, no matter where they came from, that's why they went to it, make it easy for them to get out rather than the School Board reorganizing the school system so that no student is in the school because he's a Negro in the first place.
