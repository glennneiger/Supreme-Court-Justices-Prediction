    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 79, 2,872.88 Acres of Land, etcetera, et al., Petitioner, versus United States. 
    Mr. Champion.
speaker="forrest_l_champion_jr" startTime="34.707" stopTime="786.627">
    Mr. Forrest L. Champion, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I approach this argument with a keenly felt sense of humility, recognizing that despite any exhausting effort to study the law with respect to the issues involved in this case, one can never know it all and while I may seem categorical or firm in my position, nevertheless, I recognize the right to a difference of opinion and a difference in the construction of the rules. 
    I approach it also with a keenly felt sense of pride that this Court considered the issues involved in our petition for certiorari of sufficient import to justify its consideration.Most cases are decided upon their facts but this case is different. 
    It depends, we submit, upon the interpretation of the federal rules of civil procedure and we respectfully submit the integrity of the federal rules of civil procedure are at stake particularly, Rules 46, 51, 52, 53 7 -- and 71A (h). 
    The last three rules are specifically involved. 
    Rules 46, 51 and 61, I omitted to state that one, are incidentally involved if we construe the rules together, following the analogy of the doctrine of pari materia. 
    As we see it, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were -- were a tremendous advance in the promotion of the expeditious trial of cases upon their merits. 
    And that's the reason why we say that Rules 46, 51 and 61 are involved -- incidentally involved because they reflect the rationale behind the rules. 
    It is a maxim of the common law that -- that which I can't quote for Latin but I can say that it is a maxim that is well-recognized and that is, it is in the interest of the public that there'd be an end to litigation. 
    In other words, the person is entitled to a trial in court of fair trial of his issues but he is not entitled to continue to carry on litigation when he has an opportunity to make exceptions and apprise the trial court of the position which he takes. 
    The law requires -- due process requires that he let the trial court know with the first opportune time, what position he takes with respect to a particular matter, so that the trial court can determine the merit of his position and that has particular application here because under Rule 53 (e) (2), the objector to the findings of fact, may file objections. 
    And the only difference in our position between the Government and us is this. 
    We maintain that those objections must be specific. 
    The Government agrees that while Rule 53 (e) (2) reads may and seems to be permissive that it is in fact, mandatory. 
    We think that the better reason authority support that means. 
    Our only difference in opinion or position is that they say, it may -- the objections maybe general, we say they must be specific. 
    They must be sufficiently specific to apprise the trial court of the position taken at that time, so that the trial court, if it deems the findings of fact inadequate in any particular respect, can immediately remand it and the Commission can make findings of fact and then the trial court can review the Commission's findings in the light of the additional findings of fact. 
    We say the findings of fact in this case are so utterly general as to raise no question for review and that question is tremendously important. 
    That, however, is a procedural question under Rule 53. 
    The other question that is involved is what is a fact under Rule 52? 
    The Government takes the position that it is necessary in making a finding of fact that a master state what evidence he credited and what evidence he dis -- discredited. 
    And the Fifth Circuit went along with that position. 
    Indeed, that is the crux of the Fifth Circuit's opinion. 
    Even though at the same term of court, the Fifth Circuit rendered a -- a decision which reads to our way of thinking that altogether differently, cannot be reconciled. 
    It is our opinion that it cannot be reconciled and I -- I don't want to be inaccurate in this respect and I -- I therefore, ask the Court's leave to quote it, in order that I might be accurate. 
    It's a very short quotation and since it was decided by the Fifth Circuit at the same term of court and is so utterly inconsistent with the position taken in this decision appeal from that I read, "Where the only issue on appeal was one of fact and the reviewing court could not determine that the judgment of the trial court approving the findings of a special master were clearly erroneous, judgment would be affirmed." 
    That, we submit to you cannot be reconciled with the decision in the instant case. 
    But yet, aside from that, there were numerous other decisions of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals already existent at the time this appeal was held, which decisions the -- the Fifth Circuit in this opinion, studiously avoid, for instance, they studiously avoided the decision of the Fifth Circuit in U.S. versus Tampa Bay Garden of condemnation case, wherein this -- the Fifth Circuit had previously held, we do not think it necessary that we require, in applying the clearly erroneous doctrine, a special finding of fact with reference to each evidentiary conflict in the record. 
    Now, taking the Government's position to its logical extreme, it would mean that a master would have to take each witness and take each bit of testimony to which he testified and make a finding with reference to that and say, "I believe this, I disbelieve this, I believe this 50%." 
    And the logical extreme, we submit, reduces Rule 53 (e) (2) and Rule 71A (h) to an absurdity, destroys the utility of commissions. 
    And whether we like the commissions or not, it is a part whether the Court likes commissions or not, whether a litigant likes the commissions or not, it is part of our federal rule. 
    And there is in fact, no distinction between a finding -- a report by a master, adopted by the trial judge and a jury verdict. 
    In a distinction, we submit, particularly as applied to this case, is one without a difference because if the Court will look at the extensive instructions to the Commission in this case, commencing at page 18, outlining all of the basic principles of law to the Commission and even instructing the Commission that if they desired any further instructions with reference to any question that might come up before them, they could apply for -- further instructions. 
    There were no exceptions to these instructions by the Government. 
    There were no exceptions to the reference to a commission by the Government, in fact, both parties asked for a jury trial in the first instance. 
    And I respect -- respectfully submit to the Court that the question of reference to a commission was not involved in the case at all, even though the opinion of the Fifth Circuit laid us tremendously to try to justify its opinion, referring to its prosecutors against the use of a commission in a condemnation case and it was not involved. 
    Again, the opinion seeks to assert, impliedly asserts that a master must find qualifications of witnesses. 
    Now, we respectfully submit that qualification of witnesses is not a fact. 
    It is a preliminary question addressed to the fact finder. 
    One other thing that we would like to -- for this Court to clearly understand and that is this, these -- these commissions are not just referred -- they're just not picked out of thin air, they were -- they were referred to as this -- the order appointing the Commission in this case, shows they were referred to people of -- of tremendous ability that -- the -- the order of the reference says that he is an experienced attorney talking about the Chairman of the Commission. 
    He was in fact, a retired superior court judge, a professor of law at Mercy University. 
    The other man -- one of the other men that constituted the member of the Commission was a real estate appraiser from Columbus, Georgia and the other member of the Commission was a gentleman from Albany, Georgia that was widely familiar with land values in this particular vicinity. 
    So we maintain, respectfully, that once the trial court affirms the findings of a master, that it has the same dignity as a jury verdict. 
    But now, let's go further. 
    Look at the reports of the Commission made in this -- this case, in all three cases. 
    Indeed, the report of the Commissioners in the Lindsay case is found at page 32. 
    What findings were made? 
    They first determined the highest and best use of the land. 
    They next determined that he was not entitled to severance damage to his home place which was located some 5 miles from the property that was condemned. 
    They determined the value of the land taken in fee. 
    They determined the value of the (Inaudible) upon the land not taken. 
    They determined severance damage to the land not taken and then they concluded that the landowner was entitled to the sum total of those specific items and they concluded in that conclusion of law that the fair market value of land governed them. 
    Now, what else could they have found, unless they took each witness and said, "I believe this witness, I disbelieve this witness" 
    Now, there maybe some complaint and in all candor, I must take to the Court that there were some comparable sales introduced but they were introduced for different purposes. 
    The Government into introducing comparable sales, introduced sales not as independent evidence of value but as a means of buttressing that expert's opinion and the distinction between introducing evidence as a basis for an expert's opinion using hearsay and -- introducing evidence of comparable sales as independent evidence of value has been recognized as vital because one stands on his own, the other one is only as a basis of the expert's opinion. 
    Looking at the end result, in all three of these cases, as the Ninth Circuit stated in U.S. versus Lewis upon which the Fifth Circuit placed his reliance but we submit very improperly so, looking at the end result in this case, you can only conclude one thing and that is that the Commission rejected the Government's witnesses. 
    They did not answer it except any particular witness. 
    They arrived at their own independent impression of value. 
    They had a right to do so under the instructions given to them by the Court because the Court specifically instructed them, "You are not bound by any particular witness nor any bit of evidence". 
    Yes, sir.

    Well, I -- I did. 
    I particularly inquired as to the provision of the instructions casting the burden of proof on the -- on the landowner because the rule had been different prior to the adoption of the federal rule -- the federal rules -- in applying the federal rules to the condemnation cases.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="831.261" stopTime="833.189">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Did Government counsel make any suggestion?
speaker="forrest_l_champion_jr" startTime="833.189" stopTime="1159.054">
    Mr. Forrest L. Champion, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    No exceptions, no suggestion. 
    And the only exceptions made after the awards were rendered, were these general objections that the awards do not show the basis -- the reports do not show the basis of the award, do not show how the conflicts in the evidence were resolved. 
    For the rule of law is -- is accepted almost universally. 
    Moore's Federal Practice cites it to this effect that if from the facts found, an inference maybe drawn which will support the judgment, they will be so drawn. 
    Prior decisions of the Fifth Circuit had accepted that readily. 
    But this decision completely ignores it. 
    Applying that principle of law to these cases and looking at the actual findings and if the Court will allow me, I will go into the actual testimony in each of the cases and what the Commission found. 
    In the Gavin case, the range of testimony as to the 865 acres of upland was $60 to $85. 
    As to the 435 acres of river land, it was $83 to $100. 
    The Government's testimony as to each of these was $35 per acre and $50 respectively. 
    The Commission returned an average of $81 per acre. 
    The Commission awarded $4480 severance damage to 200 acres which had been split up into four tracks by which of the taking which was well within the range of the testimony. 
    We introduced five comparable sales as independent evidence of value ranging between $75 and $111 or an average of 86. 
    The Commission's finding recall was 81. 
    Now, if we apply the rule of an inference, if inferences maybe drawn from the facts found, we can only conclude that the Commission gave credit to the -- all of that -- testimony including the comparable sales which were introduced as independent evidence of value making adjustments. 
    Now, the comparable sales are not ultimate facts. 
    They are evidentiary facts. 
    They are introduced to persuade the fact finder that this land is worth so much because this particular track of land which was similar to this instant track sold within an approximate time for a certain amount. 
    But can the replies that we recognize that sales of land, no two pieces of land are alike. 
    And it is up to the fact finder in much the same fashion that he weighs opinion evidence to make the numerous adjustments. 
    Now, if we -- if we infer from the facts found or the end result as found in this case, we will conclude, one, that they rejected the Government's witnesses because instead of returning an average of $43, they returned $81 per acre. 
    We will conclude also that they gave credence to the evidentiary comparable sales introduced because they returned $81 per acre and the average of the comparable sales introduced was $86 per acre. 
    You can follow that same reasoning as applied to each one of these cases and conclude if we follow the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in U.S. versus Lewis that the Commission arrived at its own independent examination of value in the light of their visit to the land. 
    And the visit, the light of their visit to the land is something that is given tremendous significance by the appellate court. 
    I have been interested in following the cases since this decision of the Fifth Circuit to see if I could find any case which went to this extreme of saying that you must state what evidence in words, what evidence you believe and what evidence you disbelieve in order to comply with Rule 52 and 53. 
    I have found no case to go that far. 
    I have found several cases aside from U.S. versus Lewis stating that you do not have to go that far and it was very interesting to note the decision of the Ninth Circuit just recently published in Lange versus Liberty National 324 F.2d 237 wherein the Ninth Circuit said this that not only is that not required under the amended of Rule 52 (a) requiring findings of fact but that it would have been improper to have so found. 
    Now, we respectfully submit to the court that just plain sensitivity to propriety does prohibits the requirement that a fact finder stated in his findings of fact. 
    I didn't believe this witness because I thought he lied.

    Mr. Forrest L. Champion, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    Lange versus Liberty National Insurance Company 324 F.2d 237 and particularly at 241. 
    Now, in that case, the Court said, "It would have been improper for the trial court to recite the evidence which had led it to the conclusion," referring to the Petterson Lighterage &amp; Towing Corporation case which is the chief case referred to in the Advisory Committee note under Rule 52. 
    And that is the reason why we so earnestly submit that it is not just a matter whether this Court affirms or reverses this judgment. 
    It is a question of the eroding effect of the decision of the Fifth Circuit upon the -- the uniform application and interpretation of these rules. 
    And I submit to you -- the Court that if it will read as we have sought to our brief, each of the cases referred to in the Advisory Committee note under Rule 52 (a) that it will find no case that goes to this extreme. 
    Indeed, the emphasis is on conciseness ultimate facts rather than on the evidence. 
    And also it seems to us that the law does not require a useless thing where you can determine from the in result as found what was credited. 
    A court does not have to come out and say, "I didn't believe this witness because he was evasive on the stand." 
    Now, recall this too, when the trial judge in this case reviewed this matter, he had not only the detailed findings of the fact and the recital in the findings of fact that we determined the value to be from the evidence as a whole, they stated it in words. 
    Now, if they determine this to be value from the evidence as a whole, they -- the only logical inference that you can draw from that finding is that they didn't particularly discredit or any particular witness, they didn't conclude that any particular witness was lying because after all really, only opinion evidence is involved and everyone is entitled to an opinion particularly and there -- there is very little required in -- very little that is necessary to qualify a witness to testify the value. 
    Indeed, the law recognizes that a farmer is an expert as to farmland. 
    And of course, in these cases, these awards did exceed the expert witnesses' opinion. 
    But it is also remarkable that the Fifth Circuit, since this decision was rendered, stated categorically that not only is it not error and it -- no deprivation of due process but that the failure to follow advice of experts is neither perceived denial of constitutional rights nor even error which maybe corrected on direct review and neither military or civil case. 
    Williams versus Heritage 323 F.2d 731 had no fault. 
    There's nothing new in there. 
    But it is a positive statement of a universally accepted rule.

    323 F.2d 731 had no fault. 
    I -- I apologize to the Court for the length of our briefs. 
    I apologize to the Court for the seeming elementary nature of the argument. 
    But we so strongly feel that the integrity of these rules are at stake in this case and we also strongly feel that the Government's request that a new trial be granted is a very unconscionable request when particularly, on the mere suggestion that the Commissioners may not be available. 
    We still have the transcript. 
    The Commissioners are still available. 
    The land has been covered up. 
    But that's not what we asked in this Court to do. 
    We are asking the Court, this Court to set aside the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and to reinstate the judgment of the trial court because we say as a manner of law that it is clearly erroneous. 
    We recognize our burden to prove it's clearly erroneous. 
    But we respectfully maintain that it is so contrary to the intent of the rules that it should be set aside and the uniformity of the -- of the federal -- of their interpretation and application of the federal rules maintain.

    They awarded on the average of $81 an acre of the land taken there.

    Grazing, grazing and peanuts. 
    Yes. 
    And the evidence showed tremendous production on that land. 
    And the other land was located within the outskirts, part of it within the city limits of Georgetown and improved tremendously. 
    As a matter of fact, the Government's testimony was that it was over improved and one of the experts for the Government said in a -- one of the track -- the houses that was bringing in $35 an acre, I mean $35 per month, one worth anything because the -- the land was over improved and that therefore, it didn't contribute anything to the market value of the land.

    $160 per acre. 
    But that was because it was tremendously improved with fences, with houses, with bonds and -- and it also he had his home located on it.

    Mr. Forrest L. Champion, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    All except 70 acres left -- purely, it was the poorest land left and it only was good as -- as they found in the findings of fact that it was good only for the growth of pine trees and grazing. 
    And it was multiple -- little times on it and it was inaccessible also. 
    There is one other thing that I beg the Court to leave to -- to distinguish and that is the reliance of the Government upon these appeals from administrative agency. 
    And I say to you -- the Court that we think we detect a distinction between the review of -- of cases wherein injunction was granted because Rule 52 expressly requires that you state the grounds of your decision where the extraordinary relief of injunction is granted. 
    Likewise on the Rule 8 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, it says not only findings but the reason then basis therefore. 
    And -- and there are two -- there are good reasons for that. 
    One is, and it was clearly enunciated by this Court in the Burlington case decided at the last term, one is that Congress vested in the administrative agency that discretion. 
    And in that particular case, a choice between two definite remedies was involved not a choice as between believing two sets of witnesses as to the same issue. 
    So, naturally is -- more detailed findings were necessary but this Court was also jealous of the fact that it did not encroach upon the prerogative of the administrative agency to decide and exercise that discretion as vested in it in Congress. 
    So you've got -- but there is one other thing. 
    Due process is inherent in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
    Due process is not necessarily inherent in the administrative hearings. 
    And it is the province of this Court and this Court had jealously regarded the right to see that due process was done in administrative agencies so as to maintain the integrity of our Government and to maintain the -- the object of the congressional legislations.

    Mr. Forrest L. Champion, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    Except -- I don't see that due process is involved. 
    I think that the only thing it is involved is the Fifth Circuit was -- was wrong in stating that -- that the trial court didn't know what it was doing when it set aside these detailed findings.

    I asked that because I wonder what is the relevance of your argument about due process.
speaker="forrest_l_champion_jr" startTime="1797.957" stopTime="1898.836">
    Mr. Forrest L. Champion, Jr. 
    Well, this, that I think I detect a requirement in the decisions that findings be more detailed and with quite a bit degree of collaboration in findings made by administrative agencies as compared with a master. 
    I don't think that the findings of a master need to be as detailed because Rule 8 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act expressly requires a detailing of the reasons and bases therefore whereas Rule 53 (e) (2) says that the finding shall be made only if required in the order of reference. 
    And in this case, the trial judge did require findings but he did not detail the nature of the findings to be required, to be found. 
    And it would have been a simple matter for the Government to have state. 
    Now, you haven't made sufficient findings as to these evidentiary sales and the judge could have referred the thing back to the Commission immediately. 
    These findings could have been made. 
    We could have had a review, but it's not necessary that all of this detail be found in order for the appellate court to apply the clearly erroneous doctrine because prior decisions had said that it is only necessary that we check the general processes of the court below in order to determine if a mistake had been made, if there had been a clear misapprehension of the rule of law applied or the other usual rules that are accepted in determining that a decision is clearly erroneous. 
    My thanks to the Court.

   Argument of Harold S. Harrison
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1915.378" stopTime="1916.452">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Harrison.
speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="1916.452" stopTime="2049.898">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The United States joined in a request that certiorari be granted in this case and we did so because the opinion of the Fifth Circuit is in a valid conflict with the opinion of the Tenth Circuit in the Merz case. 
    Position of the United States is that the Fifth Circuit is eminently correct and that it is the Merz decision that's erroneous. 
    These cases reflect that the lower courts have founded the bet in regard to the use of Federal Rule 71A (h) Commissioners. 
    This is not surprising because jury trial is the rule, albeit, too often ignored and the use of the Commission is an exception. 
    Now, at the time the rule was enacted, some 46 out of the present 50 States provided for a jury trial either de novo from the viewers or the land Commissioners' report or at some stage on appeal. 
    But the rule changed that and got away from the -- that double procedure that it had been in effect even the -- the previous federal experience with the TVA where the Commission would render award then either party could have a trial de novo by three judges or on appeal, the Court of Appeals could treat it de novo. 
    But the federal rule got away from that and made the Commission, the judicial tribunal. 
    Now, the fact that a number of the District Courts have allowed the exception to devour the rule, we think really just points out the need for careful and full report by the Commission, to show what it has done.

    Well, we have gotten away from the routine demand of jury trial, Your Honor. 
    As a matter of fact, now, the Government is vigorously pressing a program that's called "our small track program" where we're urging the courts without the intervention of a jury or without a commissioner, the judge itself to hear these cases. 
    And in those --

    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    I'm arguing that there -- there must be sufficient to show the hows and whys. 
    May I use an analogy that was used in the Court of Appeals when the similar question was asked with my colleague sitting here? 
    Said that for all the world, the report here, reminded him of a murder mystery that was 50 pages long, with pages 45 to 49 missing. 
    The first 44 pages had given the cast of characters in the situation and all the suspects. 
    And then you had a gap and you came to the last page that shows the murderer but the -- the why and the how and the reasons were all missing. 
    And the Court of Appeals, he allowed us how the Government had been murdered and we wanted to know how. 
    Carrying that analogy a step further, the Court of Appeals has sent it back for those missing pages to show us how and why. 
    May I --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that -- is that what I asked you? 
    It's required, maybe it is. 
    It's almost as easy just to read the record, wasn't it? 
    Well, I have findings, you got to go into that much detail but the witnesses sometimes -- of course, the judges have no judicial argument we know although there was -- what was one says, "I wanted to (Inaudible) judges of the Fifth Circuit, there was a judicial argument but what you're -- what you're saying is that if that -- that take of each witnesses' testimony, say, "How much of it you believe and don't believe?

    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    I think the Court of Appeals has answered that well by putting it this way, they said, "We do not say that every contested issue raised on the record before the Commission must be resolved by a separate finding of fact. 
    We do say, however, that there must be sufficient findings of subsidiary facts so that will appear -- so that it will appear to the reviewing court that the ultimate findings of value were soundly and legally based.

    Let me explain some of the things that are missing here but I think it'll -- it'll help -- help show what we feel the parties were entitled to. 
    For example, normally, indeed almost unbearably, an award in condemnation will be somewhere before the -- between the condemnor's high testimony and the condemnee's low testimony. 
    But not so here, the award here was in excess of the landowners' own witnesses, own expert witness rather, from the size of the award, we're not told why this is the case but from the size of the award, it would appear that these Commissioners, for some reason, decided to base their award on the testimony of the landowner, himself and the lay witnesses.

    He characterized that type of testimony in this way, "So -- on the other hand, the testimony of the defendants and their respective appraisal witnesses, appear to me to be things with the over enthusiasm of owners and to represent more of the viewpoint of one who attaches value because of sentimentality and devotion to his or her own property."

    For example, in the matter of improvements to the land, the Government witnesses testified as to the value of land as enhanced by the improvements on it, which is the proper way. 
    And yet some of the landowners' witnesses valued the land so much per acre and then added so many thousand dollars for this, of improvement and that improvement. 
    Now, if the Commissioners, in arriving at this high awards, just took a land value and then arbitrarily added so much for improvements, that was an erroneous way of doing it.

    Not -- not in broad detail or not in detail, Your Honor. 
    Each set did include some particular evidence that we said that were alone -- was erroneously admitted. 
    But the -- the objections were mainly on the part -- on the point that they weren't sufficiently specific to know what was done.

    Well, did you -- did you comment on -- on wherein they lacked specificity?

    No, sir and that --

    Why wasn't that done? 
    You wanted to correct your thing down there where it should've been corrected.
speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="3458.051" stopTime="3541.573">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    Your Honor, we think this Court answered that in the Kelley case by indicating that -- well, let me say -- say first that a party cannot deal with specificity it -- to a report that is never seen. 
    We think this is where the Ninth Circuit and this Circuit difference and that the Fifth is correct. 
    In the Lewis case, which incidentally rejected the overruled Judge Hall's -- a case where Judge Hall said that the report only had to be like a jury verdict. 
    That was overruled but the Ninth Circuit indicated that the -- there had to be detailed statements. 
    I suppose in the negative to show exactly what you felt was wrong. 
    This Circuit, in remanding the case, does not place any limitation to that nature. 
    And we think clearly that the parties cannot be expected to give detailed objections to an incomplete report, one, that they don't know what the inferences were, what the -- what the reasoning was, what the Commission had in mind.

    Why couldn't you make it there as well as you can here?
speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="3549.641" stopTime="3603.297">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    Unless you know, I don't think you have to. 
    It's where a report is insufficient, then it goes back to be completed and there is -- was coming to the -- well, one of their answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, we don't think this goes to a jurisdictional matter. 
    The Circuit Court was not persuaded by this argument below. 
    I'm not sure that anything under this is specifically here. 
    But even so, we don't feel that the parties should be put in the position of having to try to be specific with report -- with respect to a report that does not contain these hows and whys and wherefores.

speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="3652.863" stopTime="3686.976">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    No, sir, we didn't. 
    We feel that it's sufficient here go to object to a report that is -- isn't sufficient and object to it on that ground and have it go back to get complete. 
    This Court in Kelley, for example, said in Kelley v. Everglades District, it is not the function of this Court to search the record and analyze the evidence in order to supply findings which the trial court failed to make. 
    In the Florida case, there's also some excellent language by this Court and in several other cases. 
    We think --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3686.976" stopTime="3699.378">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Inaudible) could've required the Commissioners to make the findings if you had pointed out the efficiency of those findings, wouldn't it?
speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="3699.378" stopTime="3700.171">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3700.171" stopTime="3700.619">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And my question --
speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="3700.619" stopTime="3701.075">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    We --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3701.075" stopTime="3714.232">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- is if -- if that could've been done there, why shouldn't it been down there instead of you now pointing out the deficiency to us but having failed to do it with the trial court?
speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="3714.232" stopTime="3717.786">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    We did do it, of course, to some extent as I say. 
    Each one of the objections that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3717.786" stopTime="3720.332">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, was it sufficiently done?
speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="3720.332" stopTime="3751.701">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    I don't think it's necessary, Your Honor. 
    The Government's position is that where there is an inadequate report, it should be sufficient to say it is inadequate and get an adequate report before the parties are in the position of trying to have to spell out all the negatives of what should or should not have been there. 
    We think, the proper way, the -- the burden is on the fact finding body to file a sufficient report. 
    May I -- may I say this that --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    (Inaudible) report in the sense that you don't know the reasoning that has lead to the Commission the result, you've got one or two choices, either to say, we object to do -- to the award that it's too high or you can, without knowing -- without being able to give any reasons for except to introduce new evidence or you say that the reports are inadequate, you can't go an objection.
speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="3781.468" stopTime="3783.416">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    Yes, sir, and that -- that's the position.

    Is that --

    All --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3783.934" stopTime="3785.545">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- what you're -- is that what you're saying?
speaker="harold_s_harrison" startTime="3785.545" stopTime="3804.476">
    Mr. Harold S. Harrison 
    Yes, sir. 
    And all the Government seeking is meaningful participation by the Court in these cases. 
    We get it where there's a jury and we get in the judge-tried case. 
    But unless you require adequate findings, you don't get it in the Commissioners. 
    Thank you.
