    Mr. Vincent A. Theisen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The decision of the statutory court below, consisting as this Court knows, of Judge Biggs, Judge Wright and Judge Layton, declaring the apportionment provisions of the Delaware Constitution inviolate under the Fourteenth Amendment and the subsequent injunction which restrained the defendants, appellants below from conducting any elections for the membership of the General Assembly was, in our opinion, clearly correct in both instances and we ask that the opinion below be affirmed. 
    Now, because my friend, Mr. Wiener, suggests that there are maybe some novelty present in the Delaware litigation that was not argued heretofore in the other reapportionment cases that your -- the bench heard during the week of November 12th of this year, we think it might be appropriate to define more precisely the issues that were presented to the court below, the issues therefore they are before you, and are set forth, if I may, a more clear exposition of the grounds upon which that decision below rests. 
    As a prologue to my argument, permit me to agree in principle with Colonel Wiener that Delaware, perhaps, in some ways, is very unique. 
    It was, as Your Honors know, the first case -- the first state rather to ratify the Constitution of the United States, an event which we celebrate in our State each December 7th of each year. 
    One of the 13 original colonies, it ranks second smallest in area of the 50 States. 
    It is smaller in this regard as this Court heard than Saint Lawrence County in New York State. 
    It is smaller, of course, than many counties throughout this nation. 
    It is 48th of the 50 States in population in -- and that is, it ranks 48th in numbers. 
    Its northern border is about 94 miles away from its southern border. 
    At its widest point, it is about 35 miles in width that is on the southern end of the State. 
    On the upper end, it is about an arc of 8 miles drawn from New Castle County's Courthouse. 
    Its highest point, Your Honors please, is about 440 feet above sea -- sea level. 
    It contains no dormitory counties, such as you have heard exist in Maryland or in Connecticut or in New York. 
    It has no large military concentrations within its borders such as Virginia. 
    It has no offshore islands such as Rhode Island or Massachusetts, nor does it have any widely separated regions such as -- are to be found in the upper peninsula of Michigan. 
    Delaware is uniquely compact and uniquely accessible from one end of the State to the other. 
    Our capital is, as you know, in Dover and Dover is situate about 50 miles from Wilmington. 
    It is within easy accessible driving range, within one hour from any portion of our State. 
    Our legislators who meet in the General Assembly, a number of whom are here today to hear these arguments, commute daily back and forth from their homes to Dover into the General Assembly. 
    So we have none of the other problems as we see it that might affect your decision in other cases. 
    Ours is uniquely our case and we would like to confine our unique case for your consideration to the following facts. 
    The Delaware General Assembly is a bicameral body. 
    It consists, of course, of a Senate, an upper House and a House of Representatives. 
    The composition of both of these Houses was fixed by the Convention of 1896 and became effective in 1897. 
    We have not had reapportionment prior to the institution of this suit since 1897 and before that we had no apportionment in our State -- reapportionment from the period of 1831 to 1897. 
    Now then, in 1897, the Convention contrived of a House of Representatives consisting not of county representation, if you please, but it created geographical representative districts. 
    It created 35 of those districts. 
    Now, it happens that 10 of the representative districts are to be found and were allotted to the rural areas of our three counties and as Mr. Wiener has stated, we have but three counties in Delaware. 
    The five remaining of the 35 representative districts were allotted to the City of Wilmington. 
    In the Senate, it created again 17 representative geographical rather senatorial geographical districts. 
    And those 17 geographical distri -- districts were again so constituted that geographically, five or in each of the rural areas of the three counties and two were to be found within the City of Wilmington. 
    Now, as I stated we've had no reapportionment prior to the institution of suit and the Constitution of 1897 provided for no periodic reapportionment of our General Assembly. 
    We have neither initiative nor referendum in our Constitution. 
    When the Constitution was adopted in the State of Delaware in 1897, the population of our State was approximately 180,000 inhabitants. 
    105 of those persons resided in the city -- resided rather in New Castle County. 
    70,000 of them resided in the City of Wilmington and 35,000 in the rural areas outside of Wilmington. 
    At that time, 35,000 persons inhabited the rural areas of Kent County and 38,000 resided in the rural areas of Sussex County. 
    Now, when the Constitution was adopted, as will appear by the debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1896, the people who lived in the rural areas of our State were considered to be identical not only in their vocations but in their interest and consequently, I believe it made logical sense to allot to them equality since their representation, the number of persons who lived in the rural areas were substantially identical. 
    However, Wilmington, with a population of 70,000, was given different considerations. 
    Instead of allotting representation to Wilmington on a population basis, it was given a SOP of two senatorial representatives and five additional representatives in the House. 
    Now, what happened in Delaware is, I suppose, what has happened in a great number of other States. 
    We have had a tremendous population explosion in our State. 
    It was not conceivable, I'm sure in 1897 for our legislators to have known or to have anticipated the direction in which this population explosion might have occurred. 
    We did not know that by 1960, our Sate would've reached 446,000 in inhabitants. 
    We did not know, of course, that by 1960, 307,000 of 446,000 would be residing in New Castle County. 
    We didn't know what would happen in the suburbs of Wilmington and what has happened since 19 -- 1896 is that that population has increased now to 211,000 persons from which we now still get the same representation of five members in the House -- rather 10 members in the House and five in the Senate. 
    In the same period of time, New Castle County or rather Kent County has grown to 65,000 and Sussex County about 75 -- 73,000. 
    Thus, by 1960, 69% of our entire state population resides in New Castle County, 14%, approximately, reside in Kent and approximately 16% in Sussex County. 
    Because of this irregular population explosion, and the fact that all attempts prior to 1962 to reapportion the state legislature had failed, and I might point out to Your Honors that in the six years that preceded, the institution of this suit, there had been seven attempts made in the General Assembly of our State to achieve some kind of reapportionment in the General Assembly. 
    Of the seven bills that were presented, one reached the floor and was promptly voted down. 
    The other six never came out of committee. 
    So that in 1960, with this irregular population explosion and the districts frozen in, the representative districts ranged in size from about 1643 inhabitants in the New Castle County 15th representative district to over 58,000 in New Castle County's 6th District. 
    This, gentlemen, is a disparity of over 35-to-1. 
    Similar disparities are to be found between the districts not only in New Castle County, not only in Kent County, not only in Sussex County but also, of course, in the City of Wilmington.

    You'll find that in the Senate, there are combinations of hundreds and other representative districts, but in general, they do follow them. 
    Now, in Kent County, we had -- well, in Wilmington, for example, we had one district, the 4th District that has 5300 in population and right next to it in the 5th District, there are over 30,000 inhabitants living there. 
    Similarly, in the City of Wilmington, another district has 33,000 as compared with the 5300 in the 4th District. 
    In Kent County, they had one district that has 17,800 in it. In the second district and right next to it, in the 3rd District, there are about 3300.

    Well, I have read the -- I've read the debates of the Convention of 1896 and there are three very large volumes and I cannot find anywhere in the committee on the legislature any explanation ever offered for the creation of these districts. 
    As you read those debates, you'll find that there were four reports of the committee on legislation. 
    They apparently wrestled with the problem of numbers first. 
    That is how many representatives was each county going to get, how many was Wilmington going to get? 
    There were three different plans suggested that dealt with Wilmington. 
    They finally settled on Wilmington getting five additional representatives and two senators. 
    They then reassigned this task of districting to the committee and the committee came back with a report which was adopted. 
    There's no explanation as to how they arrived at the districting. 
    No -- no basis that I can find that they considered the population whatsoever.

    Mr. Vincent A. Theisen 
    There is nothing of that sort whatsoever. 
    It is true that the City of Wilmington maybe considered to be more industrial than the county suburbs or suburban areas around it. 
    The 6th District is solidly suburban and residential. 
    But it was interesting, the record will show this that by 1910, Delaware had lost its status as a rural state according to the census and I think Chief Justice, the record will show that it's becoming more and more industrialized through out the State. 
    The indu -- industry is not confined to New Castle any longer. 
    It's to be found in Kent and Sussex, both. 
    Now, I might add that in the 1963 amendment that you asked me about, there was no effort made, for example, in dividing the or in providing for additional representation, no effort was made to combine any of the small districts. 
    For example, the 15th District of New Castle County which is the smallest one with 1643 inhabitants, was left that way even though since 1890, that hundred has increased about 143 inhabitants in that entire time. 
    It remained with one house representative. 
    What they did was to take the larger areas such as Brandy 100 and subdivide that according to a 15,000 population or a major fraction thereof, but they left the smaller ones completely intact.

speaker="vincent_a_theisen" startTime="1093.687" stopTime="1787.159">
    Mr. Vincent A. Theisen 
    Oh! 
    I think that's absolutely explicit if not implicit. 
    As a matter of fact, Mr. Justice Goldberg, if you would -- the record shows and we have it in our appendix that Mr. Wilson, who was admitted here today, a fine lawyer in Wilmington, was chairman of the committee, the Governor's bipartisan committee, stated in the trial of this cause that the reason they didn't change the provisions of Article II, Section 2 of 1897 as far as it relates to future constitutional conventions was because they didn't want the reapportionment to apply to that Convention. 
    It's obvious that this is a question of under representation or being bucked by the overrepresented areas. 
    If I may continue, I was reciting the situation that existed in 1960 insofar as the House was concerned. 
    In 1960, as we have stated, 18.5% of the population of the State of Delaware was able to elect a majority in the House of Representatives. 
    In the Senate, a similar situation existed. 
    The seven geographical senatorial districts that lie within New Castle County represented a total population of over 307,000 while the five in Sussex County represented about 73,000 and those five in Kent, 65,000. 
    The senatorial districts in 1962 ranged from 65,000 to 4000 so that a vote in the smallest senatorial district in Delaware was worth almost 16 times the vote in the largest. 
    22% of our entire population elected the majority in the Senate. 
    And this, if Your Honors will recall, prompted the Solicitor General in his brief to say that Delaware represented the worst represented General Assembly of any of the 50, third worst, sorry. 
    Now, these disparities that I have spoken off existed not only on an inter-county basis, they're also on an intra-county basis and they are to be found, as I pointed out, within the City of Wilmington. 
    My friend would state that the basis of discriminatory, the utmost of discrimination in this field would be a crazy quilt type of apportionment. 
    I don't think that you can find a better example of a crazy quilt apportionment than you can in the Delaware situation. 
    Often, the discriminations exist, as I pointed out, in adjoining districts. 
    Sometimes, the difference is simply the question of whether you live on one side of a street or on the other side of a street. 
    Sometimes, it's a question of whether you live on this side of a creek or on the other side of a creek, even though the persons on both sides of the street are identical and on both sides of the street are identical. 
    Now, we have heard today about the amendment of 1963. 
    This was instituted in the 1962 legislature and finally consummated in 1963 and we refer to it as the 1963 amendment. 
    And we think the effect of that represent -- of that amendment was to freeze into the senatorial districts representation of New Castle County, the seven existing districts and the effect of adding two additional floterial or at large senators in both Kent and Sussex and where the total membership of the Senate was increased from 17 to 21 and by adding the four floterial senators to areas having about 31% of the population at the expense of the areas containing 69% of the population and it's interesting to know that when questioned, the chairman of the bipartisan committee that prepared this bill, stated that when they allotted the four additional senators to the two lower county areas, they did not take into account population at all. 
    Now, in the House, they divide the House into 10 additional districts by dividing the more populous districts on the basis of 15,000 populations. 
    The smaller districts, even in the same county, were left untouched. 
    The amendment, as I have pointed out, also froze into future constitutional conventions, the composition of the General Assembly as it existed in 1897. 
    And so the effect of the amendment, if I may summarize it, was that in Kent and Sussex Counties, in the House, it had no effect and it perpetuated discrepancies that existed of over ten-and-half to one in Kent and over eleven-and-half to one in Sussex. 
    In New Castle County even after the subdivision and the creation of 10 additional districts, we still have discrepancies as high as 12-to-1. 
    We still have numerous discrepancies of 11-to-1 and many at 10-to-1 and under the amendment, instead of the 18.5% of the population that prior to the -- could elect the majority, it now is about 28% of the population of our State that can elect the majority in the House. 
    After the amendment, the disparities in population in New Castle ranged from 4100 to 64,000 or over 15-to-1 in New Castle. 
    In Kent, they range from 7000 to 46,000 or six-and-half to one, in Sussex, from 9000 to 38,000 or over four-and-half to one. 
    After the amendment, Kent, with a population of about 14.5%, now elects one-third of our Senate. 
    Each voter in Kent County now elects two-twenty-first of our Senate. 
    The same thing is true in Sussex County with about 16.5% of the population, but after the amendment, New Castle with 69% is still permitted to elect about one-third of the Senate and our residents in our county in our senatorial districts can vote for about one twenty-first of the Senate. 
    Now, it was obviously in the light of these facts and many others that were developed during the trial in the District Court below that the opinion of April 17th which held Article II, Section 2 as existed both before and after the amendment to be unconstitutional in violation of the Equal Protection Clause should be viewed. 
    The court below said that these disparities resulted in gross and invidious discrimination against the plaintiffs in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. 
    The court could find no rational or reasonable basis for the apportionment. 
    Contrary to what has been said here, it -- I think throughout the entire course of the litigation considered that basically, the problem of reapportionment was a matter for the General Assembly of the State to properly apportion itself in accordance with the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    In this regard, honoring the request of counsel for the defendants below, the court laid down certain guidelines, standards that in the apportionment of the House of Representatives of Delaware, the basis must be one of population. 
    It adopted this Court's ruling in Sander Gray -- Sanders versus Gray and announced that one vote, one person must be the aim and that in the Senate, while population must be given the heaviest vote, other factors such as diverse interests, county governmental functions, geography, area, historic and economic differences might be considered provided that no wide deviation from the principle of population representation would be permitted and then, only if the deviation served a valid legislative purpose. 
    In reaching that conclusion, the Court applied the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause and in this regard, I believe it is explicitly supported and sustained by the ruling of this Court in Baker versus Carr whereas as we see it, Baker stated a rule that was more than procedural. 
    Baker stated the rule that gross dilutions of voting rights which result from unlawful discriminations against people lead to limitations that exceed the constitutionality. 
    And that this conclusion of the Court in Baker versus Carr is correct, we believe is supported by the overwhelming number of federal, lower federal and state courts, which have followed that rule since the ruling of Baker versus Carr. 
    We think also that the court below was following the mandate contained in the closing words of Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion in that case where he said, "The complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection presents a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which the plaintiffs were entitled to a trial and a decision. 
    " Now, in reaching the conclusion below, it is our feeling that the Court followed what it considered to be and what are traditionally considered to be the well-established concepts and tests of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It found that the discriminations, inequalities that existed reflected no policy and were simply arbitrary and capricious. 
    The Court, as I have stated, adopted the principle of representation or the principle or the equality and majority rule, the concept that one person and one vote must be applied according to the court below to both houses of the General Assembly.

    Mr. Vincent A. Theisen 
    Chief Justice, we believe that there could be little doubt, the case was decided on the question of the House and could have been left on the question of the House alone. 
    The court below unanimously found that there were no separability provisions in our Constitution. 
    It, therefore, found that the invidious discrimination that existed in the House was sufficient, but during the course of the trial, if Your Honor please, there was a very extensive pretrial had in this case and in the course of that pretrial, the plaintiffs below wanted to go further. 
    They felt that one of the issues in the case that remained was, what kind of a plan of apportionment, if any, should be adopted by the Court. 
    We certainly felt that we were litigating the question of what kind of a plan would be acceptable. 
    We, therefore, presented our own plan which included both houses. 
    In the course of the trial as has been stated by Colonel Wiener, the Court did hand counsel a former plan for the House alone and asked our comment on that, but we had hoped that we would get across-the-board relief because we don't think relief in one house is substantial relief in Delaware. 
    But I think technically, I must say to Your Honor, that the Court could have decided the matter only on the House and I think it did, but the Court went on because counsel, in the course of trial, had requested guidelines be established. 
    The Court then went on and in Judge Biggs' words, used precatory, precatory advice, gave precatory advice to the General Assembly as to what that Court considered would be the minimum plan under the Equal Protection Clause.

    Mr. Vincent A. Theisen 
    That is absolutely correct. 
    There was a claim made in the -- in the Convention of 1896 that Delaware should adopt the federal analogy and we have quoted at page 10, I believe, 9 and 10 of our motion – brief in support of our motion to affirm below a few excerpts from the debates that took place. 
    I read from Mr. Nathan Pratt, "I do not regard a county as I do a state. 
    I cannot understand on what ground such a comparison can be made. 
    " And William Salisbury said, "In the State of Delaware, we have no such conditions. 
    A county is not an independent sovereignty. 
    The counties of New Castle, Kent and Sussex were never free and independent States of themselves. 
    " Now, this federal analogy was rejected completely in the Convention of 1896 and why it should be resurrected in 1963 is something beyond me, I can't understand it. 
    I come to this question of county sovereignty. 
    We think that the claim that Delaware should be in the classification of federal analogy is erroneous. 
    First, we can find no comparable incidence of history in Delaware which are analogous to the situation that necessitated that compromised in the federal system. 
    We never had such a historic event as we had in the Connecticut compromise. 
    Secondly, the counties of Delaware were never sovereign and I don't believe that any of the witnesses in the trial of this Court so stated, but if they were, it would be our position that such fact would be irrelevant to any of the issues before this Court. 
    We are concerned here not with county discriminations. 
    We are concerned here with the action of the State of Delaware in denying these plaintiffs equal protection. 
    I know of no charge that any county is involved in these discriminations and as a matter of fact in Delaware, counties have -- they're integral part of our State but they form no governmental function.

speaker="vincent_a_theisen" startTime="2199.825" stopTime="2509.794">
    Mr. Vincent A. Theisen 
    Unquestionably. 
    The State had existed under Colonel Wiener's argument from September of 1776 until the date of the 1868 period and it had existed without federal analogy. 
    Of course, another comment on that is that the Delaware House of Representatives is, of course, not apportioned strictly on population while the federal house, we believe is so apportioned. 
    And in Delaware, as we pointed out, 18.5% or 28% whichever -- you are considering the old Constitution or the amendment of the population can now elect the majority in the House. 
    While, as we show in our brief, it takes approximately 50% of the population of the States to constitute a majority in the United States House of Representatives. 
    And lastly, the federal analogy is not applicable to Delaware because our senators are not chosen from the counties. 
    They're chosen from representative districts that happen to be situated in the counties and the discrimination that exist is not a county vis-à-vis county, it's a representative district or a senatorial district vis-à-vis one another. 
    So that we don't think that Mr. Wiener's argument on the federal analogy should be applied to the Delaware Legislature. 
    Now, the next argument that Mr. Wiener has asserted, as we understand it, is that of contemporaneous construction. 
    We pointed out at the beginning that this has nothing to do whatsoever with the rationale of the disparities existing in the General Assembly of the State of Delaware. 
    It is an argument, we believe, that was made first had its genesis in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Brown versus Topeka. 
    It was -- I'm sorry, Baker versus Carr. 
    It was started in Brown versus Topeka. 
    It was repeated with special application by Mr. Justice Frank -- Frankfurter in the dissent in Baker versus Carr and there rejected and as I understand it, it has been reintroduced into the reapportionment suit -- arguments in the Maryland case. 
    Now, in the Brown case, it was rejected as being incon -- inconclusive in the field of public education. 
    It was not accepted by this Court in Baker. 
    In the Brown case, this Court refused to turn the clock back to 1868 and considered public education in the light of a full development and present place in American life throughout the nation. 
    No other apportion, we believe, of the Constitution with the exception perhaps, of the Commerce Clause, has had so much elasticity as the due process, public, Equal Protection Clause, but we're not here, it seems to us, to argue the abstract questions, which Mr. Wiener presents of what the Fourteenth Amendment might have meant in 1868 in the field of apportionment. 
    If we are here, it seems to us, to argue the question of whether the Equal Protection Clause means today what you said it meant, as we interpret it, in Baker v. -- versus Carr. 
    We are here today to argue what the Fourteenth Amendment means to the apportionment of the Delaware General Assembly. 
    Now, we don't think that Mr. Wiener's contemporaneous construction helps us very much in arriving today at what the Fourteenth Amendment means in the field of apportionment of General Assemblies. 
    Moreover, we think that it's apparent from the discussion that we've heard this morning that the Fourteenth Amendment was not particularly designed to meet the challenge or the problem of the apportionment of state legislatures. 
    We think that a careful reading of the cases of this Court indicates that the Fourteenth Amendment was chiefly concerned with the then current problem of protecting the rights of Negroes. 
    Apportionment of state legislatures was not then a current problem and under the standards of equality of the times was like separate facilities being in advance over no facilities and improvement over that which antedated it.

    Mr. Vincent A. Theisen 
    So our conclusion on the question of contempora -- contemporaneous construction is that at this time, it is not of any great material help to this Court. 
    We think it -- at best it is inconclusive and speculative and there we leave it. 
    Now, what happened below was, of course, that the court having found the provisions invalid was faced with an appropriate type of relief to be granted to the plaintiffs. 
    My friend has alluded to the injunction that was entered and perhaps, I should state the frame in which -- frame of time in which that injunction was issued. 
    This suit was instituted on June 5th, 1962. 
    In early July, as Colonel Wiener has stated, of 1962, the Governor appointed a bipartisan reapportionment committee. 
    They met. 
    They had three sessions prior to July 25th, 1962. 
    One of the members at least to that committee was one of the attorneys representing the defendants below. 
    appellants in this Court. 
    It was represented to the court below that a plan had been devised for the reapportionment of the State of Delaware. 
    An application was made prior to July 25th by the appellants below to stay the action of the court until that plan could be presented to the General Assembly. 
    The court did grant the stay to the -- in the proceedings until August 7th, and it did so because of the representation that this plan was ready and would be presented to the court below. 
    Now, my friend would make haste out of this. 
    I say to you that he was not present below and I think might have misjudged a little bit of the tempo of the trial, the speed of the trial and the necessity of the moment. 
    Judge Biggs, with all of his many, many years on the bench, stated on at least three occasions as an indication of his concern with the importance of this case that it was the -- the most important case that he had sat on in the 25 years that he had sat on the federal bench. 
    I can assure you gentlemen, if assurance need be given, that the question of haste, pressure and so forth that is alleged to have been attributed to Judge Biggs just did not exist. 
    He granted the stay until August 7th and there was good reason for granting the stay until August 7th because if the plan was to be adopted, an amendment to the Constitution, it would require publication. 
    The publication had to be made before the 4th or 5th of August. 
    And therefore, if the plan was not going to be passed by the -- by the General Assembly, there was no reason to stay the proceedings any longer. 
    I might point out that in the -- in the first opinion of Judge Biggs, he suggested to the General Assembly that they consider the question of passing a statute providing that apportionment in the General Assembly of this State shall be by statute, not as a permanent harbor but as a temporary haven. 
    This, of course, was ignored by the legislature which went ahead and passed the invalid amendment. 
    Now, I think the briefs are adequately replete with the references which we have made to the timing of this case. 
    It was April 17th, 1963 before the court handed down its final opinion on the merits to this case. 
    Between July 25th, 1962 and April 17th, 1930, counsels were completely aware of what was going on. 
    The legislature was completely aware of what was going on. 
    On April 30th when the opinion was handed down, the court, again, in its over abundance of caution to try to help the General Assembly assume its responsibility which it had not assumed to reapportion the State, granted the legislature an additional time from the date of the decree which is April 30th until October 1st to pass an appropriate statute relating to reapportionment. 
    As Mr. Justice Goldberg has pointed out through his questioning, the legislature just has -- simply has not taken any effective steps since that date and here it is, December of 1963 and still no steps have been taken. 
    This, I submit, is in line with what the -- we have alleged in our brief. 
    We have stated the numerous occasions on which we have attempted to get a reapportionment in the State of Delaware. 
    We have met with legislatives still made on this question and unless this Court will lay down the minimum standards or will affirm below, I don't think we're going to get -- let any reapportionment in Delaware for good number of years to come.

    I would say that it would meet our objections as far as the House is concerned. 
    It -- as I understand the bill, it divides the State into 45 districts and then divides the number of 45 into the number of population and then allots the different districts according to the number of the popular quotient. 
    And as I understand it further, the bill permits an additional representative to go to those counties that have a larger population after one has been elected or appointed to each district. 
    Now, as I understand it, it will require combinations of districts. 
    If it doesn't require combinations of small districts, it would not be satisfactory. 
    It was my understanding that there would be a reapportionment committee that would engage experts and so forth and would meet and would combine small districts throughout the State and come up with -- with -- it doesn't say how many districts as I read it, but I think it could be worked out.

   Argument of Archibald Cox
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3694.552" stopTime="3695.942">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3695.942" stopTime="3748.615">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I must confess that I found the task of planning a fifth argument on the subject of apportionment within a month is somewhat difficult. 
    I concluded that it would be most helpful if I were to devote my time today to three aspects of this specific case. 
    First, I shall endeavor to show that this case does not raise any question about the power of a State to model its legislature after the federal analogy. 
    The case to which appellants' briefs are chiefly directed in our judgment simply isn't here. 
    Second, coming to the case that is here --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3748.615" stopTime="3751.078">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Petition of the Senate is not here?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3751.078" stopTime="4018.567">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    No, that's because there is, in our judgment for reason I'll state in a moment, no resemblance between the apportionment of either house of the Delaware Legislature and the apportionment of the seats in the Federal Congress. 
    Second, coming to the case that is here, I shall argue that the apportionment of the Delaware Legislature results in gross discrimination between persons, groups of persons without any basis in policy and is therefore, unconstitutional under established principles of equal protection. 
    And third, I shall try to answer briefly some of the appellants' arguments directed to the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly its early history and interpretation which I submit if they have any relevance are really abridge to reargue Baker against Carr. 
    The appellants state on page 10 of their reply brief that the basic question for decision is whether anything in the Equal Protection Clause forbids a State from patterning its legislature on the federal model. 
    As I said a moment ago, we submit that this case does not present that question. 
    The Delaware Legislature is unlike the Congress of the United States for four -- because of four fundamental differences. 
    In the first place, the composition of the Delaware Senate is utterly unlike the composition of the Senate of the Unites States. 
    The United States senators are there to represent States. 
    The States are, for many purposes, sovereign entities, each with its own historical identity, each with existing political function, a coherence of its own and the senators are chosen at large by the peoples of the State to represent them. 
    Now, assuming that counties are like States and I assume it’s solely for the purpose of argument, still, the Delaware senators do not represent the counties. 
    The 21 senators are chosen by 21 geographical districts established for the sole purpose of choosing senators. 
    Each senator is chosen by his district, represents the district and not the county. 
    So far as one can see, the legislature might establish these five counties instead of three or abolish all counties and it would have not the slightest effect on the state legislature. 
    That essential difference, as a matter of fact, is reflected in the fact that the Delaware Senate today is apportioned very like the apportionment under the 1896 Constitution and the districts are the same except for a few that was added or one can get out it in other way and suppose that it were possible to amend the Constitution so as to divide each State into senatorial districts. 
    We would suppose that that was a very radical change in the composition of our Congress and I think it shows the radical difference between the composition of the Delaware Senate and the composition of the Senate of the United States. 
    Now, the appellants say, "Well, this was never suggested to us before." 
    The point is here, whether it was suggested or not and they say, "Well, we didn't want to have our senators chosen at large." 
    Well that's all right, they may have had very good reasons for rejecting the federal analogy, but their reasons for rejecting it cannot make something fundamentally different into the same thing as the Senate of the United States. 
    Second, the Constitution, the Federal Constitution contemplates a lower House apportioned essentially in accordance with population. 
    Nothing in the Constitution requires or sanctions gross inequalities in per capita representation in the lower chamber. 
    Seats in the Delaware Lower House on the other hand are not apportioned either among counties or within counties on the basis of population. 
    To take a single fact, Kent County has almost twice the per capita representation of the people of New Castle County --

speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4041.871" stopTime="4061.109">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, I should have supposed that it has to historically meant that they would be elected at large. 
    I could say as I never considered the question. 
    I suggest that -- well, I -- what I was about to say, I don't -- I don't think it will stand up, but when we talk about the federal analogy, it seems to --

speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4061.203" stopTime="4083.002">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    -- me we ought to talk about it historically as it has always been. 
    Certainly, I would find nothing in the Seventeenth Amendment to authorize creating districts within a State which gave the people of -- which put -- attempt the number of people in one district that was in another as there is in Delaware.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="4083.002" stopTime="4086.567">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4086.567" stopTime="4376.513">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I -- I assume that the history was the law, Your Honor. 
    I had never reflected on the point. 
    I suspect that it will continue to be the practice. 
    Appellants' answer to our point about the lack of per capita representation in the House is that well, the House -- the purpose was to make the apportionment of the House conform to population, a purpose which the subsequent unadopted report of the committee would have effectuated. 
    Well, I submit that if that was their purpose, they fell far short and we're concerned with what they did not with their purposes. 
    And so far as their future intentions go, there would be nothing adjudicated here that would prevent them from carrying out their future intentions but we're concerned now with the constitutionality of something on the books. 
    Third, in Delaware, there is no rational basis for the apportionment of seats in either house -- either branch of the Delaware Legislature whereas the apportionment in the Federal Constitution is certainly in accordance with an intelligible rule. 
    And fourth, we find out that Delaware's 1963 amendment creates or perhaps I should say continuous gross discrimination of a kind which the federal system has never created. 
    Appellants say to that in their reply brief that this assertion is contrary to fact and they go on to say that inequalities in per capita representation in the United States Senate are greater than the ine -- inequalities between the three Delaware counties. 
    Well, that's true, but I think its a little acting whoever says that an orange is different from an apple is a liar, both have skin. 
    The fact is that there are many other kinds of gross discrimination under the Delaware apportionment which do not exist in the Congress of the United States. 
    First, some senatorial districts have three, four, 10 and even 15 times the per capita representation of other districts in the same county. 
    There's nothing similar to that in the federal arrangement. 
    Second is gross discrimination in the lower House, both between counties and between districts in different counties. 
    On the average, as I said a moment ago, the people of Kent County have twice the per capita representation in the lower House of the people in New Castle County. 
    There's nothing in the Federal Constitution that contemplates that kind of discrimination. 
    Third, a numerical majority in the Delaware Senate could come from districts containing only 28% of the population. 
    There's nothing of that kind required or sanctioned by the Federal Constitution. 
    So we think that taking the apportionment that is before the Court and comparing it with the federal system is an utter lack of resemblance and all the argument about the federal analogy is utterly beside the point. 
    Appellants say in their reply brief, well, the issue of the federal analogy is inescapably in the case for two reasons. 
    First, they say the legislature might have equalized the senatorial districts in each county. 
    Well, this case doesn't concern with what the legislature might have done. 
    It's concerned with what it did and then it says that the legislatures, second, might have followed the suggestion that we made in our brief. 
    Well again, it didn't and we're not concerned with what might have been. 
    Nor I submit made the court be concerned with any future apportionment that might be enacted by the Delaware Legislature that may or may not satisfy the District Court. 
    The decree leaves the legislature to adopt its own apportionment. 
    It doesn't forbid the adoption of a plan truly analogous to the Federal Congress. 
    If it doesn't, then it will be time enough to adjudicate that question. 
    This Court does not sit and certainly in this field, I submit, should not undertake to render advisory opinions on hypothetical questions that are not here. 
    I turn now to the second point that I -- that I wish to cover and that is -- excuse me.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4376.513" stopTime="4377.155">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Go ahead.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4377.155" stopTime="4580.762">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Now, the second point and that is our argument that taking the case that is here, the apportionment of the Delaware Legislature violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it creates gross discrimination between persons and groups of persons without any support in policy whatsoever. 
    We're contend here to take as appellants say they're content to take, the rule suggested by Baker and Carr to it that if the discrimination reflects no policy but simply arbitrary and capricious action then it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The findings of the District Court and the undisputed evidence, we think, demonstrate that this is such a case. 
    I don't want to take the time of the Court with a lot of figures because there's something that have to be again looked at and studied in order really to grasp them that if you were to look at the tables on pages 25 and again, over on 30 of our brief, you'd find that there is really the most enormous differences in the number of people in each district and remember that each district elects one representative or one senator as the case may be. 
    For example in Sussex County, you find the 8th District has as fewest three -- just under 3000 people and the 10th has as many as 12, the 9th has four so your differences of 2-to-1, 3-to1, 4-to1. 
    Within Kent County, you find districts running up from 2, 3, and 4-to-1 up to a difference of 6-to-1. 
    Within the City of New Castle curiously, you find the difference as great as 3-to-1 -- I -- I said City of New Castle, I meant City of Wilmington and within the County of New Castle, you find ratios running up to 12-to-1 and of course, you find differences of the same order when they are taken across county whereas I was stating it simply between counties, at page 25. 
    On page 30, we deal with the Senate. 
    You'll note that in New Castle County, the 7th Senatorial District has 4000 people and the 6th has 14,000 people. 
    The others run up to 63 to 64,000 people with a couple of (Inaudible). 
    Kent County, there's a ratio of at least 3-to-1 and another 2-to-1. 
    Sussex County is a little bit better. 
    They are the worst ratio isn't quite as bad as 2-to-1. 
    If you compare them cross county, you find that the same number of senators are assigned to the 300,000 people in New Castle County as or assigned to the 61,000 people in Kent County. 
    And remember, they are not assigned by county. 
    Those figures show in average rather than specific comparisons because comparison can't be county against county.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4580.762" stopTime="4595.333">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is their any reason assigned -- assigned, General, to the fact that in New Castle County and the Senate, one -- one district should have 4000 and another 52, does the legislature make any explanation?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4595.333" stopTime="4623.317">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    We've -- we found no explanation of this except to, it was suggested that no senator could be expected or representative could be expected to give up his seat so there was no use proposing a plan that wouldn't preserve all the existing district. 
    Well I suggest that in trench power is not a constitutional justification for a denial of equality. 
    And similarly --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4623.317" stopTime="4625.437">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That would be -- that would be the same in the House?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4625.437" stopTime="4721.185">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That would be the same in the House. 
    Similarly, it is said that, well, the existing legislature would have to approve the plan. 
    Therefore, it had to be one that would commend itself to a -- commend itself to a malapportioned body, but I submit again that that kind of justification doesn't show the differences in representation to be rational. 
    Certainly, we would always agree that if the matter of providing transcripts to the record on appeal to proper defendants in criminal cases came up and then majority of the legislature said, "We'll never stand for this. 
    It's an outrage. 
    The Supreme Court is all wrong.” 
    They finally compromise by supplying them in capital cases but not in any other cases. 
    I suppose from the standpoint of one seeking legislation it might be rational to take the compromise as if there were no other solution, but in constitutional terms that's not an acceptable kind of justification. 
    And you can imagine other cases. 
    I suppose that my State of Massachusetts years ago had disenfranchised Irish and there was fight in the legislature over it. 
    And it was agreed “Well, we will franchise those who have been in the country for four generations or three generations. 
    Now this is the only way we can get a bill through. 
    It would make the discrimination and it last on constitution but I think that's essentially what's involved here.

    Would you say the same thing, I realize that it isn't here but I'm just interested in testing your argument, would you say the same thing in this field that if this -- this present apportionment were put up the people of Delaware and to take an extreme example, they unanimously voted to a man to sustain the apportionment against the decision of this Court, does that would make any difference?

    -- in your --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4758.226" stopTime="5306.694">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    In the -- in this case, we didn't deal with it so explicitly in the earlier cases because the argument kept bringing out the points we have really dealt with, but that point is fully explained in our brief in this case. 
    There are some other reasons assigned and I would like to try to deal with each of them briefly. 
    In the first place, it suggested that the apportionment is rational because of the work of the bipartisan committee, had all the virtues of the work of the federal constitutional convention and that indeed they pass through 13 steps of procedure in expounding this plan of apportionment, but of course, we're concerned with what they did. 
    I have no desire to criticize the membership. 
    They may have had all the virtues attributed to them, but it's the result that the Court was concerned itself with and similarly the procedure that it went through 13 steps seems hardly decisive for all unconstitutional legislation goes through a good number of steps in the legislature not all was a faithful 13 steps, but nevertheless, it does go through committees and resolutions imposed. 
    We're told here substantively that one of the things that justifies the apportionment is that it is on a rational geographical basis. 
    Unfortunately, it has not been explained to us just what this rational geographical basis is. 
    Looking at it and there's a map attached to the complaint so you can see the configuration of the district, there are seven within each county but I don't know why that's particularly rational anymore than they have five in one, eight in another and 12 in another. 
    Even within the counties, the districts are widely different in area and population. 
    There seems to be no relationship between the area of the population that no significant topographical features as would explain to us at bar. 
    The two floterial districts in Kent County are divided between what is said to be the Eastern and Western House but I don't suppose that that's meant to explain why one has placed as many people in it and therefore half the representation of the other. 
    It's suggested the likelihood of population growth in the future would wipe out these inequities. 
    Well, it might, but when the county has to increase 15-fold, and another one has to increase a 12-fold and another one has to increase 11-fold and many of them 8-fold, it seems to me that -- that hope that maybe it will someday in the hereafter workout fairly is not enough to justify in -- unfairness in the present choice of the legislature. 
    Then it is said that this was compelled by time. 
    Mr. Theisen has pointed out one answer to that and that is that the District Court taking the facts and provisions of the Delaware Constitution really acted quite reasonably. 
    Another answer, I suggest, is that when constitutional ranks are denied, it's not a sufficient answer to say, "Oh, we did it in a hurry. 
    " The appellants are here arguing that this plan as a permanent continuing piece of legislation conforms to the Equal Protection Clause. 
    Indeed, they explain in answer to a question before the bench that they didn't want to moot the case, they didn't want to make this into stopgap legislation and enact another permanent end until they had their whack in having this one upheld. 
    Well, then it must be judged as continuing permanent legislature. 
    None of these explanations, I submit in conclusion, explain the gross inequalities that exist between the senatorial districts and the representative districts. 
    Indeed, I have yet to hear the explanation that was going to be given to Justice Goldberg for the difference in size between the districts -- the senatorial districts in New Castle County. 
    Finally, I want to say just a word with reference to the argument based on the early history of the Fourteenth Amendment and the early cases under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now, their only relevance, as I see it, is to an attack upon Baker and Carr. 
    I recognized that counsel claims that, but I cannot so the life of me saying what bearing the quotations from Minor and Happersett have or the references to the Fifteenth and Eighteenth Amendments have or to Fifteenth -- thank you, Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments have or that the quotations from Congressman Bingham have unless it is an argument that the Fourteenth Amendment has nothing to do with case -- with questions that have to do with voting. 
    Now, there it is all water long over the bend. 
    It is but settled ever since Nixon and Herndon in 273 U.S. that the Fourteenth -- that the equal protection of the Fourteenth Amendment clause does have something to do with voting right. 
    True, it is still up to the States to lay down the qualifications for voting, but the guarantee of equal protection applies to the opportunity to participate at primaries, to the right to have your vote counted equally with other votes so as to prevent against frauds, stuffing the ballot box and such to voting -- to having your vote counted as one vote in an election for Governor. 
    And as I read the decision in Baker v. Carr, it applies to the claim of equality and the right to representation. 
    So that going back over that history, it seems to me quite unnecessary at this stage. 
    Now, appellant say that the references to the readmission of Florida and the other discussion of the Fourteenth Amendment is intended to show that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the principle one man, one vote to be applied to representation in both houses of the legislature. 
    Certainly no such question is raised by this case and I think no such question is raised by any of the other cases that have been argued here during the past month. 
    Someday, that question may come here. 
    Someday it may have to be considered, but certainly Florida's Constitution, in terms of what was known about it when it came before the Congress in the 1860s, is no justification for what we know about the Delaware apportionment today. 
    All that appeared on the face of the Florida Constitution was that every county in the lower House was assured at least one representative and then remaining representatives were to be apportioned per capita and nothing appeared on the face of it about the upper House, but quite plainly that isn't altogether a different case than is before us in terms of the Delaware situation. 
    I think one another thing should be said about the history. 
    It is not quite as easy as appellants' quotations from the objection to the readmission of Florida and the reply by Benjamin Butler make out. 
    In the first place, there was considerable amount of debate in between and while Congressman Farnsworth of Illinois, of course said what Colonel Wiener said he said, he made a great many other points. 
    Congressman Butler took out for all the arguments that have been made by Congressman Farnsworth and at least one other representative and answered each of them one by one except this matter of apportionment and it was after that that he said, "All these matters have been going into by our committees."

speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="5318.250" stopTime="5336.257">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Not only that. 
    I would fully concur with that. 
    I would go one step further. 
    The conclusion I brought I suppose all this history once across different conclusion. 
    The conclusion I would draw was that the first of the argument was -- let's take Florida in anyway.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="5336.257" stopTime="5337.550">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Go on.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="5337.550" stopTime="5464.093">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    It was partly that. 
    Partly, it was pointed out on the Florida that the House Committee on Reconstruction had repeatedly turned down to Florida Constitution and had repeatedly found themselves dissatisfied with it. 
    I don't mean to imply that anything has to do with apportionment because I don't know of the slightest grieves to think so. 
    But it had repeatedly rejected and this is stated in about the same part of the debate that the quotations are taken from a little bit late. 
    The thrust of the argument for readmitting Florida was I would say two-fold or two points in addition to that mentioned by Justice Goldberg. 
    The first was what else are we going to do? 
    We've got to get on here. 
    We can't remand Florida back to the State as territory. 
    What else are we going to do but to take or despite the committee's dissatisfaction and that's what the committee recommended. 
    And the second thing was that we need Florida in for the purpose of having the Fourteenth Amendment ratified so as well are your doubts and vote to have Florida readmitted. 
    In other words, it comes to what Mr. Justice Douglas suggested if I heard him right this morning to words that there was a political decision to readmit Florida, governmental decision, I mean political in that sense and not a scrutinizing of everything Florida had done or stood for with the idea of writing it as a rubric on the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment yet to be adopted. 
    So that we think to preclude that the arguments are directed to the Fourteenth Amendment insofar as they attempt to overrule all the cases from Nixon and Condon and Nixon and Herndon down to Gray and Sanders come much too late and that so far as they are directed to sustaining this Delaware apportionment, they simply missed the point. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Frederick Bernays Wiener

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Colonel Wiener.
speaker="frederick_bernays_wiener" startTime="5466.123" stopTime="5608.167">
    Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener 
    If the Court please, there is a tradition at the bar of this Court and on one occasion when the lateness Mr. Justice McReynolds asked the question, he was answered by the familiar, "I am coming to that Your Honor" and he replied rather testily, "You're here now. 
    The question of the Senate in the Delaware Constitution is here now. 
    " Two of the judges below concurred in saying that it was impossible, it was impermissible to deviate from the population factor as the major factor in apportioning the Senate. 
    Judge Biggs at page A49 and Judge Wright at page A62, that problem is here. 
    Now, what I have talked about as the federal analogy what everyone else has talked about federal analogy means basically a one house not apportioned according to population. 
    Now, the two ways of doing that within the basic framework of the Delaware amendment, one is to have all the senators at large and the other is to have the senatorial districts equalized within the counties and the Solicitor General has said that you cannot expect anybody to vote away his seat, entrenched power is too strong and that's the reason why nothing has been equalized. 
    I suggest it is not very helpful particularly with those who -- on the part of those who represent the United States to deal with questions of this seriousness in terms of epithets and motives. 
    The fact of the matter is that when the equalizing bill which we have in our -- in the appendix to the reply brief got to the Senate, the Delaware Senate on the very day that the circuit justice stayed the -- the injunction, it passed unanimously. 
    Let's not have any talk about entrenched power. 
    They were prepared to equalize the -- equalize the Senate and perhaps vote away their own seats, but the State --

    No reply of absent. 
    Yes, they passed it and then they didn't do anything more because the case was on appeal, the injunction had been stayed and Judge Biggs himself had said at the trial, "I hope this case will be appealed to the Supreme Court. 
    " But the Delaware General Assembly of the State of Delaware is powerless to amend its Constitution if this injunction now stay a pending appeal remains in effect because if the Delaware General Assembly sometime in 1964 as soon as it -- as long as it sits proceeds to do whatever this Court's decision says is necessary, it can't do it by way of constitutional amendment because no subsequent General Assembly can ever be elected.

    Now, we think that unless rational and reasonable means personal preferences, this effort under these time limits, these terribly constricting time limits, passes a test of rationality. 
    However, if the matter needs to be -- if the Court feels that the existing plan needs to be perfected before it passes muster then we would like to do it by constitutional amendments and we can have such a constitutional amendment through this General Assembly and the next. 
    We think in that event, the matter ought to be returned with the injunction dissolved with directions per State to permit us, to permit the State of Delaware to perfect the basic plan and to affect the necessary equalizations consistently with what this Court tell the judge but do it according to the terms of the Constitution of the State and indicate how we can equalize. 
    Do we need to have everybody elected at large and wipe out the minority interest in every county or can we do it the way we set out to do it under the second report of the bipartisan committee tying up the inequalities by making every senate district within the State equal.

    Yes. 
    The -- the one General Assembly is now sitting and I think it's the 122nd, the next will be the 123rd, but what we're principally concerned with and what concerns us so very much is the rejection of the federal -- basic federal pattern of area representation in one house and population representation on the other. 
    The whole of that is outlawed under the Equal Protection Clause means a construction of that clause directly of variance with what the way Congress construed it in the case of Florida and South Carolina and Georgia. 
    And Mr. Cox’s the arguments here about the Congress not scrutinizing the Florida Constitution are just like Mr. Rankins in U.S. v. Florida but they didn't look the boundary. 
    And it would be a construction also of the Equal Protection Clause that would repeat the tragic era of the Due Process Clause construction that’s been so recently reviewed here. 
    And it would be a -- a result achieved not as a matter of elasticity on a case to case basis. 
    But at one fell swoop, it would -- not on the basis of experience put overnight and it would really, it would really be amending the Constitution with a cleaver and what would be the result? 
    I think the necessary, the inescapable result is that it would reduce the States of the union to mere geographical subdivisions when their -- their instrument of Government for constructing their legislature is subjected, it can be subjected at the instance of a single disgruntled citizen to a scrutiny far more searching then any of its legislation and in the process would be hurried and harried and sneered up by those who represent the United States as completely inadequate (Inaudible) efforts. 
    Now, I don't think, I don't think that the States -- the relationship of the States to the nation properly can be the same as the relationship of municipalities to a State. 
    That would be the inevitable consequence if a State is denied in the right to apportion, to mold, to construct, to -- its legislature on the federal pattern and the necessary consequence would be with that kind of a holding and the republic as it has existed. 
    Our federate republic as it has existed for 175 years would no longer be a federated republic.
