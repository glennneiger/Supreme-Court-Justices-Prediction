    Mr. Calvin H. Childress 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The nature of this case is an alleged unreasonable search and seizure by means of an electronic listening device. 
    The issues here are whether a city police officer have used an electronic listening device stuck into a party wall and this enabled him to hear everything that went on in the adjoining efficiency apartment occupied by the petitioner, constituted an unreasonable search and seizure. 
    In addition to this issue, the respondent had raised four questions before this Court. 
    He has suggested that although this search took place for three days before the arrest of the petitioner that the search was valid as incident to a legal arrest. 
    He selected that -- suggested that because the petitioner was suspected of running an illegal place that she forfeited her rights under the Fourth Amendment and he's also suggested that evidence obtained by electronic means should not be completely excluded, which point the petitioner does not state and he also asked this Court to review all the evidence if it finds there was -- the evidence found by the police officer was improper and find that there was other sufficient evidence to find the accused guilty. 
    This is sort of a harmless error doctrine. 
    The issue as to the unreasonable search and seizure by the electronic listening device, the trial court and the Commonwealth of Virginia are not required to write a written opinion and just rule that it was a proper search and seizure by -- and let the evidence in. 
    The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia held that there was not a showing of a physical trespass by this spike. 
    The spike was just stuck in the wall. 
    And therefore, that it was not an unreasonable search and seizure distinguishing it from the -- the Silverman case and holding under the Goldman case.

    And then he asked -- he was asked, "Was it a spike device?" 
    He said, "Yes, sir, a small device." 
    And then on cross examination, he was asked whether it was driven in the wall and he said, "No, sir." 
    â€œAnd was it stuck in the wall?" 
    "It was stuck in the wall."

speaker="calvin_h_childress" startTime="306.887" stopTime="576.435">
    Mr. Calvin H. Childress 
    If the Court please, I submit this question of what constitutes unreasonable search and seizure should -- should be faced by the problems that we -- modern technology and invention have developed to our forefathers of -- who are present at the time of the beginning of the revolution. 
    The problem wasn't reasonably simple. 
    They merely broke in the hearths. 
    But now, we have this problem of the electronic eavesdropper. 
    This Court has cited the eavesdroppers, the volume by (Inaudible) and it's well aware of the large problems that electronic surveillance present nowadays. 
    We -- we have pointed out in the eavesdroppers, the volume, this question of a sonic wave flooding a room and bringing it back. 
    But I suggest to the Court that its decision in Silverman created a new standard as to what constituted an unreasonable search and seizure. 
    Before Silverman beginning with Olmstead, it was held Olmstead being a tapping the telephone line, that there had to be a physical trespass. 
    It constituted the unreasonable search and seizure. 
    It acquainted the actual physical trespass of the police officer into the premises of the petitioner with the unreasonable search and seizure. 
    This was adhered to in Goldman. 
    But in Silverman, with the case of the -- despite that it went in six to seven inches and made contact with the dock of the heating system and it appropriated the whole heating system of the adjoining building. 
    This Court said at two places that it didn't turn upon the technicalities of local trespass law. 
    Silverman case did not turn upon the niceties of local trespass on a party wall. 
    Principle was enunciated in Silverman, it was a case turned upon the -- the reality of an actual intrusion into a constitutionally protected area. 
    And if Your Honor please, I submit that's what we have here. 
    The section on tools and dash and open a sports book, the eavesdropper points out that a contact mic, a spike mic is use to get access into a room where you don't have a way to get in there, any other way. 
    And that despite by making contact with a stud allows you to get access to the room and hear what's going on. 
    Now, the respondent wrote, Professor Schwartz, a letter on that which appears in page 17 of his brief but I believe it proved too much. 
    Professor Schwartz emphasized there that walls have a dead air space between them. 
    And that this usually, this speaks to me as a layman, a sort of an insulated situation. 
    And the sounds don't come through this dead air space and Professor Schwartz said that "unless you have a spike mic that go through that, it's quite likely that no other microphone would also work." 
    That's -- now when -- but this -- this is the problem. 
    What constitutes unreasonable search and seizure? 
    I submit to the Court that as I read Silverman versus United States, it does set up this new standard of reality of an actual intrusion. 
    It doesn't speak of a physical intrusion. 
    And then under this new standard, that the search and seizure of the instant case is unreasonable. 
    I suggest that the Court should again reemphasize the standard. 
    It -- it is a standard that has meaning in our present day under our present day means of discovery. 
    And in -- in -- as Justice Brandeis said in his dissent in the Olmstead case, a discovery and invention can find means much greater than constriction on the rack to hearing or disclosing what was whispered in a closet. 
    And this is the situation that that we reached today.

    You pull down to your window shade.

    And if the District Attorney filed an affidavit suggesting an invoice, what -- what was on it if the defendant didn't turn it up then it was presumed to have admitted it. 
    Now, this of course did not involve a physical trespass. 
    In Gouled versus United States was an Army officer and a friend of his came into his office and surreptitiously took a piece of evidence. 
    And again, this was not a physical trespass.

   Argument of D. Gardiner Tyler
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1555.897" stopTime="1562.756">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may do Mr. -- Mr. Childress. 
    Mr. Tyler.
speaker="d_gardiner_tyler" startTime="1562.756" stopTime="2003.894">
    Mr. D. Gardiner Tyler 
    If it Please the Court. 
    We maintain here the fair state -- there was no physical invasion or inclusion of -- at least in obtaining the evidence objected to and sought to be excluded. 
    And secondly, there was no unreasonable search as condemned by the Fourth Amendment. 
    And thirdly, the evidence complained of did not contribute to the conviction of the defendant. 
    Oh, to understand the case, I would think it would necessarily give you some point of background as to what -- why the officers were in the apartment. 
    This thing, I'm making a (Inaudible) a quasi criminal to suggest -- it kind of hurts me because they're not. 
    In other words, the officers there, to do their duty. 
    Now, the duty of the officers there was to watch the apartment, put the woman under surveillance by the law of a police department. 
    Now, the -- the evidence is amply clear here that she had -- that -- of a reputation in the community, what she was doing now for years and years and the officer in the surveillance appears they -- he didn't get into car at all. 
    He stayed in asleep in this car and watching the apartment. 
    What did he observe? 
    Observed the parents of the defendant there, with her husband from time to time and they tried to kill men and women, the young women and men. 
    It added to the -- in another feature, they found that the -- the apartment was rented by the defendant in a false name, in other words, in another name. 
    They didn't disclose their real name. 
    So honestly, from the very beginning, the -- what the officers knew there, this woman was operating this house of prostitution and that was the purpose of renting the apartment. 
    She lived elsewhere in Norfolk. 
    She maintained a whole (Inaudible). 
    And she used -- and she rented this apartment for the sole purpose of operating a house of prostitution. 
    Now, it's come to the Honorable Court to relieve them the responsibility of that crime. 
    Your Honor, if it please Your Honor, the police department violated the provisions of the Fourth Amendment and they get around it like this. 
    This thing, that certain evidence obtained by the police officer should be excluded. 
    Now, I think the Court should -- should have some idea what that evidence was. 
    Was it material? 
    Didn't have anything to do with the -- the account on which she was found guilty? 
    Now, she was -- she would -- this woman was charged in the indictment, two counts. 
    One count was the -- count number one was a violation of Section 208 or 18.228 of the code which makes it unlawful to obtain money from a prostitute. 
    A female engaged in the occupation of prostitution. 
    The other count was pleasing a female in a house of prostitution. 
    Separate sections of the code of Virginia, separate crimes. 
    And the one in which she was found guilty was the one that according to the determination made by the Supreme Court of Appeals was that statute that makes it unlawful for a person to obtain money from a prostitute. 
    Share in this -- no question about the -- of the guilt there. 
    The -- the reason that -- the -- that the termination was made by the Court of Appeals on -- in that and this isn't the -- the penalty proscribed. 
    The jury gave her a $500 fine and five years in -- in the penitentiary. 
    The -- of the youth -- the penalty of both operating in the house of prostitution on the other hand, is a minimum fine of a $1000 and the -- I think a maximum 10-year imprisonment. 
    Obviously, she wasn't found guilty of that by the jury, affirmed by the trial court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Virginia. 
    The Court of Appeals of Virginia stated that in the -- in it -- in the -- in the record here. 
    There's no question about that. 
    So, we can hear -- that's found on -- that's found on pages 44 of the 40 -- 40 -- page 40. 
    They call -- Virginia says the jury found defendant guilty as charged under the first count and fixed her punishment to five years imprisonment and a fine of $500. 
    Now, the evidence sought to be excluded and I have put it on in -- in the brief here, the appendix of the brief. 
    And I have -- the evidence that was sought to be excluded was that this -- the conversations that this Officer Beach heard. 
    What did they amount to? 
    Did they amount to anything? 
    Did they show that this woman violated this -- the law by obtaining money from a prostitute? 
    And then the -- the indictment named the prostitute, Katherine R. Taylor. 
    Katherine R. Taylor isn't mentioned in the converse -- in the conversation or what's heard. 
    There's nothing mentioned in the conversations that the -- the woman, the defendant obtained money from a prostitute. 
    So there --

    Mr. D. Gardiner Tyler 
    Well, except -- except -- the jury found the -- the -- it -- it's determined -- it's determined by the -- the penalty assessed by the jury.

    Mr. D. Gardiner Tyler 
    No, sir because it -- you'd have to show -- the evidence would have to show that the -- the spike went -- and factually in -- into the -- into the premises of the -- of the defendant. 
    That's what the Court is talking about there. 
    The fraction of the instant means a physical fraction of an instance because the Court very clearly in the -- in the Silverman case, used this language. 
    For a fair reading of the record in this case, shows that the eavesdropping was accomplished by means of unauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied by petitioner. 
    And the turnover to the -- you can see the concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Clark and Mr. Justice Whittaker. 
    They say this, "In view of the determination by the majority that the unauthorized physical penetration into the petitioner's premises constitutes sufficient trespass to remove this case of the coverage of errant decisions, we've -- we are obliged to join in the Court's opinion. 
    And what else did -- and after that case, this Court in the -- in the Lopez case last June, mind you, used this language to the Lopez case, didn't have a -- it didn't have a spike mic but it had a little, a little device in the pocket of a detective, they picked up the sound while he was there interviewing this man. 
    Now, what did the Lopez case state? 
    See, I --

    Mr. Tyler, did you ever see this device?

    No sir. 
    I did not.

    Mr. D. Gardiner Tyler 
    I don't think I could agree with anything else (Inaudible) -- I mean I like to do it. 
    I would like to do it.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I beg your pardon?

    Mr. D. Gardiner Tyler 
    I would like to do it but I -- I just can't. 
    I can't agree to -- to permit that --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
speaker="d_gardiner_tyler" startTime="2433.731" stopTime="2447.096">
    Mr. D. Gardiner Tyler 
    -- that the thing out of the record, I mean that's all -- is the -- we -- we have to -- we have to stand -- draw a line somewhere or maybe some -- or the things in the -- not in the record but if the Commonwealth would like to put into --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2447.096" stopTime="2483.947">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, that seems to be so vital if it was a spike mic. 
    And it was -- the spike was injected into the wall, it would come very, very close to -- to Silverman. 
    On the other hand, if as the Court of Appeals inferred that it was nothing more than something like a thumbtack that would keep it from falling from the wall. 
    It might be differentiated. 
    So I -- I don't think it would be unreasonable if it's available to determine what the true fact is by counsel agreeing to show it to us, (Voice Overlap) --

    We have no right to insist on it, of course. 
    It isn't in the record, that's true.
speaker="d_gardiner_tyler" startTime="2493.528" stopTime="2511.682">
    Mr. D. Gardiner Tyler 
    Well, wouldn't it be on a -- when -- when you have to have other evidence besides that little -- if you want, (Inaudible). 
    Wouldn't you have to have the -- a description of the wall. 
    How -- I don't think it was the wall? 
    Was it -- was it six inches or was it a foot or was it 10 feet. 
    In other words --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="d_gardiner_tyler" startTime="2513.235" stopTime="2521.009">
    Mr. D. Gardiner Tyler 
    That would be very material, we're talking about the spike. 
    If the spike was just inches long, three inches, and the wall was more than that. 
    You --

    Yes.

    -- one -- one could go through them.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2523.084" stopTime="2548.342">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But I think -- I -- I think Mr. Tyler, one of the things that -- that bother us here, some of us anyway is the fact that the officer said it was a spike mic. 
    He answered yes. 
    He said a small device. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals translated that into the fact that it was nothing more than a thumbtack on the wall.
speaker="d_gardiner_tyler" startTime="2548.342" stopTime="2549.770">
    Mr. D. Gardiner Tyler 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2549.770" stopTime="2570.724">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You tell us and counsel tell us that the Court never saw it, and knows no more about it -- about it than -- than we do. 
    And we don't know whether it was a thumbtack arrangement or -- or a spike mic as the -- as the officer said it. 
    And it might be of some interest to us if it -- if it was here, that's all but (Voice Overlap) --

    They'd be punished by a fine not less than $1000. 
    Not less than $1000 and by confinement in the penitentiary of not less than one year or more than 10 years. 
    That was the one that -- that was the second count. 
    Now, the -- the count that she was found guilty of, in other words, that obtaining a money from a prostitute, it said this. 
    She'll be con -- confined in the penitentiary of not less than one year or more than 10 years and fine not more than $500.

    It -- I want to say this, there's been a -- a privilege to be before this Honorable Court, I want to thank you for the consideration extended and its been an honor to represent my State of -- State of Virginia. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Calvin H. Childress
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2683.910" stopTime="2686.646">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Childress.
speaker="calvin_h_childress" startTime="2686.646" stopTime="2788.969">
    Mr. Calvin H. Childress 
    Your Honor. 
    I would like to point out Your Honors the question of the evidence relating to the offense. 
    This Court in a Faye decision said if it weren't -- the question was not whether there was other evidence sufficient to convict but whether the evidence was contributed to the conviction and the evidence found by the spike mic did actually contribute to this conviction, related to sounds of prostitution. 
    It related that a man came in to the next apartment and said that he want a woman in his apartment and Catherine Clinton, the petitioner, says, "I'll send one to you." 
    Now, this I submit is where a material and does go to the question of whether she was a -- pondering in this case whether she took money without a -- with consideration. 
    This is the question because we had here Katherine Taylor, the main prosecution witness who admitted to previous prostitution and admitted that she was living illicitly with a man during this time. 
    And the question was whether she had moved up in the ranks of the working girl to the rank of management for which case Katherine Clinton would not have been guilty of this offense. 
    And as to the evidence -- as to the spike mic Your Honor, fortunately, I'll be happy -- the counsel would agree to have it send up here. 
    The policeman did say it was a spike device and it was stuck in the wall and enabled him to hear sounds in the other room. 
    Thank you.
