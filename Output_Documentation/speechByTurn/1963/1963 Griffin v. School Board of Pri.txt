    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    We want to make in the time left, several points. 
    One, that the State is deeply involved in the -- this whole operation that as a matter of fact, but for the fact that the Prince Edward County closed the schools, the Prince Edward School Foundation would not be functioning and what has really happened is by virtue of its closing the schools, it is responsible and directly responsible for the fact that children are now going to the schools. 
    So that I don't believe that the State can say, that in this instance, “We're innocent bystanders and innocent parties. 
    Secondly, we don't believe -- what we think is clear is that the schools were closed in order to defeat and frustrate, in order not to maintain unsegregated schools as the Constitution requires.

speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="308.762" stopTime="396.705">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Insofar as the argument that we're presenting, we think that the State has function and operated to this extent that the State has, after the 1955 and in terms of its so-called massive resistance which we program, which we presented in our brief, did amend the tuition grant law, did or permit and allow this operation of the schools on the local basis. 
    And in fact, it does seem to us, in terms of this, that what has happened is that the State was making it possible in terms of its amendments to its laws for local counties to decide for themselves whether they wanted to abide by the Constitution of the United States. 
    The State itself, since the school closing law was declared unconstitutional in James v. Bowman, has enacted laws apparently to leave this matter to the local parties. 
    Now we feel that what really is happening in this case is that the Prince Edward County, Prince Edward County has said “We'll close the schools rather than have schools operating and functioning.” 
    We say to the Court that this cannot be done, that this is the State is operating, the State is functioning and that the State is required to obey and abide by the Constitution, that the schools cannot be closed.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    On the basis of the denial of equal protection, equal protection of the laws. 
    It is our view that insofar as the State is concerned, that the State of Virginia, that the people in Prince Edward County, from whatever source the closing of the schools came, that the people in Prince Edward County, the children in Prince Edward County are being denied equal protection of the laws because Virginia is deeply involved in running and operating the school system throughout the study.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    And maybe you might have a different argument as to whether it could abandon the part of the State and not in the other, but the argument -- I can understand your argument if you base it on the facts, that this is a state course of conduct, state course of conduct which in denial of the right in the Fourteenth Amendment, ends up in denying people the right to go to school on account of their color or permitting other people to go to school because of their color.

    – and I think in order to present this case, and I am -- time is pressing close off upon the terms -- by attempting to make the other arguments I wanted to make. 
    It does seem to me that I do believe that insofar as the narrow question before this Court in which I believe that this case can be determined on one, is on the basis of the reasons why these schools were closed, the reasons why they're not operating, and the basis upon which the Prince Edward County and the State took its position. 
    Well it seems to me, that on that -- that there's no question, but that there has been a denial and frustration right. 
    I think that the tuition grant program which has been -- and the state scholarship program that they can be enjoined and should be enjoined as long as they are utilized for the support of education and institutions that discriminate on the basis of the color. 
    I think insofar as the release is concerned, that there should no question and no problem in regard to relief because the Court has before it the parties, who are the principal parties to this action. 
    It seems to me that the relief we're asking for is that the County Board be required to levy taxes, sufficient and appropriate funds sufficient to reopen the public schools in Prince Edward County on a nonsegregated basis. 
    And that the County Board of Education be required to make plan for the admission of people on a nonsegregated basis effective, we hope by September, 1954 and that the State be required -- state officials be required to do all that they must do under -- in order that the schools will be opening and functioning by September, 1954 --

   Argument of Archibald Cox

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="857.611" stopTime="1044.345">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The United States joins the petitioners in urging that the judgment below in this case be reversed and that the case be sent back with instructions to grant relief necessary to bring about a reopening of the public schools in Prince Edward County. 
    I shall argue the case in somewhat technical terms introduced by the respondents, but not because that is the whole case, but because it seems to me important to show that even on their own ground, their arguments when closely examined, are lacking in the merits. 
    The Court will not forget, I'm sure, even though I don't mention it again, that this case is ultimately concerned with probably the greatest of injustices, the denial of -- and equal education to children because of racial considerations. 
    Now as we see it, the case has two, somewhat different parts. 
    The first concerns the situation that obtained while the tax credits, the scholarships, and the tuition grants were enforced. 
    And it seems quite clear that with the public schools in the county closed, now I don't go beyond it, that with the public schools in the county closed and public schools being operated by the State in every other county, that the main -- that the contribution of state funds to this white foundation school is clearly within Cooper and Aaron, and that there's nothing more to that issue. 
    The more difficult part of the case, although I think not difficult when one analyzes it clearly, is when one creates it on the supposition that there is no financial aid being given to the children or through them to the foundation school. 
    As we see it, this branch of the case rests upon a very simple theory that if you keep it clearly in mind dissolves all the complexities that have been so much argued about. 
    The schools of Prince Edward County have been closed solely because of the policy of denying the children who live in that county, any public education rather than giving them an equal public education as required by this Court's mandate. 
    And we submit that for officials exercising state power to deny children who live in Prince Edward County any public education, upon such a grant, while granting it to all other children in the state, constitutes an invidious discrimination, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment between children who live in Prince Edward County and children who live outside.

    Suppose, on this branch of the argument, it doesn't -- it's not important that there be racial discrimination and it's not really vital that this be related to schools. 
    I suppose this argument could be made if Virginia, through the cooperation of its state and local officials, provided highways in all of the counties, but one that did not provide it (Voice Overlap)
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1069.082" stopTime="1174.451">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I plan to devote my whole argument to this point and I think the difference is that I say between the case you suggest and this case will come out in course of it. 
    I will develop, Mr. Justice Stewart, at some length two points. 
    First, that here the only ground suggested for the differentiation is the purpose to perpetuate inequality in educational opportunities. 
    And second, that assuming one could go behind that, or that that was irrelevant, that in this case there is suggested and cannot be presumed to be any differences in local conditions or local needs such as would justify some of the exercises of local options that have been suggested in the opinions below and here. 
    I'm going to develop that as we go along, but those seemed to me to be the two essential points in discussing local option. 
    In the -- I'm going to devote my whole argument except that I would hope until the time at the end to this basic thesis. 
    In developing it, I start with the indisputable fact that the net effect of respondent's activities is an unconstitutional kind of discrimination against the children of Prince Edward County, in favor of the children who live everywhere else. 
    Prince Edward County children have no less need for a basic education. 
    There's no suggestion that they are less educatable. 
    The sole ground for the differentiation is the desire to avoid having them -- having white children in the county, go to the same school as Negroes. 
    Now it manifest --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1174.451" stopTime="1181.195">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're not talking now though basically about racial discrimination, but rather discrimination against all the school children of Prince Edward County?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1181.195" stopTime="1182.892">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1182.892" stopTime="1183.819">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, that's what I'm asking.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1183.819" stopTime="1792.917">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Oh yes. 
    Yes. 
    I'm sorry. 
    What I meant to say was that there are local options and local options and the fact that this local option, if it may be called that, is impermissible, does not require one to say that all local options are impermissible and I was afraid that I'd let, Your Honor, to think I was taking the opposite. 
    It depends on the local option, that is what I'm getting and trying to say. 
    To manifest the purpose of the basis of classification here is not acceptable under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now that point was squarely decided in James and Almond, a three-judge court decision that was cited by approval in this Court in Cooper and Aaron. 
    And indeed, the respondents could see that point, that if Virginia had introduced this differentiation, and by Virginia, I now mean the statewide officials, that it would be unconstitutional. 
    The whole debate here therefore, is whether the respondents, by the procedure that they have followed, can escape responsibility for what would otherwise have been a patently unconstitutional result. 
    Now manifestly, anybody pressing such a proposition is that has a very heavy burden to carry. 
    First, I suggest that it's plain that the discrimination between these two groups of children, regardless of race, is not saved by the fact that the victims live in one county and those, with whom they are being compared, live in other counties. 
    While the Fourteenth Amendment does not require territorial uniformity, nevertheless, and the Fourteenth Amendment leaves a lot of room for territorial variations in the law, still, the bear fact that a discrimination conforms to county line, is not enough to make it rational and within the Equal Protection Clause. 
    That's the point of of course in Baker and Carr and Grand Sanders and that's the point that's been assumed, repeatedly, in decisions of this Court, examining laws that vary differently on people in different localities. 
    Again, nobody really questions the fact, as the court below said, “No one questions the principle that if Virginia is operating a statewide centralized system of schools, she may not close their schools in Prince Edward County in the face of a desegregation order, while she continues to operate the schools in the other counties.” 
    Here respondent's argument is that this discrimination which would be admittedly unconstitutional if the legislature did it is saved in this instance because it's accomplished by what they call local option. 
    Now it might be enough to say that that contention is inconsistent with this Court's all the precedents. 
    On at least two, I think it's fair to say three occasions, the Court has held that in making territorial variations in the treatment of citizens, the legislature has all the -- has the power to do everything that could be done by local option. 
    As a matter of logic it follows, that what the legislature can't do, can't be done by local option and so, under those precedents, the contention that respondents make is contrary to the views of this Court. 
    Now it's not necessary for us to go so far as to urge that expression of local preference will never save a classification that would be unconstitutional if made by the legislator. 
    It's enough for us to show, I submit, first that the mere fact of local option does not automatically take a differentiation out from under the Equal Protection Clause. 
    And second, that the expression of local preference will not save this classification, under the circumstances of this case. 
    In other words, that the court below erred in supposing that because some local options were constitutional, therefore, all local options must be constitutional, which does not follow. 
    Plainly the local option does not automatically render the Equal Protection Clause inapplicable. 
    There's no magic in the words local option. 
    What the introduction of local option does is two things. 
    First, it fragments the power decision making processes of the State among a variety officials, some local, and some statewide and second, it provides for a referendum or other expression of local opinion. 
    Let's see if either of those renders the Equal Protection Clause inapplicable. 
    The fragmentation of state power, among statewide officials and officials with only countywide jurisdiction is patently irrelevant. 
    Respondent's, if I understand them say here, that the officials in the county aren't discriminating, the supervisors aren't discriminating because they voted that no child shall have a public education and their authority is only countywide. 
    Now the School Board says that, it also says “We're helpless. 
    We're dependent upon the supervisors.” 
    And the state officials say, “We aren't discriminating because we're offering the same thing to every county.” 
    And that's the ground chiefly on which the court below rested, but that, I submit, is contrary to the decisions of this Court, and indeed, I think I can say, patently fallacious. 
    The fallacy is that the act of several officials, including county officials, cannot be viewed one at a time in isolation. 
    Every respondent here, and this goes for the county supervisors, is exercising or purporting to exercise, the power and authority of Virginia. 
    Every one of them is acting as and for the State so far as the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment are concerned. 
    That's been true all the way from Virginia and Reeves to Cooper against Aaron, that the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned with the net effect of the exercise of state power and not with who doesn't or with what particular officials doing. 
    That principle is illustrated, perhaps, best by the cases based which involve a converse situation by the cases involving challenges under the Fourteenth Amendment, complaining that the power has been exercised by the wrong instrumentality. 
    And in an early case of Missouri against Dockery, Mr. Justice Holmes said for the Court, “Rights under that amendment turn on the power of the State, no matter by what organ it acts, it is a question of the power of the State, as a whole,” and so in the converse situation it's the question of the power of the State as a whole and what its impact is in creating an unjust discrimination, not who does it? 
    The principle is quite clearly illustrated by a case which unfortunately is not cited in our briefs. 
    Iowa-Des Moines Bank against Bennett in two -- Iowa-Des Moines Bank against Bennett in 284 U.S. at 239. 
    In that case, a national bank was contending that it had been subjected to discriminatory taxation, not in this case in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in violation of a federal statute that permitted the capital of national banks to be taxed equally with the capital of other monied institution. 
    And the claim was, on the part of the bank, that they were subjected to a higher rate of taxation, or that their capital had been over valued. 
    The answer that the State made was that, “Our statutes don't require this.” 
    The board of the assessors made an equal assessment upon the federal bank and the other monied institutions, but that any higher rate being paid by the federal bank is the result of a mistake made by the county treasurer, I think it was, or perhaps it was the tax collector. 
    And Justice Brandeis speaking for a unanimous court, if my memory is right, brushed that aside and said its a question of the power of the State as a whole, and that for the purposes of determining whether there was discrimination. 
    The powers of the several state officials must be treated as if merged into a single officer and that's exactly the contention we made here. 
    And under that principle, if one took the concession literally, since they must be treated as if they were a single officer and since everybody has agreed through this litigation that the discrimination among children based on where they live, would violate the Fourteenth Amendment if accomplished by a single statewide officer. 
    It follows that the judgment below was wrong.

speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1882.950" stopTime="1891.052">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I take it your suggestion is that the state, even if one discussed this case in terms of local option, the state retains a close connection with them.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1891.052" stopTime="1892.129">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Exactly.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1892.129" stopTime="2587.673">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    And that's true, and I rely on that fact. 
    There are many ways, in which, the state retains a close connection, the approval of teachers, the prescription of what the school book should be, the local superintendent of schools must come for an approved list and so on. 
    But I've been, as I said in the beginning, I've been anxious to take this case just in the terms in which they put it and to show that even then, there is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    So, while of course, we rely on that if necessary, I think even if those elements weren't there, the result would have to be the same. 
    Now, I mentioned that there were two elements introduced by local option, one was this fragmentation of authority. 
    The other is -- that per se not here a local referendum but an expression of local opinion through elected officials which I will assume is the same for present purposes. 
    But I submit that it's clear that that cap, automatically take the case out from under the Fourteenth Amendment and here, I think, was the fundamental error in the opinion below. 
    The Court said, since every locality may participate, if it wishes to do so and state funds are available to each upon the same conditions. 
    The state is even handed. 
    Well, I've already mentioned that the locality is the state, as one error in that, but more than that the Fourteenth Amendment isn't concerned with the equality of treatment among localities, it's concerned with the equality treatment among people. 
    These are personal rights and they are personal rights, which it has been held many times, cannot be waived by majority vote, not even by the will of the majority of the class affected. 
    So that the referendum doesn't destroy the individuals right, whether a white or colored child in Prince Edward County, to equality before the state with other children in Virginia. 
    So that the local option, I submit, does not automatically take this case out from under the Equal Protection Clause. 
    Then the question becomes is the denial of public schooling to Prince Edward children while giving it to other children an invidious or otherwise arbitrary classification and I point out to begin with that so far as anything in the record shows, conditions in Prince Edward County and children in Prince Edward County are just like other children in respect to the fundamental need for an education. 
    And so, we say, that even if it would be assumed that there are times when the preference of the people in a particular locality, will save a classification based on residence, a lack of territorial uniformity in the law, still that the local preference will not save the classification here for two independently sufficient reasons. 
    In the first place, this classification differentiating between people, between children, who are apparently similarly situated in every relevant respect is itself too invidious, to furnish a justification for the differentiation. 
    The schools were closed and this is beyond dispute because of the recitals of the school -- of the Board of Supervisors, and I don't think they deny it or have any desire to slide away from it, the schools were closed, solely to avoid giving Negro children an equal public education as this Court has defined it with white children. 
    Only in the abolition of segregated education can Negro children receive true equality. 
    Surely, the desire to perpetuate one invidious discrimination, one inequality based on race, will not justify introducing another inequality, although that one is not based upon race, it is still an inequality and that, I submit, is the end of the case here we have so far as the substance goes. 
    Here, we have a classification, different treatment by the state of people who in all respect are apparently alike, and the reason for it is so unworthy as the motive in this case and it just won't serve to justify and to rationalize the classification. 
    The state is not treating people differently in pursuit of a rational policy. 
    Now, I would emphasize that this, that what I have said is not inconsistent in any respect with the cases cited by the respondents which they argue, support the proposition that motive will not vitiate an otherwise constitutional act. 
    Nut the cases that they cite, typically, deal with use of the commerce power and the claim was made that what Congress was interested in was not regulating commerce but accomplishing some moral objective as in lottery ticket or that in the Child Labor Tax case, that the purpose was to eliminate child labor, not to raise money. 
    Those cases are different and we would fully concede that the use of a power to achieve was not -- is not vitiated by achieving some collateral objective, but here the question is whether you -- by a classification, which is at first blunt, arbitrary and unreasonable, there is something -- some policy the state is trying to achieve that justifies the classification that makes it rational and here, the state has excluded all other hypothesis by saying what their purpose is and as I said a moment ago, the purpose to perpetuate one inequality of a character that the constitution condemns certainly won't justify introducing another inequality. 
    Nor is this in anyway inconsistent with the possibility, and I state only with the possibility but I assume it for this case, with the possibility that a state might be able to abandon all public education. 
    Then there would be no question, under the Equal Protection Clause, if it genuinely abandoned, but here we are concerned with the Equal Protection Clause, and the schools are operating in other parts of the state. 
    Now, I go a step further. 
    I assume now, for the sake of argument, that the Supervisors are not bound by their own resolutions or that their motive is irrelevant. 
    Still, we submit that this discrimination cannot be saved by any expression of opinion under local option because education is a subject, in relation to which, because education is subject in relation to which the discrimination occurs is too important, and its importance too far transcends county lines to deny some children the opportunity for some education while granting it to others unless some very strong justification appeared. 
    Here -- that my time is running terribly rapidly, I -- here, let me simply say briefly, this is not a situation in which one can presume that there are any differences in territorial or local conditions that would justify this discrimination in the cases of juvenile detention homes, and the like, they're obviously are. 
    Here, it is not suggested that the schools compete with other needs of the county, for the tax dollars available, nor can it be said that education is such a local matter, that the people -- just because they want it that way, can give it to children -- they give it to their children or not. 
    That maybe true of speed loss or whether you'll have race tracks in the town or whiskey as the like, as Justice Holmes once said, those matters are wholly within the power of the state. 
    Education is too fundamental, too important, and I emphasize that it transcends county lines. 
    If children lose three years of education, their lives will be affected by that, where ever they go or what ever they do. 
    And if this experiment in ignorance is continued in Prince Edward County, it will affect the whole state and not just conditions in that county. 
    Now, taking it as established, I hurry on, that there is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, because of this discrimination between children in Prince Edward County and all other children in Virginia then it seems to us to follow that the decree must bar the continuance of that unconstitutional state of action. 
    The decree should require the defendants so long as Virginia furnishes public education elsewhere to take the steps necessary to furnish it to children in Prince Edward County. 
    The thrust of such a decree is plainly negative. 
    It would enjoin an unconstitutional course of conduct and on direct parties persons purporting to exercise state authority in order to carry on an unconstitutional course of conduct may be enjoined. 
    Under some circumstances, it might be possible simply to stop there and it's to be presumed that respondents, especially those who have taken an oath of office, will carry out their duties when they're laid down clearly, certainly by this Court. 
    Here, so much time has passed that we join in urging that more specific steps be spelled out in the Court's Amendment. 
    We think the supervisors should be ordered to levy the taxes necessary to provide some basic education in Prince Edward County that the Board of Education should be required to open the schools and to submit a plan for the desegregation of the schools and that the state officials should be enjoined from continuing the discrimination.

    I think not, Your Honor for two reasons. 
    So far as the county officials are concerned, it seems to me that the Eleventh Amendment is rendered inapplicable by the fact that they are county officials and the counties enjoined -- enjoy none of the immunity that the state would enjoy. 
    Now, my friends from Virginia say that that applies only where there is a debt involved. 
    The two answers to that, one that most clearly is not the ground on which this Court's decision rests.

speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="2695.096" stopTime="2700.195">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    But by interpretation, it has been taken to apply by citizens of the same state.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2700.195" stopTime="2703.778">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that's sovereign immunity, isn't it?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="2703.778" stopTime="2834.278">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    In that event, I suggest the doctrine doesn't apply for the reason I have stated. 
    The two have been equated quite frequently, Mr. Justice. 
    I think Hummel and Louisiana are some such names in this first case. 
    So we say that in terms of the counties acts -- count -- the county supervisor's action, this defense simply doesn't apply, but I think there's another and more fundamental answer to any argument based on the Eleventh Amendment or sovereign immunity, and that is, that you can't pick the decree apart and look at it bit by bit. 
    The remedies that are proposed here are in their thrust, negative. 
    Their aim as a whole at compelling the cessation of this course of conduct. 
    That truly suggests that the County Supervisors should be required to levy the tax. 
    Strictly speaking, I take it that if Virginia were disposed to give up her entire public school system then the theory we've advanced here would make it proper to release the Board of Supervisors from that obligation, but surely the Court in framing the details of its decree, vis-a-via the Supervisors, is entitled to presume that Virginia is going to continue doing what it's done all along, do its part to provide public schools for the children of Virginia. 
    And if that is a false assumption and if Virginia comes in and says, “We're planning to close our entire school system despite the provisions of our Constitution, requiring the legislature to operate and maintain a system of schools throughout the state,” then will be time enough to think about modifying the decree. 
    For the present as I say, the relief we suggest, seems to us, to be essentially negative, essentially directed at terminating an unconstitutional course of conduct.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    No, I would (Voice Overlap) I think that they -- does not require a three-judge court and I was just coming to that. 
    I do want to say, if I may say one sentence first, of course mandamus to compel the levying of taxes is sustained by a number of decisions cited in our brief. 
    Now, the reason we think that a three-judge court is not required, the reasons are two-fold. 
    In the first place, the relief sought is not to restrain in the language of the federal statute, the enforcement or execution of a state statute. 
    The attack is upon the executive or administrative action and the action which the respondents have chosen to embark upon, not upon anything required by the state law. 
    And the decision of this Court in Ex parte Bransford, 310 U.S. 354, 310 U.S 354, especially at 359, deals with that very point if I may read just a sentence. 
    There the challenge was that certain state taxation was discriminatory under the Fourteenth Amendment, but the state statute didn't require the discrimination. 
    It resulted from the act of minor state officials and the Court said, “Variations by assessors in valuations of like property, taxable under the same statute, sufficiently marked to be discriminatory under the Constitution for valuations so large as to be confiscatory cannot properly be said to be the basis for an attack on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the statute. 
    Such assessments, if made and if invalid, are so because of a wrong done by officers under the statute rather than because of the requirement of the statute itself” and I submit that that is an exact description.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Then I won't mention the other case and our second argument upon this point would be -- would be this, that a case primarily against local officials on a matter that is of immediate local concern, which the decree will not have a statewide impact of any significance It's not a case that requires a three-judge court. 
    I'll supply the citations to support that statement. 
    There are a number of such cases. 
    There is one last point. 
    It is argued here that the state officials have done nothing wrong and that the county school authorities have done nothing wrong, that each of their acts depends upon an act by somebody else, and that therefore, no relief can be granted against them. 
    That point is squarely covered by an opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis in the case of Labette County Commissioners versus United States which is cited in our brief, Labette County Commissioners against United States, 112 U.S. 217, 224, 225.

   Argument of J. Segar Gravatt
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3085.276" stopTime="3093.259">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gravatt.
speaker="j_segar_gravatt" startTime="3093.259" stopTime="3621.097">
    Mr. J. Segar Gravatt 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    I would like at the outset of the argument of this case, sir, to see if we can agree on a few very simple and I think well-established principles. 
    The first is that this is a suit to redress deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States upon that fact depends the jurisdiction of the District Court. 
    It is extremely difficult to read the brief of the petitioners and ascertain what is the right that they claim that they have been deprived of. 
    It is stated in oral argument that the right is a right to equal educational opportunities. 
    That statement is contained in the brief. 
    In order to find out what are the constitutional rights that they have, it is necessary first for us to determine what this Court decided in Brown against Board of Education. 
    As I understand the opinion, as it has been construed by all of the lower federal courts, the opinion was an enlargement of the liberty of people within the jurisdiction of the United States in that, it removed race as a consideration with respect to the access to and the use of public facilities, namely, public schools. 
    Now, if that be a correct interpretation, that cannot be enlarged into a decree or a judgment that Virginia is compelled to operate public schools nor that any person is required to attend the public school or that the power of the state of Virginia to control and to modify, and to alter the methods and the means by which it provides education, is in any way is impaired by that decision. 
    I take it further that there will be no disagreement with the proposition which has been repeatedly mentioned in the more -- most recent decisions of this Court that education is in fact an area that is reserved to the states or to the people under the Tenth Amendment, and that the states have the power and the complete power, and the whole control of education, subject of course to the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and any other applicable requirements of the Constitution of the United States. 
    Now, what Virginia has done is not to abolish education. 
    What Virginia has done is that the Constitution of Virginia, the arrangement about education is fixed in its constitution, has been there since 1902. 
    This is no new innovation, no new power that has been reposed in local bodies, as a response to the decision in Brown against Board of Education. 
    This is a power that all of the debates was fixed in the Constitution of Virginia, predicated upon a principle which I suppose all of us must recognize and that is that the success of any public educational enterprise depends upon the support and the sympathy of those who must furnish the funds and who must patronize it. 
    And it's upon that proposition that Virginia, when it embarked upon the course of fixing the public educational system, reposed in the local government body of each county and city the power to determine whether or not and how much it would appropriate for that purpose and reposed the administration and the operation of those schools in a local school board. 
    All that the state has done on the state level is to fix a plan, the outline of a probe by which the localities, if they chose to do it, could provide public education for their citizens and that has been the law in Virginia since the year 1902 under the present Constitution. 
    Now, in 1956, the Constitution of Virginia was amended, so as to permit the state and the localities to use public funds for the education of children in private non-sectarian schools located anywhere in the United States, and in public schools located outside of the community in which the child resides. 
    Now, the statement is made that Prince Edward has acted in this case, to mean racial motives. 
    That it has acted to deny any education. 
    I would not void the fact, which you find stated in the brief that I have filed, that this has been a tremendous problem for the people of Prince Edward County and it will be a tremendous problem for the people of all southern communities, and particularly, in Sunnyside, Virginia for an indefinite period of time. 
    There's no way in the world that you can take a community upon which white and colored people have lived upon the land, in many instances, have given homes and parcels of land. 
    There's no way in the world that you can arrange to admit those people to public schools except to commit them on -- admit them on the basis of race. 
    And that means that when you bring them into the public school system, in that arrangement, in that county that you have got what the lower court says, 1,800 colored children and you've got approximate of 1,500 white children. 
    And while it's good --

    Mr. J. Segar Gravatt 
    The tuition grant part came in to effect after that decision in 1956, but it is -- the purpose of it is not a racial purpose. 
    It's a purpose to give people what I take it, the Constitution of the United States gives people, the privilege of selecting the school in which they put their children.

    It seems to me that your plan has completely deprived people of the privilege of going to an integrated public school in Prince Edward County which is what everybody else in the United States is required to do under the Constitution and certainly has the option of doing it.
speaker="j_segar_gravatt" startTime="3803.336" stopTime="3876.577">
    Mr. J. Segar Gravatt 
    Well, sir, I come back. 
    I say that there is nothing in any decision of this Court that requires any county or city in Virginia to operate a public school. 
    That when we call the public school, that we have deprived no one of a right guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States. 
    That what we do when we close the school under this arraignment is that we alter the method by which public education is provided. 
    Instead of having children in a school building that's owned, maintained and controlled by public authority, which of course, under decisions of this Court has to be integrated, that is everybody who wants to go there has got a right to go there. 
    To have in the place of that by the exercise of a legal power that's reposed in the Board of Supervisors, to have in the place of it available for all citizens in scholarship funds which can be used by them in such schools as they choose to use them in.

    Mr. J. Segar Gravatt 
    No, sir and there were none that white children could go to and we've tried, the local people in the county, I don't mean by that but the Board of Supervisors did anything about it but they were repeated efforts made by local people to try to provide educational facilities. 
    There was an organized resistance to it and affirmed in complete refusal to accept the means that were offered. 
    This record shows that in 1960, the Virginia Teachers Association, I'll call it Organization of Virginia Teachers has put in the paper, I noticed that they were going to put on an educational program in Prince Edward County during the summer months. 
    We offered -- the School Board offered to give them the school buildings of the county, to give them the facilities and to give them janitorial and upkeep of the buildings and they refused to accept it. 
    At the present time, through the good offices of my friend, Mr. William Vanden Heuvel of the Justice Department, and through the mutual effort of myself and Mr. Danny, who is dead and gone, and the Governor of Virginia and other people, we were able and [Inaudible] Mr. Tucker, we were able to induce the colored children to at least go to school and we rent it to them at a nominal figure the finest school buildings in the county to be used for that purpose. 
    And I say to you, that those same school buildings and that -- I don't say we could put on the same educational program that's presently being on, but we could offer to -- in that building, to those children, all of the education and better than being offer -- offered in the Prince Edward Academy or in the Prince Edward Foundation Schools or in any county that's anywhere adjacent to Prince Edward County and upon this issue --

speaker="j_segar_gravatt" startTime="4150.377" stopTime="4206.100">
    Mr. J. Segar Gravatt 
    In 1959, they simply declared, they simply decided that School Board under the law offers the Board of Supervisors a school budget with a request for an appropriation. 
    The Board of Supervisors refused to make any appropriation under that school budget in 1959 and that left no money in the hands of the School Board with which to operate the schools. 
    All of the state money is appropriate on a matching fund basis in any county that chooses to operate schools, gets a certain proportion of state funds. 
    A county that does not choose to operate schools, and choose to go on a tuition grant program an approximately commensurate amount of money is paid out through the state which may be supplemented by the county in the way of scholarships to count, to be used in schools as a parent's choice.

    Now, we further think that the program that has presently in effect in that county, supplemented by whatever funds might be necessary in order to provide if additional money is needed, holds out the best opportunity for a solution of the social and difficult problems involved in education resulting from integration. 
    That if that program can be put into effect, everybody in that county who wants to go to an integrated school or have the right to do it, colored people who want to go to a colored school have the right to do it and the white people who want to go a white school have the right to do it. 
    And that, sir, is an enlargement of liberty that has been declared by this Court to be protected under the First and Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

    Mr. J. Segar Gravatt 
    Well sir, it was a change from what had been the law for a great many years and in my judgment, it constituted an enlargement of rights or liberties but did not constitute an affirmative requirement of anything. 
    Now, if the Court please, back to the question of redress of rights deprived on the Constitution, secured by the Constitution of the United States. 
    In order, it seems to me in my simple way of thinking, to get a decree that says to Prince Edward County, you've got to open these schools. 
    You have to enlarge what you have decided in Brown against Board of Supervisors -- Brown against School Board and you've got to find some federal right in these petitions. 
    Some federally secured right to have an education, and not just in education because to get that -- the law of Virginia provides it by tuition payments, but an education inside of a school house that is owned, operated, and controlled by the state or some political subdivision. 
    And I say, that up until now, there's no decision of this Court and so far as I know, no decision of any state court that takes issue with the fact that education and the method which it provides is a state matter and is not a matter secured by the Constitution of the United States. 
    Now, for the tuition grants. 
    You will see in the brief, reference to cases that have been decided in regard parent -- parental rights with respect to the training and education of their children. 
    You will find that these rights have been established by this Court, as rights protected under the Fifth Amendment. 
    And you will find that they are protected not only against state law such as Oregon enacted the law saying that all children have to go to a public school, it was over thrown as an invasion of parental liberty. 
    But you'll find that in the territory of Hawaii, the federal territorial government enacted arbitrary and high statutes against Japanese taught in Japanese language school and that this Court overthrew it as an invasion of the Fifth Amendment, the freedom of those people, and that the Federal Government could no more invade that privilege than could the state. 
    In more recent decisions, this Court has related the right, the freedom of association to freedom of speech under the First Amendment. 
    I say to you gentlemen that the tuition grant program of Virginia is designed not to deny anybody anything, but to give in a democratic society the greatest opportunity for the solution of a difficult problem by giving to every person the liberty that is here under this Constitution that was truly ordained to protect those freedoms.

    Mr. J. Segar Gravatt 
    The Cons -- first thing sir is that the Constitution of 1859 gave the Board of Supervisors exactly the same discretionary power that the present Constitution gives. 
    The language in that Constitution is that the local school -- local Board of Supervisors may levy taxes. 
    They are not required to levy any taxes and not under that. 
    Now may I say an additional thing, sir, about that that if that were an effort to restrict the control of the State of Virginia of the method and means of providing education for its people, it would be in violation of the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in that it would deny to the State of Virginia rights of the Constitution, the rights shall be reserved to them. 
    So that's my response to that, sir. 
    Now if the Court please in regard to the tuition grant statutes of Virginia, they are not -- they have no racial connotation whatsoever. 
    They are available to any person for use in any school that meets the reasonable standard of education. 
    I do not contend that the constitutionality of those statutes are here before this Court. 
    There has been no application of any -- of the petitioners or any place for admission to any school wherein a tuition grant has been or was used. 
    There has been no application of any person that's in the class of these petitions for a tuition grant and -- so that they are without anything in this record that shows -- that by virtue of the tuition grant law of Virginia, they have been deprived of any right secured by the Constitution of the United States. 
    Now when you begin talking to use in a legal opinion, terms such as circumvention of a court decision or circumvention of a court order, I submit to you that you're using terms that depends upon matters of judgment and doesn't depend upon matters of the law. 
    How can you circumvent a court order anymore than you can circumvent the speed limit? 
    You either violate it or you don't violate it. 
    I take it that's the reason why the rules of the federal courts require that injunctive orders be spelled out in writing so that a man will know and anybody who's on the one will know when he's violating or when he's not. 
    And to make a kind of a mythical broadside statement that an act is a circumvention or a frustration of a court order, lives within the hands of the Court, a power that is not defined and that nobody can know when they are violating an order and when they're not violating. 
    We have known that the Board of Supervisors of Prince Edward County has never violated any order of any court. 
    We have never acted in defiance of any order. 
    We have acted in what we honestly and conscientiously believe today are the sacred rights of American people protected under the fair Constitution which you gentlemen are here to interpret and to construe and to apply.

    They come in and said the Court entered an order. 
    And it said, “You admit people to such schools as you operate.” 
    And it was the expectation of their reply that should operate public schools and everybody would be admitted but nobody said, “We haven't got a right to do what we're doing”, or that it violates anything that's secured under the Constitution of the United States and that's the issue.

    If all that you have, sir, were public schools, if that was all that was conceived of under the Virginia plan of education that might be a tenable position. But when the Virginia plan of education gives everybody tuition grants and gives the locality the option to bring that into effect as a method of education in that county and the same option, the same privilege is given to every other county and city in Virginia unless, sir, the cases that this Court has decided are reversed, I do not see how it could violate the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Mr. J. Segar Gravatt 
    I do not -- this Court -- you had a similar question. 
    You had quite a similar question if you look at the case of Millers against Bowman which is cited in the brief. 
    The State of Missouri allowed in St. Louis and certain areas, an appeal in certain types of cases. 
    In other areas of the same state, they were denied an appeal and the matter came here and this Court held in our – in an opinion that is absolutely in point on this very question that that was not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The only time in my judgment that you get to a question that you can't delegate an option to a locality is when you get to a right that is secured by the Constitution of the United States. 
    When you get to something that is a privilege of a citizen of the United States or is a right that the federal constitution requires, then you got some limitation on what you can do because everybody everywhere has got to be subject to the same thing, but when it's education and education is a state matter and anymore requirement for state uniformity with respect to education and there would be if the state said, “We have powers.” 
    And we just put them where we're pleased to put them and you can't come into Court and say, “Give me a power in my county and give -- take it away from him over there” or something of that nature. 
    Now, if Your Honor please, this is what the Court has decided in all of its cases, and I do not believe there's a case cited in the Attorney General's brief that holds to the contrary. 
    All that I could get my hands on and could look at are absolutely not in point. 
    They either go off on some state constitutional restriction of the delegated power or they have got a statute that's on the state level and as applied as absolutely a clear violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    I said a moment ago that I did not think that the tuition grant program here is before you.

    Mr. J. Segar Gravatt 
    That is correct, sir. 
    That is correct and we have the argument in our brief. 
    I do not think that the tuition grant program as I have said is here before the Court. 
    The Solicitor General asked you not to enjoin tuition grants on the basis of the liberty involved. 
    He asked you to enjoin the tuition grants on a conditional basis until public schools are open. 
    I think if the Court feels compelled to do anything in this case, that is far and away the desirable -- the more desirable thing to do. 
    Because the issue, the actual issue, and this is a tremendously important question, this matter of how, what does it reach of the privilege of the parents and of citizens to select their associations in education and to have a freedom to bring up their children as a will involved the most intimate and the most sacred natural rights of people. 
    And I do not think and I hope that this Court will not enter an order that will so restrict the freedom that I know that you gentlemen are dedicated to preserve -- preservation of perhaps and more conscious of perhaps than almost anybody. 
    And that whatever you do with this case, that you will not take Brown against Board of Education which was in truth an enlargement of the liberty of mankind, and use it as a means to exercise compulsion and force against people. 
    The opportunity, the genius of our Constitution is in the blessings of liberty that it protects and bestows upon our people. 
    The solution of this problem like the greatness of our country in so many respects depends upon the preservation of it and when you give people freedom. 
    You can take away these restraints on account of race. 
    I suppose many, they should never have been in the law, but let's not in the name of advancing what we think in our private judgment maybe a good thing to take away and constrict the liberties of people because in truth, that has been historically the way that we have solved these difficult problems and the way that we have brought about unity and cohesion with our people, and it is a possibility here that holds out a peaceful existence of people. 
    Virginia has had peace in racial matter since this program has been in effect but whatever -- whatever --

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    As an Assistant Attorney General of Virginia, I appear as counsel for the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the Commonwealth. 
    These respondents first became defendants in this suit when the amended supplemental complaint was filed by order of Court on August the 14th, 1961. 
    At that time, the defendants asserted a series of defenses and contentions against the suits sought to be set up against them in the amended supplemental complaint and we have continued consistently thereafter to assert these defenses. 
    Thus, we have taken the position that the suit sought to be setup in the amended supplemental complaint is in its direct purpose and effect a suit against the Commonwealth of Virginia which has not consented to be sued and is expressly forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment. 
    We have taken the position that the amended supplemental complaint states no claim upon which relief can be granted against these respondents. 
    We have taken the position that the amended supplemental complaint states a new and distinct cause of action different from that setup in the original complaint which cannot properly be maintained in an amended supplemental complaint. 
    And we have stated that the amended supplemental complaint asks relief in the nature of the enjoining of the enforcement operation and execution of a state statute which relief under the laws of the United States cannot be granted except by District Court of three judges. 
    The District Court in its opinion set out on page 160 of the record detailed all of these points which we made, set them for consideration when the trial was heard on the merits at a later date and these points were argued. 
    That was the last we have ever heard of these contentions. 
    I make this statement with more than passing justification where I refer to the language of the Fourth Circuit set out on page five of my brief, in which the majority pointed out this. 
    For the District Court to get to the merits, it had to bypass a number of preliminary questions, including a very troublesome question arising under the Eleventh Amendment, all of which are brought up before us. 
    Now we have no doubt whatever that if the Fourth Circuit had not decided to abstain until the Virginia Supreme Court had considered what precisely was the nature of the Virginia system and this case had gone back to them from that decision that we would have had all of these contentions considered by the Fourth Circuit. 
    But we take the position, that Due Process of law no matter how it maybe construed assuming it applies to the respondents in this case as it does to the petitioners which of course it does, necessarily requires that these contentions which we have made be considered at some time by some judicial tribunal. 
    We suggest in view of the action what this Court has taken that they must now be considered by this judicial tribunal. 
    So far as the Eleventh Amendment question is concerned, we have set out in our brief a number of cases, none of which the Solicitor General has dared to mention in which we have pointed out that the line of demarcation between a suit which seeks to enjoin a state official from taking action under an unconstitutional statute, that is a suit which seeks a cessation of action by state officials as contrasted to a suit which affirmatively seeks to require state officials to perform a duty alleged to be place upon them by the law is the line of demarcation between suits which are not forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment and suits which clearly fall within the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment. 
    Now in the case at bar, the amended supplemental complaint alleged that the state officials whom I represent had failed to discharge the obligation placed upon them by the Virginia Constitution to maintain a system of free public schools throughout the state and it asked a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the state officials to operate public schools in Prince Edward County. 
    Now they did not ask for the peremptory writ of mandamus in so much -- in so many words. 
    They asked for an injunction to enjoin the state officials from refusing to operate the schools in Prince Edward County. 
    Now this sort of strategy has been laid to rest in the case of Louisiana versus Jumel which we cite, in which the Court has said that suits of this nature, a suit to mandamus a public official to perform an act or a suit to restrain a state official from refusing to perform an act under a state statute raise identical questions and constitutes a suit against the State within the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment. 
    If we may paraphrase the language of this Court in Hagood versus Southern, a suit requesting the relief which is here requested by the petitioners, that is that state officials spend money which they do not have, which has not been appropriated, and affirmatively begin to operate the public schools in Prince Edward County. 
    If a suit requesting this relief be not a suit within the inhibition of the Eleventh Amendment, it would be difficult to conceive the frame of one which would be. 
    As the Court said in Hagood versus Southern, a judgment against state officials in their official and representative capacity commanding them to perform official functions on behalf of the state according to the dictates and decrease of the Court is, if anything can be, a judicial proceeding against the State itself.

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    It was because the initial legislative decision to issue the bonds and lay the tax had already been made by the elected representatives of the people and that in requiring the local Board of Supervisors to lay the tax, the Federal Government, the federal court was giving them contract relief which they would have been entitled to under state law and would have obtained even if the matter had been heard in a state court.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6625.259" stopTime="6630.460">

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    Yes, Your Honor, I do because I think those cases clearly turn upon the fact that there had been a contract by the local people to pay the bonds. 
    And they were suiable on their contracts. 
    We don't take the position that a locality is not suiable on its contracts or that if the people have decided and have contracted with bond holders that they will levy a tax that that contract cannot be enforced.

    The Court invalidated the subsequent enactment as being in violation of the federal constitutional prohibition against the passage of a legislation impairing the obligation of contracts, and then enforced the right to which the petitioners were entitled under the original law. 
    Every one of those cases, Mr. Justice Black, is a contract case on a debt for a liquidated sum after the representatives of the people had contracted and agreed that they would levy the tax.

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    Only one of the cases was that matter an impairment of contract did arise. 
    In all the others, the legislature, I mean the local governing body just simply did not pay the debt, they just fell into default and the Court said, “You can be mandamus. 
    The state court would mandamus you. 
    We can mandamus you because you have already exercised the legislative discretion. 
    You have contracted the debt and you as a municipality or just as suiable as if the case with Brown against Smith. 
    It's not Brown against the City of Quincy or what have you and any one of those cases or the Labette County Commissioners. 
    Under the Eleventh Amendment, the locality is just as suiable as a private party. 
    We don't state that but the State is not and if the State repudiates its debt, this Court cannot require the State to levy the tax unless the State has entered into a contract with another state which would come within the original jurisdiction of this Court, which is not this case at all.

    In other words, I should think that any attempt to repudiate a debt by the locality would raise that question. 
    In other words, so far as the Eleventh Amendment is concerned, we do not assert, we never have asserted that the Eleventh Amendment erects any shield for local officials. 
    We say that it does erect the shield with respect to the relief sort in this case of requiring the state officials to operate public schools in Prince Edward County and we cite a number of cases which make it perfectly clear that the difference between enjoining state officials from acting under an unconstitutional statute which means they're enjoined in their personal capacity because the unconstitutional statute gives them no immunity and those which require a state official affirmatively to perform its obligations is the line of demarcation between Eleventh Amendment suits and Fourteenth -- and of suits which are not within the scope of the Eleventh Amendment.

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    I see. 
    In that case Your Honor, I will proceed right away then to the question of the right. 
    We take the position that what is here required by the petitioners is this. 
    They say that they have a right to be provided with public schools in Prince Edward County. 
    This is what they say. 
    Now Brown said and we admit this, that they have a right to racially nondiscriminatory access to such public schools as operated in the county, but that there is no provision in the Federal Constitution which requires the State to operate any public schools. 
    Second, we say, that this Court has never held that any truly local option law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and this is a point which I feel I must stress. 
    No decision of which I am aware and no decision contained in the brief of the Solicitor General holds that a local option law is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    There is no such case. 
    Now in Virginia, we have a truly local option system. Our State Supreme Court has made that perfectly clear. 
    Whether or not, public schools will be operated and locality is a decision which is made by each individual locality. 
    It has been this way since the foundation of our public school systems were laid in 1869. 
    It was that way when Virginia was readmitted to the Union, that principle was carried on in the Constitution of 1902 and it exists today. 
    Nothing having to do with local option was fashioned on a post Brown basis over the idea of concocting any evasive schemes to continue segregated education in Virginia.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="7181.436" stopTime="7193.623">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I thought you are surely -- you're not suggesting what you seem to be saying a moment ago that a law is automatically constitutionally valid if it's enacted by majority vote of the locality?
speaker="rd_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="7193.623" stopTime="7317.552">
    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    No, sir. 
    What I'm saying is this, that you cannot say that the Virginia local option laws which had existed for 100 years, constituted an invasive scheme to circumvent any orders of this Court. 
    That's what I want to say. 
    Now on the local option proposition, I do say that a local option law in which you have a statewide program in which state aid is made available to each and every locality of the State which elects to come under it, provided the locality meets certain minimum requirements, I say that that is constitutionally unassailable. 
    As the majority of the Fourth Circuit said, “Any such program is that which is engaged in by every state in the union which the Federal Government engages in, in which it lets the states wish to come up to the minimum requirements, participate, pays money to those states which elect to come under the program and doesn't pay money to those which do not elect to come under the program is constitutionally unassailable. 
    We will not see the Solicitor General stand before this Court and urge to it that the National Defense Education Program is unconstitutional, but it is a clear local option program which is available only to those cities and counties in the United State which elect to insert in their curriculum those provisions for advanced Mathematics, modern foreign language and Science for which alone the Federal Government is willing to make its money available. 
    Now this is straight local option, and it is available to everyone who wishes to come under the program. 
    In Virginia, three of our cities have elected to come under the program. 
    Must the Federal Government discontinue aid to those simply because three other cities in Virginia have elected not to come under the program, and that is precisely what we have here. 
    Virginia for 100 years has had a local option program in which every locality in the state which elects to operate public schools and which appropriates funds therefore may have state aid.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="7317.552" stopTime="7320.206">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now the state aid is on a matching dollar per dollar basis?
speaker="rd_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="7320.206" stopTime="7353.413">
    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    It's on a formula basis Your Honor. 
    It's not on a matching form -- it's not on a matching fund basis because certain localities make a greater effort and get a large proportion of the funds. 
    Certain localities will appropriate quite a bit as much as 75% to 80% of that budget because they will go beyond what the State requires and will spend more money even though the State will not match it. 
    But so far as the matching state funds are concerned, they are available only upon the condition that the locality has provided certain minimum funds and it's undertaken to operate schools --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="7353.413" stopTime="7357.264">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Except to the so-called constitutional minimum of something like $40,000 in this case --
speaker="rd_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="7357.264" stopTime="7358.095">
    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III

speaker="rd_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="7358.490" stopTime="7397.004">
    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    Now the constitutional minimum goes to the locality for whatever use they wish to make of it. 
    In one year, Prince Edward -- they have no use for it at all, didn't even take it. 
    But under the Constitution all that Virginia is required to give in the way of financial assistance is that constitutional minimum. 
    Anything beyond that constitutional minimum comes within the scope of Section 129, that Virginia shall provide a statewide system in every locality, a plan for it. 
    And our state court has clearly said that we have established that plan when we set it up on the same basis of the National Defense Educational Program or other federal programs in which a locality is permitted to participate if it elects to have schools in the first instance.

    If it pass and if it does pass the law for that purpose and has that consequence of discrimination being an unlawful discrimination as set out in the Brown case, wouldn't it be unconstitutional?

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    It is not a matter of whether we have to Your Honor.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, it finally gets down to this as I understand your argument which is a really frank argument. 
    It gets down to this seemingly to me that the argument is that it does not involve and deny equal protection for a state to have a whole plan of Government within the state with reference to its school some of which they call it public and some of which private, is passed that way in order to prohibit, we will say, to bar -- to permit a county to keep its people from having to sit together because they are white and black and it accomplishes that result in the end that that would not be unconstitutional.

    MWell, I don't think so, Your Honor for this -- I mean -- I think it brings your question and I will come to it in a minute but I don't think that it's beside the issue because I think every case that is -- that exists on the point clearly establishes the right of the locality. 
    We have cited numerous decisions in which the right of the locality to close a public facility rather than operate on integrated basis has been held to violate no unconstitutional rights. 
    The Fifth Circuit has held it. 
    The Fourth Circuit has held it. 
    The abolition of all public facilities within a geographical area eliminates the discrimination forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment, infringes no rights of Negro plaintiffs, and violates no order of the Court even after a court has entered an order against the city requiring it to refrain from the racial discrimination, the operation of public parks. 
    The city has come along and said, “Alright, we'll close the public parks” and the courts have said, “That's no violation of our order. 
    We didn't tell them they had to operate public parks. 
    What we told them was you cannot discriminate in those parks which you do operate,” that's all Brown said.

    The tuition grant is available to any school integrated or segregated. 
    It makes no difference whatever and as Mr. Gravatt has pointed out in his brief, this has been a method by which more rather than less integration has been achieved in a number of parts of the country and a number of our tuition grants have been used by Negro citizens all over the State of Virginia to send their children to schools in the District of Columbia, public schools in District of Columbia because they believe that integrated education obtainable in the District of Columbia is better for them than the education which they received in Virginia.

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    No sir, I don't think they are. 
    The object of the tuition grant program is simply to let those people who elect to use them, decide where they will send their children to school, and the State has no interest at all in whether it's an integrated or a segregated facility, no interest whatever. 
    All that the State requires is that it'd be a school to operate -- giving a minimum foundation of education and as I say, they have been used to --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="8247.662" stopTime="8255.848">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But can we decide this case really genuinely on the basis that the state has no interest in whether they are -- shouldn't be together in the same school or not?
speaker="rd_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="8255.848" stopTime="8350.031">
    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    I think yes Your Honor because I don't think that the tuition grant program is actually before this Court. 
    I don't think that because I don't think there was, that the three-judge District Court was empaneled to hear the question of the constitutionality of that statute. 
    I think the basic issue here is whether or not, if petitioners in this case have a right to be educated in public schools in Prince Edward County, that is the schools operated by the School Board in Prince Edward County. 
    Now if they have that right, then it is unquestionably been denied them because there are no public schools operated in Prince Edward County. 
    There aren't any public schools being operated in the City of Fairfax 15 miles down the road. 
    There aren't any public schools being operated in the City of Franklin either. 
    The people in those areas have elected not to have any public schools but to foster the education of their citizens by tuition grants and tuition payments. 
    If somebody in the City of Fairfax filed a suit, claiming that his Federal Constitutional rights have been denied him because the city fathers have decided that they would not build any public schools or establish them or go to the expense but would simply give them tuition grants and make tuition payments, would not such a person receive exceedingly short script at the hands of this Court if he attempted to assert any such federal constitutional right as that, that he has a right to public schools in his own political subdivision or that's what he's being asserted in this case? 
    They claim that they have a right to have this Court make the Board of Supervisors of Prince Edward County open and operate public schools in Prince Edward County.

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    But Your Honor they say in their brief that they have a declared right to education in public schools in Prince Edward County on a racially nondiscriminatory basis. 
    That's the right which they assert and they don't have that right anymore than the people in the City of Fairfax or the City of Franklin have that right and that's why you have the difficulty with the remedy. 
    That's why the Solicitor General stands here and makes the bold assertion that this Court has the authority to require a political subdivision to exercise the initial legislative function and lay a levy to support public schools when it is decided not to do so and in support of that proposition, cites such cases as the Bond cases in which the Court did no more than grant a right which existed under the State in which the right asserted was a contract liquidated right, and in which the initial legislative decision to undertake the program had already been exercised. 
    The Solicitor General can't cite any case to this Court in which this Court has held, “We have a right to tell a locality, you got to operate public schools. 
    You've got to lay or levy your tax to do it.” 
    You've got to have public parks. 
    You've got to have a hospitalization program. 
    You've got to have a library program.

    The point I suppose Mr. McIlwaine is that a county is not constitutionally required to have a sheriff at all.
speaker="rd_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="8537.882" stopTime="8572.959">
    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    That's right and I say that they're constitutionally not required to have schools at all. 
    I do not say that a right -- that a constitutional right which the state must recognize can be referred to local option. 
    I don't say that at all. 
    I don't say that they are not some constitutional rights which cannot be referred to local option, but the right to go to a school in one political subdivision doesn't exist. 
    It never has existed. 
    Nobody has a right to go to a public school in their locality if the city fathers in that locality decided that they're not going to have any public schools for any reason and if the petitioners in this case --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="8572.959" stopTime="8579.829">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You would say I'm sure that they do not have a right to be barred from going into certain locality on account of their race?
speaker="rd_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="8579.829" stopTime="8699.321">
    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    Oh yes. 
    We admit this in our brief, Your Honor, but that was exactly true in all of the cases we've cited Tompkins, Gilmore, and so forth. 
    It was admitted that if the State or the city had the public facility, they could not bar people from the use of them on account of their race, but the closing of the facility was the exercise by that locality of its constitutional right to decide whether it would operate the facility at all. 
    This was a power reserved to the city fathers which the Constitution has not taken away. 
    And we say that if this Court decides that it can say to Prince Edward County, you ought to lay the following levy, you are to appropriate the amount raised by that levy to the public -- to the School Board and that they are to use it to operate the following schools, in other words divest every citizen of Prince Edward County, every elected public official of Prince Edward County with any control of the system and Your Honors running then I say this will be the first time in the history of this nation that this Court has ever undertaken to say, we can order a locality to lay a tax and carry out a program which we think should be carried out. 
    It will be the first time in which this Court has said a local option statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And constitutionally of course, there is no difference whatever between public schools and public parks, and playgrounds, and libraries, or any other public facility. 
    The decisions of this Court had made that perfectly clear that you can't discriminate on the account of race in schools or parks, or playgrounds, or anything else. 
    If it's a public facility, it's constitutionally identical. 
    Consequently, you can close the parks and the swimming pools, and the playgrounds which you unquestionably can do under the decisions then a locality may close its public schools.

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    No sir, I do not think so. 
    I don't think that it can be argued that there are anymore public schools and going back to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, you can argue that a school which has students, which -- who have had tuition grants under the GI Bill of Rights are public schools. 
    When I returned from the Pacific World War II, I went to the University of Virginia with a lot of veterans, and that the University of Virginia received an awful lot of federal money and that didn't make the University of Virginia an instrumentality of the Federal Government. 
    And I can take it one step further, there were certain people, a vast number of veterans I submit who returned from the war and went to Princeton and Harvard. 
    And I submit that millions of dollars were paid to Princeton and Harvard on their account and that neither Princeton nor Harvard ever became an agency of the United States Government simply because the money was paid. 
    That's all what's done in this case. 
    No control, nothing.

    Mr. R.D. McIlwaine III 
    No sir, they are not. 
    They are not. 
    The people in Prince Edward County, the white people formed a foundation. 
    They went out. 
    They got contributions. 
    They built a school. 
    They used -- made their schools and churches as Mr. Gravatt has said. 
    They offered an educational program. The same opportunity was available and as the Fourth Circuit found, the Negroes declined property systems in undertaking exactly the same program for themselves. 
    But it is my view that the simple payment of money to a child in reimbursement of tuition, whatever type of school the child may select to go to, no more has the effect of converting that institution into a public school or public institution than does the Federal GI Bill of Rights converted Princeton and Harvard into agencies or instrumentalities of the United States government.
