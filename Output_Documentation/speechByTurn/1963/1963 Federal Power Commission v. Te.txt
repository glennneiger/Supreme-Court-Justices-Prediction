    Alright. 
    Two minutes, I won't argue about that.

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    Well, in those two minutes, I think that it is an opportunity after having had a few moments to let the thoughts spill on over us as they have been coming at us for two hours. 
    To recollect that the key issue in this case is the power of an agency directed by a statute not to promulgate any rules going to either rights or contracts which will be effective in the future without holding a hearing and developing an evidentiary record. 
    The issue then is the power of that agency despite that statute to hold such a hearing that does not provide for a record or the development of those facts. 
    This was an issue that has come up once before. 
    It did not get as far as this Court but it was actively litigated in the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    Before 1960, the Federal Power Commission issued its general policy statement in which it promulgated prices for some 23 areas in the country. 
    And in that general policy statement, it provided for specific prices. 
    And the consumers of natural gas felt that they did not like those prices and they challenged the issuance of that policy statement in the Court of Appeals. 
    And there the court said, “But this is only a matter of policy. 
    There has been no hearing. 
    The Commission cannot promulgate prices without a hearing. 
    The avenues of recourse and the development of facts must be kept open as they are here under this policy statement.” 
    “But the statement, “said the court, “may stand.” 
    So, these rules may stand as policy only. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    This Court merely affirmed what the lower court had said Your Honor that the policy statement prices were no more than guidelines just as the Tenth Circuit below here has permitted these prices that I held up earlier to be statements of the Commission's policy to let the industry know generally how the Commission feels about these clauses.

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    Oh, they will -- they will permit a filing and they will permit hearings as to why you should have a right. 
    And this is the only reason that the court -- the District of Columbia Court, where the policy statement was specifically challenged permitted the policy statement to stand.

    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    And it was also where the consumers really got concerned about it was, that -- that it appeared, put on both a ceiling and a floor. 
    And they were concerned that if -- if a price filed below the ceiling were submitted to the Commission, the Commission would automatically stamp it and approve it and the Commission has not allowed that. 
    A challenge can be put in even for prices below the policy statement and a hearing held. 
    But as you say Mr. Justice White, if it's over, you're certainly going to get that hearing.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="182.412" stopTime="204.359">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Well, I understood that the -- well, the policy statements say they fixed the price in a certain field. 
    Then they had applications subsequent to that that were in excess of that ceiling on that price. 
    That they reduce them to the ceiling price before they would certi -- certificate them.

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    No, Your Honor, yes and no.

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Yes, just an area.

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    If you file for a price that exceeds the policy statement, make a certificate application, the Commission consolidates a great number of these applications and has the statutory hearing to determine the public convenience and necessity. 
    And it may condition the certificates if it -- on the basis of that record, finds that they do not need the test of the public convenience and necessity. 
    They do not reject your application in that instance. 
    The policy level is just that. 
    It is a policy.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="248.796" stopTime="250.359">

speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="252.817" stopTime="285.992">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    But only when there is a record which will support it in a court of review which you have a right to, under Section 19 (b) of the Natural Gas Act, permits you to bring that record before a competent court of review to see whether there are findings which support the Commission in its cut. 
    And there must be findings of record and there must be facts of record to support the finding that a condition should issue. 
    And they have not just cut them to the policy level, Your Honor. 
    In some cases, the Commission had stated that the facts of record require even a further reduction in the policy.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="285.992" stopTime="292.751">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    I understand, of course you'd have a right there to -- I suppose on the permanent -- permanent certifications to have a hearing, isn't it?

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    Absolutely. 
    And that hearing has been permitted in those cases but it has been permitted in the cases of these contract clauses.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="299.596" stopTime="306.412">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Because that's a directive. 
    It operates directly on the price though, doesn't it? 
    Or rates, doesn't it?

    Well, first of all, these clauses --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="310.946" stopTime="312.462">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    This doesn't operate directly on the rates.
speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="312.462" stopTime="348.724">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    These clauses go obviously directly to the price that you will be able to file for. 
    And secondly, the authority of the Commission over a contract and price is spelled out in the same sections of the Act. 
    They have no greater authority over price than they have over contract, exactly the same statutory limit is placed on them. 
    Price and contract appear in the same section of the Natural Gas Act in the same sentence. 
    There can be no greater authority over one than the other. 
    No -- no permission to do something without findings as to one but the necessity for findings as to the other.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="348.724" stopTime="377.030">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Wisconsin case first speaks for itself. 
    But on page 299, that statement is what the case hold, not quite what you state because its -- Commission stated in that case absence of compelling evidence, it will certificate, an issue would raise and suspend increase of rates which exceeded those price level.
speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="377.030" stopTime="383.335">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    That's correct but you have the opportunity to put on the evidence, Your Honor.

speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="392.201" stopTime="395.131">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    The very barrier is the fact that this rule and regulation --

    Justice Tom C. Clark

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    Well, that it -- I don't see how the Commission can -- can ever protect the consumers if it is permitted. 
    If any agency is permitted to promulgate prices, contracts or anything else without evidence, without a hearing in which the consumer can appear to state what he thinks the price ought to be.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="434.567" stopTime="445.625">
    Justice Tom C. Clark

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    No, not at all. 
    They had in our contract -- oh, we had in contract also, Your Honor, the result at the end of -- of 10 years and 15 years to negotiate -- renegotiate the contract price on the basis of quality, quantity and all the other pertinent provisions as to delivery conditions in the 10 and 15th year. 
    The problems which might come up as to costs of value of the commodity, the supply and demand situations, all of the facts which necessarily will go into a determination of the justness and reasonableness. 
    It's not just one clause that we're complaining about. 
    What must be remembered is that Commission has stricken all clauses, the fertility of the businessman's mind to provide for the sale of his commodity over 20, 30 or 40 years, has been completely set aside and he is restricted to the half page of pricing provisions which are spelled out in Order 232A, that were spelled out.

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    No, no. 
    Let me come to that. 
    The one we have here is for redetermination upon the basis of other prices at the time, an average of three, something of that kind. 
    Now, the Commission had not explicitly considered that in Pure Oil. 
    It invited comments after 232 so that in effect, there was another rulemaking proceeding.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="969.276" stopTime="969.777">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.
speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="969.777" stopTime="996.487">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    And 30 comments were received to argue this. 
    And on the basis of that, the Commission adhered to the position that it had originally taken, accepted and modified it to permit these -- these indefinites that are now permitted, redeterminations. 
    Once, not more than once in a five-year period if they are based on rates that the Commission has had a chance to look at and hasn't questioned. 
    Now --

    Pan American can have what it wants at the -- in 8 -- in 1983 or in 1965, if it will provide that the redetermination shall be upon the basis of three jurisdictional rates or one, if they want to make it for that which the Commission has and which has been filed with the Commission and the Commission has not suspended it and hasn't been -- hasn't questioned it --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But on 242, the -- there is nothing available to show why the Commissioner arrived at this conclusion other than just the text of the order itself.
speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="1033.992" stopTime="1035.050">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    The text of the order, that's right.

    Under the Administrative Procedure Act, it is solely within the Commission's discretion whether two and if anyone asks it and there were -- and if there had been factual questions raised, the past practice of the Commission indicates that if a trial-type hearing is the best way to resolve that question, it will follow that method.

speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="1099.189" stopTime="1207.706">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    I can't say them to you. 
    My definite impression and I've -- and I'm -- I'm sure that I could verify this, is that it has on occasion used trial like proceedings to resolve questions when it did not have to have a room at such proceeding so far as the statute was concerned. 
    It certainly can use that and whether that is an effective way of doing, so it will. 
    But here, the provision of the rules permitting petitions for waiver to be filed enables a company in the case of a Memphis-type provision or in the case of such a provision as Mr. Gilliam referred to for an adjustment on account of rising costs due to the necessity for eliminating contamination which may occur if they have circumstances like that that the Commission has not considered, that are not within the ambit of the -- of the general problem, which it has resolved or -- or which it was dealing with, then it can apply for a -- a waiver and the Commission will grant it an app -- a hearing as it has in the of the case of the -- the Memphis-type clause itself, which Atlantic presented in a petition for amendment -- for waiver of the rule. 
    And the fact that there has been delay in that Atlantic proceeding to which Mr. Gilliam referred as though this were a sham. 
    This was a run around, the Commission was giving the companies is I submit, perfectly explained by the fact that when the examiner took that case under consideration, he was immediately confronted by the fact that the rule which was sought to be waived was one which the Tenth Circuit has said was an invalid rule. 
    And the court examiner, I would suppose is waiting up to see what the outcome of this decision is. 
    Thank you.
