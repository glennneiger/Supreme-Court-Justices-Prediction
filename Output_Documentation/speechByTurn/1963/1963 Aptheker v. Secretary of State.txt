Aptheker v. Secretary of State
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="0.000" stopTime="136.210">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court. 
    When we recessed a half a hour ago we had just reached the point of identifying in the large the two constitutional attacks on the statute, two bases for constitutional attack. 
    And I would now like to turn in the first instance to the Fifth Amendment attack. 
    And as we said, the question here is, is this fair, is it reasonable, is it a rational means to an end that Congress is free to pursue under the constitution. 
    Now it seems to me that this is fairly readily disposed of the end that Congress is pursing is the preservation of the national security by frustrating the purposes and objectives of a world movement which is dedicated to overthrowing our government. 
    And as this Court quoting Madison in the 41st federal has said, protection against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society. 
    It is an avowed an essential object of the American Union, the power requisite for obtaining it must be effectually confided to the federal counsels. 
    So we have an appropriate end, an end that Congress can constitutionally entertain. 
    And we have a finding that Congress has made on the basis of evidence that travel is a necessary part of the apparatus, the integument of this world organization whose purposes it is seeking to frustrate. 
    So that it is then not irrational to seek to prevent that travel as a way of seeking to prevent the attainment of those unlawful objectives.

    I don't -- I am not sure I thoroughly understand what you say -- the basic source of congressional power.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="144.613" stopTime="181.680">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    I think we agreed that the basic source of congressional power is the power to protect and defend the national security against foreign danger, foreign danger acting internally through dominated and controlled organizations. 
    And a foreign, a foreign movement which requires, because it's working at a distance, because it's working through semi-covert internal organizations, requires travel to establish contact and strength and tie the bonds with those internal organizations.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Yes it still is, I think when you get to confining people in a narrow room that comes to be imprisonment and that is the kind of punishment that has to be taken on the basis of a judicial trail.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Yes, and all that we say here is that the danger may not be so grave as to justify that kind of confinement, but it is plain enough --

    Justice William O. Douglas

speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="324.002" stopTime="331.465">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well the question is in each case, what is the danger perceived, how reasonable are the relations as the means to the end.

    Would you think that these people could have got a passport if they had shown that their parents were dying in Paris?
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="337.188" stopTime="375.482">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    They can't get a passport but the Secretary of State has discretionary authority under Section 215 to waive the requirement of passport for exit. 
    Now my friend said that that won't waive the requirement of the foreign government for a passport as a means of entry, but in fact we will also give a document of identification which is in most cases enough to get him into a country that has a passport entry requirement. 
    So that there does exist under the statute as it now stands I believe adequate power for the Secretary of State to make an exception in meritorious circumstances.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    No we haven't had any applications for an exception since this statute has been in effect. 
    But it is true that the before Kent and Briehl, before those cases in which the court struck down our administration practice, when we were denying passports to communists on the basis of our internal regulations, we did make an exception in one case I think on the basis of the secretary's power to make exceptions under Section 2 (15).

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Our -- the argument that we are making sir is that when a statute is so limited, it falls within an appropriate power to protect against threats to the national security, and that Congress -- the question here is not what the limits are of congressional action but whether this statute is constitutional. 
    And we say that this statute is so limited to parties of this kind. 
    Remember, if it please the Court, the Communist Party is not designated here by affiant either legislative or administrative.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Nobody picked the Communist Party out and said it was a bad party and therefore people can't travel. 
    It was found to be a party having certain characteristics after a full administrative hearing complying with all the safeguards of procedural due process in which it was free however it chose to meet the charge that it had these characteristics and it was found to have had them and this Court sustained those findings.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well, we are now talking I think for the moment about the question whether this is a rational means to this end. 
    And all I am suggesting is that having established these preconditions namely that the organization is found to have these characteristics in an administrative hearing, that the parties -- the persons are found to be members of the party in a full due process hearing, that the organization is found by Congress to depend on travel, it's not irrational then to seek to inhibit travel in order to frustrate the objectives that the movement is seeking to accomplish.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well that's what I was going to say -- oh absolute prohibition on travel.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="597.334" stopTime="608.287">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Could they take that into consideration? 
    Suppose -- I suppose the different shades and types of communists, some are perhaps more dangerous than others, you're telling.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="608.287" stopTime="722.148">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well, I think that's exactly the main burden of the attack on the statute under the Fifth Amendment. 
    It is that to say that all communists can't be permitted or given passports is too broad, so broad as to be irrational. 
    But I submit that at least for the Fifth Amendment side of the case, I think perhaps different considerations would and different principles would operate. 
    I think those principles operate to sustain, but different principle operate on the First Amendment side of the case, but for the Fifth Amendment side of the case, I think we are in the same place we were in American Communication Association versus Douds, where this Court said that the mere fact that membership in a political association is made the basis of classification does not mean that the classification is irrational or unconstitutional. 
    And indeed the Court will remember that in the Douds case again two of the dissenters, Justices Frankfurter and Jackson, upheld the oath on the membership side of the oath. 
    They were worried about the belief side of the oath; there is no belief issue here. 
    There is an objective standard, membership. 
    Now why did Douds say that? 
    Douds cited a whole series of cases; it cited Agnew versus Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve, upholding a statute, which prohibited all underwriters from serving as officers or directors of national banks. 
    It wasn't necessary to bring home to the particular underwriter that he might be going to commit a breach of trust or have a conflict of interest on the national bank. 
    It was enough that the class was rationally related, the classification was rationally related to the evil to be forestalled.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="722.148" stopTime="745.203">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Inaudible), while this statute bars the members of the party (Inaudible), and they want to travel abroad.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="745.203" stopTime="878.812">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    And they want to travel, travel aboard. 
    Well I think again if I may address that on the First Amendment side of the case, because I think that's where it was addressed in Douds. 
    I just want to establish here that the general principle, that the classification, is not necessarily related to the particular persons of whom undesirable activity can be expected, is always the case, where the Congress tries to anticipate the evil rather than act after the evil has occurred, because the consequence of trying to anticipate the evil is you don't know whether any particular person is going to do the undesirable act, and so if Congress is to have the power to forestall evil, as it did in the Public Utility Holding Company Act cases, as it did in the board -- the Agnew case, and as it does over and over and over again. 
    Every factory is subject to inspection under the Food and Drug Act, why? 
    Not because we believe a particular manufacturer, we don't have to start with the proposition that a particular manufacturer is probably doing the bad thing. 
    We are trying to forestall he is doing the bad thing, and that's why the classification must be broader than merely those whom we now already are engaging in the disapproved conduct. 
    And the consequences saying we can't draw the circle any narrower or any broader than those who are already engaging or will engage that we know will engage in the conduct is to say we can't act in advance at all. 
    And so the only question is, is this a rational class, is it rational to say that all lawyers should be disqualified from jury service, for example, because some, maybe may not follow the instruction of the judge, but the instruction of their law professor. 
    Is it rational to do all the other things that we do on the basis of anticipatory desire to forestall conduct that it is appropriate to seek to forestall?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="878.812" stopTime="880.971">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why does it have to be rational?
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="880.971" stopTime="889.911">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    It had to, because otherwise unless it's somehow related to what we are trying to do, then it's arbitrary, and that is a violation of the due process clause.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="889.911" stopTime="905.276">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    If I hear it correct at the beginning of your argument, there you said that you didn't have to depend much charge on whether or not it's rational to do this if you assume the government had the right to put a party out of business. 
    Of course it's rational, it's rational to do every one of the things that had been done and many more.

    And I say this statute is narrowly drawn. Nobody here is prevented from travel on suspicion or on some -- on the basis of some secret dossier.

speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="1196.783" stopTime="1216.463">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    (Inaudible), and I am looking at the fact that (Inaudible).
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="1216.463" stopTime="1372.061">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well I would only say Mr. Justice Goldberg that in the Briehl case itself, the Court said as to our then existing regulation, which you recall permitted the withdrawal of a passport not because of membership in the Communist Party but because the conduct abroad would be inimical to the interest of the United States and which took, only took Communist Party membership into account as appellants say would be a proper situation. 
    What the Court said about that is, and it said, “The only law which Congress has passed expressly curtailing the movement of Communists across our borders has not yet become effective.” 
    That was this Section 6 that we're now talking about. 
    It would therefore be strange to infer that pending the effectiveness of that law, the Secretary has been silently granted by Congress the larger, the more pervasive power to curtail in his discretion the free movement of citizens in order to satisfy himself about their beliefs. 
    Now I think it's possible in a sort of an abstract logical sense to say that all you're worried about is conduct abroad that's going to be dangerous to our security and therefore in order to prevent travel, you ought to have some showing that the conduct is likely to be dangerous to our security. 
    And that has a very plausible and pleasing sound to it, and I don't deny that abstractly that sounds like a narrower regulation. 
    But if you think of the problem of administering that kind of statute, if you think of the problem of appraising evidence to fathom an individual's future intentions, if you think of the problem of what this is, giving the person the opportunity to go abroad and there to do what he pleases. 
    He may correctly have no and properly say that he has no intention of doing anything wrong, when he appears before the hearing, but when he gets over there, there may then be an opportunity to engage in the wrongful activity which he embraces, indeed that's happened and cases of that kind are cited, of misuse of passport after accepting stipulations.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Surely, and all I say is that -- to say that that's narrower than the inhabitation proposed here, is to me a strange way of dealing with it, because what have we done when we've had to -- when we've had to administer standards of that kind. 
    We have relied on confidential evidence, because after all if you have a standard of that kind, the necessity or the desirability of seeming -- of relying on confidential evidence seems greater. 
    So most of these bills that are cited in the appellants' brief do provide that in certain cases the Secretary may rely on secret or confidential evidence. 
    We reverse burdens of proof which is in fact what we did in the passport regulations that existed in Kent and Briehl, in the Kent and Briehl cases. 
    It was necessary for the applicant to satisfy the Secretary that he was going abroad for a bad end -- an innocent end or we throw the net wider.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    But it was also possible to deny passports to people who weren't members at all, who we suspected on various grounds without any objective indicia of dedication to these ends. 
    And so when you put all these things together, which I submit Mr. Justice Goldberg are the practicalities of administering this kind of a standard and if you look to see which one is going to inhibit protected activity more, which one is going to have a wider reach within the population, which is the imposition of a loyalty oath and a loyalty test. 
    The standard which appellants suggest is the appropriate one, would in fact be broader than the standard we have here.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well, I think we do have the statute and our regulations provide that if a person is going abroad for the specific purpose of conducting unlawful activities abroad, he can be denied a passport, and we have done that upon occasion. 
    So that an espionage person, the person who is actually going abroad and we know that he is going abroad to do something unlawful is covered, and I think the Court in the Kent case said that that was an appropriate regulation of the passport right. 
    So the difficulty is that it only happens in the rarest of case that we know that a person is going abroad for espionage. 
    And my friends say that the prevention of espionage is the only object of this statue. 
    I think that's not the case. 
    I think anybody who has engaged in a cooperative venture, all of us have engaged in many for business, for pleasure, for government, knows that face-to-face contact, knowledge, understanding of the minds and of the actions of one's co-participants is an essential to the success of that kind of venture. 
    This isn't speech in the accepted sense, this isn't associated in the accepted sense. 
    This is a team getting together to work for its object as a team. 
    Now when its objects are unlawful or when its objects are those of the kind that this world organization has, it seems to me necessarily that to follow, that this kind of personal contact face-to-face intercourse is essential to the carrying out of those objects and therefore --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, whether you -- punishment is a broad word and includes many things.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    There is no question that it's a disability and I don't want to demean or deprecate the disability. 
    But the Court has said that disabilities other than criminal punishment can be imposed on people on the basis of this kind of membership.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    The Court has said for example that aliens can be deported on this same basis under the same statute.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1988.876" stopTime="1992.233">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Aliens and they drew a distinction there wherever they say aliens, did they say aliens?
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="1992.233" stopTime="1993.543">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well I think the distinction --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1993.543" stopTime="1996.567">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did they say that a non-alien could be citizen?
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="1996.567" stopTime="2073.094">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    No, but they said that a non-alien could be deprived of his officership in a labor union or could be required a -- or could be required to swear that he was not a member of this party in order to hold a position in a labor union, which could then make use of the facilities of the labor board. 
    All I'm saying is that under the decisions of this Court, it's clear that as to matters which don't involve criminal punishment, which don't involve a direct prohibition of speech, association, belief, disabilities maybe imposed on the basis of certain kinds of membership and membership as the Court said only the other day in the Quinones case, membership in which the element of advocacy of unlawful objectives was not brought home to the person upon whom the disability was imposed. 
    So it seems to me if the constitution resides or is to be found in the interpretations that this Court has given it, I can answer your question very easily. 
    No, a person is not entitled to a jury trial every time --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2073.094" stopTime="2076.708">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    My question is not premised on the First Amendment, there are other provisions of the constitution.

    Yes.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    One of them is the right to a trial by jury. 
    And if the government creates something, I don't know what they designate it, criminal offense or just anything in theory, the argument of the government here has to be that the government can't deprive them of the right to travel on account of disputed fact for what they believe, by letting a single administrator pass on those facts.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="2102.867" stopTime="2107.439">

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    But this Court in the Mendoza case only last year I think spent five or six pages of an opinion trying to determine whether a disability, a disability in that case of loss of citizenship, was designed as a punishment for crime in which case the Court decided it was designed as a punishment for crime and then decided it could not be imposed without a jury trial, but in another parallel --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2147.220" stopTime="2153.485">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did that case hold, I've forgotten, did that case hold if they hadn't decided it was a punishment, they wouldn't have been entitled to a jury trial.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="2153.485" stopTime="2193.384">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    In another parallel case, where they decided that denaturalization was not a punishment for crime, but an exercise of the foreign affairs power they held that denaturalization was not a punishment and that a citizenship could be taken away from him without a jury trial as to the facts. 
    So there you have in two cases in this Court dealing with the same kind of disability, denaturalization. 
    The Court in two separate opinions saying in one yes it is a criminal penalty and therefore there must be a jury trial and in the other, no it isn't a criminal penalty, in this case it's a different kind of thing and therefore we need a jury trial.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2193.384" stopTime="2208.612">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your argument leads you to the point that it is the most substanding citizen in the United States against whom there was no block on his (Inaudible), never had been, they want to take away his citizenship, can be done by an administrative agency without a jury trial.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="2208.612" stopTime="2233.353">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    No my argument does not lead me to that point at all. 
    It says that where denaturalization is imposed as a punishment, and this Court will determine in each particular statutory provision whether it is imposed as a punishment or not. 
    Where it's imposed as a punishment, it requires a jury trial; where it's imposed for something else, it doesn't require a jury trial.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    He did not, no, but Mr. Justice Brennan in a different case did manage to uphold the depravation of citizenship on -- the Perez case I think, on a ground and without a jury trial. 
    I think in -- we do have to consider, I agree we have to consider whether the accumulation of disabilities mounts up to a prohibition of the activity rather than merely a regulation of it. 
    But here I submit the statute is drawn so as not to prohibit the activity, but so as to define the conditions under which it maybe carried out and that it seems to me is the difference between the Scales case, for example, which appellants have cited and relied on very heavily and the cases we have here. 
    You cannot punish speech, you cannot put a man in jail for it, you cannot prohibit it as a norm of conduct without bringing home to that individual and in a trial by jury that he himself advocated the illegal objects of the organization. 
    But when it comes to disabilities less than criminal penalties, the Court has sustained a number and had sustained them very recently to be imposed without a jury trial and on the basis of association, that is membership without brining home to the individual any unlawful advocacy, any commitment to the unlawful objectives of the organization.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It strikes me that the distinction you are now making has got things turn around. 
    I had always thought that most people were of the view that prior restrain without trial was a more, more serious impairment of free speech and subsequent conviction after the speech had been delivered and with the conviction with all the charges of a criminal term.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="2424.146" stopTime="2474.724">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well, the point is that this is not designed as a prior restraint on speech, as was the case in Near versus Minnesota or the obscenity statutes. 
    It's not designed to prevent people in advance from saying dangerous things or to keep them from access to the marketplace of ideas. 
    It's designed to prevent them from doing other things, contributing in other ways to the success and to the objectives of this world organization which we have already described. 
    Although unfortunately at the same time, they may also be speaking or associating, and that's why it's not a prior restraint case in the sense of Near or the licensing cases and so on.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2474.724" stopTime="2483.201">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You know it's -- you mean it's not been intended to keep them from going aboard because, as here, that he may converge with somebody about his idea.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="2483.201" stopTime="2510.089">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    No it's not. 
    It's not intended as a regulation of speech at all, it has as we all agree the consequences of preventing some speech and inhibiting some association. 
    But the question there is not to be judged in the same way as it was in De Jonge and Oregon, the case on which the appellant relies where the problem was can you prohibit this speech, can you put a man in jail for this speech.
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="2510.089" stopTime="2524.191">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    Now, this has had -- there is something that you can see, but this is not necessary to tailor the statute (Inaudible) for a particular reason that Congress felt he could.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="2524.191" stopTime="2749.323">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    It is necessary to tailor the statute in that way, and we submit that this statute is so tailored. 
    I could read just one quotation from Justice Jackson in the Douds case when he talked about the inferences which Congress could draw from membership in this organization. 
    ‘Inferences for membership in such an organization,' he said, ‘are justifiably different from those to be drawn from membership in the usual type of political party. 
    Individuals who assume such obligations are chargeable on ordinary conspiracy principles with responsibility for and participation in all that makes up the parties program.' 
    And that was in an opinion where he said, you couldn't make a disability depend on belief, but you could on membership in this kind of organization. 
    As this Court has held over and over again in the deportation cases, in Douds, and in other similar cases. 
    I would say, if it please the Court that as the discussion has shown this is not an easy case, it's a case which presents us, the Congress in the first instance, the administration in the second, and now the court sitting in review with the agony of choice. 
    We have here great ends of government on both sides of the scale. 
    Great end of free speech and free association to which we are dedicated. 
    And on the other side of the scale the great end of protecting the security of our government. 
    Congress was faced with this choice in the first instance, the choice was a necessary one. 
    You can't have one and still have the other. 
    You've got to make some choice if you are going to deal with this problem, and the alternative, the alternative is to prohibit Congress to prevent it, to say it does not have the power to deal with this problem. 
    Congress made the choice, I submit, that in Fifth Amendment terms, it was a rational choice. 
    I submit that in First Amendment terms, it was a choice, which in practical consequence was the narrow choice rather than the broad choice, that a statute directed to suspicion of evil conduct aboard, a statute permitting as would seem to be necessary under any other standard resort to secret information, is a broader statute not a narrower statute. 
    However, it may seem superficially that here Congress insisted upon full procedural due process in which every person subject to the disabilities of this statute have the right to meet the evidence against him, to appear by attorney, and to make argument and to have a decision on the record. 
    I submit that it chose an objective criteria as this Court has said in Killian and in the deportation cases, an objective criteria, a criteria manifested by objective acts. 
    What Mr. Justice Brennan called membership in the Douds sense in his dissent in the Killian case. 
    That's the kind of criterion that has been chosen here. 
    It's an objective criterion and it has the effect of narrowing the statute rather than submitting the applicant to the whim or the suspicion of an administrator. 
    For these reasons --

    No, I think it's very important to note that the Court need only decide the case for these two appellants and as to these two appellants, as we have already said, they are the president of the party and the editor of its chief theoretical journal. 
    The record is replete with evidence which by any standard of meaningfulness makes their association with the party meaningful, so that we do believe the Court can decide on these two appellants and leave for another day someone whose contact with the party is less intimate.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well, the reason or the difference is that anyone can remove himself by that -- from the pains of the statute by simply resigning from the party as I guess Mr. Justice Harlan stated, and the essential character of a bill of attainder is that it's existing punishment, it's present punishment for past conduct without a jury trial.

    It was a legislative determination on findings which they sometimes made and sometimes didn't that a whole group of people were tainted, some of them had to be ostracized, some of them wouldn't be permitted to go within 10 miles of London or whatever it was, some of them would be tried for one thing or another. 
    But it was a legislative determination on their finding.

    It's inconsistent with --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, it does that in England when they proscribed -- had a proscription but no Catholics should come within -- no Catholic priest should come within 10 miles of London, he could have resigned his priesthood and gone to London.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="2958.951" stopTime="2966.737">
    Mr. Abram Chayes

    Mr. Chayes what is the practice of the department so for as the prohibiting passports to mere members of the party.

    You mean there is no practice.
speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="2982.194" stopTime="3029.365">
    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    So that there is no practice. 
    I would point out as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out that these appellants now say that the statute must be construed to prohibit any member from getting a party -- passport even though his connection -- however tenuous his connection with the party maybe, but they did not raise that issue. 
    And the usual way to test that kind of an issue is to raise it so that it can be tested on a record. 
    The department's interpretation of the statute, although it's not one that has been tested in actual adjudication, would be that a member of the party means what this Court has said member means in other cases under this statute.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Well it's talked -- it's used a different phraseology in different cases. 
    It said -- I think the best thing or the best way to describe it is that it's talked about meaningful association, and it means some involvement in the policies and programs.

    Well, I think that finding stands undisputed even though it wasn't repeated. 
    I mean the facts show that, the fact show continuing membership since 1937. 
    They show her in a variety of officer positions in the party, they show a great many activities.

    Mr. Abram Chayes 
    Our argument is that member means what it is mean the statute, in that finding, and therefore -- and if anybody is a member within the meaning of that test as prescribed in this statute, these people are. 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John J. Abt

    Mr. Abt.
speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="3553.751" stopTime="3592.832">
    Mr. John J. Abt 
    I would first like to point out to the Court the finding of the hearing officer in the case of Dr. Aptheker, which appears as a part of the letter from Mrs. Knight to him at page 13 of the record. 
    It states the hearing officer concluded that on the basis of the evidence of record, the state department had reason to believe that you were within the purview of Section 6 (a) of the act. 
    That's the only finding that the hearing officer made in that case. 
    It didn't even make a finding of membership, only a finding that he had reason to believe that Dr. Aptheker was a member. 
    Second I would like –

    Mr. John J. Abt 
    Well, there was no finding by the board.

    No finding?

    No.

    What about the hearing officer?
speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="3599.251" stopTime="3606.964">
    Mr. John J. Abt 
    Well, this was the finding of the hearing officer. 
    Hearing officer found that he had reason to believe that Dr. Aptheker was a member. 
    It appears at page 13 of the record.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3606.964" stopTime="3609.712">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That is not really an issue in this case. 
    You told as much earlier in your (Inaudible) Rowoldt and Perfetto case and all of it.
speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="3609.712" stopTime="3688.913">
    Mr. John J. Abt 
    Of course it's not an issue. 
    It's not an issue except to the extent that it's been talking about mere membership, whatever mere membership is, and by mere membership I assume we've been talking about non-meaningful membership in the Rowoldt sense, a coerced membership or a casual membership something on this kind, that's not in this case. 
    But I do want to reply to a question that the Chief Justice asked as to whether the state department has applied passport provision to rank and file members. 
    Let's used at term instead of mere member of the organization. 
    And the answer to that Mr. Chief Justice is that the statute makes it difficult but not impossible for a rank and file member to apply for a passport, because by the very act of applying, he's subjecting himself to a possible five-year prison sentence, and this no academic business. 
    The Department of Justice last Fall indicted a women, I don't know whether she is a mere member or rank and file member, or what kind of member she is, but indicted her out of down in San Francisco charged with just doing one thing for having applied for a passport while being a member of the Communist Party. 
    And that I should think would be sufficient to discourage rank and file members from testing out the application of the act to themselves.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3688.913" stopTime="3694.160">
    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible) that the application then disclosed her membership.
speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="3694.160" stopTime="3703.467">
    Mr. John J. Abt 
    No, no, no, the Section 6 makes it a crime for a member of the party to apply. 
    She applied, and the government alleges that she is a member.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3703.467" stopTime="3708.322">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's one of the sections as I recall that the Court found it unnecessary to pass.
speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="3708.322" stopTime="3715.466">
    Mr. John J. Abt 
    That's quite right, because Mr. Justice Frankfurter we may not be, may never be confronted with that problem because Communist may never want a trial.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They might never want to take this risk, why.
speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="3717.073" stopTime="3732.703">
    Mr. John J. Abt 
    That's right, that's correct. 
    And I think Mr. Justice Douglas who said that that's a unique kind of situation which requires a citizen to subject himself to a possible five-year penalty in order to find out whether a statute is constitutional or not.

    You've got this here (Inaudible) through the revocation proceeding.

    Mr. John J. Abt

    Mr. John J. Abt 
    The State department did us a favor I would say, or did the organization a favor in permitting this case to brought in a civil from rather than requiring a criminal prosecution to try it out. 
    Now, as I understand Mr. Chayes, what he, in bottom, is saying is that it's necessary to deny passports to all members of the Communist Party as a class indiscriminately, because we have to forestall the possibility of their doing something illegal if they went abroad. 
    Now, and it's too risky to wait until they do something illegal and then prosecute them. 
    I'd like to say only that all democracy I think Mr. Justice Holmes who made the point long ago I can't remember the exact phrase, but all democracy is a risk. 
    The presumption of innocence is very risky business. 
    And the rule against the prior restraints on First Amendment -- on the exercise of First Amendment rights is a very risky business. 
    You got to wait until something bad is done under our constitution before you can prosecute a man or punishing or deny -- or deprive him of his liberty. 
    Now -- but even if we put that one aside, put aside the argument I made earlier on the question of preventive detention, which I think is very much in the foreground of this case, and talk only about the form of this statute. 
    Mr. Chayes is a legal advisor for the state department but I must say that he talks, when he argues to this Court, as a typical prosecutor. 
    The typical prosecutor says, if we have to prove that this man from the beginning of ab initio, this man committed a crime, will never get a conviction, and therefore we need a presumption that was Tot case that Mr. Justice Black -- in which Mr. Justice Black wrote the opinion and that's been the cry the of prosecutor since the beginning of time, we need the help of a presumption. 
    Now, I don't think that the national security is so endangered that we've got to throw away the presumption of innocence and rely on these kind of presumptions that every person who joined the Communist Party, merely because of his membership, is a potential spy, saboteur, or whatnot in order to protect the national security of this country. 
    Indeed I think in terms of the real source and base of our national security, it lies not in shortcut procedures of this kind but the real base of our national security that lies in the perseverance of our constitution and the democratic processors that have been traditional with us and I that I hope that we'll continue to observe. 
    Thank you.
