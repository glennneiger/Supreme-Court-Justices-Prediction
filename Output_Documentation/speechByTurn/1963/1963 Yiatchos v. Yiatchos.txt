    Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case involves the question of the beneficial ownership of the United States Savings Bonds when there is encountered a conflict between the survivorship provisions of those bonds and the community property law, in this case of the State of Washington. 
    The case was heard in the trial court on stipulated facts which essentially are these. 
    Angel and Pearle Yiatchos were married in Washington in 1943 and resided there as man and wife until the death of Angel in 1958. 
    In 1950 and 1951, Angel Yiatchos, the husband, purchased the United States Series E Savings Bonds in question with community property. 
    He named on each of these bonds as the POD or the pay-on-death beneficiary, his brother Gust Yiatchos. 
    At the time of his death, Mr. Yiatchos left the will in which he bequeathed all of his bonds to six relatives including one -- among one of the six, his brother Gust who is also the petitioner here. 
    The bonds were of the total value of approximately $15,000 out of an entire community estate of approximately $36,500, and it is stipulated that the bonds are not required for the payment of creditors' claims. 
    There are three claimants to the bonds, the petitioner Gust Yiatchos who is the beneficiary named on the bonds, the -- the widow Pearle Yiatchos and the legatees under the last will and testament of Gust Yiatchos. 
    The contentions of the parties are best illustrated by considering the three possible results which were available to the Court in resolving the case. 
    If the survivorship provisions of the bonds were followed, the bonds would be awarded to Gust Yiatchos in their entirety. 
    If that should be construed to be a fraud on the widow, one half of the bonds could have been reserved or the equivalent in value could have been reserved to the widow by way of a trust. 
    If the purchasing of the bonds and the designate -- designation of the brother as beneficiary were held to be a complete fraud and void in its entirety, the widow would then receive her half interest in the bonds and the legatees under the will would take by a way of the will the remaining half interest. 
    The trial court held that under the stipulated facts, this was in effect an attempted gift of community property and therefore, it was void in its entirety and the beneficiary designated on the bonds took nothing. 
    The widow -- the bonds were held in trust for the estate which would give the widow her half interest and the other half interest would be distributed to the legatees named under the will. 
    The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the State of Washington and after it had been submitted to the Supreme Court on written briefs and on oral argument but prior to the decision of the state court, this Court decided the case of Free versus Bland which also involved the question of beneficial ownership of U.S. Savings Bonds in a community property law state, it having a reason out of Texas and the question there presented to the Court was whether the Treasury regulations governing survivorship, determined the beneficial ownership of the bonds or whether they were merely for the convenience of the Government in making payment, with the Government having no interest in who ultimately receive the proceeds. 
    The Court held in Free versus Bland that the survivorship provisions and the Treasury regulations were a substantial feature of the bonds and intended to and which did make the bonds attractive to investors by virtue of the fact that it provided a very simple and efficient and quick way to transmit property on death and thus avoiding the -- and thus to avoid the complications and the delay and the expensive probate proceedings, that these features contributed substantially to the marketability of the bonds and consequently to the management of the National Death by the U.S. Treasury Department under the constitutional authority to borrow money on the credit of United States. 
    The Court pointed out that under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, the relative importance to estate of its own state law is not material if it is in conflict with a valid federal law and stated this holding in this language. 
    "We hold, therefore, that the state law which prohibits a married couple from taking advantage of the survivorship provisions of United States Savings Bonds merely because the purchased price is paid out of community property must fall under the Supremacy Clause.” 
    The Court also indicated that there was an exception implicit in the bonds in the Treasury regulations so that the bonds could not become a sanctuary for fraud and that relief would be available under circumstances where fraud was -- or breach of trust was manifest. 
    The Court indicated that the --

    Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr. 
    Yes, I understand that the Supreme Court of Texas determined that there were no allegations of fraud and therefore the decision in the U.S. Supreme Court was dispositive of the case and entered judgment accordingly. 
    The Court also indicated that the doctrine of fraud which would be applicable in this situation was the doctrine of fraud under federal law and cited in the footnotes, the cases of Clearfield Trust Company versus United States and Holmberg versus Armbrecht. 
    Following this decision, the Washington Supreme Court which had the case pending before it, decided in the instant case that the purchase of the bonds by the husband designating the brother as beneficiary was an attempt to convert community property into separate property and therefore, it was an effect a fraud on the wife and the purchase with the designation of the beneficiary was void ab initio and affirmed the trial court in its judgment that the named beneficiary on the bonds took nothing and that the bonds reverted to the estate with half to go to the wife and the other half ultimately to go to the legatees.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is that on the theory that there is no consent by the wife to the purchase of the bonds?
speaker="ernest_r_whitmore_jr" startTime="514.145" stopTime="672.262">
    Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr. 
    There is no statement and no -- no fact as to whether there was consent or not and the Court merely held in effect and it was a very brief opinion that in the absence of proof of consent that the mere purchase itself would constitute the constructive fraud as a matter of law. 
    The effect of this decision of the Washington Supreme Court is that a married person does not have the right to take advantage of the survivorship provisions of United States Saving Bonds when they're purchased with community property, which we argue is flatly contrary to the specific holding in Free versus Bland. 
    The Court purported to bring the case within the exception stated in Free versus Bland but in its effort to do so, I would suggest that it had the exceptions swallow the holding and that the decision can be construed in no other way than that community property law transcends the Treasury regulations pertaining to these survivorship provisions. 
    With respect to the question of fraud, I would point out that there is no actual fraud contended for in the case, there were no allegations of actual fraud and there are no facts found upon which actual fraud could be said to exist. 
    The only way that fraud can be considered to be present in this case is simply by holding as a matter of law that a member of the community cannot purchase U.S. Savings Bonds designating anyone other than his spouse as beneficiary or presumably co-owner if it were that type of bonds. 
    In that regard, I would point out in the first place that the husband is the manager of the community property and as such, he has the right to handle the investments and to select the investments and this is regardless of either the knowledge or consent or even the objection of the wife. 
    It had --

    Do you -- do you suggest that this was a management of the affairs distinguished from the gifts of the -- the brother?
speaker="ernest_r_whitmore_jr" startTime="695.183" stopTime="765.305">
    Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr. 
    I think that the purchase of the U.S. Savings Bonds in this situation involves both aspects. 
    In the first place, they are bought by a living person with the contemplation of continuing to live for a substantial period of time and in this case, he did and in that sense during the continuance of his life and of the marriage, these represent a security and consequently an investment of the community and assets of the community. 
    At the same time, either party to the community has the right to dispose of half -- not more than half of the community property by will and this in effect an alternative to a will by -- by way of making disposition of property on death. 
    So the U.S. Savings Bonds in this case are -- are in the first instance, an investment which the husband is authorized to make as manager of the community property and in the second place, they are a technique or a device whereby he may transmit his share of the community property on death.

    Why does this -- this case differ from Free versus Bland on the facts?
speaker="ernest_r_whitmore_jr" startTime="771.069" stopTime="808.431">
    Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr. 
    In the facts of Free versus Bland, the husband and wife purchased -- well, I don't know who purchased the bonds but in any event, they were purchased in the name of the husband and the wife as co-owners. 
    Thereafter, the wife died and the husband claimed ownership of the bonds in their entirety and an heir of the wife claims that they should have remained part of her estate so that he could have inherited them. 
    In this case, the bonds were made payable to the brother as beneficiary and it is the wife who is claiming the bonds.

speaker="ernest_r_whitmore_jr" startTime="819.453" stopTime="931.802">
    Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr. 
    But in any event, yeah, that is correct. 
    Our -- our position is that -- that the proper rule and that in seeking a uniform rule as the -- as the Court has indicated should be sought under federal law and citing the -- the Clearfield Trust Company case that this should not be left to state court decision but that the decision should here be made by this Court in this case and I will refer to that later and that a proper test in order to obtain a rule of uniformity rather than to leave it to the various decisions of the various state courts would be first to say that either there must be actual fraud or that there must be an attempt on the part of the offending spouse, if that is the proper term, an attempt on the part of the spouse by this device to dispose of more property than it could have by will. 
    And so long as he does not exceed that, it's our contention that there is no fraud because here, the husband could have disposed of half of the community estate amounting to in excess of $36,000 by will. 
    By the device of community -- of U.S. Savings Bonds, he has in effect attempted to dispose of less than that and therefore, it's our contention that this cannot be said to be a fraud. 
    The --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="931.802" stopTime="940.824">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Would that be true regardless of whether he did it over the objection of the wife or not?
speaker="ernest_r_whitmore_jr" startTime="940.824" stopTime="980.606">
    Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr. 
    Frankly, it would be my belief and opinion that it would be because the husband has the right. 
    He has the right to select investments regardless of the knowledge or consent of the wife and he has the absolute right to leave half of his property by will and there's never been any suggestion that he has to obtain the consent or approval of the wife in order to dispose of his property by will. 
    Therefore, I suggest that there is no reason why he should not be free to dispose of it by this method regardless of the consent of the wife.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="980.606" stopTime="989.095">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But if it wasn't the investments, I suppose you can do -- do the same with the entire (Inaudible).
speaker="ernest_r_whitmore_jr" startTime="989.095" stopTime="1108.283">
    Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr. 
    I would certainly agree that he would be free to devote -- to invest the entire community estate in community -- in U.S. Savings Bonds. 
    However, if he attempted to dispose of a greater portion of the community property by this technique then he could have disposed off by will then I think that you would become involved with a -- with a question of a fraud on the wife because she is entitled to her half of the community property. 
    Where it amounts to less than that, it's our position that there can be considered to be no fraud and that the status which the Washington Supreme Court has left us in is that a -- a husband has the right to dispose off half of his property by will, but that he can dispose of it only by will and that he can't utilize U.S. Savings Bonds. 
    And in fact under the present situation of the law in Washington, an investment -- or the use of U.S. Savings Bonds is something which a married person should very carefully avoid because if he attempts to make a disposition by way of U.S. Savings Bonds, he has depleted his estate by the amount which he has invested in the bonds and that attempted disposition is held entirely void and so he has whatever might be left to dispose of by will which is less than he could have if he had not bought U.S. Savings Bonds at all. 
    So if this state of the law is permitted to continue, the attractiveness of U.S. Savings Bonds to people certainly in the State of Washington and potentially in other community property estates -- property estates has been very seriously diminished and damaged.

    Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr. 
    Yes and there is no reason at all why at any time prior to the death of the named owner that the bonds would not be available for any legitimate community purpose. 
    They are subject to attachment by judgment creditors of the community. 
    They certainly would be within the jurisdiction of the Court in a divorce action in the division of property and simply constitute a perfectly valid and legitimate holding of the community so long as the community exists.

    Under the facts of the present case, I would say that since it does not appear that there is here an attempt to dispose of more than half of the community estate by will, or by the use of the -- these bonds which we're here concerned with that therefore, there is presently before us no fraud. 
    Now, if upon the final settlement of the case, it should appear that -- and I think that that should be determined -- determinative of the case at this point because --

    Yes, but I would seriously dispute the position of the Court that that section should not apply to community property. 
    However, regardless of -- of the matter of testamentary disposition, I think that we here under the Supremacy Clause if the state statute is construed to hold that disposition of property on death can be made only by testamentary disposition, we have in effect nullified the survivorship provisions of U.S. Savings Bonds and --

    They would all -- they would all vanish if that state statute were permitted to prevail.

   Argument of Charles W. Cone

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Cone.
speaker="charles_w_cone" startTime="2099.290" stopTime="2243.728">
    Mr. Charles W. Cone 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, if the Court please? 
    The question as arisen initially or at this time as to whether or not there was fraud in the purchase of these bonds by Angel Yiatchos at the time of the purchase. 
    We admit at this time that the record is not complete. 
    Mr. Whitmore and I stipulated to all material facts and there are now facts that appear more material than they did in 1959 when we so stipulated. 
    However, the trial court made a founding -- a finding which in a sense is a finding that there was fraud. 
    This was an attempted gift by a husband of what is stipulated to be community property, and this would be a -- a constructive fraud upon the wife if it was done without her consent, without her knowledge, without subsequent ratification by her or without consideration or benefit to the community. 
    It seems to me that the trial court so found in its decision when it ruled that these were community property and the wife was entitled to one-half because any other ruling would have the effect of stating that it was separate property and the husband had a right to do this. 
    I want to briefly outline what the state -- in the Supreme Court of State of Washington found in these matters after argument. 
    On page 19 of the record, Supreme Court says, "This purchase was in fraud of the rights of the respondent wife" and then after a test, this was a unilateral attempt to convert community property into separate property and void ab initio.

    Initially, the first answer to that question Your Honor is that the husband has -- does not have the present right to distribute or giveaway or use one-half of the community property. 
    Their ownership of community property is an undivided half interest, and a husband cannot unilaterally divide the community property. 
    He cannot say the Buick is mine and the Cadillac is yours or the bank account is mine and the bonds are yours or make any other division without consent of the wife.

    Well, I think the -- the rule will -- will be applied in other cases that the -- the ruling of this Court would have the effect of stating that the beneficiary does need it on the bonds with the owner of half of them and -- and if that is the ruling then in other cases, the -- the wife share of the estate can be depleted as I say by the community debts.

    There -- there is another point we should consider and that is the difference in this case and that of Free versus Bland in -- in the -- your decision in Free versus Bland was upholding the right of a married couple to take advantage of the survivorship provisions of the Treasury regulations.

    Or by agreement of the parties. 
    I -- I want to remind the Court since we're dealing with Treasury regulations that -- that there's one cited in our brief CFR 315.5 and if precedes these regulations concerning the survivorship provisions of -- of bonds and its estates, United States Savings Bonds are issued in only -- only in registered form. 
    The form of registration must express the actual ownership of an interest in the bonds. 
    Now, we contend that a bond purchase without consent of his wife by a husband payable-on-death to someone else does not express as a -- the regulations require her interest in the bonds because she retains an interest in these bonds until her death. 
    And if we're going to -- and we think that is the intent of -- of this regulation is to provide that the survivorship regulations will prevail if the bonds are purchased properly and show the proper interest to the parties at the time of purchase. 
    Now, his wife, Mrs. Yiatchos, had an interest in these bonds throughout the -- the marriage. 
    The -- the divesting over that interest was in violation of -- of these regulations, in this regulation as well as the survivorship regulation should be maintained. 
    Unless there are further questions, I will conclude my argument. 
    We move that the -- the decision of the lower court be affirmed.
