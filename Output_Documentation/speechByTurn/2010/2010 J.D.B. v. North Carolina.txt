J.D.B. v. North Carolina
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="0.000" stopTime="189.362">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    This case comes to us from the Supreme Court of North Carolina. 
    Under our decision in Miranda versus Arizona, a suspect must be warned of his rights before being subjected to custodial police interrogation. 
    A suspect is in police custody if given all of the objective circumstances a reasonable person in the suspect's position would not feel at liberty to terminate questioning and leave. 
    This case presents the question whether the age of a child subjected to police questioning is relevant to the Miranda custody analysis. 
    Petitioner was a 13-year-old child attending middle school classes when police removed him from his classroom and escorted him to a school conference room. 
    There, petitioner was met by school administrators and an investigator with the local police force. 
    For at least 30 minutes, petitioner was questioned about his involvement in two home breakings that occurred the prior weekend. 
    Eventually, petitioner confessed to the crimes. 
    Petitioner was charged with breaking and entering and larceny. 
    He argued in the state court that his confession must be suppressed because he had been interrogated in a custodial setting without first receiving the warnings that Miranda requires. 
    The (Inaudible) trial and appellate courts rejected this argument. 
    The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed refusing to consider petitioner's age as part of that custody analysis, we reverse. 
    As we explained in our opinion filed with the clerk of the court today, we conclude that a child's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis. 
    A child's age is an objective fact that would affect how a reasonable person in the suspect's position would perceive his freedom to terminate questioning and leave. 
    Police officers in courts can account for that reality without compromising the objective nature of the custody analysis. 
    So long as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, a child's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis. 
    The judgment of the North Carolina Supreme Court is reversed. 
    The case is remanded for the state courts to evaluate whether petitioner was in custody, when police interrogated him, this time taking into account of his age at the time. 
    Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas joined.
