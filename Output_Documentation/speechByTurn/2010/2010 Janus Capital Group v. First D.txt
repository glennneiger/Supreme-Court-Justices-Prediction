    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the -- to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    Janus Capital Group, a publicly traded company created Janus Investment Fund, a collection of mutual funds. 
    Janus Investment Fund then hired Janus Capital Management or JCM wholly on subsidiary of Janus Capital Group, to be its investment advisor and administrator. 
    As required by statute, Janus Investment Fund filed prospectuses with the Securities Exchange Commission for its mutual funds. 
    Some of the -- those pros -- prospectuses suggested that JCM would implement policies against market timing, a trading strategy that can harm investors. 
    When it came to light that JCM permitted Market Timing, investors withdrew money from the Janus Investment Fund, mutual funds. 
    Janus Capital Group stock price also plummeted. 
    Respondents, stockholders of Janus Capital Group sued Janus Capital Group and JCM under SEC Rule 10b-5 which makes it unlawful to make any untrue statement of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 
    The stockholders alleged that -- that the companies have made material untrue statements by participating in the writing and dissemination of the prospectuses. 
    The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. 
    But the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed holding that the stockholders had alleged sufficient facts claimed that both companies had made misleading statements. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for purposes of Rule 10b-5, the maker of a statement is a person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement including its content and whether and how to communicate it. 
    Here, even if JCM assisted with the drafting of the prospectuses, they were Janus Investment Fund's prospectuses and that company had ultimate authority over them. 
    Janus Investment Fund, not JCM or Janus Capital Group made the statements. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan joined.
