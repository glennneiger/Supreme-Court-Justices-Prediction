Wall v. Kholi

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    This case concerns the 1-year limitation provision for filing a federal habeas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. 
    The statute provides that that one-year period is tolled by “a properly filed application for a State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.” 
    And the question here concerns the meaning of the phrase, "other collateral review." 
    Specifically, the question here is whether a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is an application for “collateral review” that tolls the limitation period. 
    For the reason stated in the opinion filed today, we hold that the phrase "collateral review" in this provision means judicial review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of the direct review process. 
    The parties here agree that Rhode Island's motion to reduce sentence is not part of the direct review process, so we hold that it is an application for a collateral review that tolls the limitation period. 
    We therefore affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part.
