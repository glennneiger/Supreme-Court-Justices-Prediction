    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The basic civil rights statute 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 says “Every person who, under color of any state statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, subjects or causes to be subjected any other person to the deprivation of any right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity or other proper proceeding for redress.” 
    It's a basic text. 
    In 1961, this Court, in the case called “Monroe versus Pape” held that that statute, the text I read, did not apply to the actions of cities or towns or other municipalities. 
    But 16 years later, in another case called “Monell”, the New York City Department of Social Services, the Court reconsidered the question of municipal liability under Section -- Sections 1983 and it overruled Monroe. 
    In doing so, it held municipalities are persons who can be held liable under Section 1983. 
    But they can be held liable only for their own actions. 
    They cannot be held by vicariously liable for the actions of others, say their employees. 
    Now, I'll repeat that, that's the key point. 
    The Court expressly said, a “municipality cannot be held liable” solely for the acts of others, solely because it employs a tortfeasor. 
    But a municipality can be held liable for its own actions, namely, when execution of a government policy or custom inflicts the injury. 
    That's the basic rule. 
    The Ninth Circuit and has held that this municipality liability requirement, the policy or custom requirement, does apply when a plaintiff sues a municipality for damages but they've also held that the policy or custom requirement does not apply when a plaintiff seeks injunctive or other perspective relief looking to the future. 
    So, that's the cast question before us. 
    We look at this last holding, are they right to make this exception for perspective relief? 
    In our view, the Ninth Circuit's exception to the ordinary policy or custom requirement is wrong. 
    It has no basis in law. 
    Monell, referring to earlier cases, said specifically that its interpretation of the statute should not “have a bifurcated application to municipal corporations depending on the nature of the relief sought”. 
    Monell's logic and reasoning lead to exactly the same conclusion. 
    There is no difference, whether it's perspective relief or whether it's a monetary relief that they seek. 
    All the other Circuits who've decided the question have come to the same conclusion. 
    And for these reasons, which we explain more fully in our opinion, we conclude that Monell's policy or custom requirement applies in Section 1983 cases, whether the relief sought is monetary or whether it is perspective. 
    And we reverse the Ninth Circuit's contrary determination. 
    The decision is unanimous. 
    Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
