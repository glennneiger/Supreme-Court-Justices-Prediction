    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    The second case is the opinion for the Court in Sorrel versus IMS Health. 
    Companies that manufacture brand-name prescription drugs, higher marketers to promote their products. 
    Some of these marketers visit doctor's offices to discuss the details and benefits of various pharmaceuticals. 
    So these direct marketers are called “detailers”. 
    Sales persons are often more effective when they are familiar with the preferences of their customers. 
    Pharmaceutical sales persons, including the so-called “detailers” are no exemption. 
    They use information regarding doctors past prescription decisions to concentrate their presentations on information that is most relevant to the individual doctor. 
    This information called “prescriber-identifying information” is collected by pharmacists. 
    Pharmacists sell this information to data miners. 
    These are firms that analyze the data and produce reports on individual prescription decisions. 
    Pharmaceutical manufacturers and the detailers then purchase the information from the data miners. 
    In 2007, Vermont enacted a law that place limits on the disclosure and use of prescriber-identifying information. 
    The measure prohibits pharmacists from selling the information and from disclosing it for marketing purposes. 
    The law also forbids pharmaceutical manufacturers from using the information for marketing. 
    Some Vermont data miners, and in association of pharmaceutical manufacturers, filed suit arguing that the law violated their First Amendment rights. 
    The United States District Court for the District of Vermont denied relief, but the Second Circuit reversed. 
    We now affirm the judgment of the Court of the Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    Vermont's law raises serious First Amendment concerns. 
    It imposes burdens based on the content of speech. 
    Under Vermont's law, pharmacists may disclose prescriber-identifying information for many purposes including, for example, healthcare research. 
    But the law forbids pharmacists from selling or disclosing the information for marketing. 
    The law also imposes a restriction based on the identity of the speaker by preventing drug manufacturers from using the information for marketing. 
    Under the First Amendment, Vermont must justify these contents and speaker-based burdens on expression. 
    We conclude the State cannot do so. 
    Vermont suggest that its law protects the confidentiality of doctor's prescription decisions, but the law allows for the widespread disclosure and user-prescriber-identifying information and so does not advance any interest in confidentiality. 
    Vermont also suggests that this law will prevent detailers from selling so many brand-name drugs. 
    In the States' view, that outcome is desirable because brand-name drugs are expensive and pose special health risks. 
    The States' argument, however, is contrary to basic First Amendment principles. 
    The Government may not strive to keep its citizens in the dark so that they will make decisions the State prefers. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Kagan joined.
