    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    The -- this case has come to us on a writ of certio -- on writs of certiorari to the United States -- from the United States Court of Appeal for the Sixth Circuit. 
    The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires incumbent local telephone providers like -- or such us respondent AT&amp;T to share certain parts of their physical networks with competitors at cost-based prices. 
    This case concerns an incumbent's obligation to lease entrance facilities which are typically wires or cables that connect to networks. 
    Entrance facilities can be used for two different purposes. 
    One is called "backhauling" and the other is called "interconnection". 
    The FCC recently decided that incumbent local telephone providers are not required to lease entrance facilities for backhauling. 
    It emphasized however, that it was not changing incumbent's existing obligation to provide facilities necessary for interconnection. 
    After the FCC's decision, AT&amp;T notified its competitors that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based prices for either backhauling or interconnection. 
    The competitors argued that AT&amp;T was violating its duty to provide interconnection. 
    The District Court ruled that AT&amp;T -- ruled for AT&amp;T and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals because no statute or regulation expressly addresses AT&amp;T's obligation to lease its entrance facilities, we look to the FCC's interpretation of its regulations in its amicus brief. 
    The FCC argues that an incumbent must lease existing entrance facilities to competitors at cost-based rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnection. 
    We find the FCC's interpretation reasonable and defer to that interpretation. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous. 
    Justice Scalia has filed the concurring opinion. 
    Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.
