    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    This case began with a bitter personal dispute, Carol Anne Bond is the petitioner here. 
    She learned that a woman who was her close friend was pregnant and that the father was Bond's husband. 
    Bond sought revenge. 
    She put caustic substances on -- substances on objects the woman was likely to touch like her mailbox and the front door handle and the door handles of the woman's car. 
    A federal investigation followed and Bond was charged in United States District Court with two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. Section 229. 
    The Section 229 was enacted by the Congress of the United States or implement provisions of a chemical weapons treaty that was ratified by United States in 1997 and the statute forbids the knowing possession or use non-peaceful purposes of any chemical that can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals. 
    Bond raised the constitutional objection to the prosecution. 
    She argued that by enacting Section 229, Congress exceeded its powers under the constitution. 
    The statute, Bond argued, intrudes upon the sovereignty and authority of the states. 
    Relying on the Tenth Amendment, she contended that at least in the present instance the federal treaty cannot be the source of congressional power to regulate or prohibit her conduct. 
    The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that because no state had intervened, Bond lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Section 229 on Tenth Amendment grounds. 
    This Court granted certiorari. 
    Because the Government unlike its earlier position later did concede that Bond has standing, an amicus curiae was appointed to defend the judgment of the Court of Appeals and hereto the brief and oral argument presented to the Court by the amicus has been -- have been of considerable assistance to the Court. 
    We do now determine that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed. 
    In reaching the conclusion of no standing, the Court for Appeals relied on a single sentence from this Court's -- this 1939 decision in Tennessee Electric Power Company versus TVA. 
    In that sentence has been the source of disagreement and confusion in various Courts of Appeals. 
    We now hold that the sentence should be treated as no longer controlling or instructive. 
    In defense of the Court of Appeals, the amicus invoked the more general principle that a litigant cannot risk his claim for relief on the legal rights or interest of third parties. 
    In the view of the amicus argue that national government has interfered with state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to assert only a right or an interest pertaining to states as such and not to individuals. 
    We conclude that is not so. 
    It is true that the federal structures established these boundaries between the states and the national government for their own integrity. 
    But federalism has more than one dynamic. 
    It also secures the freedom of the individual. 
    It allows states to respond through the enactment of laws, to the initiative of those who seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times and by denying any one government complete jurisdiction overall the concerns of public life, federalism helps protect the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power. 
    Fidelity, the principles of federalism is not for the states alone to vindicate. 
    An individual has a direct interest in objecting to laws that upset the balance between the national and state governments. 
    Of course, a person who challenges government action on federalism grounds is subject to Article III in prudential limitations applicable to all litigants. 
    These include the requirements of an injury in fact traceable to the Government's conduct and redressable by judicial decision. 
    But when those requirements are met as they are here, there is no further restriction applicable to Tenth Amendment challenges. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and remanded.On remand, the Court of Appeals may consider the merits of Bond's Tenth Amendment arguments in the first instance. 
    The decision of the Court is unanimous. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Breyer joins.
