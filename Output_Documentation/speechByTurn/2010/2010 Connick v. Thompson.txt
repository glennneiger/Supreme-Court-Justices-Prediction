    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Justice Thomas just reported on dissent from today's decision. 
    Nearly half a century ago in Brady against Maryland, this Court held that due process requires the prosecution to turn over evidence favorable to the accused and material to his guilt or punishment. 
    That obligation was dishonored in this case. 
    Consequently, John Thompson spent 14 years isolated on death row, before the truth came to light. 
    He was innocent of the charge of attempted robbery and his subsequent murder trial, by prosecutorial design, was fundamentally unfair. 
    Within weeks of Thompson's scheduled execution, a private investigator hired by defense counsel unearthed a police crime lab report. 
    Prior to Thompson's armed robbery trial, the crime lab had tested a swatch of fabric stained with the robber's blood. 
    The lab reported to the prosecutors that the perpetrator's blood type was B. 
    Thompson's blood type is O. 
    Petitioners acknowledged that Thompson's prosecutors violated his right to due process by withholding from defense counsel the blood stains swatch and the lab report. 
    After his exoneration, Thomson filed a civil rights action seeking to hold the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office liable for failure to train prosecutors concerning their Brady obligations. 
    Such liability attaches, I agree with the Court, only when the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom untrained employees come into contact. 
    Unlike the Court, however, I would hold that the record in this case abundantly shows labels of difference to Thompson's rights. 
    As we counted in detail in the written dissent, the conceded, long-concealed prosecutorial transgressions in Thompson's trials were neither isolated nor atypical. 
    They were just what one would expect given the attitude toward Brady pervasive in the district attorney's office, just one of many examples. 
    The prosecution in Thompson's murder trial failed to produce a police report containing an eyewitness description of the murderer as six feet with close cut hair. 
    Thompson is five feet eight inches tall. 
    And at the time of the murder, he styled his hair in a large Afro. 
    No fewer than five prosecutors concealed year upon year this and other evidence vital to Thompson's defense. 
    And his retrial on the murder charge, which yielded a prompt not guilty verdict, the defense introduced 10 exhibits containing evidence not disclosed when Thompson was first tried. 
    One instruction that Orleans Parish prosecutors received regarding their obligation to reveal evidence favorable to the accused, District Attorney Connick hired staff members right out of law school. 
    And because of high turnover, inexperienced prosecutors quickly became supervisors. 
    The supervisors leading Thompson's prosecutions learn their craft in Orleans Parish. 
    They recalled no instruction at the District Attorney's Office on Brady and its application. 
    Ample evidence presented at the civil rights trial demonstrated that Connick deliberate -- deliberately indifferent attitude created a tinderbox in which Brady violations were not inevitable. 
    And when they did occur, Connick maintain that there was no need to change anything, he terminated grand jury investigation into prosecutorial misconduct in Thompson's case because holding the prosecutors accountable he felt that make his job more difficult. 
    The Court suggests that lawyers, unlike rookie police officers, are guided by their professional education and ethical rules and therefore need no special Brady training. 
    As a handling of Thompson's prosecution shows, however, Brady compliance is too much at risk and too fundamental to the fairness of our criminal justice system to be taken for granted. 
    Training remains critical and Connick himself should have been the principle insurer of that training. 
    I do not suggest that Con -- that Connick can be held vicariously liable to Thompson's ordeal. 
    My point is that Connick bares responsibility for his own deliberate indifference to and all too apparent need for on-the-job Brady training. 
    In accord with the Court of Appeals, and before it, the District Court, I would uphold the jury's verdict awarding damages to Thompson for the gross, deliberately indifferent and long-continued violation of his fair trial right. 
    Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan joined me in this dissenting opinion.
