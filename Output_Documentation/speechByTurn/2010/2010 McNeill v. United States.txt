speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="0.000" stopTime="130.037">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of the Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, known as ACCA, a felon who unlawfully possesses a firearm is subject to a 15-year minimum prison sentence if he has -- has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. 
    As relevant here, the statute defines a serious drug offense as a state drug trafficking offense for which "a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law". 
    The question in this case is how a federal sentencing court should determine what maximum sentence is prescribed by law for a defendant's previous state drug offense. 
    Petitioner Clifton McNeill pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. 
    The District Court determined that ACCA applied based in part on McNeill's six prior state drug trafficking convictions. 
    McNeill argued that his prior convictions were not for serious drug offenses because, although those offenses each carried a 10-year maximum sentence. 
    When he was convicted of them, the State had since reduced the maximum penalty for those offenses. 
    The District Court rejected McNeill's argument and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals to determine the maximum term of imprisonment for prior state offense for ACCA purposes. 
    A federal sentencing court must consult the law that applied to the defendant's offense at the time of his state conviction for that offense. 
    The plain text of the statute allows no other interpretation. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous.
