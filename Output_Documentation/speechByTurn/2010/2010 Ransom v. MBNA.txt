    Justice Elena Kagan 
    This case is about the proper interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code. 
    In what's called Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, a person can get relief from all his debts in exchange for an agreement, an agreement to repay his creditors a certain amount of his future income for the next several years. 
    The Bankruptcy Code instructs a person in this situation how to calculate the exact amount that he has to repay his creditors. 
    The Code says to that person, first, you take your current income then you deduct certain defined living expenses. 
    Those defined expenses, the Bankruptcy Code says, are set amounts, not necessarily your actual expenses, but set amounts that the IRS decides are reasonable for various necessary things like housing, or transportation, or food. 
    You deduct those expenses from your income and what's left over is the amounts that you are required to repay creditors. 
    Now, the issue in this case is whether the Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor, who's making this calculation, to deduct an expense that he simply does not have. 
    The expense at issue is for car ownership. 
    The IRS, and again that's the agency that's authorized to set these reasonable expenses. 
    The IRS says that the average loan or lease payment for a car nationwide is $471 a month. 
    And so the IRS says, that's the amount that a person typically can deduct in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. 
    That's the amount of the car-ownership deduction. 
    The petitioner here, whose name is Jason Ransom, he claims this deduction even though he owned his car free and clear, and he didn't in fact make any loan or lease payments on this car. 
    And claiming this deduction, allowed him to shield about $28,000 that he otherwise would've had to pay his creditors over the life of his bankruptcy plan. 
    And he took the car-ownership deduction in addition to claiming another deduction that the IRS sets for car-operating costs like fuel, and insurance, and repairs. 
    So one of his creditors, perhaps not surprisingly, objected. 
    That creditor said that Mr. Ransom wasn't eligible to claim the car-ownership deduction because he didn't in fact incur any car-ownership costs. 
    Today, we hold that this was a valid objection, that Mr. Ransom was not entitled to this deduction under the Bankruptcy Code. 
    We reached this conclusion by looking closely at the language of the statute. 
    The statute authorizes a debtor to deduct, “His applicable monthly expense amounts that are set by the IRS.” 
    "Applicable," if you go and you look it up in the dictionary, means appropriate, or relevant, or fit and we conclude that when the statute says, “Applicable expense amounts”, what the statute means is the expense amounts or deductions, that's another word for it, the deductions that are appropriate for that debtor. 
    And the deductions that are appropriate for that debtor are the ones that correspond to his own financial circumstances. 
    So a person who doesn't have any car-ownership expenses can't take a deduction for car ownership. 
    We also think that this understanding of the statutory language accords with the context and purpose of the statute. 
    Other provisions of the statute made clear that Congress intended the deductions to approximate the debtor's reasonable expenditures on basic necessities. 
    And Congress' essential purpose in enacting this part of the Code was to ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do pay them. 
    So once again, we think this means that a person like Mr. Ransom who doesn't have any car-ownership expenses shouldn't be able to deducts them when calculating how much he has available to repay creditors. 
    We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which previously disapproved this deduction. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.
