Kentucky v. King

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-1272, Kentucky v. King. 
    Mr. Farley.
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="9.106" stopTime="43.510">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue before you today, of whether or not police can impermissibly create exigent circumstances, arises from the improper suppression of reasonably seized evidence after a reasonable warrantless entry. 
    The test set forth by the Kentucky Supreme Court is improper for several reasons, the first of which is that this Court has routinely held that the subjective intent of police officers when effecting a warrantless entry is irrelevant.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="43.510" stopTime="57.420">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Where did the -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court say that it was looking to a subjective state of mind on the part of the police?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="57.420" stopTime="103.132">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Well, the Kentucky Supreme Court's first prong of their test, and I believe it's in our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry. 
    Their -- their discussion starts on page 44a and carries over to 46A. 
    The first question of their test is whether or not the officers acted in bad faith in an attempt to purposefully evade the warrant requirements.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="103.132" stopTime="105.566">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    That didn't -- that didn't apply in this case?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="105.566" stopTime="123.925">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    That is correct. 
    The second prong of the Kentucky Supreme Court's test is whether or not the actions of the Respondent in this case or the occupant of the home would have been foreseeable by the police officers before they knocked and announced their presence. 
    Now, the problem with the foreseeability test--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="123.925" stopTime="133.197">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Why is -- why is that subjective? 
    Why isn't that, wouldn't it be foreseeable to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="133.197" stopTime="205.829">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --Well, Justice Ginsburg, it -- it isn't directly a subjective inquiry. 
    However, police officers are trained to expect and foresee illegal activity so that they may carry out the duties of their job in protecting the citizens. 
    So under a foreseeability test, a police officer will always foresee illegal activity in response to his actions. 
    Be it walking down the street or knocking on your door, a reasonable officer will always foresee illegal activity, and for that reason, the Kentucky Supreme Court's test is completely unworkable. 
    Several of the other circuits and the lower courts have adopted tests that also attempt to add an extra exception, an unwarranted closure of the exigent circumstances exception that narrows the use of that exception by police officers. 
    The test that the Commonwealth would propose is a simple lawfulness test. 
    Now, under this test, as long as an officer behaves lawfully, there should be no suppression of evidence seized after an otherwise reasonable search--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="205.829" stopTime="225.973">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    So, you have an apartment building where the police know from experience there is a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug transactions. 
    Every 2 weeks they walk through and knock on every door and wait for evidence of the destruction of -- of -- of drugs. 
    Is that all right?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="225.973" stopTime="232.646">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --Well, there's -- I would say yes, if there is probable cause as well as--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="232.646" stopTime="239.300">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, the probable cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know, flushing and, you know, the hiding or whatever behind the door.
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="239.300" stopTime="252.290">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --Well, I would assert that there are -- there are two separate issues here. 
    You must have probable cause separate from the existence of exigent circumstances. 
    In this case there was probable cause due to the smell of marijuana.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="252.290" stopTime="287.964">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    They go to the apartment building and they sniff at every door, and when they sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from the door, then they go through this routine, but they do it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a routine matter. 
    They don't just knock on every door, but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana, and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being stashed.
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="287.964" stopTime="305.574">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Justice Ginsburg, under a simple lawfulness test, since the officers have not violated the Fourth Amendment prior to the exigency arising, there would be no need to suppress any evidence. 
    That would be perfectly fine for the officers to do that. 
    It may not be the most--

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    --to the Chief Justice when he said -- and I think this was the Solicitor General's position -- that the police can routinely knock at a door and wait to see if they hear a toilet flushing. 
    I -- I've taken it out of this case but -- because I don't know what noise means. 
    But your answer would be yes?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="327.220" stopTime="329.688">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --Yes, if -- if probable cause exists.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I'm sorry. 
    I think I have got two different probable causes that's caused -- causing me some confusion. 
    I understand their requirement of probable cause, and that they hear sound of evidence being destroyed and therefore enter. 
    Is that -- or are you talking about the probable cause to think there's something going on in the first place?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="365.975" stopTime="373.562">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    There are two separate issues here.

    He -- he--

    --He could knock on the door.

    --He smells marijuana--

    The smell of--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="393.493" stopTime="397.112">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --then he knocks on the door. 
    When does the probable cause arise and when must it arise?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="397.112" stopTime="415.406">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --Well, the smell of marijuana would give probable cause to obtain a search warrant. 
    Once he knocks on the door and hears noises consistent with the destruction of physical evidence, then an exigency has arised. 
    Now the officer has both probable cause and an exigent circumstance--
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="415.406" stopTime="447.358">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    But I don't understand why the smell of marijuana is necessary. 
    This goes back to what Justice Sotomayor was saying, you don't need probable cause to knock on a door. 
    Knocking on a door is perfectly lawful. 
    So, if there's just a lawfulness test, the knock is fine. 
    And then when you hear whatever it is that you hear that you think creates exigent circumstances, whether it's a toilet flushing or whether it's just noise, that too gives you the ability to go right in. 
    So -- so if it's just lawfulness, you don't need the marijuana smell even, do you?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="447.358" stopTime="454.812">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --Well, I think -- I think we're confused.

    Correct.

    Okay.
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="460.231" stopTime="460.798">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    That is correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="460.798" stopTime="463.516">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It might just be somebody going to the toilet, right?

    It could be. 
    It could very well be.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="465.635" stopTime="475.924">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So, you have to suspect that the reason the toilet is flushing is somebody is trying to get rid of evidence. 
    And in order for that to be the case, you have to have smelled marijuana?

    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Yes. 
    The exigent circumstances is a reasonable belief based upon the totality of the surrounding circumstances. 
    Here, given that the officers had a reasonable belief that they were chasing a fleeing felon, they had a reasonable belief that this was the doorway he had entered, then you couple that with the noises that they heard, they testified were based on their training--

    --and experience.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Mr. Farley, may we just go back over -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far as I understand from this record, it was never shown that the dealer that the police were following was aware that he was following and that he was fleeing from them. 
    I mean, this is the -- it's not part of the question you presented, because we've granted only on the exigent circumstances, but I didn't think that there was -- the dealer wasn't called and he wasn't asked did you even know that the police were following you?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="541.382" stopTime="561.244">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    That -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 
    However -- and -- we cannot divorce the officers' chase of this suspect, regardless of whether he knew of their hot pursuit or not, we cannot divorce those facts from what the officers knew when they knocked on the door.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="561.244" stopTime="579.574">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Sure, you can. 
    There's nothing illegal about walking down the hall and knocking on somebody's door; and if as a police officer you say, but I smell marijuana, and then you hear the flushing, then there's probable cause. 
    You don't need any business about the dealer and the breezeway and all that at all.
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="579.574" stopTime="591.113">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Certainly. 
    Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    You're absolutely correct. 
    I was -- I was just speaking in terms of this case, saying that there were -- there was ample evidence that exigent circumstances existed here, coupled with the probable cause.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="591.113" stopTime="591.882">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    And in your view--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="591.882" stopTime="651.754">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Question -- may I ask a question that goes back to what you said? 
    You have clarified very nicely that there has to be probable cause to think that there's something wrong going on in the -- the apartment; and you said that is, at that point when they -- the marijuana strong smell comes from the door, at that point police could go and get a warrant. 
    Then they don't have to, because then they knocked on the door. 
    We start out with a strong presumption that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, a strong preference for getting the warrant. 
    So why in this situation wouldn't the first response of the police be, instead of knocking -- because once they knock they alert the people in there -- let's get a warrant; we'll come back?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="651.754" stopTime="670.280">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Well, the officers testified under these circumstances that they believed that they were in hot pursuit of this felon. 
    So at the time they were at the door they believed he had entered this apartment and was aware of their presence and was destroying evidence of his deal of crack cocaine, so this is an evolving--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="670.280" stopTime="712.039">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    --Counsel, why was -- how does this holding by us not become a simple warrantless entry in any drug case, meaning police knock on the door, suspect doesn't answer it, gets up and moves to their bedroom? 
    Because there's no noise that was described by this police officer. 
    It was simply not answering the door and moving. 
    So if that's all it takes, any police officer will come in and say: In my experience, most drug dealers destroy the evidence when we knock.

    --Well--

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Aren't we just doing away with Johnson? 
    And aren't we just simply saying they can just walk in whenever they smell marijuana, whenever they think there's drugs on the other side? 
    Why do we even bother giving them a -- a warrant?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="727.432" stopTime="749.776">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --Well, I would disagree with you. 
    I think that when determining whether an exigent circumstance exists, you look at the totality of the circumstances. 
    So -- and there would be a myriad of cases in which a court would determine that, simply based upon the testimony or the noises that were heard, with no surrounding circumstances, that exigent circumstances may not have existed.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="749.776" stopTime="768.504">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What if -- what if the defendants here had not flushed the evidence down but had answered the door and said, "Yes"? 
    Would the policeman have been able to do anything just because they had smelled marijuana?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="768.504" stopTime="772.956">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    They could have sought a consensual encounter with the occupant--

    Oh, yes, but they say: Oh, heck, no, you can't come in; do you have a warrant?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="775.889" stopTime="778.408">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --Then the officers would not have been able to force entry.

    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Well, I don't if I -- I don't know that I would phrase it -- there is no -- there is not a requirement to inform an occupant of a right to denial. 
    However, the officers could not have forced their way into the home. 
    That would have made this a case like Johnson.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, after -- after they've heard the movement inside or the flushing or whatever, you can't just kick it in because you've smelled marijuana.

    They would have to obtain a warrant at that point. 
    If the person came to the door and denied them consent, they would have to obtain a warrant. 
    If the person did not come to the door and made -- no exigency arose, then the officers would still have to go and obtain a warrant.

    I -- Justice Kennedy, I -- I would tend to -- I would tend to agree with you.

    I tend to agree -- disagree with that personally. 
    However, from a legal viewpoint. 
    The simple smell of burning marijuana is not--

    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Well, what occurred in Johnson, I believe, is -- is completely different than what occurred here. 
    What occurred in Johnson was the officers forced their way into the occupant's apartment -- the occupant's hotel room, and then said: Consider yourself under--

    --Well, they did, and they knocked on the door, and she came to the door and they -- they forced their way in. 
    There was no -- there was no "let us in", there was no demand for entry, there was no even ask for consent to enter. 
    They then said: Consider yourself under arrest. 
    They searched, and then held her under arrest based upon the evidence that they obtained.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="941.389" stopTime="950.078">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    You left out one thing. 
    I thought they heard rustling noises before they attempted to get into the apartment -- into the hotel room. 
    There was something about noises.

    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Well, I believe they heard sounds when they knocked on the door.

    Here we don't have that.

    Ms. Ann O'Connell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    If police officers act lawfully in conducting their investigation, they may respond to any exigencies that arise. 
    It is up to police officers to determine how they will collect evidence in any given case as long as they stay within the confines of the Fourth Amendment. 
    Although securing a warrant--

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Could you -- does a ruling in this case that any lawful conduct by the police mean that the police knock, somebody gets up on the other side and walks through a closed door, and closes a door in the back, and police say in my experience it's -- it's consistent with the destruction of property that drug dealers will go into a closed room to get rid of it. 
    Is that enough?

    Ms. Ann O'Connell 
    --I guess some people might do that if they don't want to give consent to police entry. 
    I think that in order to go in based on an exigent circumstance the police would have to be able to articulate to a court that they objectively, reasonably believed that there was destruction of evidence occurring inside.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And what was that here? 
    Because it is kind of vague. 
    They heard movement. 
    What kind -- what kind of movement? 
    It said nothing about a toilet flushing--
speaker="ann_oconnell" startTime="1113.061" stopTime="1165.763">
    Ms. Ann O'Connell 
    Justice Ginsburg, it's our position that the Court should assume that there was an exigency in this case. 
    In the Respondent's brief in opposition, he argued that there was insufficient evidence of exigency. 
    The Court nonetheless granted cert on the question of whether a police-created exigency would be okay under the Fourth Amendment. 
    The Solicitor General believes that the Court should assume there was an exigency, and if it agrees with Kentucky on the question presented and then reverses, it should remand to the Kentucky Supreme Court for a determination of whether an exigency existed. 
    The trial court in this case certainly found that the movement inside of the apartment was enough for the officer to reasonably conclude that somebody inside was destroying evidence. 
    The Kentucky Supreme Court assumed that that was so in order to reach the question presented in this case that the Court granted cert on.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1165.763" stopTime="1224.100">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Ms. O'Connell, if I could ask you about the government's proposed standard: You say that as long as each step in the police conduct is lawful, that's sufficient, and each step would -- the way the Fourth Amendment works, each step, we're asking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable. 
    What some courts have done in addition to that -- and this was not the approach of the court below -- but what some courts have done is to say, we also ask a more holistic reasonableness question. 
    We say: Is the whole process by which the police operated with respect to this person reasonable? 
    So, for example, we might say, you know: Was there time to get a warrant or did it look like the police were just -- they preferred not to have to deal with a magistrate? 
    So what's wrong with that sort of standard? 
    In addition to asking whether each step is reasonable, to say: Look, is the whole pattern here of what the police did to come up with this evidence reasonable?
speaker="ann_oconnell" startTime="1224.100" stopTime="1266.129">
    Ms. Ann O'Connell 
    I think the problem with that test, Justice Kagan, is that police officers have options of how they can conduct searches and seizures. 
    Getting a warrant is one way that they could do that. 
    Getting consent to conduct a search or a seizure is another way. 
    There's no justification in this Court's precedents for requiring police officers to choose one of those options over another if both options are lawful. 
    In this case, the police officers knocked on the door, not sure which apartment the person that they were pursuing fled into, in order to determine whether that was the correct apartment. 
    There's no reason why they needed to get a warrant before knocking on the door and seeking cooperation of the people inside.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1266.129" stopTime="1276.484">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

speaker="ann_oconnell" startTime="1276.484" stopTime="1292.510">
    Ms. Ann O'Connell 
    Yes, I think that under this Court -- the way that this Court has interpreted Fourth Amendment warrant exceptions, as long as there is no violation of the Fourth Amendment, that is okay. 
    The police officers can rely on any ensuing exigency.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1292.510" stopTime="1306.003">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    The -- the question presented in the blue brief used the word "impermissible", and we're talking about unlawful.

    Ms. Ann O'Connell 
    Well, yes, there is a difference. 
    I think that that comes up in Respondent's argument that if there was an impermissible demand for entry -- for example, if the police officer said, I have a warrant, let me in, even though he didn't, as in Bumper v. North Carolina -- that that could still be okay under a lawfulness test as long as the suspect reacted by destroying evidence instead of by coming to the door like in Bumper or Johnson and going about with--

    Ms. Ann O'Connell

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    My point is a solely unlawfulness test would allow the police to get into the habit of just knocking at every door, but if you say that also, it has to survive a bad faith test, where bad faith is objectively, not subjectively, determined, then you will rule out the possibility of the police hatching -- which I don't know if they would, but hatching such a plan.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, there are circuits who have adopted a bad faith test in the alternative with other things than the word "unlawful". 
    The Second Circuit uses only the word "unlawful", and I thought we took this case to iron out that discrepancy.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Miss Drake, the problem I have is there are a lot of constraints on -- on law enforcement, and the one thing that -- that it has going for it is that criminals are stupid. 
    [Laughter] 
    And we had a case some years ago in which the issue was whether the Washington police could enter buses arriving from -- from the south and -- and randomly ask passengers, do you mind if we look in your luggage? 
    And the -- the -- the mules who were carrying marijuana were stupid enough to say: Oh, of course, just to show that they had nothing to fear. 
    And an enormous number of arrests were -- were effected in that fashion. 
    We didn't say that's not fair because you're taking advantage of the -- of the ignorance of these -- these poor criminals. 
    We said that's perfectly okay. 
    And it seems to me the same thing is going on here. 
    These people could have answered the door. 
    There's a policeman knocking on the door. 
    All he's saying is open the door, open the door, say, yes, what do you want? 
    Say, you know, blah, blah, blah. 
    They say, well, get a warrant. 
    Shut the door. 
    They didn't do that. 
    But everything done was perfectly lawful. 
    It's unfair to the criminal? 
    Is that -- is that the problem? 
    I really don't understand the problem.
speaker="jamesa_j_drake" startTime="2056.889" stopTime="2089.360">
    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    I have two responses to Your Honor's question. 
    The first is that -- and along with this notion that criminals are stupid and so that's why we get all these criminal cases, there is no difference between what happened in this case and how an innocent person would respond. 
    Recall Officer Cobb's testimony is simply that after banging he heard movement. 
    Any innocent person at 10:00 at night would have to move in order--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2089.360" stopTime="2131.851">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Could I ask you this? 
    It might -- it might make a difference to me whether the police demanded entry prior to the time when the alleged exigent circumstances arose. 
    And the only testimony on this point that I am aware of is on pages 22 and 23 of the appendix when police banged on the door as loud as they could and announced police, police, police, and then Detective Maynard banged on the door and said this is the police. 
    Now, is there any -- anything more in the record? 
    Any evidence that they, prior to the time when they heard what they allegedly heard, they said open the door?
speaker="jamesa_j_drake" startTime="2131.851" stopTime="2140.957">
    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    --The portion of the Joint Appendix that I quoted to the Court, we explained to them we were going to make entry, appears on page 24.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Right.

    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    So, if Your Honor keeps reading--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2143.557" stopTime="2158.299">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    It starts -- it says we knew that there was possibly something that was going to be destroyed inside the apartment. 
    At that point Detective Maynard -- this is after they heard the sounds, after they claim to have heard the sounds.
speaker="jamesa_j_drake" startTime="2158.299" stopTime="2172.142">
    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    --Yes. 
    Officer Cobb's testimony suggests that the demand came after they heard the sound of movement. 
    The finding by the trial court, however, is that this was all happening simultaneously and in very quick fashion.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2172.142" stopTime="2176.594">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Is there any -- is there any evidence of that?

speaker="jamesa_j_drake" startTime="2176.594" stopTime="2200.059">
    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Officer Cobb's testimony was -- was all the Commonwealth offered. 
    But the chronology of the demand is not dispositive in this case because the demand itself is not dispositive. 
    The demand removes any doubt that the officers were not seeking a consensual encounter, but you still have the behavior of banging on the door.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2200.059" stopTime="2209.498">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, does it -- does it turn on how loudly they knocked? 
    If they just knock on the door and say this is the police, is -- is that -- is there anything wrong with that?
speaker="jamesa_j_drake" startTime="2209.498" stopTime="2232.095">
    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    It -- it -- it depends entirely on whether a reasonable person would interpret that behavior as the officer conveying the impression that entry was imminent and inevitable, and this feeds back to Justice Scalia's question which is, well, what -- what is unreasonable about what the officers did here?
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2232.095" stopTime="2249.889">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    What was there here to make a reasonable person believe that -- that entry was imminent and inevitable, if -- if all that's done is a knock on the door and they say police, police, police, this is the police? 
    Maybe it turns on how loudly they spoke or how loudly they -- they knocked, is that the point?
speaker="jamesa_j_drake" startTime="2249.889" stopTime="2256.960">
    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    That is the point. 
    Those are all relevant criteria because in every Fourth Amendment case we're considering the totality of the circumstances.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2256.960" stopTime="2322.234">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    It seems to me that you're trying to change the case. 
    I mean, this is not a case where they come in and, in effect, demand entry. 
    My understanding is that the issue in the case is whether or not after a request for entry, they can then base probable cause and dispensing with the warrant based on what they hear from behind the door. 
    Now, I know you think whatever they hear is perfectly innocent; but the issue is whenever they knock on the door, "police", or "can we come in" or whatever, and then they hear that -- the activity behind the door, they have reason and can -- can enter. 
    Now, what you're -- it seems to me what you're arguing is well, they did something else. 
    They banged on the door, they yelled police; it wasn't simply knocking on the door and seeking entry. 
    And you may be right, again, on the facts, but it seems to me that's for -- for later on. 
    I want to know what your position is on whether they can assume, at least for me, they knock and say can we come in or knock and say police, no demand to get in.
speaker="jamesa_j_drake" startTime="2322.234" stopTime="2350.102">
    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    If I understand Your Honor's question, the officers are engaging in what we would call a true knock and talk. 
    They're seeking -- they're on -- the scenario is such that no one would doubt they're attempting a consensual encounter. 
    Our position is because that behavior is reasonable, it is not made unreasonable by the fact that evidence may be destroyed, and so suppression would not be the remedy. 
    But again--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2350.102" stopTime="2428.302">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So you agree that -- that the court below is wrong because what they say as I read it is irrespective of how reasonably the police behave, if it is reasonably foreseeable that their tactic will create exigent circumstances -- and I would think it's reasonably foreseeable when you knock on the door very politely and say "the police" that somebody might shout out "hide the pot", all right? 
    That if that's reasonable foreseeable, says the court, then that violates the Fourth Amendment. 
    But we have the Second Circuit that says as long as the police behaved unlawfully -- it -- lawfully, lawfully, it does not violate the Fourth Amendment; and we have the First Circuit that has some kind of bad faith test plus an unreasonable or improper test; and we have the Fourth and Eighth circuits that yet have some different kind of test. 
    And one of the things I would be interested in hearing your view on at some point is just what the Chief Justice said; that assuming from your point of view this is a hypothetical case, nonetheless we would like your view on which of those tests or some other test is the appropriate test and why. 
    That was the question he started with, and Justice Kennedy started with, and I also would be interested in your view on that.
speaker="jamesa_j_drake" startTime="2428.302" stopTime="2473.533">
    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    --The appropriate test is the test that we propose. 
    Under our test, the police act unreasonably when they convey the impression to an -- to a reasonable person that entry is imminent and inevitable. 
    Our test follows directly from the Fourth Amendment requirement that people in their homes deserve precision. 
    By conveying the impression that entry is imminent and inevitable, the police are -- and they don't have judicial authority for doing that; that is, there's no warrant -- they are engaging in behavior that would confuse an ordinary citizen and make him or her uncertain about whether the assertion of right to privacy and security in the home--

    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Well, Ms. Drake if that's the case, in some way you're agreeing with the government. 
    You, too, are saying that -- that there's a lawfulness test.

speaker="jamesa_j_drake" startTime="2484.238" stopTime="2523.430">
    Ms. Jamesa J. Drake 
    --And to the extent that lawful is defined as a synonym for unreasonable, and to the extent that there does not need to be a completed antecedent Fourth Amendment violation, we would agree. 
    There is area of agreement between the Commonwealth and I and it is on the issue of this knock and talk. 
    Of course, police officers need to have the investigative tool of a knock and talk. 
    There's nothing wrong with an officer attempting to gain consensual entry; and our position is that that's not made unreasonable by factors outside the officer's control, no matter how foreseeable.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But I -- you -- you -- you might have considerable support on the Court for the proposition that if the exigent circumstance is created by unlawful activity by the police, which would include conveying the impression that they are about to kick the door in, then -- then you have a different case. 
    But -- but I thought the case we had before us is what if the police officers are behaving perfectly lawfully and they're not threatening to kick down the door, and they smelled the marijuana and then they hear the motion inside, does that justify their going in? 
    And that's what I thought we took the case for, and that's a different question. 
    You're trying to -- you're trying to make the police officers' actions unlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions were unlawful you have a different case, and probably the evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't think we were here to decide that, whether they knocked too loud, whether they threatened to kick in the door. 
    The opinion below says if they created the exigent circumstances whether they did so lawfully or unlawfully, they cannot go in -- and that's, that's the issue.

    That wasn't the basis for the decision below, though.

    In Bumper, this Court made clear that if the police act as though they have a warrant when they don't have one, any consent would be coerced. 
    So reviewing courts are already making these determinations about how loud was the knock and how aggressive was the demand, simply in another context. 
    By the other -- on the other hand, police officers are already receiving the same instruction that they would need in order to apply our rule, which is, don't act as though you have a warrant. 
    Don't engage in the functional equivalent of a knock and announce if you do not have prior judicial authority.

    In that regard, it's no different than any other case that makes its way to this Court where this Court is asked to review the record, make a determination of how an ordinary person would interpret the officers' conduct. 
    It is simply unreasonable and unlawful for purposes of the Fourth Amendment for an officer to convey the impression that he has the authority of a warrant when he doesn't have one. 
    And when that prompts, as it obviously would, an occupant of a home to move, and then that movement is used as evidence that exigent circumstances exist and warrantless search is justified, if this Court were to, you know, adopt the framework the Commonwealth is arguing for, the exception to the warrant requirement would be the rule. 
    So we would ask this Court to affirm the decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court.

   Rebuttal of Joshua D. Farley
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="3247.282" stopTime="3295.765">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    My time is short, so I would like to just make a few quick points. 
    I believe Mr. Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy were absolutely, absolutely correct. 
    The question before this Court is: Can lawful police action impermissibly create exigent circumstances? 
    And the answer to that question is no. 
    There is never a circumstance in which lawful police behavior under a Fourth Amendment analysis can impermissibly create an exigency. 
    I would point the Court to Hodari D., which I believe Justice Scalia wrote for the Court, that we should not punish police officers for attempted Fourth Amendment violations or Fourth Amendment violations that do not reach fruition, because it does not serve the point of the exclusionary rule.

    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Mr. Farley, one of the points of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when people search your home, they have a warrant, and of course there are exceptions to that. 
    But if there is one place where the warrant requirement has real force, it's in the home. 
    And I think that the concern here, and you have some strong arguments on your side, but the concern here is that your test is going to enable the police to penetrate the home, to search the home, without a warrant, without going to see a magistrate, in a very wide variety of cases, that all the police really have to say is: We saw pot, we heard noise. 
    Or: We think there was some criminal activity going on for whatever reason and we heard noise. 
    How do you prevent that from happening? 
    How do you prevent your test from essentially eviscerating the warrant requirement in the context of the one place that the Fourth Amendment was most concerned about?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="3353.183" stopTime="3383.868">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    Well, Justice Kagan, I would disagree with you. 
    I don't think that it would. 
    I believe that what the Commonwealth is asking for is no more or no less than reviewing courts have done for generations. 
    You look to determine whether there was a Fourth Amendment violation, whether there was an unlawful entry, whether there was an unlawful seizure, or whether there was a coercion that then they gained consent for entry. 
    If those things occurred, they are clearly Fourth Amendment violations. 
    There should be a suppression of the evidence. 
    The exigent circumstances--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3383.868" stopTime="3394.657">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It wouldn't technically be a Fourth Amendment violation, would it, if the police gave the impression that they had a warrant and were about to kick in the door? 
    Is that a Fourth Amendment violation in and of itself?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="3394.657" stopTime="3395.740">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --I don't believe so.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3395.740" stopTime="3401.061">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So your -- the -- the unlawfulness test would not prevent that?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="3401.061" stopTime="3403.811">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    No, Justice Scalia, it would not.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3403.811" stopTime="3408.215">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It would not? 
    Oh. 
    Maybe we have to come up with an unreasonable test, then.
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="3408.215" stopTime="3420.206">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    I believe under Hodari D., if the officers demand entry and there has been no response to that demand, there has no -- been no completion of the Fourth Amendment violation. 
    The officers could stand outside the door--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3420.206" stopTime="3425.509">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it'd be okay for officers to do that? 
    Pretend they have a warrant? 
    Open the door or we'll kick it in. 
    That's perfectly okay?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="3425.509" stopTime="3438.684">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --I believe that there are -- there are large restrictions and prohibitions to that, that officers are well aware of, because if the person does answer the door, the officers know, well, everything is going to be suppressed. 
    Or it's--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3438.684" stopTime="3442.652">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why, you say that what they've done is not lawful. 
    Why would it be suppressed?
speaker="joshua_d_farley" startTime="3442.652" stopTime="3455.444">
    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    --Well, if they demand entry and entry is given, that is then a Fourth Amendment violation, because they've demanded entry without a warrant. 
    And in that case, suppression -- once they have entry, the evidence would be suppressed.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3455.444" stopTime="3459.979">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    They can't gain entry by deception. 
    They can't knock on the door and say, pizza, right?

    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    No.

    No? 
    Okay.

    Mr. Joshua D. Farley 
    We would just assert that under the lawfulness test, we aren't asking for anything more or less than this Court has done or other reviewing courts have done for generations, and this is a simple Fourth Amendment analysis. 
    There was no demand in this case. 
    This was a simple knock-and-announce case, regardless of the time of day. 
    There was no coercion. 
    There was no seizure. 
    There was no consent given. 
    Officers should not be held accountable for unlawful reactions by suspects. 
    Thank you.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Thank you, counsel. 
    You will have noticed that Justice Kennedy left the bench a few minutes early. 
    He is going to Tucson to represent the Court as the circuit justice for the Ninth Circuit at the memorial service there. 
    He will review the tapes and transcripts of the rest of the argument and fully participate in the decision. 
    This case is submitted.
