Montana v. Wyoming and North Dakota
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="0.000" stopTime="145.633">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us under our original jurisdiction. 
    With Congress's consent, Montana and Wyoming agreed to the Yellowstone River Pact in 1951. 
    Under this Pact, the States agreed that water rights existing in each State as of 1950 would continue to be enjoyed in accordance with the doctrine of appropriation. 
    In 2008, Montana sued Wyoming alleging that it had breached the Compact in several ways by using more than its agreed upon share of the water. 
    Only one of Montana's allegations is before us today. 
    The claim that by installing more efficient sprinkler irrigation systems, Wyoming water users have reduced their runoff. 
    As a result, less water returns to the river and less water reaches Montana than it did in 1950. 
    Montana claims that Wyoming has therefore violated the Compact. 
    The Special Master reappointed found that Montana's allegations failed to state a claim. 
    Montana filed an exception. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we overrule Montana's exception to the Special Master's Report. 
    The Yellowstone River Compact preserves water rights “in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation”. 
    Under that doctrine, efficient sprinkler, irrigation systems are permissible even if they cause a net increase in water consumption. 
    This is true so long as the sprinkler users do not increase the amount of water they divert from the river or use the conserved water to irrigate new acreage. 
    Accordingly, Montana's allegations that Wyoming has violated the Compact by merely allowing the installation of more efficient sprinkler systems fails to state a claim. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
