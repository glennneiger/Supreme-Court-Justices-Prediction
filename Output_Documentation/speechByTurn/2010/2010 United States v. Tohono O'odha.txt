United States v. Tohono O'odham Nation

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    The -- the Tohono O'odham Nation is an Indian tribe with federal recognition. 
    The Nation's main reservation is in the Sonoran Desert, which is in Southern Arizona. 
    And counting this and other reservation lands, the Nation's land holdings are approximately 3 million acres. 
    The case turned on a relationship between two suits that the Indian Nation filed. 
    First, the Nation sued federal officers in United States District Court for alleged violations of fiduciary duty with respect to tribal assets that the Government holds in trust. 
    Second and on the next day, the Nation sued the United States in the Court of Federal Claims for the same violations. 
    Now, a federal statute, which was enacted in 1868, is designed to limit duplicate suits against the Government. 
    The statute bars jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims over any claim "for or in respect to" which the plaintiff has another suit pending in another court. 
    And so here, the question to be resolved is what it means for two suits to be "for or in respect to" the same claim. 
    In a case called Keene versus United States, this Court held that two suits are “for in respect to” the same claim when they are "based on substantially the same operative facts -- at least if there is some overlap in the relief requested." 
    Keene therefore narrows the permissible constructions of the statute to one of two interpretations, either the statute requires substantial factual and some remedial overlap, or it requires substantial factual overlap without more. 
    The Court opinion today concludes that factual overlap is sufficient to trigger the statute's jurisdictional bar. 
    The text of the statute precludes jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims not only the plaintiff sues on an identical claim elsewhere, that is a suit for the same claim -- but also if the plaintiff's other action is related but not identical, that is a suit "in respect to" the same claim. 
    The meaning of the phrase "in respect to" is not immediately apparent but it does suggest the broad prohibition on redundant lawsuits, and for the reasons the opinion explains, the statutory phrase refers to facts, not remedies. 
    Hence, the statute bars jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims, when the plaintiff has a suit based on substantially the same operative facts, it's pending elsewhere and here, the Nation's two suits involve almost identical operative facts, they relate to the same trust assets, and they describe almost identical alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. 
    The Court of Federal Appeals' action -- the Court of Federal Claims' action must therefore be dismissed. 
    The contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is reversed. 
    Justice Sotomayor has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Breyer joins. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Justice Kagan took no part in consideration or decision of the case.
