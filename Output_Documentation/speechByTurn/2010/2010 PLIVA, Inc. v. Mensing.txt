PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="0.000" stopTime="150.282">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case has come to us on a -- on writs of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals -- Courts of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit. 
    Respondents were prescribed the drug Reglan to treat digestive tract problems. 
    Each received generic Reglan from her pharmacist. 
    After taking the drug for several years, each developed a serious neurological disorder. 
    Respondents then sued the manufacturers of the generic drugs in a state court alleging that the manufacturers failed to provide an adequate warning label. 
    The question presented here is whether Federal Drug Statutes and Regulations conflict with and thus pre-empt these state tort lawsuits. 
    The Fifth and Eighth Circuits found no pre-emption and allowed the lawsuits to proceed. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgments of the Courts of Appeals. 
    The generic manufacturers have demonstrated a conflict between state and federal law. 
    State law requires the manufacturers to change their warning labels but the Federal Drug Regulations prevent them from independently doing so. 
    The manufacturers could potentially have complied with state law but only with the help of the brand name Reglan manufacturer and the special permission and assistance of the Food and Drug Administration, a federal agency. 
    We find that federal law pre-empts the state law, state tort lawsuits here. 
    The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution instructs the federal law -- that federal law is the supreme law of the land, in a state law to the contrary notwithstanding. 
    It would distort the plain text of the Supremacy Clause to find no pre-emption simply because a federal agency has the discretion to resolve an existing conflict between federal and state law on a case by case basis. 
    Justice Kennedy joins all but Part III–B–2 of the opinion. 
    Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg, Breyer and Kagan joined.
