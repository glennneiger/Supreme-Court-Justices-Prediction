Henderson v. Shinseki
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="0.000" stopTime="72.751">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    This case concerns the 120-day time limit for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court. 
    The petitioner in this case, David Henderson was a veteran. 
    He applied for veteran's benefits but those were denied by the Veteran's Administration so he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court but he missed the 120-day deadline by a couple of days. 
    He argued that his late filing should be excused because it was caused by his illness but the Veterans Court held that the 120-day time limit is jurisdictional and can't be relaxed under any circumstances. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. 
    As we explained in an opinion that is filed today, we hold that Congress did not intend that the 120-day time limit be treated as a jurisdictional provision. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings. 
    Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
