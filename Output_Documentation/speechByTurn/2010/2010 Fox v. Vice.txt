    Justice Elena Kagan 
    This case concerns the proper interpretation of a federal fee-shifting statute called Section 1988, which allows the courts to award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party in certain civil rights lawsuits. 
    We have held in prior cases that the defendant may receive attorney's fees under the statute if the suit against him was frivolous. 
    This case asks us to consider what happens when part of the suit but only part of the suit was frivolous. 
    Is the defendant entitled to any fees and if so, how should they be calculated? 
    The case arises out of an election for chief of police in the town of Vinton Louisiana. 
    The challenger Ricky Fox alleged that the incumbent Billy Ray Vice used an assortment of dirty tricks to try to force him out of the race. 
    Vice's various machinations didn't work. 
    Fox won the election and Vice was ultimately convicted of criminal extortion. 
    But Fox, the winner of the election, went on to sue Vice and he asserted both state law claims like defamation and also federal civil rights claims. 
    Vice, the defendant removed the case to federal court on the basis of the federal claims. 
    At the end of discovery, Fox, the plaintiff, admitted that his federal claims were not valid. 
    And the District Court dismissed them, remanding the case to the state court to resolve the remaining state law claims. 
    Vice once again remember the defendant sought attorney's fees under Section 1988 on the grounds that Fox's federal claims had been frivolous. 
    The District Court agreed with that and then granted Vice fees for all the work his attorneys had done on the suit, the entire suit, even though only Fox's federal claims were frivolous and his state law claims had yet to be considered. 
    The Court of Appeals upheld that award. 
    We now reverse. 
    We presume that the federal claims here were frivolous and the state claims were not. 
    And we agree with the courts below that the defendant may receive some fees in a mixed suit like this one where only some of the plaintiff's claims are frivolous. 
    But he is entitled only to the fees he paid because of frivolous claims alone. 
    He is not entitled the fees he would have paid anyway to defend against the nonfrivolous claims. 
    The test can be stated as a 'but for' rule. 
    He is entitled to the fees that he would not have paid but for the frivolous claims. 
    This test comes directly from Congress' purpose in enacting the statute to relieve defendants of the burden associated with fending off frivolous litigation. 
    So if the defendant's attorneys would have done the same work anyway, even if the frivolous claims had not been in the suit then fee-shifting is not allowed. 
    If it were, defendants would be relieved of some of the costs of defending against normal nonfrivolous litigation. 
    And Section 1988 was never intended to give defendants that kind of windfall. 
    The courts below failed to adopt -- failed to apply this 'but for' test. 
    Fox's suit involved frivolous federal claims and nonfrivolous state law claims, but all of them were closely related arising out of Vice's conduct in the campaign and requiring proof of the same basic facts. 
    So even if Fox have filed only his state law claims, the nonfrivolous ones, it is likely that Vice's attorneys would have done much the same work, would have taken the same depositions, review the same documents and so on. 
    And if that is so, Vice is not entitled to fees for that work. 
    Because the courts below failed to analyze the issue in this way, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case for application of the proper standard. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous.
