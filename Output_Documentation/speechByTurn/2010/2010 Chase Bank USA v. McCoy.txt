    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Regulation Z, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to its authority under the Truth in Lending Act, requires issuers of credit cards to disclose certain information to cardholders. 
    The version of Regulation Z, applicable in this case, requires that insurers provide cardholders with an “initial disclosure statement”, specifying “each periodic rate” associated with the account. 
    The regulation also imposes “subsequent disclosure requirements” including giving to cardholders notice when any term required to be initially disclosed is changed. 
    The cardholder agreement between petitioner, Chase Bank and respondent James McCoy, authorized Chase to raise McCoy's interest rate up to a preset maximum, in the event that McCoy was delinquent or in default. 
    This case presents the question, whether Regulation Z required Chase to notify McCoy of an increase it imposed within the range specified in the agreement following such delinquency or default. 
    We conclude that it did not. 
    We find that the text of Regulation Z is ambiguous with respect to the key question, whether an interest rate increase instituted pursue -- pursuant to a previously disclosed contractual provision is a change in term requiring notice. 
    Because the regular -- regulatory text is unclear, we look to the Board's own interpretation of the regulation for guidance. 
    Under our precedent in Auer versus Robbins, we deferred to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations advanced in a legal brief, unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. 
    In its amicus brief to this Court, the Board states that in its view, the version of Regulation Z, applicable in this case, does not require notice. 
    The interest rate increase at issue did not change the term of the agreement. 
    It's simply implemented a term previously disclosed. 
    This interpretation is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulation, and we have no reason to suspect that it does not reflect the Board's fair and considered judgment on the matter. 
    Accordingly, this interpretation is authoritative under Auer and we need look no further. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.
