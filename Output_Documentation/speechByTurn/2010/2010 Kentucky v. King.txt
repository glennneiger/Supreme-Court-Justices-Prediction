speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="0.000" stopTime="154.279">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Justice Alito has the opinion of the Court this morning in Case 09-1272, Kentucky versus King. 
    He has asked that I announce it for him. 
    This case comes to us on the writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky. 
    In this case, police officers smelled marijuana outside an apartment door, knocked loudly, and announced their presence. 
    As soon as the officers began knocking, they heard noises that, in their view, indicated that the occupants were destroying drug-related evidence. 
    The officers entered the apartment without a warrant to prevent the destruction of evidence. 
    Respondent was convicted of drug-related offenses based on evidence that the officers found inside the apartment. 
    Now, it is well-established that the rule of exigent circumstances which includes the need to prevent destruction of evidence is an exception to the warrant requirement. 
    We do not decide whether exigent circumstances actually existed in this case. 
    We, like the Kentucky Supreme Court, assume that there was an exigency. 
    The question before us concerns an exception to the exigent circumstances rule that has been developed by lower courts. 
    Lower courts have held that when police create an exigency, the search is unconstitutional, even though an exigency existed. 
    This is known as the "police-created exigency" doctrine. 
    The Kentucky Supreme Court applied the police-created exigency doctrine in this case, overturning respondent's conviction. 
    Assuming there was an exigency, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances rule could not justify the search because the police should have foreseen that their conduct would prompt the occupants to destroy evidence. 
    In short, the Court held that the police had impermissibly created the exigency. 
    For the reason stated in our opinion, we reject this interpretation of the exigent circumstances rule. 
    The conduct of the police, prior to their entry into the apartment, was entirely lawful. 
    They banged on the door and announced their presence. 
    They did not violate the Fourth Amendment, nor did they threaten to violate the Fourth Amendment. 
    Under these circumstances, the officers' warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence was reasonable. 
    We therefore reverse the judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting Opinion.
