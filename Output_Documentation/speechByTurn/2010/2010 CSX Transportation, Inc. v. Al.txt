    Justice Elena Kagan 
    In 1976, Congress enacted the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act, sometimes called the “4R Act,” to restore the financial stability of railroads. 
    A provision of the Act prohibits state governments from discriminating against railroads through their tax systems. 
    The provision contains four separate prohibitions. 
    The first three are directed at discriminatory property taxes. 
    The fourth is the one at issue in this case. 
    It prohibits states from imposing “Another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.” 
    This case involves a challenge that's brought by a railroad, CSX to an Alabama tax. 
    The tax is a 4% sales and use tax. 
    Railroads pay this tax whenever they purchase or consume diesel fuel, which of course they do a lot of. 
    But railroads' main competitors, motor carriers, trucks and water carriers, ships, those competitors are exempt from the tax. 
    What CSX said in this suit was that, Alabama sales and use tax was another tax that discriminated against railroads because railroads had to pay the tax, while these other entities, their competitors did not have to pay it. 
    But the Eleventh Circuit dismissed CSX's suit. 
    It said that the statute did not allow railroads to challenge the tax on the theory that the tax exempted other entities, and in reaching that decision, it relied on the prior decision of this Court called, ACF Industries. 
    We held in ACF that a railroad could not challenge a property tax based on the tax exemptions. 
    The Eleventh Circuit thought the same rule should apply to non-property taxes like the one in this case. 
    Today, we reversed the Eleventh Circuit. 
    We hold that a railroad can challenge a non-property tax like this one, on the ground that the tax contains exemptions. 
    We rely on the plain language of the prohibition, again, another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier. 
    First, a sales and use tax is another tax. 
    The meaning of that phrase is very broad. 
    There are lots of different kinds of taxes in the world as all of you taxpayers know, and this provision includes all of those taxes. 
    Second, a tax that contains exemptions can discriminate within the meaning of the statute. 
    Simply put, discrimination is the failure to treat people in the same way without a good reason. 
    So if one person has to pay a 4% tax and another identically situated person has to pay 2% tax, that's discrimination. 
    And the same is true if the first person has to pay a 4% tax and the second person pays 0%, nothing, which is of course what an exemption is. 
    That's also discrimination, it's even worse discrimination. 
    So with sales and use tax that contains exemptions can be challenged as discriminatory under the statute. 
    Now, all of this would be easy. 
    It would be obvious except for the case of the Eleventh Circuit relied on ACF Industries. 
    In that case, you'll recall, we held that a railroad could not challenge a property tax as discriminatory based on the tax exemptions. 
    So a very considerable part of this opinion is devoted to explain why a different rule should apply for non-property taxes. 
    And I won't say very much about that, it's -- it's complicated but it comes down to this. 
    The Congress drafted a set of provisions that concerned property taxes alone. 
    And those provisions, for whatever reason, prevent property tax exemptions from being viewed as discriminatory under the statute. 
    But those provisions have nothing to say about non-property taxes and so, we can hold and today we do hold that the sales and use tax, unlike a property tax, might discriminate because of its exemptions. 
    But one last point, we do not decide today whether Alabama's tax in fact discriminates against CSX and other railroads because it exempts their competitors. 
    Alabama might, well have a sufficient reason to make that distinction and that is a matter for the trial court on remand. 
    Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joins.
