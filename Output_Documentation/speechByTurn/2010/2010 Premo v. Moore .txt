    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-658, Premo v. Moore. 
    Mr. Kroger.
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="14.117" stopTime="65.286">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The court of appeals held that Arizona v. Fulminante was the clearly established Federal law to control and govern the outcome of this case. 
    This was an error, because this Court has never applied Fulminante's direct appeal harmless error standard, which places the burden of proof on the government, to a collateral ineffective assistance of counsel claim, where the burden of proof is on the inmate. 
    In Boyer, unlike Fulminante, there is no trial transcript to review because the defendant pleaded no contest or guilty before trial. 
    The court of appeals' decision conflicts with both Strickland v. Washington and Hill v. Lockhart and will have grave negative consequences for our criminal justice system.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="65.286" stopTime="89.541">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But isn't -- isn't Fulminante relevant as -- just for the proposition that a defendant's own confession carries heavy weight, leaving the rest of it -- the statement that -- in Fulminante that when a defendant confesses to the crime, that carries heavy weight?
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="89.541" stopTime="128.742">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    Yes, Your Honor, I think it's relevant to that extent, that a confession from a defendant is significant evidence. 
    However, it certainly does not imply, as the court of appeals proceeded to do here, that it controls the prejudice prong of Strickland, that it sets a new standard of review of harmlessness, that it shifts the burden of proof onto the government, or that it limits the prejudice analysis to that question of the potential impact of the confession at trial. 
    And so for all those reasons, I -- I think the -- the court of appeals has gone well beyond any potential relevance of the Fulminante decision.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="128.742" stopTime="161.573">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Is it -- if I am understanding your argument, it is that the Court erred in assuming that if the confession had been suppressed -- which you're not arguing for or against. 
    I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position that we have to get to the question of what would have happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a defendant should never plead guilty. 
    You are saying that that conclusion is what the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong?
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="161.573" stopTime="180.364">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    Your Honor, we're -- we are suggesting that the court was wrong both in stating Fulminante provided the standard of review, as well as holding that you can, in effect, assume prejudice simply because defense counsel failed to file a motion which defense counsel believed was not--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="180.364" stopTime="186.564">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    So it's another way of saying what I said, which is, no defendant should plead guilty if it's a suppressible confession?
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="186.564" stopTime="188.171">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    --That is correct, Your Honor. 
    That is correct, Your Honor.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="188.171" stopTime="201.838">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    All right. 
    So now, what is the other information that would have made a plain guilty in this case inevitable? 
    However, that's a higher standard than you need to meet, but--
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="201.838" stopTime="249.909">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    As -- as Your Honor noted, that is a much higher standard than we have to meet under Hill v. Lockhart. 
    There were very good reasons why defense counsel's advice to this defendant plead guilty was sound and reasonable advice. 
    First of all, the defendant faced a very strong government case, even at that stage of the investigation. 
    Second, there was a potential charge of aggravated murder that could be brought if the case were taken to the grand jury. 
    Third, the plea offer that was extended to the defendant and which the defendant took was very favorable to the defendant, both in terms of -- of capping the amount of time that the defendant would serve, as well as dismissing two additional mandatory minimum charges of assault and kidnapping. 
    So--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="249.909" stopTime="254.701">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    --Were those higher than the minimum he pled to? 
    Were those mandatory minimums higher?
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="254.701" stopTime="457.024">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    --No, Your Honor, but they could have been run consecutive rather than concurrent. 
    I -- I think more significant is the fact that when the defendant himself testified about the reasons he pled guilty, none of the reasons he provided had anything to do with the strength of the government's case or the failure of counsel to file the motion. 
    What the defendant said motivated his guilty plea was a concern about an aggravated murder charge, a desire not to have to testify against his brother, which he believed would be the outcome of a guilty plea. 
    And those factors were in the defendant's mind when he decided to take the guilty plea. 
    So in this case, even if one were to shift the burden onto the government -- and I do not believe that -- that that is consistent with Strickland -- the government would prevail here. 
    This case raises, I think, significant consequences for application of Strickland and Hill v. Lockhart. 
    Strickland and Hill clearly place the burden of proof in a collateral proceeding on the inmate. 
    The court of appeals here shifted the burden of proof, pursuant to Fulminante, onto the government. 
    One can see this in the petition appendix at page 48 where the court states that there is not enough evidence in the record to prove that the defendant would have pled guilty had the confession been denied. 
    As I stated to Justice Sotomayor, I believe the government actually could meet that burden, but that is certainly not the burden that either Strickland or -- or Hill requires. 
    Second, the Court's application of Fulminante transforms the Hill v. Lockhart analysis. 
    It narrows it to one degree, because it's focused on one issue, what the government's evidence would be at trial, rather than looking at the broad array of issues which might motivate a defendant to plead guilty which the courts will look at under -- under Hill v. Lockhart. 
    For example, under Hill v. Lockhart the court will not only look at the defendant's testimony with respect to the estimate of the strength of the government's case, but also look at the potential for an additional sentence that is higher or additional charges that carry a higher sentence if the defendant proceeds with litigation rather than pleading guilty. 
    It will look at the investigation risk that additional evidence would be found in, if the case continued rather than terminating in an early plea. 
    And it will look at personal factors as the ones that were evident in this case that might motivate a guilty plea. 
    For those reasons, the Hill v. Lockhart standard encompasses a broader array of factors in determining whether there is prejudice than a simple application of Fulminante's direct appeal post-trial standards. 
    It is also the case that the application of Fulminante will substantially increase the amount of speculation which courts have to engage in compared with applying the proper Hill v. Lockhart test. 
    Hill v. Lockhart limits the amount of speculation by focusing on the defendant's motive in pleading guilty and whether the ineffective assistance could have influenced that decision to plead guilty.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="457.024" stopTime="489.105">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    What about Judge Berzon's test, that seems to be simple and a matter of common sense, that if you get rid of the confession, then you have a better chance of getting a good deal in the plea bargain? 
    The confession certainly -- it -- this serves the defendant to get rid of that as well as weight on the prosecution's side.
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="489.105" stopTime="572.084">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    Your Honor, I would say two things: First, the test which is proposed by Judge Berzon in the concurrence has never been recognized or promulgated by this Court. 
    So in a collateral proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S. Code 2254, it would not be clearly established law that the State court was required to follow. 
    And second, application of that standard, as Judge Bybee noted in his concurrence, would require an immense amount of speculation. 
    In this case, the majority in the Ninth Circuit hypothesized that filing the motion to suppress the confession would strengthen the defendant's position in negotiation vis-a-vis the Government. 
    It is also very possible, however, that the Government would respond to filing a motion as opposed to taking an early offer of guilty plea by taking the case to the grand jury, seeking an aggravated murder charge, and thus, putting the defendant in a worse position in the case. 
    And, in fact, as Judge Bybee noted, he questioned whether the courts have the proper tools to be able to speculate years after the guilty plea whether a particular motion may have increased or may have decreased the amount of leverage that a defendant has, or what kind of response that that motion might have drawn from the prosecution.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But you have to, don't you? 
    I mean, what's the alternative? 
    I mean, imagine a case where it's clear there was a malpractice or an inadequate assistance, and it happened a long time ago and now you have to decide, well, was it prejudicial or not? 
    It's prejudicial if in the absence of that he would have gone to trial or wouldn't have pleaded guilty, or -- and what's the alternative to trying to figure out whether that's so?

    Your Honor--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It can't be the State always wins and it can't be the defendant always wins. 
    So -- so what's the alternative?
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="603.561" stopTime="628.252">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    --I think the alternative, Your Honor, is application of Hill v. Lockhart, which looks not at speculation about how this could or could not have affected the plea bargaining process, but looks very concretely at the defendant's pretrial decision-making process and examines the record to determine why the defendant pled guilty and whether they can prove with a reasonable probability that he would not have pled guilty--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="628.252" stopTime="639.264">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Oh, but that is -- isn't that -- sorry, maybe we are just quibbling. 
    I -- I don't quite see it. 
    That would seem to me to be going into the plea bargaining process. 
    Would he have pleaded guilty, what would have happened?
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="639.264" stopTime="703.939">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    --I -- I think the difference, Your Honor, is that when you are applying Hill v. Lockhart, you almost always have at least three very concrete pieces evidence to show the defendant's state of mind. 
    You have the defendant's own testimony or deposition, or in this case both. 
    You have the trial counsel's affidavit for testimony about the decision-making process his client engaged in, and then you have the guilty plea colloquy itself. 
    So you always have a -- a concrete record that the court years later can review in order to determine what motivated the -- the decision to plead guilty. 
    If one were applying Judge Berzon's proposed alternative prejudice finding, one would have to engage in a great deal of speculation. 
    One would, I presume, have defense counsel and the government make claims about what they might have done in response to hypotheticals, which does not seem to be a -- a -- a reasonably judicable standard. 
    As a--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="703.939" stopTime="729.243">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Without any confession -- forget about the brother or the girlfriend -- assume that there had been no confession, wouldn't it have been a fair conclusion to draw that without any confession whatsoever that the plea bargaining strength of the defendant in this case would have been appreciably higher and that the prosecutor would have had to offer something--
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="729.243" stopTime="732.335">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    --Your Honor, if none of -- none of the three confessions--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="732.335" stopTime="745.731">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    --None of the three-- 
    MR. KROGER -- had been made. 
    --whatsoever. 
    I mean, if the brother's confession -- or the confession to the brother is a very big piece of why a plea would have been reasonable in this case. 
    Let's assume no confession.
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="745.731" stopTime="832.601">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    --Your Honor, I still think taking, recommending a guilty plea and taking of a guilty plea would be a rational response to the remaining evidence. 
    Even at this early stage in the proceeding, the police had uncovered certainly the body with the direct shot to the temple. 
    It had recovered the -- the murder weapon. 
    It had recovered the car which the defendants had borrowed and which had blood in the trunk where the victim had been locked and transported. 
    They had four witnesses who were present when the plan to kidnap and assault the victim was hatched. 
    So they would have testified very directly about the forming of the plot. 
    There was an eyewitness who identified the defendant, Mr. Moore, at the trailer where the victim was abducted. 
    And then, of course, there was a co-conspirator, Mr. Salyer, who was cooperating with the Government prior to the confession and whose -- whose cooperation was known to the defendant. 
    So, with all of those pieces, even if one stripped the three confessions out of the case, you would still have a situation where the Government 's case was strong, where there was a very severe risk the Government would go to the grand jury and obtain an aggravated murder charge, and where there was significant advantages to pleading early and locking in a lower sentence to a felony murder charge.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="832.601" stopTime="863.855">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Kroger, from -- General Kroger -- from everything you said, and I take it -- from your brief, too, that you are not urging the -- that -- that counsel's assistance was adequate? 
    You are not contesting that the confession was involuntary? 
    You seem to be putting everything on the prejudice issue; is that right?
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="863.855" stopTime="1005.625">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    No, Your Honor. 
    We -- we concede and forfeited the issue that the -- the motion to suppress would have been meritorious, but believed the district court got it right when it held that on both prongs of Strickland, both on deficient performance and on prejudice, the defendant has failed to make his -- his -- meet his burden of proof. 
    I think the -- the prejudice argument here is extraordinarily strong, but I think the deficient performance, even if one concedes that the motion would have been meritorious, the deficient performance prong is strong as well, because the defendant can't meet his burden of proof that defense counsel's representation was unreasonable, given the strength of the government's case, given the quality of the plea offer that was made, and given the defendant's own reasoning for why he pled guilty. 
    The case has significant practical consequences for the criminal justice system. 
    One is that if the Ninth Circuit's opinion stands, it will be much easier to challenge guilty pleas years after the fact on collateral challenge, and this will undercut the principle of finality. 
    One would certainly expect to see fewer Government plea offers in cases like this, if the Government believed years later it would have to present all of its trial evidence in a collateral proceeding in order to rebut the presumption under Fulminante that there was prejudice. 
    Second, it has severe implications for the freedom of defense counsel to exercise its discretion and represent its client using the wide latitude that Strickland recognized was necessary. 
    Strickland itself stated that it's a mistake to hem in defense counsel with strict rules about what should or should not be done, because defense counsel needs that wide latitude. 
    If there is a -- a virtual presumption that motions to suppress must be filed, even where defense counsel reasonably believes it will not resound to the advantage of his client and may cost the client a chance to plea early, the defense counsel must take that option, it's a severe restriction on the--

    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    --Your Honor, if he had gone to trial on the charges that were pending, and these -- these were not charges from the grand jury, he would have faced at least the mandatory minimum of 25 years that he pled guilty to, plus the potential of additional -- an additional sentence both on that charge perhaps as high as life, given the two other potential mandatory minimum sentences of -- of kidnapping and assault that could be brought.

    Mr. John R. Kroger

    So--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1048.235" stopTime="1051.077">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It could have gone to the grand jury. 
    Then what is the maximum he could have gotten?
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="1051.077" stopTime="1092.233">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    --It could have been a capital case, Your Honor. 
    This could have been an aggravated murder case because the facts involved a very severe beating to the extent perhaps of torture where a Defendant who was very vulnerable who had a protruding hernia that was in a truss was savagely beaten, his nose was broken, he was locked in the trunk of the car, taken to a remote location and shot in the temple with one shot of a revolver. 
    It is distinctly possible that the state would have come from the Grand Jury as a capital case and at the very least have been an aggravated murder carrying a life sentence, not a 25-year sentence.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1092.233" stopTime="1121.172">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    What about his argument that his failure -- the Defendant in the case arising out of this episode, if Salyer did go to trial and he ended up getting that exact same sentence that this Defendant did?
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="1121.172" stopTime="1197.531">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Salyer did receive the same sentence after he went to trial. 
    His case, though, was very different from that of the Petitioner, because the Petitioner was the individual who cocked the pistol and fired the round into the head of the victim killing him. 
    And so it is very unlikely that the other two co-conspirators would have found themselves charged with an intentional murder based on the facts of this case. 
    But because this pistol could only be fired if it were cocked and because the round went into the temple, it would have been a reasonably strong aggravated murder case against this Defendant who was the triggerman. 
    The final point I would like to make to the Court is that this case involves or should involve significant deference to the State court decision. 
    This was not a summary denial by the State court. 
    The State court held a hearing at which it received all testimony that was available. 
    It made very explicit findings of fact about the facts in the case. 
    It made a credibility finding about the evidence that had been submitted by the Petitioner, and it ruled after citing the proper Strickland standard that the Defendant had failed to carry his burden of proof.

speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="1223.456" stopTime="1311.172">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    --Your Honor, I would say two things with respect to that. 
    First of all, the State court's decision, even if it were incorrect in its ruling that the confession would not have been admissible, the State court's conclusion that the motion would not have assisted the Defendant in any way, the finding that it would have been fruitless because of the other confessions, the other two confessions in the case, is a reasonable decision that the Court made and is dispositive and thus under AEDPA should receive deference. 
    I would also suggest the case is somewhat similar to Yarborough v. Alvarado. 
    There was a custody issue at stake and this Court explicitly held that one might come out one way or the other on the custody issue, that reasonable jurists might split, but that that fact alone rendered the State court's opinion on voluntariness or on custody in that issue as reasonable. 
    And again, as here, though we are not asserting that this confession was admissible, should the Court consider it, it's clearly a close question on voluntariness and somewhat factually similar to Yarborough where even if the State court were was wrong, it was still a reasonable adjudication of the claims. 
    If there were no further questions from the Court, Your Honor, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Steven T. Wax 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Mr. Moore established prejudice under Hill from his attorney's failure to recognize the involuntariness and inadmissibility of the lengthy tape recorded statement obtained from him by the police. 
    The most critical type of evidence that the State can have in any case. 
    The Ninth Circuit's conclusion to that effect was correct, and was correctly based on this Court's precedence of Strickland, Hill, and Kimmelman.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="1351.480" stopTime="1407.548">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    I am having a little bit of trouble here with your argument for the following reasons. 
    Assume we suppress the confession. 
    Why is it unreasonable for the defense attorney to have concluded that the evidence showing your client's presence at the shooting, and identification as the shooter, that it was solely that he should have gone to trial on a defense that he wasn't involved in the shooting at all. 
    Once you put him in this shooting, then the only issue he seems to be confused about is that he thinks that because it was accidental that that presents a defense to felony murder. 
    And that's clearly an erroneous position on his part. 
    So what made the case so weak that the Government was never going without the confession to prove felony murder?
speaker="steven_t_wax" startTime="1407.548" stopTime="1444.114">
    Mr. Steven T. Wax 
    Well, Your Honor, we believe that the case is not as the State would have it, a strong case in the absence of this confession. 
    We also believe that the proper focus is not solely on the strength of the State's case, and that under Hill it is necessary to look at the totality of the circumstances, and look for the objective factors in this record that inform the decision of what Mr. Moore would have done or would have been likely to have done in the absence of his counsel's mistakes.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    What does your office do in this situation, all right, a client is indicted in Federal court and you anticipate that there are all sorts of motions that you might make if this case is going to trial, but at an early point the prosecution offers you what looks like a really good plea bargain. 
    Now do you litigate all those motions? 
    If you have, you know, you have a chance of winning, of suppressing some statements that your client made, suppressing physical evidence, getting certain evidence excluded with a motion in limine, maybe you could win on a severance motion, do you think you litigate all those rather than grabbing a good plea deal when it's offered to you?

    And the issue here is not as we have attempted to articulate in our brief solely and in the abstract the failure to file the motion. 
    The problem is that Mr. Moore's attorney did not understand that the statement was suppressible. 
    In the situation that you are putting to me, if I or an assistant in my office says to a client, look, there is a strong motion to suppress the confession, the drugs, what have you, but here are other factors that we should look at.

    Mr. Steven T. Wax 
    --Your Honor, I cannot point in the record to a motive. 
    What I can point to is the fact that there is in the record his self-description of himself as the golden boy for the police, his working with the same detective who interrogated his brother years before when he completely avoided a murder charge. 
    And as a defense attorney, in a case involving a group of men who are not necessarily as socialized and well educated as some other group, that his testimony would have been subject to impeachment.

    Okay. 
    I've got on the other -- I've got -- the other reason I asked the question, to be clear about it, is that -- is that he wouldn't have gone to trial in my mind unless he had a pretty good chance of getting a better deal.

    And what he got was the minimum. 
    Okay? 
    One thing I've written down is that the State would not have the confession.

    Mr. Steven T. Wax 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    What we have in this record is highly unusual combination of four facts appearing at three different stages in the proceeding. 
    First, from his attorney, who articulated this in the sentencing -- it's in the supplemental appendix at page 7: Mr. Moore had a very difficult time accepting the fact that this was a felony murder charge, or a felony murder offer. 
    That leads directly to the fact that Mr. Moore did not plead guilty. 
    This is only a nolo plea. 
    And while in some circumstances the court will equate a nolo plea with a plea of guilty, in these circumstances the fact that he entered a nolo plea only is highly significant on the question of whether or not he would have rolled the dice.

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    And a competent -- and a competent counsel is supposed to accept their irrational client, who doesn't want to understand the law, and let him risk getting an aggravated felony charge brought against him, or a capital murder charge brought against him, and not -- and just go ahead? 
    And try the case because he's not going to recommend to the client, go to trial, take the plea, because you're irrational?

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    That's really what you are saying, that a competent attorney would not recommend to his client take the plea, and that his client wouldn't ultimately accept the plea, because the objective reality is his upside horrible and his downside is almost a given.

    Mr. Steven T. Wax 
    --Your Honor, a competent counsel might advise his counsel to accept a plea. 
    The question of the irrational client is however one with which I regrettably deal on a regular basis. 
    Clients do not always accept my advice, and for whatever it is worth in the footnote toward the end of his opinion, Judge Reinhardt responds to Judge Bybee by saying: Look, he may not be better off by pursuing this habeas corpus action; it is, however, his choice.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2150.694" stopTime="2177.605">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, but Judge Reinhardt and the court of appeals did not in fact apply the test of Hill, which you are asserting. 
    The test is whether he would have gone to trial. 
    I -- I didn't read the opinion as ever saying that he would have gone to trial. 
    The opinion says he could have gotten a better deal. 
    That's quite a different -- quite a different question, and I -- I'm not prepared to make that the test.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

speaker="steven_t_wax" startTime="2210.469" stopTime="2265.616">
    Mr. Steven T. Wax 
    There is -- there is no direct statement to that effect. 
    In all the cases where we have found where there is such a direct statement, the courts almost always discount them. 
    What we have here, we submit, is something more significant, and that is he did not want to enter a plea. 
    He did not enter a plea, and then at the first opportunity that he learned that his attorney had been ineffective, he moved to undo the conviction. 
    And we submit that the decision in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, in which this Court found it highly significant that Flores-Ortega moved to initiate an appeal at the first opportunity that he learned that the appeal had been lost, is applicable here. 
    That is an objective fact that this Court has found relevant -- and--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2265.616" stopTime="2302.303">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    That is an irrelevant question. 
    I don't see how we could go back to a possibly irrational state of mind. 
    I mean, don't -- when you're trying to figure out what a defendant would have done in the absence of an error in respect to a plea, don't you have to ask a question: What would a rational person have done. 
    I mean, I would say that's a good question. 
    I don't know the answer, but if we are trying to figure out he might have been totally irrational and would have gone to trial even though he was likely to end up in jail for life as opposed to 25 years, we should then reverse it and give him a trial?

    Your Honor, what Mr. Moore has said is: I enter this plea on the advice of my attorney. 
    That advice is conceded by the State to have been incorrect, and the full record of the case includes that plea petition document. 
    It includes the State's concession that the advice provided was incorrect.

    Mr. Steven T. Wax 
    --Yes, sir. 
    And I believe it is also consistent with the statement of the judge at the sentencing, who described this as a case involving two tragedies. 
    Everyone who participated -- the lawyers for the defendants, the prosecutor, and the judge -- recognized this was an accident. 
    This was a tragedy. 
    The judge saying, Mr. Moore, the person who had led a good, law-abiding life, a person who had been a productive member of--

    I have to say, I think that's a very aggressive reading of what was said here. 
    It was not necessary for the plea to this offense to prove an intent to kill, and the statement that the intent that was necessary, which is lesser intent but sufficient to support this plea, was present is not a statement that a greater mens rea was absent. 
    And I thought you argued to us that the prosecutor said this was not intentional. 
    It was an accident.

    Mr. Steven T. Wax 
    --Well, I believe, Your Honor, that is the portion to the record to which I am referring at page 228. 
    He also described at the sentencing the facts of the case as facts involving and consistent with the slip and the fall. 
    His description of the incident is a description of Mr. Rogers falling back into the gun. 
    He did that both at the plea, which I believe is on page 227, and he did it again at the sentencing. 
    And then he is followed by the judge, who articulates the circumstances of this case as involving two tragedies: To be sure, the death of Mr. Rogers, but also the tragedy of Mr. Moore having accidentally killed his friend. 
    If there are no further questions, I thank the Court.

   Rebuttal of John R. Kroger
speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="2878.277" stopTime="2917.573">
    Mr. John R. Kroger 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Court of Appeals here did not apply clearly established Federal law, but applied, for the first time in a way that is non-mandated by the decisions of this Court, Fulminante to a collateral proceeding. 
    The State court's adjudication of this claim was eminently reasonable on both prongs of Strickland. 
    Accordingly, we would ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and to affirm the judgment of the district court. 
    I would be happy to answer any additional questions that the Court may have.

    Counsel, the case is submitted.
