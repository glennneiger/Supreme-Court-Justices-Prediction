    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    And Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning in Case 10-188, Schindler Elevator Corporation versus the United States ex rel. Kirk and he's asked me to announce that for him. 
    The case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    The False Claims Act prohibits submitting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States and authorizes what are known as qui tam suits in which private parties brings civil actions in the government's name. 
    The Act's public disclosure bar however generally forecloses this qui tam suits that are, “Based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in among other things an administrative report hearing, audit or investigation.” 
    Respondent Daniel Kirk brought one of this qui tam suits against his former employer, petitioner Schindler Elevator Corporation. 
    He alleged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false claims for payments under its federal contracts. 
    Kirk supported his allegations with information his wife had received from the Department of Labor in response to three requests for records she had filed under the Freedom of Information Act or FOIA for short. 
    The District Court granted Schindler's motion to dismiss concluding that the public disclosure bar foreclosed those aspects of Kirk's lawsuit that were based on information disclosed in the FOIA responses. 
    The Second Circuit vacated and remanded allowing Kirk's lawsuit to proceed. 
    In its view the Department of Labor's responses to the FOIA requests were neither administrative reports nor investigations for purposes of the public disclosure bar. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    The Department of Labor's three written FOIA responses in this case along with the accompanying records are reports within the ordinary meaning of the word, a report is something that gives information or a notification or an official or formal statement of facts or proceedings. 
    A written FOIA response falls within that ordinary meaning and any records produced with such responses are part of the responses just as if they've been produced as an appendix to a printed report. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justices Breyer and Sotomayor joined. 
    Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision in this case.
