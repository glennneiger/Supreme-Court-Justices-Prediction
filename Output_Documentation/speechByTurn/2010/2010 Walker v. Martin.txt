    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    This case concerns California's time limitation on applications for postconviction relief. 
    The question presented: â€œDoes California's requirement that habeas corpus petitions be filed as promptly as possible qualify as an independent State ground for denying relief adequate to bar a subsequent application for the same relief in federal court? 
    Unlike most states, California does not employ fixed statutory deadlines to determine the timeliness of a state prisoner's petition for habeas corpus. 
    Instead, California directs petitioners to file known claims without substantial delay. 
    Petitioners are further instructed to state when they first learned of the claims they are asserting and to explain why they did not advance those claims sooner. 
    Claims not presented as promptly as the circumstances allow may be denied as untimely. 
    California courts signal that a habeas petition is denied as time barred by citing the California Supreme Court's controlling decisions, In re Clark and In re Robbins. 
    But denial of a petition for undue delay is a may, not a must. 
    A California court has discretion to pass over the question whether a petition was filed too late and simply deny the petition for want of merit. 
    Petitioner below, respondent here, Charles W. Martin presented claims for postconviction relief, allegations that his counsel had provided ineffective assistance in a habeas petition filed in the California Supreme Court, nearly five years after his conviction became final. 
    Habeas petitioners in California can file directly in the Supreme Court. 
    They need not climb up the judicial ladder to get there. 
    Martin gave no reason for the long delay in asserting the ineffective assistance claims. 
    Citing Clark and Robbins, the court denied Martin's petition. 
    In turn, the Federal District Court dismissed Martin's Federal habeas petition raising the same claims. 
    Denial of Martin's state court petition as untimely the District Court held rested on an adequate and independent state procedural ground. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.Contrasting the precision -- precision of fixed statutory deadlines, for example one year but California's no substantial delay formulation a Federal Appeals Court held that California's standard lacked the clarity and certainty necessary to constitute an adequate state bar. 
    We reversed that judgment. 
    In a 2009 decision, Beard -- Beard against Kindler, this Court clarified that a state procedural bar may qualify as an adequate and independent state ground for denying a federal habeas petition even if the state court had discretion to omit ruling on the procedural barrier and instead ruled on the merits. 
    Guided by that decision, we hold that California is not put to the choice of imposing a specific deadline for habeas petitions which would almost certainly rule out Martin's nearly five-year delay or preserving the flexibility of it's current practice but at a considerable price, opening the door to federal habeas review and thereby undermining the finality of state court judgments. 
    In ruling for California, we stress that Martin has not alleged that the state's time bar, either by design or in operation, discriminates against federal claims or claimants. 
    The opinion of the court is unanimous.
