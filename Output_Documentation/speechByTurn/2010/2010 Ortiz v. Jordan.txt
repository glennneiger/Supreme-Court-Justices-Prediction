    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    This case presents a procedural question. 
    May a U.S. Court of Appeals review after trial a federal district court's denial of a pretrial motion for summary judgment? 
    The question arises -- arises in the context of a prisoner's civil right suit. 
    Petitioner Michelle Ortiz, a former inmate at -- in Ohio prison commenced an action for damages against two prison officers, Paula Jordan, Case Manager at Ortiz's living unit, and Rebecca Bright, a prison investigator. 
    On two consecutive nights, Ortiz alleged a prison guard sexually assaulted her. 
    She promptly reported the first assault, Ortiz for the alleged, but Officer Jordan though aware of the risk Ortiz faced did nothing to ward off the second assault. 
    Ortiz charged that Bright placed her, shackled and handcuffed in solitary confinement in a cell without adequate heat, clothing, bedding, or blankets. 
    Bright did saw according to Ortiz in retaliation for the complaints Ortiz made about the prison guards' assaults. 
    Jordan and Bright's conduct, Ortiz urged violated her right to reasonable protection from violence while in custody. 
    Before trial, Jordan and Bright moved for summary judgment based on their defense of qualified immunity. 
    That defense shields public officers from suit if their conduct did not violate any clearly established right. 
    Denying the officers' motion, the District Court explain that the force of their qualified immunity defense depended upon disputed facts within the province of a jury to resolve. 
    The case proceeded to trial and the jury returned sizable verdicts against both officers. 
    Appealing to the Sixth Circuit, Jordan and Bright argued that their pretrial summary judgment motion should have been granted. 
    Appellate Courts ordinarily do not reach that to review the denial of a pretrial summary judgment motion once a trial has taken place. 
    The Sixth Circuit so acknowledged. 
    But it relied on what it believed to be an exception to that rule when qualified immunity is at stake holding two-to-one that qualified immunity sheltered Jordan and Bright from Ortiz's suit, the Appeals Court reversed the judgment, entered on the jury's verdict. 
    We now reverse the Sixth Circuit's judgment. 
    There is no qualified immunity exception we hold to the rule that a pretrial summary judgment motion cannot be appealed after a case has been fully tried. 
    A plea of qualified immunity of course does not vanish what a District Court defines to rule on the plea summarily. 
    But at the trial, the defense must be evaluated in light of the character and quality of the evidence received in court. 
    The challenge's sufficiency of that evidence, a defendant can move post verdict for judgment as a matter of law. 
    Jordan and Bright did not do so, nor did they request a new trial on the ground that the weight of the evidence favored their qualified immunity defense. 
    The Court of Appeals therefore had no warrant to override the jury's verdict or the appraisal of the evidence made by the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and thereby gained a sense of the case no transcription of the record can impart. 
    Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy joined.
