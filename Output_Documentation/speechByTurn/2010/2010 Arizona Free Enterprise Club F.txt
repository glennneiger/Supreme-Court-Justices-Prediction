    Justice Elena Kagan 
    The First Amendment's core purpose is to foster a vibrant political system full of robust discussion and debate. 
    Nothing in Arizona's anti-corruption statute, the Citizens Clean Elections Act, violates this constitutional protection. 
    To the contrary, the Act promotes the values underlying both the First Amendment and our entire Constitution. 
    It does so by enhancing the opportunity for free electoral discussion while preventing the kind of corruption that can wreck democratic governance. 
    This Court is wrong to invalidate the State's important initiative. 
    The idea behind Arizona's statute is straightforward. 
    When elected officials are holding to big donors, they may act to serve those special interests rather than the interests of all Americans. 
    To prevent corrupt deals of this kind, Arizona has turned to the public financing of elections. 
    By supplanting private cash in elections, public financing eliminates the source of political corruption and makes sure elected officials serve us all. 
    For this reason, we have previously upheld the constitutionality of public financing. 
    The statutory provision of the Clean Elections Act invalidated today, the so-called matching funds provision simply ensures that Arizona's public financing system works. 
    The provision makes public financing effective in attacking corruption and also makes public financing sustainable overtime by ensuring that its cause is not prohibitive. 
    The provision achieves these results by setting the amount of the public subsidy at an appropriate level for each race. 
    At a level, that does not waste the taxpayer dollars but that assures candidates that if they signup for public financing, they will be given sufficient resources to run a competitive campaign. 
    So the idea of the Clean Elections Act is just this simple. 
    The matching funds mechanism is necessary to make public financing work and public financing as necessary to prevent corruption to break the stranglehold of special interests on our system of government. 
    That was what Arizona voters thought when they passed this Act by referendum. 
    There is nothing unconstitutional about that. 
    The law here does not impose any restriction or substantial burden on speech. 
    It does not prevent anyone from speaking and it does not tell anyone what they should say or how they should say it. 
    To the contrary, this law puts into place a subsidy program that serves nearly to fund additional electoral expression. 
    The program does not discriminate against any idea or any speaker. 
    It is open to all candidates, republican or democrat, conservative or liberal who wish to avail themselves of its benefits. 
    All the law does is fund more speech and as this Court said just last year it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule. 
    That is the consistent teaching of our precedents. 
    When the law creates speech rather than restrict speech, it is not subject to the most rigorous form of First Amendment review so long as it is viewpoint neutral which this law clearly is. 
    And that is so far an obvious reason, because laws of this kind to promote First Amendment values, by fostering additional and responsive expression, so that the market place of ideas can work at its best by exposing citizens to all kinds of opinions and enabling citizens to choose among them. 
    Indeed, we have previously recognized as much in this very context. 
    In Buckley v. Valeo, our seminal campaign finance case, we held the public financing systems in addition to preventing corruption served First Amendment values by ensuring that uninhibited, robust, and wide-open public debate would thrive. 
    The Court forgets all this in today's opinion. 
    And something else is wrong with this decision. 
    Even if the Arizona law merited rigorous First Amendment review, it should pass that test because the state has come forward with a clear uncontestable and compelling interest attacking political corruption. 
    We have long recognized that combating corruption is a compelling government interest. 
    It is after all the point of our entire constitutional enterprise to build and maintain a government accountable to the many not beholding to the few. 
    And Arizona has presented a forceful argument here that a successful public financing system is necessary to this end, and if the matching funds provision is a critical piece of this system, the thing that spells the difference between its success and its failure. 
    The majority today does not say anything to rebut this argument. 
    Arizonans deserve better, like citizens across this country, Arizonans deserve a government that represents and serves them all. 
    And Arizonans deserve the chance to reform their electoral system to achieve this most American of goals. 
    For these reasons and other as elaborated in my opinion, I respectfully dissent.
