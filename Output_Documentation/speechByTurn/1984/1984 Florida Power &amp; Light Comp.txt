    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents one narrow issue, whether the word 189 of the Atomic Energy Act to refer to all proceedings or only to certain types of formal agency proceedings. 
    This case began when the respondents sent a letter to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission asking the Commission to suspend the license of the Florida Power and Light Company's Turkey Point nuclear plant. 
    Under the Commission's procedures, such a so-called Section 2.206 request from the public must be evaluated by the Commission staff. 
    If the request is found to present a substantial health or safety concern, the Commission will issue an order to the operator of the plant asking it to show cause why its license should not be suspended, modified, or revoked. 
    Here, the Commission staff evaluated respondent's request, in the process compiling a 547-page record. 
    On the basis of this record, the director of the Commission's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation concluded that respondent's request did not raise a substantial health or safety concern, and be therefore issued an opinion declining to take action against the plant. 
    Respondent then challenged this decision in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, but that court decided that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. 
    The court based its decision on the language and the two-part structure of Section 189. 
    Section 189(a) provides for hearings in proceedings relating to the licensing of nuclear plants that are held before the Commission. 
    Section 189(b) then makes provision for review in Courts of Appeals of all orders entered during the course of proceedings of the kind described in Section 189(a). 
    Here, the Court of Appeals read the word 189(a) to refer only to formal agency action, and it therefore concluded that the types of orders made reviewable in the Court of Appeals under Section 18(b) are only orders entered during the course of such formal proceedings. 
    The court therefore concluded that challenges to the denial of Section 2.206 requests had to be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard first in the District Court with the decision of those courts in turn made reviewable in Courts of Appeals. 
    This system of judicial review devised by the Court of Appeals in this case, which departs from the practice followed in several of the circuits, finds no support in the statutory language or legislative history, and advances no identifiable interest to the public. 
    If the Court of Appeals believed that the word "proceeding" generally applies only to formal agency action, it plainly was mistaken. 
    The Administrative Procedure Act, which is incorporated by reference into the Atomic Energy Act, and therefore should control in this case, defines the term "agency proceedings" to include a wide range of agency action, formal and informal. 
    Among other things, agency proceedings under the APA include all agency process respecting the grant, denial, or modification of a license.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    I think, as this Court has indicated, "shall" should be read to contain the understanding that Congress didn't want agencies to conduct meaningless hearings, and I think that that... the types of cases that have raised this issue really make that clear. 
    I don't think there's any doubt that in a case such as NRDC versus NRC, decided by the District of Columbia Circuit, where the NRC concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the complaint, there would have been no point in holding a hearing. 
    It seems ridiculous that Congress would have insisted that one be held. 
    Or, in a case where the person demanding a hearing wants to raise issues that are outside the scope of the proceeding, it would make little sense to insist that--

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --I wouldn't say there is no support in the statutory language. 
    We acknowledge, I believe, that the statute can be read as... We think that is a strained interpretation of the statute. 
    I think that is made... in part is made clear by the Administrative Procedures Act. 
    The use of the word "proceedings" refers to a wide range of informal agency actions. 
    It is also made clear by the Hobbs Act, which provides the vehicle for judicial review in this case, the use of the word "proceeding" to refer to informal agency action, and that, the Hobbs Act specifically provides for review in Courts of Appeals of proceedings in which hearings have not been held. 
    The Court of Appeals, as your question suggested, based its decision on a semantic approach to the language of Section 189. 
    It entirely ignored the APA and the Hobbs Act, and instead noted that Section 189(a) provides the hearing shall be held in proceedings which raise licensing related issues before the Commission.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Let me ask you a practical question, counsel. 
    In the Commission, I assume, as in most courts, when a matter comes in that is categorized as a proceeding or a case, it is given a number. 
    Now, you mentioned the 200 letters over a period of ten years, I think it was. 
    Did every one of those letters get a number, or was there some selection? 
    Some of them got numbers and were treated as a proceeding, and some didn't? 
    Is that the way it works?
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="731.331" stopTime="753.742">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    I can't speak to every one of these letters in years past. 
    This case certainly received a number and was treated as a proceeding. 
    A docket was created containing files submitted by the agency, and my understanding is that when each of these things comes in, because the agency has obligated itself to address the facts, to issue an opinion, everyone is treated as an independent proceeding in which a record of that sort is created.

    The agency orders interpreting the regulation have used the term 2.206 request as proceeding, as we point out in our reply brief, it has also referred to Section 2.206 requests as requests to institute show cause proceedings or enforcement proceedings or informal proceedings, but I don't think the agency intended to interpret the word 189(a). 
    In fact, the agency consistently has taken the position that denials of a Section 2.206 requests are appealable to the Courts of Appeals, therefore are necessarily orders entered in proceedings of the kind described in Section 189(a).

    It is one of the problems created. 
    The jurisdictional point was never addressed in the briefs by the parties, and the opinion actually was circulated to the full court before the parties had an opportunity to file a petition for rehearing en banc, so the issues were never really fully addressed by the court.

   Argument of Harold F. Reis
speaker="harold_f_reis" startTime="1014.720" stopTime="1256.528">
    Mr. Harold F. Reis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to emphasize at the outset that in deciding this case, the Court below gave no consideration whatsoever to the relationship of the judicial review provision in the Atomic Energy Act, Section 189, the section we are dealing with now, to the overall scheme of regulation which the Act put into effect. 
    Now, whether they didn't do it because they did not permit briefing of the issue, and whether they simply overlooked it, or whether they considered the matter not to be relevant, I of course do not know, because they simply didn't consider it at all. 
    I submit, however, that however lacking in neatness the language of Section 189 is, that this is a very important matter to be considered in interpreting the section. 
    Now, a very important, if not the most important objective of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 was to make it possible for the first time for private ownership and operation of nuclear power reactors, and the most important... that private ownership and operation was the course to be made subject to a very close type of regulation, and perhaps the most important instrument of such regulation was licensing. 
    The Act made it a crime to own or operate a nuclear reactor without a license, and provided elaborate provisions in Section 189 for how licenses were to be issued and provide for their revocation. 
    Viewed from this point of view, what you had was an Act which was creating a large national administrative system in which licensing was key. 
    Section 189 therefore provided that in any proceeding respecting the issuance, amendment, or suspension of a license there would be Court of Appeals review. 
    This, of course, was wholly consistent with this idea of a national system of regulation in which licensing was key. 
    It provided for judicial review of any proceeding, and it did not necessarily turn, as courts which have considered the question before, for example, D.C. Circuit, when it first considered this question, it made it applicable to proceedings relating to licenses at any stage. 
    Accordingly, earlier, this, the D.C. Circuit determined that consideration of the jurisdiction of the question whether enforcement or licensing action should be undertaken was the first stage of a proceeding of the type that Section 189 expressly conferred authority on the Courts of Appeals to review.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    The Commission's brief, Mr. Reis, tells us that on the basis of a 547-page record, the director issued a decision on November 5th denying the respondent's request. 
    The respondent's request had been filed by letter on September 11th, 1981. 
    Now, was that 547-page record made in direct response to the September 11th letter of the respondent, or was it made independent of that but in some way related to it?
speaker="harold_f_reis" startTime="1301.573" stopTime="1306.791">

    Well, if I explain the relationship, I think I may answer it best, if I may. 
    What happened was, the letter asked that the Turkey Point unit be shut down immediately. 
    It asked that... I believe I am quoting it, but it was pretty close to that... be shut--

    Would you raise your voice a little, Mr. Reis?
speaker="harold_f_reis" startTime="1337.596" stopTime="1457.589">
    Mr. Harold F. Reis 
    --The letter asked that the Turkey Point unit be shut down immediately, that consideration be promptly given to suspension of the license, and the director's response to that request was, as the respondent herself characterizes it in her brief, at Page 2, I believe, as prompt. 
    What he did was amass the existing material relating to the matter. 
    He went to the material publicly at hand within the Commission, and if you look at the record in this case, what you will find is, there were not, for example, submissions in response to this thing, to this letter, as respondent suggests. 
    We, for example, Florida Power and Light, the licensee, did not file a response. 
    It was not because we didn't know it was there, but because we thought that the material was available to the director. 
    If you look at his decision, he looked at material relating to the two technical questions, steam generators and pressurized thermal shock, amassed them, saw, appraised the nature of the supposed threat, put this together in a coherent opinion. 
    In effect, he gave Ms. Lorion exactly the response she had asked for. 
    That is, he gave immediate consideration to it, and then, on the basis of the existing technical material, some of which had been previously submitted by us, some of which had been previously prepared by the NRC staff which was dealing with this technical problem. 
    He advised Ms. Lorion why he was not going to take the action she wanted. 
    Now, I think I have answered your question, Mr. Justice.

    Mr. Harold F. Reis 
    That is correct. 
    We didn't file briefs, she didn't file another brief, and so on.

    We were overjoyed to find the decision of the Court of Appeals that jurisdiction lay in the District Court, because one of our major concerns in this case and the first consideration or challenge is that there has been an abuse of agency discretion on the part of the Commission. 
    We have just considered here this morning the version of the government and the agency on formulation of the existing record, but the fact is that the record that was assembled was selective and ex parte in nature, and because no opportunity was given to my client to participate, she did not participate in formulation of the record.

    Mr. Martin H. Hodder 
    --The government has argued that one could renew the request in a new and separate 2.206 request, but that would require new information not previously submitted. 
    Since the decision was made on the basis of the issue we wish to be heard, we are unable on that particular issue, which is reactor pressure vessel embrittlement, to resubmit the question in a way that it could be considered new. 
    Therefore, we persist on our request that there be an enforcement proceeding or a hearing on the substantial issue of material fact that we have raised, because the issue raised here is acknowledged to constitute an unresolved safety issue, and the record relied upon the Commission in denying the relief sought is incomplete. 
    And the Commission itself shared the concerns of Ms. Lorion, and I believe it is Item 21 in the joint appendix in the case below. 
    The Commission used another show cause device similar to the 2.202 show cause process that my client sought, but without the teeth in it, and without the requirement of a hearing. 
    In other words, the Commission had requested information on August 21st from the utility noting that the Turkey Point reactors were in a site specific category which was causing them to reach levels of concern.

    --I think the Commission fairly addressed the question. 
    I don't think they denied the issue that there existed a problem, but the question is before this Court and before the director at the time the request was made, is how much information did the Commission utilize in reaching their decision. 
    You see, you cannot not find that there is an abuse of discretion, because the 50.54 request for information under a show cause request under the Commission's other rule hadn't been answered by the utility at the time they issued their decision in this case.

    The agency, on the other hand, hasn't been able to show otherwise, because they answered before they had all the information in. 
    You have to understand that in review of the record that the agency did assemble, which was fortuitously complete in some respects, the Turkey Point reactors, unlike other reactors in the United States, fell into a worst case category. 
    They, having been designed in the late sixties, early seventies, had engineering flaws designed into them that weren't apparent at the time, like Pinto automobiles with their bad gas tanks, because as the copper which inadvertently was introduced into the reactor pressure vessel began to cause embrittlement, it became apparent to everyone at the Commission and members of the public as well that these particular reactors, eight in all, the Turkey Point ones being the worst in the category, subcategory, worst subcategory of the total of eight, were so bad that the Commission itself saw fit to request this additional information from the utility company. 
    The utility company had not responded at the time the director denied the relief Ms. Lorion sought. 
    I say that that is an inadequate basis for refusal to act, and that therefore he abused his discretion. 
    Ancillary to that is the next issue of whether or not Ms. Lorion's contentions are correct or not.

    May I ask kind of a threshold question that I have never thoroughly understood in this case? 
    If you assume that a proceeding doesn't start until... well, that this is not a proceeding that we have here, where is there any statutory duty in the Commission to have anything more than the kind of prosecutorial discretion that a prosecutor in a criminal context would have? 
    What statutory obligation is there to institute proceedings? 
    Isn't it... Why couldn't one argue that it is totally within the discretion of the agency?

    Mr. Martin H. Hodder 
    --Of course, that is very true, but we must concern ourselves when we remand to the agency with the effect that is going to have on the rule and the previous teaching of this Court in the case Vermont Yankee, because if we don't remand to the agency with the direct proviso that they implement a 2.202 show cause proceeding, which is what we are seeking, that is, if anything else is requested, then you have a situation where a Court of Appeals is tampering with the procedure, the rule, 2.206, established by the agency in engrafting its own notions of judicial procedure upon that agency process, which is exclusive to the agency and which the courts have been told not to do. 
    In other words, it is not the business of the Courts of Appeals to amend their jurisdictional grant.

    Mr. Martin H. Hodder 
    --Your view is absolutely correct as far as it goes, but we must contemplate the nature of the procedure upon remand, whether it is specifically ordained that it be 2.202 or something else. 
    Because of the nature of the 2.206 process, and its definition by the agency's rule, it is not a proceeding under 189(a), because no rights as a party attach to the requester under 2.206. 
    Therefore, if we mandate that the director take the decision back and modify it, and consider this requester's views, then we have tampered with that procedure established by the agency for entertaining requests for enforcement action. 
    If, on the other hand, we remand to the agency with specific instructions that there was an abuse of discretion, and that there should have been a show cause proceeding implemented, then that would be a good result, but we must always recognize that if the Court of Appeals were to look at the Hobbs Act and its provisions under 2347(b), it could in the alternative remand the case to the District Court.

    As I read Section 1631, which is what the Court of Appeals relied on to transfer to the District Court, all that does is say the District Court may treat the case as though it were originally filed in that court rather than the Court of Appeals, and therefore it seems to me it is open to the government... I don't know whether it's right or not... it is open to the government to say, since they decided it is not a proceeding within the meaning of the statute, it is just not reviewable at all.

 The question of commencing proceedings to revoke licenses and the like are committed to agency discretion. 
 I don't think they have conceded... I may be wrong, but I don't think they have conceded that there is a lawsuit that is going to go forward in the District Court.

    Certainly as a practical observation, as I answered you earlier today, the Atomic Energy Act taken in toto doesn't permit such an abuse of discretion that would cause an atomic time bomb to be ticking in Ms. Lorion's back yard without there being some recourse to a court of law were she able to successfully show that the agency has abused its discretion.

    That is true, Your Honor. 
    However, I think that there is a vast distinction that can be drawn between the severity of these issues here and the APA issue on, I think it is 706 of the APA where they address the question of abuse of agency discretion and do make it reviewable. 
    I feel that such issues are reviewable. 
    I would only say that I have tried to be of help to the Court based on my understanding of the case. 
    I would say to this Court that if you seek to remand the case to the agency, that you be careful to consider my suggestion that we might go too far in engrafting the Court of Appeals' concepts of judicial procedure by tampering with the rule established by the agency, that is, going against the teachings of this Court in Vermont Yankee.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Finally, I think that if the Court of Appeals were to review this case and decided the record was inadequate, there would be no bar in the Hobbs Act to a remand to the agency. 
    The Hobbs Act provides for transfers to the District Court only when genuine issues of material fact are presented, and in this case there are no factual issues. 
    The question is whether the agency has properly based its decision on the record before.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    He presented factual submissions to the agency, but the question for the Court to decide is whether the determination that the agency made is appropriately based on the record. 
    The Court... I think as this Court has indicated repeatedly in cases like Overton Park and Kemp versus Phipps, it is not up to the Court to resolve these factual issues. 
    The Court can only review the accuracy of the agency's action.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    As I understand Mr. Hodder's argument is that they have never had a chance to present anything, to make a record here on which any court could review.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, respondent certainly had an opportunity to present whatever factual material she wished, and may present whatever factual material she has not presented to this point.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3595.195" stopTime="3603.768">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Ordinarily, to present factual material, you have at least an invitation to a hearing. 
    Is that not so?
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="3603.768" stopTime="3625.231">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Only if it is a case of formal adjudication or formal rulemaking. 
    In many instances, of informal adjudication or rulemaking, there are no hearings. 
    The agency simply proceeds on whatever is submitted to it by both sides. 
    And in this case, the respondent or someone in her position has an opportunity to submit whatever factual materials he or she would like considered. 
    Thank you.

    Very well. 
    Thank you, gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
