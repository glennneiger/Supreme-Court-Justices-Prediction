    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    We granted certiorari in this case and to decide whether the Constitution requires a state to provide an indigent defendant with the assistance of a psychiatrist. 
    In this case a defendant ask the Oklahoma Trial Court to appoint a psychiatrist to assist him in preparing his insanity defense. 
    The court refused and Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed and it held that the neither the state law nor the Constitution creates a right to a state funded psychiatrist examination. 
    In an opinion on file today with the Clerk we reverse. 
    We hold that when a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that insanity at the time of the defense is likely to be a significant factor at trial that a State must at a minimum assure that the defendant access to incompetence psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and insists in eveluating preparation and presentation of the defense. 
    In addition, when in the sentencing phase of a capital case the prosecutor places before the jury psychiatric evidence of the defendants future dangerousness, the defendant is entitled to the examination and assistance of a psychiatrists. 
    In this case the defendant maybe necessary joined and was therefore entitled to the assistance of a psychiatrist. 
    We reverse the decision of the Oklahoma Court. 
    The Chief Justice filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.
