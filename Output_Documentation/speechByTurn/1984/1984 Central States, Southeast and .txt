    Mr. Russell N. Luplow 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is a first impression which we believe is of great national importance as it relates to the national pension policy. 
    The Petitioners, the Central States pension and health and welfare funds conduct random audits to verify whether contributing employers, such as Central Transport, are reporting accurately on behalf of all persons covered by applicable collective bargaining agreements. 
    The issue in this case before this Court is whether in conducting these audits the trustees may request access to records beyond those of employees for whom the employer admits liability. 
    It is the trustees' claim that they have a right to a more comprehensive audit in this context under their trust agreement and under the prudent manual of ERISA. 
    The Sixth Circuit, in reversing the District Court, limited the trustees' audit rights to records of those employees that the employer admitted were covered and only to those unless the trustees could show cause why a particular employee was omitted, in which case that person, the particular employee's records could then be audited. 
    The petitioners are health and welfare and pension funds located in Chicago. 
    They're regulated by the Taft-Hartley Act and ERISA. 
    They have over half a million participants and beneficiaries with over 12,000 employers, and there are thousands of collective bargaining agreements that apply to the fund. 
    The respondent, Central Transport, is 16 companies engaged in trucking and related industries, all parties to a collective bargaining agreement commonly referred to as the National Master Freight Agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. 
    Under the collective bargaining agreement, the Transport obligation is to remit contributions under the collective bargaining agreement on each employee who's performing work under the collective bargaining agreement. 
    The fund's obligation, the petitioners' obligations on the pension plan, which is related to... which is governed by the ERISA in its trust agreement, is to give credits or benefits to persons on the basis of covered employment for pensions as a matter of law if they perform work covered by the collective bargaining agreement. 
    And this is the case regardless of whether or not the employer defaults on his contributions. 
    The funds, of necessity because of their scope, operate on a self-reporting system which we refer to as an honor system. 
    The way it works simply is that the employer sends to the fund each month a list of the employees that the employer says are covered by the collective bargaining agreement, and he sends along a check for that amount. 
    The trustees, who are familiar with misreporting problems in a multi-employer setting, have enacted a trust agreement that this Court looked at in February of this year in Prosser and Schneider. 
    And in that trust agreement, the trustees provided for an audit provision that provided in Article 3, Section 5, that the trustees shall be empowered to conduct on site audits of pertinent records of a contributing employer to verify for the accuracy of the reports. 
    In implementing that program, the trustees conduct random audits. 
    In this particular case, in 1980 the funds sought to conduct a random audit of Central Transport. 
    The auditors, upon arriving, or shortly thereafter, at Central Transport, were told by the officials of Central Transport that 60 percent of the employees of Central Transport, which was engaged primarily in the trucking industry, were not covered by the collective bargaining agreement. 
    The company then refused to produce any documentation to the fund's representatives to produce or to support its contention that these 60 percent of the employees were not covered. 
    As to the records that they allowed us to audit, those of employees that they admitted they owed liability on, the fund determined that there were over $268,000 in audit findings. 
    Now, to be sure, those audit findings are subject to the employer's--

    Your Honor, I believe that the response to that has to be found in 404 or ERISA, the prudent manual, and I believe that it would be what is prudent, prudent and reasonable in the circumstances. 
    To audit an employer three or four times a year when in particular the prior audits indicated active reporting would be unreasonable and clearly unwarranted.

    They passed the gauntlet to the trustees, and so the trustees have the right to amend the trust agreement when they think it's prudent to do so under the circumstances. 
    So it is not difficult to amend the trust agreement, but in this particular case, because of the breadth and scope of the Sixth Circuit's ruling, an amendment of the trust agreement would not get the job done here, because the Sixth Circuit said, as I'll get to in a minute, if the Court please, that... that ERISA doesn't allow you to do this the way they interpreted our contract; you can't do it.

    --The Sixth Circuit... we are absolutely dead in the water because... we believe, because of the Sixth Circuit ruling, because they not only say must you have particularized costs, that it would be imprudent, it would be arbitrary and capricious to even attempt an audit of this magnitude. 
    And that's the key point that I wanted to stress for the Court, but I see my time is flashing here, is this: the scope of our audit is a very limited inquiry. 
    As to the allegedly non-covered employees, the employees that the employer does not admit liability to, all we want to do is establish that that employee is not doing collective bargaining agreement work. 
    That's all we want. 
    We don't need test scores. 
    We don't need medical records, things that are characterized as sensitive. 
    What we do need is, for example, we need to know as a basic tie-in document, we need to see the 941, and we need... the IRS Form 941, and the complete payroll register of an employer. 
    Why do we need that? 
    Because they both have to match, because if they don't match, that means that there's possibly a ghost payroll out there, and there could be employees that are not being reported upon and being reported under the collective bargaining agreements.

    The employer has... the trustees have a right to determine... and the focus is very factual... what kind of work is being done.

    Mr. Joshua I. Schwartz 
    I... Your Honor... Justice Powell, we think that generally there's not a problem here, because contrary to what respondents suggest, this is a basic problem of jurisdictional dispute. 
    Our understanding is that the problem is essentially omissions, people who drop out of sight, particularly in certain industries where employment is seasonal, variable, or temporary or there's a lot of shifting between employers, and the Secretary of Labor has reason to believe that a lot of people just drop out of the system, and that there are omissions, and that therefore it is unrealistic to think of this as a back-door form of jurisdictional warfare among unions.

    The statute seems to place the burden on the trustees. 
    There are a few reasons why I think that solution is not an adequate answer to the case. 
    The first is I do not read respondents as accepting that solution, although the Court, of course, would differ.

    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question before the Court today is by what authority do these trustees, these Taft-Hartley funds, find the power do investigate records of employees that the union and the employer have together determined are not doing collective bargaining unit work.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1770.053" stopTime="1790.796">

    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    I'd like to answer that question in two parts, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    First, the union we're discussing here is the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has been extremely aggressive in its membership drives, and once they establish that a person is doing bargaining unit work and is a member, they have been extremely aggressive, Your Honor, in making sure that the employers remit all funds that are necessary in the form of compensation and payment of fringe benefits.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, corruption in the trust funds.
speaker="patrick_a_moran" startTime="1834.213" stopTime="1872.198">
    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    The corruption in the trust funds of these funds, Your Honor, has been the subject of some litigation launched by the Department of Labor in the Northern District of Illinois federal court, and as a result of allegations of gross mismanagement, these very funds have given, by their consent judgment, their investment and management funds, or powers rather, to an independent investment manager. 
    I'm not aware of any allegations that deal with our client or with the Teamsters Union or locals with which we deal of any misuse of funds by that union.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1872.198" stopTime="1882.181">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    I'm not addressing the particular unions. 
    I'm talking about the thrust and the purpose of this whole program in the minds of Congress. 
    What were they trying to do?
speaker="patrick_a_moran" startTime="1882.181" stopTime="2020.983">
    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    Congress was trying to pass in ERISA, Your Honor, to make sure that if an employer gives fringe benefit funds to his employees, that all employees would be eligible to participate in that fund. 
    But Congress did not say to the employers that if you employ or have more than one fund, each of your employees must be a participant in each of your funds. 
    Not at all. 
    Congress allowed certain discriminations, certain characteristics of employment that would allow one employee to be a member of one pension fund and another employee of the same employer to be a member of a different pension fund. 
    The complement of employers... of employees, rather, that Central Transport has is made up of three broad categories. 
    The first are those who are members of the Teamsters Union who operate within the jurisdiction of the Central States fund and are participants in that fund. 
    The second are members of the Teamsters Union that operate in a different geographic area of the country and are participants in a different Taft-Hartley fund. 
    Also within that second group are members of other unions like the International Association of Machinists, which have a separate Taft-Hartley plan. 
    And finally, there are those employees who are not members of any union who can qualify, if they meet the definition of ERISA participant, to be a participant in the employer-sponsored pension fund that is maintained by Central Transport. 
    Justice O'Connor asked a question earlier, followed up by Mr. Justice Brennan: Must a person be a member of the union to be a participant in these funds? 
    And I think the answer was given that no, these funds represent a broad spectrum of participants, and not all participants have to be members of the union. 
    But that's not the facts in this case. 
    Central Transport is a closed shop. 
    To do a bargaining unit work in Central Transport, you must be a member of the Teamsters Union within 30 days. 
    That's covered quite clearly in the collective bargaining agreement. 
    That's the deal.

    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    That's absolutely correct, Justice O'Connor. 
    And that's the very reason that this Court should not embark upon attempting to find implied in ERISA that which is not there. 
    If Congress wished to give a power to the trustees, Congress knows how to express its purpose. 
    Section 1104 of Code... of Title 29, which sets forth the duties and obligations of these trustees, has no mention of the power to audit nonparticipants.

    If I may, Your Honor, within the definition of employee as stated by ERISA are several components. 
    The employees of Central Transport who can qualify for participation in this plan are only one portion of that total component of employee definition. 
    And we agree full well that the definition of employee in ERISA is much broader than the definition of employee in the collective bargaining agreement, and therein lies our controversy.

    Some of them are Teamsters, and some of those Teamsters operate in a geographic area represented by these funds. 
    Some of them are Teamsters and do not operate in a geographic area represented by these funds. 
    Just taking those two components, these trustees clearly have the right to review the records of Teamsters who are operating within their geographic area, and they have done so, and they did so for 60 days.

    No, it does not. 
    In fact, therein lies the rub in this case. 
    If the trustees are correct that they have a power that is found not only in the collective bargaining agreement but in ERISA, implied in ERISA, to see the records of all employees, then the trustees of every pension plan to which Central Transport makes contributions have a concomitant right.

    And when we told them they weren't entitled to those records, they weren't even limited geographically, they said by letter to us then the result is we will kick you and all of your participants out of our fund.

    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    Certainly our federal courts could, on a case by case basis, issue protective orders as the Justice suggests; but I don't want it to go unmentioned that the attempt of the funds to indicate that they are just asking for a reasonable amount of records that are directed to particular employees should go unnoted. 
    For instance, they have asked for all freight bills, delivery receipts and bills of lading. 
    Now, these are three documents that are produced by a trucking company for every piece of freight they haul. 
    Central Transport has 60,000 a week of each of those three, or 180,000 per week. 
    They asked for equipment control requests; that's 35,000 a week. 
    Activity reports, that's 35,000 a week. 
    Employee records. 
    Now, just on those four things, 267,000 pieces of paper a week times 52 weeks are 13,900,000 pieces of paper per year over a six-year period... now, times six for their statute of limitations... and that we have to prepare, maintain and produce for every trustee of every Taft-Hartley plan to which we contribute.

    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    A union has a list of its own members.

    Thirty days.

    Your 15 percent attrition.
speaker="patrick_a_moran" startTime="2682.750" stopTime="2719.749">
    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    That's the 15 percent attrition. 
    That list is placed upon a form for the trustees, and those names, along with the check, goes into them like clockwork every 30 days. 
    If someone is left out, the union will know it within 30 days. 
    It is not a unilateral determination. 
    But I haven't answered the question of the Court yet. 
    What we wish to prevent is a fishing expedition by funds across the country in all of our records, because that will result in such a cost to employers that the purposes, the lofty objectives of ERISA that Congress set forth, will be totally lost by cost.

    Well, it probably... we probably should only decide the case we've got before us and not talk about a lot of other cases that may have different facts.

speaker="patrick_a_moran" startTime="2733.522" stopTime="2738.709">

    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    --That is correct. 
    The case in... in front of the Court today has very little chance that someone will be left out intentionally. 
    The union will monitor their employment and make sure that... that this person is part of the union and receives all of his union benefits. 
    And besides, we're not talking just about pensions here. 
    We're talking about health and welfare. 
    And you don't go very far in today's society without finding out if you have medical coverage. 
    The knowledge of the shop is such that the man in machine number one or truck number one knows very well if he doesn't get the same benefits as the man at machine number two or truck number two.

    Mr. Patrick A. Moran 
    --Yes, Your Honor, but other trustees say they have the same duty. 
    And in the New York State Teamsters example, if these trustees, Central States, assert that they represent as a participant, they have as a participant targeted employee Jane Doe, and New York State says wait, Jane Doe is a member of our fund, the New York State Teamsters trustees have the came concomitant duty to try and keep Jane Doe in their fund as these trustees have to try and wrest her away. 
    And we end up with litigation of trustee against trustee besides. 
    There are collective bargaining agreements by which the employer, Central Transport, makes its contribution, and we can see that the union's not here today. 
    And just because a trustee proves that a targeted employee should be in the Central States fund doesn't mean that the New York State Teamsters Union... not the fund but the union... is going to agree that that person is no longer part of their bargaining unit, and the symmetry of the collective bargaining agreement with the Taft-Hartley plan is completely destroyed. 
    We can have an employee who receives wages under a collective bargaining agreement and fringe benefit contributions under a second collective bargaining agreement, and to the employee this could be disastrous. 
    For instance, let us assume an employer with two sets of employees, one under union A and one under union B, and union A provides for total benefits per week of $110, as does union B. 
    But union A divides them differently: $80 goes to wages, $30 to fringe benefit contributions. 
    The union A employees get $100 of wages and $10 of fringe benefit contributions. 
    Now the trustees start their fight, and the poor pawn of the employee can end up receiving $80 in wages under union A and $10 in contributions of fringe benefits under plan B for $90. 
    And he says what happened to me? 
    I'm still driving a truck. 
    That's all he ever did. 
    That's not intended by ERISA, and the problem is putting in context the definition of employee and ERISA, which is what raised the initial question in the Court's mind. 
    We admit that ERISA's definition of employee is much broader than... excuse me... than the definition in the collective bargaining agreement, and it's meant to be. 
    If the Court finds that these trustees and all Taft-Hartley trustees have a power that's found in the law, some place in the law, although ERISA does not expressly give it to them, then they've had it at least since 1975... not since they've concocted their theory, because ERISA's fiduciary standards became active in 1975, and before that... these are Taft-Hartley funds. 
    Taft-Hartley's been around since 1947. 
    And isn't it strange that in 1947's hearings in Congress, in 1974's hearings for the ERISA, in the hearings for the Welfare Pension Plan Disclosure Act that preceded ERISA, and in the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act in 1980, Congress never said these trustees have the power they say Congress intended? 
    I would think that a more reasonable resolution of that puzzlement is that Congress simply did not intend to give them this power. 
    Justice White asked the question why couldn't an employer use his own auditor, own independent certified public accountant to issue a report. 
    Mr. Luplow responded that it would be too costly. 
    But the employer funds the cost of the audit that the funds want to do, so the answer that it's too costly is... simply doesn't hold water.

    The adequate protections that you have is the union. 
    Well, as this Court examined in Prosser and Schneider, the union may not be reliable in this context. 
    Why? 
    Because the buck doesn't stop with them; it stops with us. 
    And the fact of the matter is that our interests do not always converge. 
    We have fiduciary responsibilities. 
    They don't have any responsibility to retirees and their families; we do. 
    And as I said at the top of my argument, that under ERISA and under the law as interpreted by the Department of Labor, that if an employee performs work in a collective bargaining agreement, the fund is liable to provide him with pension credits regardless of whether or not that employer ever paid us a nickel. 
    Now, Congress made us the fiduciaries and gave us the responsibility to maintain, preserve and protect the assets of that fund, and we submit to this Court that not only ERISA but our trust agreements does not require us to simply take someone's word for it.
