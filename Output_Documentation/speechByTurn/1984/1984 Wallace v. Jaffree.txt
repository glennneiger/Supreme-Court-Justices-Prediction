Wallace v. Jaffree

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. John S. Baker, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question in this case is whether a statute providing a minute of silence for meditation or voluntary prayer constitutes an establishment of religion, or whether it constitutes a common sense accommodation of the religious diversity of our people which is consistent with the purposes of the religion causes. 
    Alabama statute provides an opportunity to pray for so minded students, but this opportunity to pray is one that is perfectly consistent with the letter and the spirit of this Court's cases under the establishment clauses. 
    Moreover, we submit that this type of accommodation is one that is perfectly consistent with the spirit of the religion clauses in that it promotes pluralism which pervades both of the religion clauses. 
    This type of a statute involves none of the circumstances that have concerned this Court in prior cases. 
    This kind of a statute does not endorse religion, it does not endorse one religion over another, it does not endorse belief over nonbelief. 
    This kind of a statute is perfectly neutral on its face. 
    The statute is one that does not coerce in any way; it coerces only silence. 
    It does not coerce any religious practice, it does not coerce religious belief, it does not affirm religious belief. 
    It is in the nature of a statute neutral in that it respects the consciences of all students equally by allowing them either at their own choice to say a prayer in silence or to say or simply to meditate during this one moment, this one minute at the beginning of the day. 
    In addition to Alabama, there are 23 other states that have found that providing a moment of silence is a reasonable way to accommodate the various desires and needs of children in the public schools in a way that the states have deemed to be consistent with the case law in this Court.

    They were passed in various years. 
    There was first of all a moment of silence statute passed in 1978. 
    There was this statute which was passed in 1981. 
    There was a prayer statute which was struck down by the Eleventh Circuit which was passed in 1982, but they were not presented as a package.

    Mr. John S. Baker, Jr. 
    The difference between the Appellee and our own position on this question really comes down to the significance of the word "prayer" in the statute. 
    As I have already said, the Appellee concedes the constitutionality of the moment of silence statute for meditation, and the Appellee also concedes that students have a right to pray silently to themselves at any time that they would wish to during the school day. 
    Obviously, then, during this one minute of silence, the students, even under the 1978 statute, the statute providing only for silent meditation, the student would have the right during that minute to pray silently. 
    In other words, the effect under either statute, under the 1978 statute or the 1981 statute, is the same as far as the classroom goes. 
    The difference comes down to that one-word prayer in the statute, but certainly it cannot be unconstitutional simply to insert in a statute a statement that it is constitutional... what is constitutionally permissible. 
    In other words, the statute merely informs students that one of the purposes that they can put this minute of silence to is that they can use it to pray silently during that minute. 
    This opportunity for prayer is not, as the Appellee has suggested, one of group prayer. 
    We have here none of the characteristics of group prayer. 
    It is not vocal prayer. 
    No one student knows what another student is saying, is thinking, or whether that student is praying, whether the student is meditating, whether the student is simply vegetating for that one minute. 
    Because no student knows what another student is doing during that period of time, there is not the problem of coercion that concerned this Court in earlier cases. 
    We do not have here a joint effort or joint purpose as among the various students in the classroom for that one minute. 
    There is, in other words, no communal effort. 
    It does not involve any of the characteristics that this Court discussed in Engel and in Shemp, and we submit on this basis that this statute is essentially different. 
    By providing an opportunity to pray, we submit that the statute is in the line of cases including Zorach where this Court has recognized that it is perfectly consistent for states to in certain areas accommodate the religious needs of our people. 
    In this area of accommodation, we find that the statute accommodates those admittedly who have this desire to pray, but it does so in a way that in no way interferes with the free exercise of rights of anyone else in the class. 
    It does not present the problem of embarrassment or excusing students as was a problem in the earlier cases. 
    The statute does in fact, as indicated, leave to the teacher a certain discretion in the sense that this statute is permissive. 
    It says that a teacher may implement this minute of silence. 
    This statute, however, is not inconsistent with the notion that local school boards in their independent areas would or could adopt regulations dealing with the implementation of the statute. 
    But the sense of the statute is that this moment of silence should be allowed for students who wish to have their religious needs accommodated during the day. 
    We see no difference constitutionally between a statute which is permissive, as this statute is in the sense that it has the word "may" in it, as opposed to a statute which is mandatory, as was indicated in one of the questions. 
    We have from the 24 states that have moment of silence statutes, we have a variety of language in those statutes. 
    In some of the states the decision is made by the state legislature. 
    In other states the decision is made by the state school board or the local school board. 
    It may be made by the principal. 
    It may be made by the teacher. 
    In viewing these statutes in terms of the fact that we have 24 states which have deemed this to be a proper, reasonable way to accommodate, we have to take into account the fact that there are various conditions from state to state, and that the statute may in fact be implemented in somewhat a different way in various states depending upon the local needs.

    Mr. John S. Baker, Jr. 
    Your Honor, it was very clear from the testimony of the sponsoring legislator here that he was concerned that people did not understand that they had a right to pray silently in the classroom, and many people are under the impression apparently that students no longer even have the right to pray silently. 
    What this statute does is to clarify that and make it very clear on the face of the statute that this is one of the uses to which the minute of silence can be put. 
    It does so in a way that is neutral because it at the same time emphasizes the word "meditation" already in the statute. 
    This statute, this opportunity to pray, was struck down by the Eleventh Circuit on its face in this case. 
    The Eleventh Circuit recognized that the teacher activity in Mobile, in the Mobile schools that were challenged in the other part of the case were not related to this statute. 
    We thus have in this case no real experience; there is nothing indicated on the record in this case as to the implementation of this kind of statute. 
    And we submit that at this point, that this Court ought to allow and recognize the constitutionality of this statute and allow for it to be implemented. 
    We recognize that any sort of statute which deals with the area of prayer is one that is obviously a controversial one, and there--

    This opportunity to pray, we submit to the Court, is one that is consistent with this Court's cases dealing with the notion of accommodation, and as this Court recognized in Lynch v.

 Would the state's purpose be equally well served by a statute that allowed this moment or two or three moments immediately before school commenced so that it would be totally optional as to whether to attend or not?

    Your Honor, I think that raises the question of equal access, which is not this statute, it is a different statute. 
    I think that that kind of a statute would be perfectly constitutional, but that is a different issue, Your Honor.

   Argument of Paul M. Bator
speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="1001.501" stopTime="1050.414">
    Mr. Paul M. Bator 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I might start by supplementing the colloquy about the relationship between these two statutes. 
    The new statute made three changes. 
    It said that the practice of the moment of silence is discretionary rather than mandatory. 
    The old statute applied only to grades one through six, so this statute generalized the moment of silence to all of the school grades. 
    And finally, the statute added the, what I think is really the purely informational addendum, that it is one of the appropriate uses of the moment of silence that so minded students may use it for silent prayer.

    Mr. Paul M. Bator 
    --Without the old statute, without the new statute, without any statute. 
    What this statute does, what these two statutes do is to formalize a practice. 
    It is a very simple, it is really a very inoffensive practice; we're all used to it, we have all been asked occasionally to fall silent for a minute, to remember something, to dedicate ourselves, and within that, the with to enhance, to accommodate the opportunity for students who are under a claim of conscience to bring silent prayer as part of their activities in school. 
    I think I want to return to Justice Marshall's question because this is absolutely crucial to us. 
    What this statute does is add an additional opportunity. 
    It enhances the freedom. 
    It is not that easy, it is not that unembarrassing, it is not that natural for students to find a moment of serenity. 
    I mean, what the moment of silence does is to create silence. 
    That is what it does.

    It expanded the operation of the formal moment of silence from grades one through six to grades one through twelve. 
    It made a change in the administrative structure because it said the teacher has some discretion. 
    Then the statute adds what was already the case. 
    How can it be unconstitutional for Alabama simply to say what was already the fact, which is that in this uncoerced, neutral atmosphere, a brief moment of stillness, within this small zone of privacy, it is permissible for so minded students to dedicate their day to God. 
    What this does is expand the freedom of all the students in a way that is wholly inoffensive. 
    This is a modest gesture of generosity toward students who are under a claim of conscience.

   Argument of Ronnie L. Williams
speaker="ronnie_l_williams" startTime="1680.490" stopTime="1805.154">
    Mr. Ronnie L. Williams 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I think what has become clear here is that this is not a case about accommodation. 
    I think the prior opinions of this Court has made clear that to accommodate the free exercise rights of individuals and citizens of this nation, there must be a burden placed upon those rights by the government. 
    Here the state has shown no burden placed upon the rights of young children in the Alabama public school system prohibiting the free exercise of their religious rights. 
    I think as has been pointed out, the earlier statute, the 1978 statute that provides for a moment of silent meditation, adequately provides time for reflection, introspection, meditation, whatever a child feels a need to engage in. 
    There was no need for this new statute, the 1981 statute, but simply the major part, the major change simply added the word "prayer". 
    I think it is a a clear attempt on the part of the state to promote religion, to promote religious practice, and one of the most basic of religious practices, and that is prayer. 
    The whole idea behind the accommodation doctrine was to assure that a person fares no worse for being religious than a nonreligious person subject to the same governmental activity. 
    There has been no showing here, and I will point out that the record is clear, there is no hindrance to any child from praying during their period of time of meditation under the 1978 statute. 
    Senator Holmes, the sponsor of that particular statute, of the new statute, the 1981 statute, testified in District Court that it was his purpose to return prayer to Alabama public schools, that is constituents had advised him that they felt a need to have prayer in school. 
    Now, the new statute was impermissive, and if there is going to be any type of accommodation, how do you accommodate when you allow a teacher the discretion to make the determination of whether or not that statute will be applied or not.

    Mr. Ronnie L. Williams 
    No, initially, when this case first started, the activity being complained about was teacher-led group, vocal prayer in the public school system. 
    Later, as the case progressed, this complaint was amended when it became clear because of other people coming forward, that other religious activity was taking place in the public school system as well, including silent prayer, Bible reading over the public address system, just a variety of religious activity. 
    The District Court did not allow plaintiff to get into the details of all that... those activities, so the main focus of the case became the teacher-led prayer, the recently enacted Bob James Prayer, and this new silent meditation or prayer statute.

    Mr. Ronnie L. Williams 
    Well, that was the indication that we had received. 
    Now, there was no evidence produced at trial because... let me back up one moment. 
    This case was amended once again to allege class allegations because other citizens of Mobile were coming forward to complain about this type of activity, silent prayer, Bible reading, just a variety of activity. 
    It was brought as a class. 
    The District Court would not certify it as a class, would not allow any testimony other than on the particular two statutes, the Bob James statute, the new meditation statute, and the teacher-led prayer. 
    So there is... the record is basically clean of any actual testimony regarding the implementation of the silent meditation or prayer statute. 
    As I was about to say about the accommodation, you do not accommodate someone when there is no burden. 
    Any student had the right, in fact still has the right since the 1978 statute has not been... as a fact, has not been repealed. 
    That statute is still good law. 
    I disagree with counsel that Appellees concede the constitutionality of that particular statute. 
    We simply did not challenge it. 
    The legislative history of that particular statute was unclear. 
    There is nothing to indicate what the purpose of that particular statute was, what the effect of it was, and whether or not there was any entanglement, which is the three-part test that has been used by this Court repeatedly in these types of cases, establishment clause cases. 
    So that particular statute was not challenged by the Appellees. 
    The 1982 statute... the 1981 silent meditation or prayer statute was a different matter. 
    The only major change, as I suggested earlier, was the addition of the word "prayer", and I think that is very important because it shows the clear purpose on the part of the state to bring prayer back to the public schools.

    Mr. Ronnie L. Williams 
    --I think I would take the position that it is valid on its face, just a simple moment of silence for meditation to do whatever you will, which may include prayer as well. 
    I think when the state went further to add or to suggest, and when we talk about impressionable children, young children in elementary schools, some who look up to their teachers, who idolize their teachers, I think you are allowing the state to promote religion as opposed to accommodate someone's free exercise rights. 
    I think that is exactly what has happened in this situation. 
    I think that is why, as the record would suggest in this case, there was so much turmoil within the Mobile public school system. 
    The record of this case I think indicates the turmoil that has come about because of this case. 
    The Governor of the State of Alabama introduced his own statute suggesting prayer in, I guess, a direct response to the filing of this complaint in District Court. 
    This is no attempt to accommodate the rights of young children in the Alabama public school system. 
    This is simply a blatant attempt to do I guess through the back door what cannot be done through the front door.

    They are, indeed. 
    I think the difference here... well, in fact, they are free to pray silently on their own without establishing or without the teacher saying anything at all.

    Mr. Ronnie L. Williams 
    Certainly, I think that would be fine in a subject matter context, in a curriculum context, but during a moment of silence, every day, day in and day out, when the school bell rings, I think that is more than just teaching children about what the First Amendment stands for, what its protections and prohibitions are. 
    I think it goes much further. 
    I think it, as I said earlier, the states stepped across that line of neutrality. 
    It is not longer... the state is no longer being neutral. 
    It is basically explaining one aspects of the Constitution, and putting special emphasis on prayer, which offends the Constitution. 
    I think it would be appropriate if the teacher wanted to, say, Monday discuss the First Amendment, Tuesday the Second Amendment, and so on and so forth, but--

    That is correct. 
    In fact, the danger is that a teacher who, as I suggested earlier, may be basically taking the role of a parent in the classroom, someone that the child looks up to, may influence some children to pray, and I think that is the danger of allowing this type of statute to remain on the books.

    Mr. Ronnie L. Williams 
    Well, a teacher, certainly during a period of time in which the student is not actually engaged in the pursuit of knowledge, I would think that he could take time to silently pray, but I don't think a child has a constitutional right to, when a teacher asks him what is five plus four, to ask the teacher for a brief moment to go and pray and then come back and respond to the question.

    It may happen. 
    I think what is clear though is that no evidence was offered as to any secular purpose regarding the second statute, the 1981 silent meditation or prayer statute. 
    The sole witness, Senator Holmes, the sponsoring legislator on this particular bill, testified that it was his main purpose, I mean, his only purpose was to return prayer to the Alabama public schools.

 How do we know that the children of Mr. Jaffree, when they go to school, will encounter any different practice by the teacher, whether one or both statutes are in effect? 
 Does the statute cause anything different to happen in the classroom of the people who are parties to this lawsuit than if the statute were not on the books?

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, in the long run, Mr. Williams, to go back to that point, is the teacher telling the students if they do so any more than what the Constitution guarantees, that is, that they may indulge in a few moments of silent prayer if they want to?
speaker="ronnie_l_williams" startTime="2766.438" stopTime="2795.271">
    Mr. Ronnie L. Williams 
    Yes, I think that the teacher may in effect be telling a child no more, or the class no more than what the Constitution provides, but I think by the teacher, a state through the teacher engaging in that behavior suggests more to some students than possibly to others, may suggest that prayer is the preferred activity during this one moment of meditation. 
    I see--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2795.271" stopTime="2816.052">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    What if the teacher tells them while you are in the classroom you may not whisper or speak to the other students, you will only speak when you are called upon, but when you go out on the playground or out in the hall, then the Constitution guarantees you the right of freedom of speech? 
    Anything wrong with that?

    If you are going to exempt other nonprofit organizations from the tax rules, then to turn around and tax churches and other religious entities, I think you would be showing some form of hostility, and I think it still crosses the line of neutrality.

    Mr. Ronnie L. Williams 
    I think it would be consistent. 
    I think my response was that a child, or the teacher should be responsive to any question from a student. 
    You do not have the routine, although this statute is impermissive, but you do not have the possibility, I guess, of every day a student asking the same question, can we pray. 
    The teacher announces a moment of silence for meditation, and I think throughout that school year you would not have someone in that same class asking that same question. 
    I think once that question is asked and once it is answered by the teacher on one occasion, assuming this takes place in the same class with the same people, I think the teacher has satisfied that inquiry and there is no need to dwell on that subject. 
    But to each day have a teacher to remind the students that you can pray during this moment of silence I think is going too far. 
    And I would just like to repeat, I think I may have glossed over the point earlier, but particularly when you have impressionable minds, you have a captive audience, I think it is even more important, and this Court has saw fit to see it that way as well, that it is even more important to protect young people from this type of behavior, from the state involving itself in religion. 
    Adults obviously can pick and choose between beliefs, philosophies and whatever. 
    Young children do not have that capability to ferret out what they feel is unacceptable and to... or what is consistent with what they are being taught at home. 
    That was precisely the situation with the Jaffree family. 
    The children were being taught one thing at home and something else in the public school room, and it is just not the business of the state to engage in that type of activity. 
    Thank you.
