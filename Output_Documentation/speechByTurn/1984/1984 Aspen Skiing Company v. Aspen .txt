    Mr. Cooper, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Richard Melvyn Cooper 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The central question in this case is whether under Section 2 of the Sherman Act a firm with monopoly power has a duty to cooperate with a smaller rival by participating in a horizontal arrangement for joint marketing. 
    The question in the circumstances of this case is shaped by two additional material facts. 
    First, the firm with monopoly power here, Aspen Ski Company, was not vertically integrated, but rather operated at only one level of the skiing industry, and therefore cases such as Terminal Railroad, Kodak, and Otter Tail are readily distinguishable. 
    This case involves no vertical element. 
    Secondly, the conduct at issue here, Ski Company's refusal to cooperate with Aspen Highlands, was decided on and carried out by Ski Company independently and not as part of any group, contract, combination, or conspiracy, and thus, under the distinction between independent action and concerted action reaffirmed by this Court last term in Monsanto and in Copperweld, what we have here is clearly independent conduct, not concerted conduct. 
    In these circumstances, we submit the answer to the question presented is no, that no firm, not even one with monopoly power, has a duty under the antitrust laws to engage in horizontal joint marketing arrangements. 
    Although voluntary horizontal arrangements between competitors sometimes have pro-competitive aspects and are consistent with the goals of the antitrust laws and therefore pass muster under Section 1's rule of reason, mandatory horizontal arrangements imposed by law and enforced and administered by courts have never had any place in the jurisprudence of antitrust.

speaker="richard_melvyn_cooper" startTime="191.473" stopTime="428.279">
    Mr. Richard Melvyn Cooper 
    --It does indeed. 
    In the 95 years since the enactment of the Sherman Act, this Court has never held or suggested that any duty of horizontal cooperation exists or should exist, and until the decision by the Tenth Circuit below no Court of Appeals in the 95 years of the statute had ever so held. 
    Thus, the decision below is unprecedented, and we submit is unwarranted on the facts of this case and is indeed directly contrary to the central goals of the antitrust laws. 
    The principal facts are relatively straightforward. 
    The product market involved here is downhill skiing services. 
    The jury found two geographic markets, one embracing all of North America and including all of the firms that cater to destination skiers those who travel a substantial distance to a ski area, generally by airplane, at least in part, and who spend a substantial amount of time, generally at least a week. 
    The jury also found a sub-market consisting of the Aspen area in which the Petitioner and the Respondent conduct their businesses. 
    For a number of years, each of the two firms has offered single day lift tickets and a variety of multi-day lift tickets designed to meet the varying needs of different skiers. 
    And if you examine the exhibits, Exhibit 15 and 47 that show the history of the ticket offerings and prices of the two firms, you will see that there has been considerable experimentation. 
    The specific kinds of tickets offered have varied from year to year and the pricing interrelationships among the tickets have varied from year to year. 
    The court below placed some reliance on the fact that shortly before trial Ski Company announced a prospective increase in its daily lift ticket price from $18 to $22 per day. 
    That was a 22 percent increase. 
    That's not the largest one-year increase shown in the record of this case. 
    From 1977-'78 to '78-'79, Highlands increased its ticket price 25 percent in one swoop. 
    Also, the relationship between the single day lift ticket and multi-day lift tickets in terms of price varied from year to year. 
    Ski Company's during '78-'79, '79-'80 and prospectively for '81-'82 was in the 12.5 to 13.5 percent range. 
    Highlands during these years was approximately a 35 percent discount. 
    So there isn't a pattern that can be inferred from the ticket pricing or the ticket offerings. 
    These firms were experimenting each year to see what the market reaction would be. 
    For the 16 years through the 1977-'78 season, with the exception of one year, the two firms together cooperated in offering a joint ticket, on which they set the price together and the terms and conditions. 
    It was good for six days of skiing at any of the four mountains operated by the two firms. 
    In 1977-'78, for the first time in several years Ski Company offered a competing six-day ticket good at its three mountains. 
    And in '78-'79, '79-'80, and '80-'81, Ski Company refused to continue the joint ticket. 
    It also refused to sell tickets to its horizontal competitor, Highlands, and in '78-'79 it refused to honor coupons issued by Highlands for entry onto Ski Company's facilities.

    I don't think you have an inconsistent verdict here. 
    I think the jury... it's fair to infer that the jury simply did not rely on the allegation of a Section 1 conspiracy as part of a Section 2 violation. 
    The second element of the six, the third one mentioned, was the advertising, and our submission on that is it's de minimus and indeed insufficient as a matter of law. 
    All of these other four... the refusal to continue the joint ticket, the offering of the competitive three-area ticket, the refusal to accept the coupons, and the announcement of the prospective price increase, which were the other four elements cited by counsel in closing argument and relied on by the Court of Appeals... all are subsumable, as the Court of Appeals held, under the issue of the duty to cooperate.

    Mr. Richard Melvyn Cooper 
    I would submit not. 
    And indeed, on the record here, as I mentioned earlier, Ski Company's discount in the neighborhood of 13.3 percent for the prospective increase... I'm sorry, 13.6 percent... was way below the discounts offered by Highlands on its unilateral six-day ticket, which in general were 35 and 36 percent in the years in question. 
    So you don't have that sort of problem here. 
    And just one more point on the price increase. 
    The only reason why a price increase would hurt a horizontal rival rather than help the horizontal rival is that that horizontal rival is in some way depending on the product of the firm that raised its price. 
    Now, we submit that there's no duty to yield to such claimed dependence.

speaker="richard_melvyn_cooper" startTime="1091.941" stopTime="1341.685">
    Mr. Richard Melvyn Cooper 
    --Correct. 
    That is, where you have the refusal to deal combined with something else, where it's combined with concerted action, if you have the Lorain Journal kind of situation where you're going to discriminate against consumers who patronize a rival and you have monopoly power, you clearly can't do that. 
    But that's not what's involved here. 
    Instead of combining cooperation with competition, we submit Ski Company engaged in a strategy of competition, for which it was held to have violated Section 2 and it was held liable for $7.5 million of treble damages. 
    We submit that the conduct at issue here was not exclusionary under any reasonable definition of the term "exclusionary". 
    It imposed no restraint on the ability of Highlands to bring its own product to the market. 
    Highlands was free to engage in whatever unilateral conduct it chose. 
    It could run its ski operation and it could sell its lift tickets, package them any way it chose, unilaterally. 
    Ski Company's conduct imposed no restraint on consumers. 
    They remained free to patronize either or both companies and to divide their patronage between the firms any way they wished. 
    The conduct was not predatory. 
    It was capable of being sustained indefinitely and without subsidy, and its success did not depend on destruction of Highlands, on injury to Highlands, or on inducing through discipline any changes in Highlands' unilateral conduct. 
    Finally, the conduct at issue here was not based on monopoly power. 
    Any firm having facilities that it believes can attract consumers on their own individual merits can pursue the kind of competitive non-cooperative strategy that Ski Company pursued here. 
    We submit that Ski Company's refusal to cooperate not only did not violate Section 2, but that it is entirely consistent with the central goals of the antitrust laws. 
    First, it is consistent with the goal of achieving economic efficiency and consumer welfare, and the duty to cooperate is contrary to that interest. 
    A duty to cooperate mandated by law is in essence a subsidy that transfers resources and rewards from the more efficient firm that seeks to compete to the less efficient firm that is dependent on cooperation, and it thereby injures the efficient use of resources by the more efficient firm, with consequent injury to long-term consumer interests. 
    In addition, a duty to cooperate would discourage risk-taking, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity. 
    If a firm that engages in risk-taking, for example, has to share with its rivals the benefits of successful entrepreneurial activity, but must itself absorb on its own the costs of unsuccessful entrepreneurial activity, then the law discourages such activity, to the detriment of consumers, of productivity, and of the competitiveness of American firms. 
    Second, a duty to cooperate is contrary to the antitrust goal of economic freedom, of autonomous decisionmaking by individual economic units. 
    That is a value that has been asserted in numerous decisions of this Court: in Topco, in City of Boulder, in NCAA, in Monsanto, in Copperweld, in many other decisions. 
    There are very few circumstances where our law grants to someone a power to coerce someone else to deal with them. 
    We have many negative prohibitions. 
    You shall not discriminate in various ways against various classes of consumers or others. 
    But the notion that a firm has a duty to deal with another or that the other firm has a power to coerce horizontal dealing I submit--

    Mr. Richard Melvyn Cooper 
    --That's correct.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1513.747" stopTime="1596.867">
    Justice Jr. 
    Mr. Cooper, I agree, I think, with most of what you say about antitrust law. 
    But tell me how we got around the jury's findings in this case? 
    The jury found the relevant sub-market was skiing in the area involving these tickets. 
    As a matter of general antitrust law, I would have thought that's a perfectly absurd finding, but the jury found it, and CA-10 said there was evidence to support it. 
    With all the other mountains in that area, it seems absurd to have a market that narrow. 
    The jury also found that Petitioner had monopoly power in the sub-market, and CA-10 found there was evidence to support that. 
    And finally, the jury found that Petitioner willfully used its monopoly power to exclude the Respondent from the market. 
    Now, I take it, in response to a question from one of the other Justices, you said your position basically is that those findings were contrary to the evidence. 
    Does that mean we must review the evidence and make a decision as to whether or not they were contrary to the evidence?
speaker="richard_melvyn_cooper" startTime="1596.867" stopTime="1658.289">
    Mr. Richard Melvyn Cooper 
    Well, in form you have to review the evidence. 
    In substance the task is much easier, because the only evidence, we submit, that could possibly support the jury verdict that isn't de minimus is the evidence of failure to cooperate in various ways. 
    And we submit that there is no duty under Section 2 as a matter of law why that evidence should even go to the jury, but even taking that evidence as established fact, it doesn't amount to an antitrust violation; that there is no duty to accept your competitor's coupons for entry into your own facilities; that there's no duty to have a joint ticket with your competitor; and that there's no duty to sell your tickets to your competitors so that he can package them with his own tickets to get tag-along purchases of his own tickets. 
    And if the Court launches on a new duty to cooperate, if it establishes that in antitrust law, we submit the consequences would be very deleterious. 
    It would create great uncertainty, for firms would not know when they had a duty to compete and when they had a duty to cooperate.

    Maybe the jury understood that better than antitrust practitioners do. 
    But it didn't... the jury did not have to find specific intent, and I would submit that if I want to drive my competitor out of business, I want to destroy him and hurt him, but the way I want to do it is by making a better product and selling at a profit maximizing price, I've committed no antitrust violation.

   Argument of Tucker Karl Trautman
speaker="tucker_karl_trautman" startTime="1826.901" stopTime="1902.132">
    Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This case, decided by the jury originally and affirmed by the Tenth Circuit, does not create a duty to cooperate. 
    Instead, the issue that you find yourselves having to decide here is to review the jury's findings. 
    That is, whether or not there was sufficient evidence, including all of the conduct that was presented at trial, to find that Petitioner's conduct, including its refusals to deal and its other actions that are noted, constituted monopolization. 
    That was the issue. 
    Two points I'd like to make in this argument: 
    One, because of the lack of evidence below justifying its refusals, Plaintiff seeks a new per se rule of free license for monopolists in this Court. 
    It has to because there was no evidence to justify its refusals below. 
    Secondly, reviewing the evidence under the established rule, which I will mention in a moment, there clearly was sufficient evidence for the jury to find, in taking all of the conduct as a whole, that this conduct was exclusionary, this conduct was in violation of Section 2 of the antitrust laws. 
    Now let me tell you just a little bit about how this case was tried, because as you know--

speaker="tucker_karl_trautman" startTime="1914.523" stopTime="2044.341">
    Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman 
    --Yes. 
    The theory of monopolization is I think as this Court has stated it in Grinnell, and that is that it condemns conduct which maintains or extends a monopolist's power, but it does not condemn conduct which is the result of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident. 
    That in a nutshell is the rule that this case was tried under. 
    And as a matter of fact, that rule was submitted as the instruction in this case by trial counsel for Petitioner, and trial counsel for Petitioner further set forth in the instructions that were proposed to this trial judge that competitors do not have a duty to cooperate. 
    He went on to say that they may refuse to deal, provided they have a valid business justification. 
    That's the basis, that's the rule of law, that this case was tried under, and that's been the law in this country since 1927, when this Court decided Eastman Kodak. 
    And in that rule essentially we set up a standard for monopolists which subjects their refusal to deal to scrutiny, and that particular rule makes some economic sense. 
    Whereas in a competitive market firms in those situations are disciplined by the market if they refuse to deal... after all, consumers can turn to other suppliers of the product... not so in the situation where a firm has monopoly power, and especially in a market such as this, where there are only two firms, one with over 80 percent of the market and the other with the balance. 
    A refusal to deal in that circumstance is not disciplined automatically as it is in a competitive market. 
    Thus the rule as set forth in the jury instructions which the trial judge accepted from the Petitioner essentially sets forth how this case was tried. 
    And as it was tried, both sides put on evidence. 
    Trial counsel for Petitioner put on numerous business justifications to try to show that its conduct was justified, including its so-called free rider argument that it's resurrected on appeal and still belabored in the Petitioner's briefs.

    Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman 
    Well, it seems to us, Your Honor, that there are cases where... for example, Associated Press is one I can think of, where newspapers that were excluded from Associated Press, wanted to take Associated Press news, package it with the news that they had gathered and sell their newspapers. 
    And we think that that's an analogy. 
    We think that this Court has recognized that a monopolist can leverage in a one-market situation. 
    You don't have to have two markets, as the rigid essential facilities test sets up. 
    Lorain Journal is a good example. 
    This case is Lorain Journal because we have a situation where the monopolist, a dominant monopolist, attempted to use his power to increase that power in a single market. 
    And this Court when it decided that case in 1951 did not make any fine distinctions between different levels of distribution or different products. 
    They were talking--

speaker="tucker_karl_trautman" startTime="2211.417" stopTime="2286.731">
    Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman 
    That is exactly our position, Your Honor. 
    It is not necessary to affirm based on the essential facilities doctrine, and the case wasn't tried on that basis. 
    Let me just mention... finish up, if I may, on how the case was tried, because after all of the business justifications were put on by Petitioner, they came to their motion for directed verdict. 
    And in their motion for directed verdict, their counsel argued vigorously on the market power issue and the relevant market issue which Justice Powell mentioned. 
    They argued vigorously, it was a close question, the court allowed it to go to the jury, and we prevailed on that issue. 
    But they did not mention the issue of monopolization. 
    And we apologize for not putting the actual pages out of the transcript in so that you could conveniently see it, but we ask you to look at page 1452 of the transcript, and I think that it's utterly clear that what was happening when the counsel happened to mention duty to cooperate is that it was part and parcel of his relevant market argument. 
    The court had interrupted and said, 
    "We think the evidence, as far as I can see. " 
    she said, 
    "I think the evidence showed that there was no competition to get skiers to Aspen, that the competition really began after they got there. "

    Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman 
    This was a colloquy in the directed verdict motion, Your Honor. 
    And in that colloquy, counsel was responding, because some of the evidence was, in terms of how the advertisements went, there was cooperation in advertising. 
    And counsel was arguing that that's not relevant to determining the market. 
    And then, in the context of that... and I'll give you the entire quote because I think it's important. 
    It is a narrow issue that this case can be affirmed on. 
    In the context of that argument, counsel said: 
    "Now, we also think, Judge, that there clearly cannot be a requirement of cooperation between competitors. " 
    "You've indicated that in your view these two companies do not compete with one another. " 
    "We think that's incorrect. " 
    "The advertising. " 
    --and then he's cut off. 
    And she comes back and reiterates her point. 
    And he comes and says advertising's irrelevant to the relevant market issue. 
    Quite clearly, the mere mention of the right word... that is, 50, and we think on that basis alone that the Tenth Circuit should have affirmed and we think you can affirm on that basis.

    Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman 
    That is not the basis, and we don't think that it expands anything that we received by the Tenth Circuit. 
    So we believe this Court can certainly address it. 
    Let me review, if I may, a couple of points of evidence which I think are crucial. 
    Mr. Cooper has made much in his brief and his oral argument about how this case creates mandatory joint marketing. 
    Well, there's more to this case than mandatory joint marketing. 
    Obviously, when you're reviewing the jury verdict you have to look at all of the evidence together and you have to see the whole picture that the jury saw. 
    And this case involved more than just dropping out of a four-area arrangement that had existed for 16 years. 
    It involved conduct, very targeted conduct, refusing to allow Highlands to market a package to provide four-area skiing. 
    And we think that that's crucial, because that element involves no price-fixing dangers. 
    It involves none of these things that are being argued here that go against the antitrust laws. 
    All we were asking to do, as tour operators were allowed to do, is to buy tickets, to come up to the window and pay full retail price.

    Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman 
    We contend that the law in terms of a monopolist is that you can refuse to deal, that is you can refuse to cooperate, if you have a legitimate business reason.

    Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman 
    Everybody agrees with the general proposition there is no general duty to cooperate. 
    But a monopolist, unlike a firm without monopoly power, when it does refuse, because that is conduct which is not economically rational at first blush, has to justify it. 
    And that's all the law requires. 
    In this particular case, the reason we think the jury rejected the justifications presented and the reason the court let it go to the jury is that we had targeted conduct. 
    We had situations where, when we asked to buy tickets in the first year, 1977... our first response was, sell us tickets like you do to tour operators, we'll package the ticket ourselves, we'll promote the ticket ourselves... they said no. 
    There was no question of price or terms or how we were going to do it. 
    They said absolutely not. 
    That's on page 34 of the joint appendix.

    That's correct. 
    Your Honor, we think that the evidence shows in terms of the sales of these tickets that they were targeted, because testimony by the financial vice president, statements were, the reason we're not selling you these tickets... and I think Mr. Cooper has essentially admitted this... is because you're our competition, whereas they would sell tickets to tour operators, which the evidence showed were also competitors, because what do tour operators do? 
    They do the exact same thing that Highlands wanted to do. 
    They purchase tickets, package them, and resell them. 
    And they try to get people to come to Aspen, and that's what Highlands wanted to do. 
    But Highlands was singled out over others because Highlands was also a competitor in terms of supplying services.

speaker="tucker_karl_trautman" startTime="2793.627" stopTime="3188.615">
    Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman 
    The Colorado Attorney General filed a lawsuit alleging that there was price-fixing. 
    The lawsuit terminated with a consent decree and the consent decree very specifically said the four-area ticket may continue. 
    Now, the coupons were the second flat refusal to deal. 
    After we couldn't buy tickets to put together the package, the next thing we thought of was, well, let's use the coupons, which are used, again, in Summit County They were used in Aspen for 16 years, a recognized medium of exchange in the ski business. 
    We'll go down to the bank, we'll deposit money so that they won't have any problem in the redemption process. 
    And again, a flat refusal. 
    Now, both of these refusals again were targeted, because they accepted coupons from other competitors and their customers. 
    We think that this type of conduct, where the consumer would show up at the window with a Highlands ticket, a Highlands coupon, and say please exchange it, and they'll say, no, we won't accept your medium of exchange, that they were telling the consumers the same thing that Lorain Journal was telling consumers. 
    That is, if you deal with us exclusively things will be fine, but if you don't we're going to make it difficult for you. 
    And that's why we believe that this case is Lorain Journal. 
    It falls into traditional exclusionary antitrust precedent by this Court, which focuses on conduct. 
    And again, the reason why the acceptance of coupons from competitors in other markets and the sales of tickets to competitors and skiers but the refusal to do the same thing to Highlands, that's important, because what that does is it disproves all of their justifications. 
    How could they possibly have free rider problems with Highlands, but not have them with tour operators? 
    Highlands wanted to do the same thing. 
    How could they possibly have free rider problems with coupons when they didn't have free rider problems in Summit County with coupons? 
    So we think that that contrary conduct in similar situations exposes those refusals to deal as ones that create no economic detriment to the incentives to invest in this particular company, as hypothetically surmised by Mr. Cooper. 
    And we think also that it reveals that it was targeted conduct, trying to prevent Highlands from competing with its package. 
    Let me just mention the competitive effect and what the evidence was on that issue. 
    Highlands invested in and helped develop this four-area joint venture, this four-area ticket. 
    It had been in existence since 1962, for about 16 years. 
    And in 1973 Highlands brought an innovation, creating Aspen Reservations, Inc., as we discuss in our brief. 
    And with that innovation came another innovation, which was the around the neck format, and the around the neck format is really what made this venture take off, which made this distribution system superior to the daily lift tickets, because now, instead of having to go back to the ticket window and stand in line every day, they could go right into the lift and go up the mountain. 
    They could choose any one of the four areas on any given day. 
    That particular distribution system, the four-area ticket, became the state of the art way of gaining access in multi-mountain resorts. 
    It coupled convenience with variety, two things that skiers when they came to such resorts wanted. 
    In every other market that Ski Company operated in, it participated in these arrangements. 
    In Aspen, after it kicked Highlands out of the four-area ticket, it didn't return to just offering daily tickets; it returned to a very similar type system which combined convenience with variety. 
    In short, the strong demand for this ticket, this type of an arrangement, made access to it crucial for a competitor such as Highlands. 
    And it's not a situation where we are, if you will, on the coattails of Ski Company's enterprise. 
    This was partially our enterprise as well. 
    This enterprise was one that we invested in with advertising dollars and that we helped out with some of our innovative ideas. 
    The refusal then of Ski Company to allow us to market our own substitute product by refusing to sell tickets to us or accept coupons had two fundamental adverse impacts on the competitive process. 
    In the short run, consumers were deprived of a product that they wanted, that they clearly had demanded, that they had voted on clearly and shown to be the preferred type of ticket. 
    And in the long run Highlands was slowly being driven from the market. 
    The evidence showed... and we ask you to look at Exhibit 97, which shows that Highlands was falling in terms of its skier visits, despite the fact that the evidence showed that it was a quality mountain, a quality product, and was efficient. 
    In conclusion, let me just state that an affirmance in this case will not create a duty to cooperate. 
    As I have argued and pointed out, instead well-established Section 2 precedent will be continued which permits refusals to deal by monopolists provided that they are supported by efficiencies or other business justifications. 
    In this case you have a jury verdict, where quite clearly there was strong evidence that there were no efficiency or other justifications to support these targeted refusals. 
    By contrast, a reversal of this case, in light of the record below, will result in a freeing of a monopolist to completely refuse to deal without any justification, even though there's a demonstrable showing of damage to the competitive process, even though innovation will be retarded, even though there will only be one competitor in the market potentially, that is Aspen Ski Company. 
    And we think that the antitrust laws mean more than just a call for trader sovereignty. 
    There are other interests that must be protected. 
    Thank you.
