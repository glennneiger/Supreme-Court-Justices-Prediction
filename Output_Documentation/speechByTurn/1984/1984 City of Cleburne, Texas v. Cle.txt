    Mr. Earl Luna 
    Now, as I mentioned, the city met these requirements that the state had, and therefore it was necessary to apply for a special use permit and have a public hearing. 
    At the public hearing and in court, it was developed that the home would have 13 mentally retarded men and women and two staff employees in this facility. 
    The 2,510-foot square... square feet of house... in another place the record shows 2,700 square feet... it had only two baths, and a half bath was to be added. 
    The 13 unrelated adults would sleep in four bedrooms, three adults in each of three bedrooms, and four unrelated adults in the fourth bedroom. 
    The building's location on a lot 103 feet wide and 156 feet deep, directly across the street from a junior high, with considerable school traffic, and in a 500-year flood plain, was of real concern to the members of the City Council, because just the year before Buffalo Creek had reached the steps of 201 Featherston Street. 
    And Bobbie Northrop, one of the corporate officers of CLC, likewise recognized this potential flood problem for the residents of this facility when she stated before the Planning Commission and it is in evidence as Exhibit 20, Plaintiff's Exhibit 20, we would evacuate the residents and not let the situation get out of hand so that an evacuation would not be possible.

    Mr. Earl Luna 
    --I am not sure that is so. 
    He said that he didn't... he couldn't give a technical definition. 
    There had been a public hearing, and I would be surprised if the people who were asking in a public hearing to zone it so they could have a home for mentally retarded kept a secret from the council what the definition of mentally retarded was. 
    I have an idea they told them at that hearing. 
    Surely they would, when they had two public hearings on the subject. 
    But they were not articulate council people, and they said they were not doctors, and they didn't know how to technically define it. 
    The special use permit requirement of the ordinance is not invidious. 
    A family's children can reside in the home with the family. 
    But if a person goes into the business of keeping other people's children, running a nursery, then this same ordinance requires them to get a special use permit. 
    So, the same special use permit that is required to run a home for the mentally retarded is likewise required to run a nursery to keep little children, the same ordinance and in the same paragraphs. 
    The mentally retarded adults that were here and proposed to be here in this facility, I think, are very much like the ones involved in Macon Association for Retarded Citizens versus Macon-Bibb County Planning and Zoning Commission. 
    This Court dismissed the appeal of a state court case involving a zoning ordinance with a classification that was based on mental retardation which were reviewed under the rational basis standard. 
    The three members of the City Council that we are talking about voted to deny the permit. 
    One of them who so voted was a grandfather who had a deceased mentally retarded granddaughter. 
    Another was a black man, now deceased, who had spent several years on the board of directors of a mentally retarded facility in Cleburne known as the C.C. Cook Developmental Center. 
    They apparently did not believe that these four unrelated adults in one bedroom and requiring 13 people to take a bath in two bathrooms constituted normal living conditions in the City of Cleburne, and that is what the policy is, to try to establish normal living conditions.

    Mr. Earl Luna 
    I don't believe so, but she asked, did we have to have the special use permit. 
    We have certificate of occupancy statutes and other building code requirements that would make it very questionable, and the record is not developed as to what the other ordinances show for a boarding house, for example, but I don't believe there is a chance in the world that 14 people, 13 people and two staff members could wind up using this place as a boarding house or anything else. 
    Now, the home at that time, located across the street from the junior high that we had mentioned, met the minimum state requirements at that time. 
    The state has now, however, since this case has come to light, reduced the number of people to be put in one of these homes in Texas from 13 to six, thereby, we think, recognizing the good judgment of the Cleburne City Council in saying that this was too many in this particular house. 
    The District Court found there was a rational basis.

    Mr. Earl Luna 
    Well, I believe that in this case, since a mentally retarded home in this case requires more than room and board, it requires training, habilitation training under both the federal statute and state regulations, that even if that finding is not set aside, it would not be the same thing in case for a mentally retarded home, because they are different. 
    And as Stigner versus Texas said, we are not required under the law to treat different things, things that are different as if they were the same. 
    We believe that there is a different need for mentally retarded.

speaker="earl_luna" startTime="1088.923" stopTime="1476.342">
    Mr. Earl Luna 
    Right. 
    That's what I'm coming to right now. 
    The District Court found there was a rational basis for these decisions, and the District Court based its holding that the mentally retarded persons are not a suspect or a quasi-suspect class requiring heightened judicial scrutiny for the Fourteen Amendment equal protection analysis on the reasoning of the Third Circuit case of Doe versus Colautte. 
    Now, the Fifth Circuit, of course, reversed, holding that mentally retarded people are a quasi-suspect class. 
    Now, in order to reach its decision, the Fifth Circuit created yet another constitutionally protected class consisting of all mentally retarded persons in the United States, and we believe contrary to this Court's decision in Youngberg versus Romeo. 
    This group is not the discrete insular minority envisioned by this Court in U.S. versus Carolene Products, but it is rather a large, diverse, and amorphous class proscribed by this Court in San Antonio versus Rodriguez. 
    Mental retardation, we have noted the definition of it earlier. 
    It is a problem of reduced ability to learn, difficulty with abstract thinking, judgment, problem-solving, and retention, and includes problems of social adjustment and economic productivity. 
    Now, the mentally retarded are a diverse class, a diverse group within themselves, consisting of several subgroups. 
    The mildly retarded constitutes approximately 89 percent of all mentally retarded persons. 
    The moderately retarded, the severely retarded, and the profoundly retarded are, of course, the subgroups. 
    Both the manifestations of retardation and the level of care required by each group vary to extremes ranging from requiring full-time institutionalization to those who are not even discernible on casual contact, which, incidentally, constitutes the overwhelming majority of mentally retarded persons, yet the Fifth Circuit has lumped them all together in one class, the mentally retarded. 
    By definition, the needs and capacities of the mentally retarded are different from each other and from the rest of society. 
    Unlike other suspect or quasi-suspect groups such as racial minorities, women, aliens, and those of illegitimate birth, whose stereotyped characteristics are not reflective of their true ability to perform or contribute to society, the mentally retarded characteristics do reflect an actual disability. 
    This relationship between the stereotyped disability and the actual ability to perform was formalized by this Court in Frontiero versus Richardson, and has become the threshold entry into a determination of suspectness. 
    Classifications based on age in Massachusetts Retirement versus Murgia and mental illness in Doe versus Colautte have been rejected as suspect on this basis. 
    The true novelty of the Fifth Circuit opinion in addition to a determination that the mentally retarded are a quasi-suspect class is in having done so contrary to and by completely ignoring the threshold inquiry and then requiring application of the heightened scrutiny applicable to gender and legitimacy to legislation involving the mentally retarded. 
    Under the Fifth Circuit requirements, the mentally retarded are in what is actually a no-win situation. 
    Since their needs are different from the rest of society, government can only address those needs by establishing classifications based on mental retardation and providing differing benefits, and yet the classification itself will fail if it is only rational and the government is then precluded from bestowing a benefit based on the classification, and the Solicitor General's brief deals with that at length. 
    Heightened scrutiny is not the answer to the problems of mentally retarded. 
    The legislative approach, if left unhampered, will provide for the needs of the mentally retarded. 
    It is doing so now. 
    Heightened scrutiny is particularly inappropriate for a zoning ordinance. 
    This Court has established a long history, commencing with Village of Euclid versus Amber Realty through its recent decisions in cases like Village of Belle Terre versus Boraas and its recent decision by Mr. Justice Stevens in Members of the City of Los Angeles versus Taxpayers for Vincent. 
    In each of these the Court applied the rational basis test to zoning classifications, and that has generally been done unless the ordinance was racially exclusive. 
    Otherwise, if it is fairly debatable or any set of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it, it must be allowed to stand. 
    Is the City of Cleburne's ordinance fairly debatable? 
    Of course it is. 
    We think the ordinance protected the mentally retarded. 
    What exactly does this ordinance do in this case? 
    It allows the City of Cleburne to regulate the appropriateness of the location and the structure of a business established to provide ICF-MF care facility for the mentally retarded by means of a special use permit.

   Argument of Renea Hicks
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1655.076" stopTime="1690.982">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case, in which Cleburne has classified a group home for mentally retarded people as a hospital for the feebleminded, is a crucial one for retarded people, involving what the trial court found as a fact is the current principal means of their gaining access to living in this nation's communities. 
    This case will establish the constitutional boundaries of what a city may do through its zoning ordinance to impede retarded persons' efforts to become socially useful citizens in this nation's cities.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1690.982" stopTime="1703.457">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Do you agree that a householder who had that place could run a boarding house with 13 or 14 people, with those rooms and two bathrooms?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1703.457" stopTime="1705.926">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Well, first, there are three bathrooms.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1705.926" stopTime="1706.778">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Three bathrooms.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1706.778" stopTime="1732.493">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Yes. 
    I think it is clear from the ordinance, it is clear from the trial judge's fact findings as agreed to by the Fifth Circuit that if everything else about the house was the same, then any other group of 13 people could locate there, whether they be a large traditional family, whether it be a nursing home that also might be certified under state licensing laws and the Medicaid program--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1732.493" stopTime="1756.442">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Do you think the legislative arm has a right to distinguish between 13 retarded children and their capacity to cope with emergencies such as fire and so forth, and either an ordinary traditional family or adult boarders?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1756.442" stopTime="1762.346">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --Well, that would be a closer question than this one is, I believe, but that isn't what--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1762.346" stopTime="1763.948">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, isn't that the question here?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1763.948" stopTime="1765.148">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --I don't believe it is, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1765.148" stopTime="1773.486">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, you have just told me that they could have an adult group there.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1773.486" stopTime="1774.553">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Yes.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1774.553" stopTime="1794.050">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    My question is, is there a distinction between an adult group and their capacity to cope with emergencies and the problems of living together in those quarters or in a bedroom and children who are retarded?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1794.050" stopTime="1833.711">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Well, the people that would be living here would be adults that are retarded, but I don't think there is a basis. 
    In fact, Your Honor, I believe that it is quite likely that in the event of an emergency, if this were a group home for mentally retarded people located here as opposed to a normal boarding house without being specially set up for retarded people, that the ability of the people in the group home for mentally retarded people to evacuate in case of an emergency would be superior to the ability of boarders. 
    And one reason for that is because there is special training done in that very area. 
    Besides that, I think it is important to keep in mind--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1833.711" stopTime="1846.451">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Let me see if I have got your response correctly. 
    These retarded people would be better able to cope than the general run of 13 or 14 boarders that they may have in the house?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1846.451" stopTime="1899.986">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I think it is quite likely that they would, Your Honor. 
    Once again, the very purpose of this group home is to teach them independent living skills, and one aspect of that, as required under the state program that is administered, is that there be special training for emergencies. 
    Most people, and I think this has happened many times in boarding houses, in fires, people panic, in general. 
    Anybody panics. 
    And I think it is also important to keep in mind that the distinction drawn in the zoning ordinance is not just between group homes for mentally retarded people and the boarding house. 
    It is between group homes for mentally retarded people and, for instance, a nursing home, or a halfway house for juvenile delinquents, and at one time one of the city administrators said a halfway house for paroled felons would be permissible here. 
    So, I think that it is important to keep in mind the distinction that has been drawn.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1899.986" stopTime="1924.602">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Wouldn't you think that they are entitled to make a distinction between the ability of people to cope on that basis, that is, if you have got former felons who are not retarded, and whatever the other group was, not retarded, that they could cope better than retarded people?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1924.602" stopTime="1927.987">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --Your Honor, I just don't accept the proposition that the mentally--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1927.987" stopTime="1928.754">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    I am not stating that as a fact.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1928.754" stopTime="1929.255">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --I understand.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1929.255" stopTime="1936.159">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    I am simply stating, are they entitled as the legislative arm to decide on that basis?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1936.159" stopTime="1940.877">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Well, I think at a minimum there has to be a rational basis for that decision.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1940.877" stopTime="1942.479">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    You say that is not rational?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1942.479" stopTime="1966.260">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    And I don't think that this decision that the City Council engaged in had a rational basis. 
    There is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that mentally retarded people would be less able to take certain actions than other people in this instance. 
    In fact, again, I submit there would be special programs set up that I suspect would ensure that they would react in a better way.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1966.260" stopTime="1981.353">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, aren't they in that home and that environment precisely because someone has determined medically or psychologically that they are not capable of coping as normal people are, as capable?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1981.353" stopTime="1986.072">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Well, that, I think, overstates the determination that is made.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1986.072" stopTime="1988.672">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, then, why are they there?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1988.672" stopTime="2113.871">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    They are there in many instances because they do learn slower, is the shorthand version of what mental retardation is, and they need an opportunity in a structured environment to do their learning, to learn, for instance, household cleaning chores and the importance of following through on those things, cooking skills. 
    This is, as the name implies, an intermediate facility, and most people it is hoped will move on to even more independent living in these situations. 
    I believe that it overstates the disability of mental retardation to say that they are unable to cope with everything in daily living, and that they are unable to learn how to better cope in some instances with certain details of daily living. 
    I think that the city's actions in this particular case and its justifications for its actions are a crystallization for the Court of the historical attitudes and mistreatment and underestimation of mentally retarded people and their abilities. 
    The city has offered two general justifications for the distinction drawn in the zoning ordinance. 
    One is that it is to protect the neighbors, in essence to protect society from the mentally retarded people. 
    The other is that it is to protect retarded people themselves. 
    This is a classic example of government's historical justifications for exclusion of mentally retarded people from many areas of American life. 
    On the one hand, it is argued we are here to protect society. 
    We exclude them to protect society. 
    Then, as an afterthought, the argument is made, well, it is really also intended to protect the mentally retarded people. 
    It is to do them some good. 
    I don't think the record in this case supports either one of those justifications. 
    As to protecting--

    Turning to the question of whether heightened scrutiny is appropriate for discrimination against mentally retarded people, I think that the class of mentally retarded people perhaps more than any other group of Americans except racial minorities fit the criteria that this Court has established for what constitutes a class that calls for heightened scrutiny when discriminations are made against it.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Your Honor, we did urge strict scrutiny before the Fifth Circuit. 
    They rejected it. 
    Again, I think that the standards that this Court has set, if applied here, would mean that strict scrutiny is appropriate. 
    But once again, trying to narrow the decision as much as is necessary, I think a heightened scrutiny at what has been termed the quasi-suspect level of scrutiny would be appropriate and would result in the invalidation of the city's actions in this instance. 
    Mentally retarded people are a quintessential, discrete, and insular minority. 
    I don't think anyone has argued to the contrary on that particular point. 
    They have suffered from a history of mistreatment that is virtually unequaled in this nation's history except for racial minorities. 
    They have been subjected to eugenic sterilization laws based on what has turned out to be misinformed scientific doctrines. 
    They have been isolated, as the trial court found as a fact in remote, stigmatizing living arrangements. 
    And I think that there has been much litigation that has come before this Court that delineates the problems in these large institutions that the Court was referring to, and I think no one questions but that they are stigmatizing. 
    I think that the result of that is that because they have been isolated in these institutions, no one in society or few people in society understand what mental retardation is. 
    They can only operate on stereotypes because they don't see on a daily basis mentally retarded people interacting at the stores--

speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="2516.650" stopTime="2645.018">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --Well, Your Honor, I don't think that a law that is intended to address the special needs of mentally retarded people and past inequities necessarily needs to be subjected to heightened scrutiny. 
    This Court has said before in a case such as Fullilove versus Klutznick that when remedying past discriminations is what is at stake, then there is a different standard to be applied, or alternatively I might add that applying the heightened scrutiny to those laws will not subject those laws to invalidation. 
    I think it would be very supportable. 
    And I think it is true that there is a substantial relation between any discriminations, if you want to call it that, drawn in, say, the Special Education Act, that there is a substantial relationship between that and an important governmental interest of providing an appropriate education program for mentally retarded people. 
    I think that there are many fewer laws that discriminate on the basis of mental retardation than might at first blush appear. 
    Quite often people think that guardianship laws, sterilization laws, commitment laws all necessarily discriminate on the basis of mental retardation. 
    While some do, the more modern statutes clearly do not. 
    They address neutral criteria and neutral traits that are not tied to mental retardation in and of itself. 
    They recognize what the city here did not recognize, and that is that there are individual differences within the group of people who are mentally retarded. 
    Some have more abilities than others. 
    It may very well turn out that some require commitment, but it is not because of their mental retardation that they require commitment. 
    It is because of other aspects that happen to fall in with the fact that they are mentally retarded. 
    So, I think it is overstating matters to think that a whole host of statutes would be subject to invalidation under this approach. 
    Furthermore--

    --Again, I think there is a much smaller universe of statutes that fit that, and my next point was going to be that invalidation does not necessarily follow from applying heightened scrutiny. 
    This Court has, in other instances where heightened scrutiny has been applied, upheld classifications based on gender, based on illegitimacy. 
    And it has shown itself capable of discerning when important interests are at stake and when there is a substantial relationship between the objective and the classification drawn in the statute.

    --Well, for instance, with people that are mentally ill, for instance, I think there is a potential difference between the immutability of the characteristic. 
    People move in and out of mental illness. 
    Not everyone does, but people do. 
    And those that are mentally ill at one time quite often are capable of having political power. 
    They vote. 
    They haven't been excluded from the vote as universally as mentally retarded people, for instance. 
    When they aren't classified as mentally ill, they clearly can vote, and they can have an impact on their community. 
    The onset of it quite often is later in life. 
    As to homosexuality, I think once again there is a substantial question of whether that trait is an immutable characteristic, and I think it is quite clear that that group of people exerts considerable political power in some areas of this country. 
    So, I think they are much different and are much... again, I haven't thought of what the ultimate resolution should be, but they are clearly not as close a fit to the standards this Court has set--

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Yes, Your Honor, there is. 
    They classify mentally retarded people, I believe... the Constitution says that idiots may be denied the right to vote. 
    Now, "idiots" is an outmoded term. 
    It is another example of how mentally retarded people have been stigmatized. 
    And it has been applied at local levels by elections officers to mean somebody with Down's Syndrome, for instance, who is quite capable of voting, couldn't vote. 
    And again, that happened in 1982 in the southern part of Texas. 
    Somebody that had Down's Syndrome was denied the right to vote merely because of that. 
    And it took an opinion after the fact, after he had missed the opportunity to vote, to change that. 
    So, I do think they still are disenfranchised in large part, if not de jure in some instances, then de facto because of what they know would happen to them when they go to the polling place.

    --That's correct, Your Honor, especially when the factfinders, the decisionmakers for the City Council admitted and testified that they knew nothing about mental retardation, nothing, or about the needs of mentally retarded people. 
    And I think it is fair to say that it is the very definition of irrationality when somebody makes a decision based on a factor they admittedly know nothing about. 
    I think, Your Honors, that if what Cleburne has done in this case in excluding mentally retarded people from its community, this group home from its community, then I think that, and this is after considered judgment, I think it is fair to say that there is virtually no limit set by the Constitution on what cities can do to exclude mentally retarded people from the community.

    Mr. Earl Luna 
    I wanted to point out that in regard to what was said about the statutes in favor of the mentally retarded, it is pointed out by the Fifth Circuit that it is not always easy to tell whether a statute is to the advantage of a mentally retarded person or is not to the advantage of them. 
    Some people might think that it is not good to have somebody supervising them 24 hours a day. 
    In other cases, it might be necessary. 
    Therefore, to determine whether a particular statute is good or--

    Mr. Earl Luna 
    But I think the Fifth Circuit was talking about in cases generally, and this Court has generally held that the rights, that the question involved in a suspect or quasi-suspect class is when the condition has no relation to the person's productivity or their contribution to society. 
    Now, in that way, the mental retardation is, of course, completely different. 
    It is different from blacks and women and the legitimate question where the suspect provisions have no relation to their productivity or their contribution to society. 
    In this case, the mentally retarded persons must be in many instances treated very differently, and some, of course, to the extremes, have to be placed in institutions, and they said in this case while they can come and go, at the same time the records show in this case that they sometimes would also have the authority to restrain them. 
    Now, Texas has a statute which affirmatively protects the rights of mentally retarded. 
    We have an entire set of statutes on rights of mentally retarded and protecting those rights. 
    Now, while on the one hand they have raised the question today about the Texas statute, on the other hand at the court when we tried this case they dropped all of their state claims, so they talk about their state claims now, but they were dropped out of this lawsuit at the District Court level. 
    And the two attorneys that represented the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, Mr. Hicks and his associate, are now both with the Attorney General's office, and the other one signed... who was with them, with that office at the time of trial signed the brief, the Attorney General's brief. 
    So, clearly the Attorney General's position was put forward in court by the same attorneys who were representing the plaintiff but are now signing the brief for the Attorney General's office.

 When we were asking about the reasons why the special use permit was denied, you mentioned, of course, the flood plane and across the street from the school, and both of those were reasons that were designed to protect the occupants of the home. 
 Were there any reasons that you would identify as reasons designed to protect neighbors from an undesirable change in the neighborhood?
