    Mr. Warren, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Robert S. Warren 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents the issue of whether a tippee who knowingly receives inside information in breach of fiduciary duty, intending to use it to defraud others, may in turn sue his tipper under Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act. 
    The case arose in the context of a suit before the United States District Court in San Francisco. 
    A Judge Schwarzer dismissed the action on motion on the basis of the following critical allegations of the complaint. 
    The Plaintiffs alleged that they had invested in a company known as TONM that was engaged in exploration for gold in Surinam. 
    They said that they did so by obtaining information directly or indirectly through the Defendant broker of a number of matters, but the following was the essential point, and that was that there was a developed gold find in Surinam, and that there would shortly be announced a joint venture with a major mining company in order to exploit that gold find. 
    The complaint recites that they were told that this was inside information obtained from a president or a vice president of TONM. 
    They said that they purchased shares of stock in TONM over a period of time from November 1979 until 1981 on the premise that this was inside information from that source.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Was that a violation of the securities laws?
speaker="robert_s_warren" startTime="183.540" stopTime="257.469">
    Mr. Robert S. Warren 
    At that particular point there is a suggestion that it would be, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    However, it was confirmed by what happened in or about april of 1980 when they contacted Mr. Neadeau directly. 
    Mr. Neadeau was alleged to be the president of TONM, and they asked Mr. Neadeau whether this information that they had learned from the broker, Mr. Lazzaro, was true, and they were told by Mr. Neadeau as follows: first, that he could not confirm or deny that information; second, he told them why, because it was not yet public. 
    Then he told them when it would be public. 
    He said you will have to wait until you see the annual report. 
    And then to make sure that there was no misunderstanding, that the information might be inaccurate, he told them that Mr. Lazzaro, the broker, was a very trustworthy and a good man.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="257.469" stopTime="264.014">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    And you suggest that was a signal that in effect was a violation of the act?
speaker="robert_s_warren" startTime="264.014" stopTime="322.021">
    Mr. Robert S. Warren 
    Exactly. 
    I suggest that the following is true, that under the analysis of this Court in Dirks, that that conduct, their subsequent trading with that information, that inside information, was in fact a violation of Section 10 of the Act, for the following reasons. 
    The duty in question is derivative from Mr. Neadeau. 
    Mr. Neadeau is the person with the fiduciary responsibility. 
    As President of that company he had a fiduciary responsibility to his stockholders not to selectively tell a broker and that broker's customers so that that broker's customers could trade, that broker could earn commissions, that broker's own stock could be benefitted... and these parties were told about the stock of Mr. Lazzaro and his family.

    Mr. Robert S. Warren 
    The complaint alleges a statement by Mr. Neadeau that the Plaintiffs allege misled them into believing that they had inside information and a jump on every other TONM shareholder in that he made a statement to them that they allege in their complaint... it must be to make it a charging allegation... was a clever confirmation while nonconfirming. 
    They said that he said yes, that he couldn't confirm or deny, but the realities were that when he said the reason he couldn't confirm or deny was because the information was not yet public, they would have to wait for that annual report to see that, but he did want to tell them that Mr. Lazzaro was a very trustworthy and good man. 
    There is only one inference from that, and if that is not... if that is not an improper transmission by Mr. Neadeau, then in the brokerage industry I believe they are going to talk about somebody being Neadeaulized because that is nothing more than a ploy, at least as they allege it, that's their charge, a ploy to indicate that they had inside information, an unfair jump on the TONM shareholders. 
    And they say that they acted on it. 
    They say in reliance on it, on the premise that they had inside information, they bought from other shareholders, and they bought at two, they bought with an advance knowledge of market conditions, and they did in fact watch the stock over a period of time from November of 1979 up to the first quarter of 1981, and indeed, in the last quarter of 1980, hit a high water mark of seven. 
    So based upon the information, the jumps that they thought they had, they did indeed have a jump. 
    They rode that stock from approximately two up to seven, and had they sold at that point, they would have actually achieved the results of their contemplated fraud. 
    They didn't; they held. 
    The stock did not pan out. 
    A public announcement was made contrary to the inside information announcing that the joint venture wouldn't go through; the stock went down. 
    So it is our position that on those facts, as disclosed on the face of the complaint, that Plaintiffs were guilty of a 10(b)(5) violation. 
    Now, it is understood that--

    Yes. 
    When the conduct which is the equal fault is itself fraud. 
    In other words, obviously if we have a gambling game where someone has gambled, and that is their fault, they have gambled against the state law and they are cheated with marked cards, then you don't have equal fault because one person has a fraudulent intent and the other person just intends to gamble, a small matter. 
    Here, these people are alleged to have had the identical intent. 
    Here it is alleged that Mr. Neadeau and Mr. Lazzaro intended to commit a 10(b)(5) violation.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Now, as I read the District judge, he said he wasn't going to get into a fine tuned weighing of quantitative dishonesty, quantitative fraud, quantitative violations of the Securities Act, that he was going to weigh and did weigh what he thought was the qualitative violations, and he thought qualitatively they were in the same boat. 
    Isn't that about it?
speaker="robert_s_warren" startTime="1023.902" stopTime="1188.259">
    Mr. Robert S. Warren 
    That is correct. 
    I believe that is exactly the fact, that the dollars weren't as important as the offense which was committed and the state of mind with which it was committed. 
    Now, we believe that if we are correct that there indeed was a fraud and attempted fraud committed by the plaintiffs then they should be barred because, first, the defense of in pari delicto is a part of the statutory law of the securities laws; second, it is based upon rational, reasonable and publicly accepted considerations; and third, the government here has failed in any respect to show that its enforcement will inhibit the enforcement of the securities laws. 
    First, as to the legislative point, Rule 10 is based upon the statutory section 10 which simply prohibits manipulative and deceptive practices. 
    As such, if construed to have a private remedy, it is a very general, federal tort standard with the contours to be set by the court. 
    In Briscoe v. LaHue, however it is correctly pronounced, it was said that when Congress passes such a very general federal tort even for very good and important purposes such as the civil rights statutes, it is presumed to be aware of the common law land the existing of common law defenses and to accept them into that tort structure. 
    This is particularly appropriate with regard to Section 10 because of the savings clauses that are found in Section 16 of the '33 act and 28 of the '34 act which accept common law remedies and deem them to continue in effect. 
    The federal courts uniformly, in applying Section 10, have adopted common law defenses based upon the conduct of plaintiffs, for example, laches, waiver, estoppel, ratification, consent, limitations, all of those based upon conduct by the plaintiffs have been accepted. 
    One of them has been in pari delicto. 
    The federal courts have applied in pari delicto in securities actions, and indeed, in the Kuehnert case in 1969, applied it to an action much like that here, also involving the tipper/tippee type of situation.

    I understand, Justice Stevens, but I don't think, still, in your first postulate, there would be any cause of action at all because the two parties may have engaged in inside trading, but there would be no relationship between the inside trading and the loss. 
    In other words, the party who received the tip would not have a cause of action against the party who gave the tip because of the concept of inside trading, there would be no deception.

    I do, if the customer, knowing of the wrongful breach of fiduciary duty, capitalized on it to his own benefit to go out and commit the fraud that he intended to commit on the customer. 
    He is a fraudulent party just as the defendant, and that's the only hypothetical in which in pari delicto can arise.

    The fact is that the comparison of I believe it is paragraphs 16 and 33 of the complaint, 16 being the representations, and 33 being the falsity, shows that we have a mixture, in other words, that they don't contend there wasn't any gold find; they quarrel with its state of development. 
    They don't contend that there were no joint venture negotiations they simply quarrel with the stage at which those negotiations had progressed.

    Because as in the case of Judge Weinfeld, I believe that is beside the point. 
    I believe that an attempt to commit wrong based upon what you believe is criminal activity is plenty enough for in pari delicto. 
    It is plenty enough for punishment for crime.

   Argument of Geoffrey P. Knudsen
speaker="geoffrey_p_knudsen" startTime="1879.715" stopTime="1920.922">
    Mr. Geoffrey P. Knudsen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is not an insider trading case. 
    It is a case in which the complaint alleged a common, garden variety fraud, and the fraud was perpetrated on the Plaintiffs. 
    The fraud was, as the complaint alleges was a planned... a plan conceived by the Defendants to manipulate the price of stock in TONM, not for the benefit of all, but for the benefit of the Defendants alone. 
    As part of the scheme, the Defendants--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1920.922" stopTime="1923.793">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, would that make it any less a violation of 10(b)(5)?
speaker="geoffrey_p_knudsen" startTime="1923.793" stopTime="1925.013">
    Mr. Geoffrey P. Knudsen 
    --Pardon me?
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1925.013" stopTime="1930.457">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    That he was... the narrowness of, the scope of the fraud.
speaker="geoffrey_p_knudsen" startTime="1930.457" stopTime="2035.316">
    Mr. Geoffrey P. Knudsen 
    Well, the scope of the fraud, as alleged in the complaint, would have some effect in terms of interpreting whether the Plaintiffs could be considered to be of equal fault or in pari delicto, but the complaint itself is meant to alleged a... just a fraud 10(b)(5) violation in the context of a market manipulation, and that the plaintiffs were injured by it. 
    What makes it a little bit different is that the complaint alleges that the Plaintiffs, who ended up losing their money, were utilized as an instrumentality of the Defendants' fraud. 
    In other words, it was the intent of the Defendants to provide intentionally false information alleged to be inside to the Plaintiffs. 
    They initiated the contact, they did it for purposes of having the Plaintiffs trade, driving the price of the stock up. 
    They never intended the Plaintiffs to benefit from that market manipulation, and in fact, as the Complaint alleges, when the Plaintiffs indicated some desire to sell when the stock got up at its higher levels, they continued the fraud so that they would continue to hold on to their stock by saying, wait, it will go higher, it will go higher. 
    So it is not a situation where the Defendants and the Plaintiffs embarked upon a conspiracy to somehow utilize inside information. 
    It is solely a situation where the defendants are alleged to have embarked upon scheme to defraud the market and defraud these plaintiffs.

    Mr. Geoffrey P. Knudsen 
    --Okay, and in terms of deciding in pari delicto, then if you are trying to decide it on the face of the complaint, assuming that you read the complaint that some is true and some is false, the complaint in my opinion would be a very bad device to make that determination of in pari delicto.

    I think that the 9th Circuit assumes that there is a line... there was a line of authority that says if you have a tippee attempting to trade on inside information, that he may be guilty of a violation, but concluded in the circumstances of the allegation of the complaint where an intentional fraud being perpetrated on the Plaintiffs was alleged, that more or less as a matter of law those parties could not be in pari delicto. 
    That is not inconsistent with the common law.

    Which at common law, if you have an actual fraud and the determination, there is a public policy issue if withholding the relief would do more to offend public morals, then in pari delicto would not apply, and that is the situation that the 9th Circuit addressed and said if there is a fraud aimed at these Plaintiffs and aimed at the market, then to withhold relief or to withhold the opportunity to pursue their claim would be more offensive in the concept of... in the context of in pari delicto.

    Do you agree with your friend's response when I put to him this question, that if this stock had gone up to 28 and then this gentleman sold out at 28, would you be subject to a claim for recovery from them, and then after that it dropped to where it did drop, 1 or less?

    I'm into Justice White's problem in the sense that if you read that there is some true inside information or nonpublic information and some false, and the stock goes to 28 based on an activity of trading, and then there is this true information about the gold find, yes, there would be liability. 
    The Complaint was meant to alleged a market manipulation that did not involve true information, or at most, partially true information solely for purposes of market manipulation.

    Well, to the extent my client is engaged in wrongdoing may not depend on that at all unless you look at it in the context of perhaps this court's Chiarella and Dirks analysis, and then you have to look at a duty to disclose, and then the question comes up how can you have a... how could the insider have a duty to disclose false information because that is the very thing you don't want to happen, but in ignoring that distinction recently drawn, yes, I think the SEC's position would be that it doesn't matter whether it is true or false, my clients are in delicto, as Justice White said.

I realize you are relying on a fraud theory, but supposing you had a case in which a plaintiff just said he got inside information which he relied on and was true and so forth and so on, but the stock didn't... the deal fell through and the stock didn't go up as much as he expected it. 
 Do you think the plaintiff has a cause of action there? 
 Your opponent says no, there is no cause of action absent fraud.

    Mr. Geoffrey P. Knudsen 
    No, that's a different question. 
    The Plaintiff, someone trading on true inside information is going to be liable for criminal sanction. 
    The SEC can proceed against him, and anyone selling his stock who loses, incurs injury, can proceed against him. 
    But that doesn't necessarily... that's really a separate question. 
    That doesn't necessarily make that person in pari delicto with a person who intentionally misleads him and provides him intentionally false information. 
    You see, he's not suing... in that case you are not considering the context of the tippee vis-a-vis the broker. 
    You are looking at the tippee vis-a-vis the regulators or vis-a-vis someone who lost money to whom he might have a duty to disclose the correct information. 
    In any event, given the legislative history of the insider trading sanctions act, I think they place the primary responsibility with the brokers and the insiders. 
    I think this Court's decisions that indicate that the tippee liability is derivative indicate that the person at the tippee level is going to be, in the common law sense, even the common law sense, of in pari delicto, not of equal fault. 
    And the facts... thank you.

   Argument of Bruce N. Kuhlik
speaker="bruce_n_kuhlik" startTime="2788.028" stopTime="2999.554">
    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I would like to focus on what the Commission believes is the dispositive factor in this litigation, and that is the furtherance of the public interest in deterring violations of the federal securities laws. 
    We think that there can be no doubt that allowing this lawsuit to go forward in the circumstances as we now believe them to be will further, will best further the deterrence of violations of Section 10 (b) and Rule 10 (b)(5). 
    Now, deterrence of wrongdoing is an important component of the in pari delicto defense as it has developed at common law. 
    The courts engaged in a flexible balancing of relative fault in order to determine which party was the primary wrongdoer who should be deterred in the first instance, and we think that in the federal regulatory scheme presented in this case where private actions such as those under Rule 10(b), or excuse me, Rule 10(b)(5), makes an important contribution to enforcement of the federal securities laws. 
    We think that the Court's decision in Perma Life Mufflers which held the defense unavailable in a private action under the antitrust laws because the defense would not further the deterrent purpose of the Sherman and Clayton Act, we think that that case requires that the defense be applied here only if it will further the purposes of the securities laws. 
    Now, I would like to turn first to the deterrence of wrongdoing by brokerage professionals and insiders. 
    I don't think there can be any doubt that allowing the lawsuit to go forward will deter brokerage sales people such as Mr. Lazzaro here from perpetrating frauds on their clients. 
    That is the whole purpose of the action to be implied. 
    And the only question then becomes whether or not there is some other overriding factor on the other side in terms of perhaps encouraging wrongdoing by persons in the position of the Plaintiffs that would, as I say, override this deterrent impact on the brokers. 
    And we think that that overriding factor on the other side just isn't present. 
    In the Commission's view, allowing this action to go forward will not unduly encourage illegal tippee trading. 
    In the first place, allowing the suit to go forward will deter brokers from giving information in the first place. 
    It will cut that inside information off at the source. 
    It won't be there for the tippees to trade on. 
    In the second place, investors in the position of the Plaintiffs, in the Commission's view, are often unsophisticated, certainly as compared with the brokerage professionals here, it might be believed that they were unsophisticated, unschooled in the law, and we think that for that reason the brokerage professionals are far more likely to respond to the deterrent impact of not allowing the defense here than ordinary investors would be to the deterrent impact on their trading of allowing the defense. 
    And I think that--

    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    I think when tippees consider whether to trade on inside information, they do not consider seriously the possibility of recovery in court if the information turns out to be false. 
    They trade on tips from trusted friends, from their broker, and they will go ahead and trade on it if they believe it. 
    I don't think it would be reasonable to assume that a person would trade, invest substantial sums of money on information believing there to be a substantial possibility that the whole information is false, simply on the chance, just the chance that they might recover later in a legal action.

    But I might add that, you know, I will get to this. 
    We don't believe that this is even a close case as to equal fault. 
    We think it is quite clear that the insider and the brokerage professional here were of greater fault--

    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    --Because, well, of a number of factors. 
    Because of their special position, but also because they are the people who instigated the fraud here They are the people who took advantage of the plaintiff investors, engaged them in a scheme, abused their position of trust to make them believe that they were trading on inside information when in fact it was the plaintiffs all along who were the intended victims, excuse me, and the actual victims of the fraud, and in this regard, I might add that the brokers and insiders such as those here, in the Commission's view, have a much greater opportunity to jeopardize the integrity of the market systems. 
    They are continually in a position to come into inside information, to represent or to misrepresent to their clients, to their friends, to their investors that they have access to this sort of information. 
    And the brokerage professionals such as Lazzaro here occupy a key position. 
    They control access to these markets. 
    If a plaintiff wants to trade, he has to do it through a broker, and it is up to the brokers to be... they are required to be conversant with the law, to be conversant with Commission rules, regulations and the statute, and it is up to them in the first instance to guide the trading of their clients into lawful channels. 
    And that position of trust was abused here. 
    And if the Commission is to be able to uncover these sorts of frauds perpetrated on investors, the only realistic way for most of these frauds to come to light is through private actions such as these, and I think there can be no doubt that the investors would have little incentive indeed to bring these sorts of actions to light because by doing so, they expose themselves to possible criminal and civil sanctions. 
    So without the incentive of recovering their investment, it is most, most unlikely that these sorts of frauds would be uncovered. 
    And finally, we would note in regard to the position of the parties here, that in the Commission's view, the in pari delicto defense should be available in those securities actions where the plaintiffs, perhaps the investors, have instigated an illegal scheme, are truly involved in a conspiracy with a broker for their mutual benefit. 
    But that is not what we have here. 
    That is why I would like to turn then to the comparative fault of the parties. 
    The Petitioner claims that under the common law, a plaintiff who is guilty of fraud is barred from recovering under the in pari delicto doctrine under all circumstances.

    Could I ask you in this connection, please, if all the information that the broker and the insider handed out was false, all of it was false, and they knew it to be false, and they passed it out to the investor who acted on it thinking it was true inside information, he buys stock, the stock goes down, is then the investor liable to the people he bought from?

    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    --I might have misspoken, Justice White. 
    In our view, if all of the information were false, then another party to a trade wouldn't have had a private action against the investors here, but the Commission most certainly would have. 
    If the Commission could have proved that the investors believed the information to be true, they believed it to be inside information that they had obtained in breach of an insider's duty, or they had notice of such a breach, the Commision most certainly could bring an action, civil or criminal action for an attempted violation of the law. 
    So in that respect, even if all of the information is false, it may well be that the investors here have attempted to violate the law.

    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    At this posture of the case, we don't believe the complaint conclusively shows that. 
    Under the common law, it was not enough simply, or it is not enough now, as the common law has developed, that the plaintiff simply has engaged in a fraud. 
    A more refined balancing takes place that takes into account the deterrent purposes of the law and the actual degree of wrongdoing. 
    And we cite a number of cases in our briefs where, for example, a plaintiff who believed he was defrauding others by engaging in a fixed foot race was allowed to recover, notwithstanding the in pari delicto doctrine, from the parties who had defrauded him, because the race in fact was fixed against him. 
    Finally, I would note that we believe it makes little sense to adopt a rule that would distinguish solely on the basis of whether the investors had noticed that the information they were trading on was inside or indeed was information obtained in breach of an insider's duty because we wouldn't want to allow brokers to escape liability simply by couching their tips in terms of inside information. 
    If there is nothing further--
