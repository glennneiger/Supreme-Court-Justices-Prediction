    Mr. W. J. Michael Cody 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is a case involving the interpretation and application of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination against the handicapped in federally funded programs. 
    At issue is whether the Tennessee Medicaid program discriminated against the handicapped by reducing the number of inpatient hospital days provided each Medicaid recipient in a fiscal year from 20 until 14. 
    The district court ruled that the change did not violate Section 504. 
    A three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit in a split decision found a prima facie violation of Section 504, reversed and remanded in order to allow the state to rebut the prima facie case. 
    The change which the Tennessee Medicaid program took in this case was an across-the-board deduction in inpatient hospital days from 14... from 20 days to 14 days. 
    It excluded no one. 
    It applied equally to the handicapped as well as the nonhandicapped. 
    This change was necessary because the Tennessee constitution prohibits deficit spending, and our program was in a condition that it would run out of money unless certain changes were made in order to reduce the financial commitment of the state. 
    And this change itself was made along with others which made the budget possible to have the Medicaid program run throughout the year and serve the public recipients. 
    This change, the state submits, was authorized by the Medicaid statutes and the regulations. 
    Congress has given the states discretion in setting benefit and service levels. 
    There are two restrictions that Congress places on those levels of services. 
    First, the level must be sufficient in amount, in duration, and in scope in order to achieve the purpose of the program; and secondly, the level must be set equally for everyone. 
    In addition to the Medicaid law, the State of Tennessee submits that the charge is consistent with the purpose of Section 504 and the specific regulations under Section 504 which refer to benefits and services. 
    The purpose of Section 504, we submit, is the evenhanded treatment of handicapped, not affirmative action in order to overcome disabilities which are caused by handicapped. 
    In the regulations which particularly refer to benefits and services, the regulation says that services are required to be equally effective, but in order to be equally effective, the benefits are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for the handicapped and the nonhandicapped persons, but must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result. 
    In order to violate Section 504, we submit, we would have had to extend a lesser number of inpatient hospital days to the handicapped than to the nonhandicapped. 
    The district court recognized this and found that there was no discrimination under 504 when an equal number of hospital days were provided. 
    The court of appeals, however, felt that a prima facie case was made because on the statistics introduced, the 14 days limitation was unable to meet the hospital needs of the handicapped to the same extent as the nonhandicapped. 
    So even if an effects test is applied, a violation or a prima facie violation of Section 504 requires a finding that the handicapped were affected unequally with respect to some program benefit. 
    Here, the benefit which the state is providing, the 14 days of inpatient hospital care, is provided equally to all eligible for the program.

    Mr. W. J. Michael Cody 
    Justice O'Connor, we do not believe that that would be the result, and it's the error we think that the court of appeals made. 
    They... we contend that the benefit which is provided in this service is a certain number of inpatient hospital days. 
    And I might add as the Solicitor General points out in his brief, if you look at the studies, the disproportionate result is even greater at 19 days than it is at 14, so the cut... the figures would show that less handicapped needs proportional to nonhandicapped are met at 19 days than at what we cut it back to at 14. 
    But what we think the statute does is it provides equal access to the program, to the benefits, equal opportunity to receive those benefits, and not an equal result. 
    And that's what these figures really are dealing with; that it takes more hospital days to have certain handicappeds reach full recovery or to get all of their hospital benefits.

    Mr. W. J. Michael Cody 
    --No. 
    I think that... that Darrone, the regulations there relate to a different situation than we have here. 
    Those are specific employment regulations. 
    In the benefit and services regulation we have argued in our brief, first, that if you go back to Title VI or Section 504 and look at Bakke and this Court's majority opinion in Guardians, that Section 504, as Darrone indicates, is a mirror image of Title VI, and that Title VI only prohibits intentional discrimination. 
    Justice Stevens, I think, went further, however, and said if... if that's correct, the regulations can provide an effects test even if the statute does not; but he qualified that to say if the regulations are in furtherance of the statute, and that's where we think there is a problem here in applying effects regulations to benefits and services afforded. 
    The handicapped are not a homogenous group of people. 
    There are many different subtypes of handicaps that require tremendous social services. 
    And in this particular situation, any time that you have users of social welfare programs such as the handicapped in this case, if you place any limits on the benefit, you're going to have this disproportionate result occur. 
    But we contend that that disproportionate result is not disparity or discrimination within the meaning of... of Section 504. 
    And the important consideration, I think, for the Court to see is that 504 requires equal access to the services. 
    As the respondent argues, is a person excluded from the program when he runs out of the 14 days? 
    Isn't that lack of access to the program, or have we excluded that person from the program? 
    I don't think that we have when it is merely a limit on the program and one which is consistent. 
    When that service runs out or the benefit runs out, it's just been used up, and it doesn't mean that that person is excluded from the program. 
    If this case... if we had to go to a prima facie finding just on the basis of disproportionate results that the handicappeds didn't receive as much health care as they might need and nonhandicapped did, then you would allow litigants every time that any change is made in a social welfare program such as this, that they could come in and if they are greater users, they would show this disproportion, and the state would have to litigate each and every one of those situations, and you would find that a very uncertain program would be present.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Bator. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Paul M. Bator
speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="829.736" stopTime="1120.692">
    Mr. Paul M. Bator 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Government's central concern here is to show why the particular version of the discriminatory impact theory that was adopted by the court of appeals in this case, why that version of this theory is really quite radically wrong. 
    And for that purpose I'll start out by emphasizing that this case is not simply about the validity of the 14-day rule, or about the validity of a reduction from 20 to 14 days. 
    Suppose Tennessee today abandoned its 14-day rule, went back to its previous 20-day rule. 
    Would this quarrel be over? 
    Not at all. 
    It's perfectly clear from the record that a rule that limits reimbursements for inpatient hospital care to 20 days has a more severe differential impact on the handicapped than the 14-day rule; that is to say, the handicappeds form a larger percentage of those who need more than 20 days of hospitalization than of those who need 14 days. 
    In fact, the odd thing about this case is that the higher the Tennessee limit went, if Tennessee had a 60-day limit, we might get to the point where those who have a... are excluded by such a limit may constitute 100 percent of the people with chronic and handicapped condition. 
    Or take the alternative that the court of appeals seemed to find attractive, which is to limit not the number of days of inpatient care, but the number of admissions. 
    It seems to the Government clear that that rule would be incredibly vulnerable to the theory of the court of appeals, because it would cut against all of those who suffer from those illnesses that need very frequent hospitalizations; that is, people who suffer from chronic and therefore handicapping conditions. 
    And the respondents' own solution here, which is to have the limit set in terms of the number of days per admission, would that rule not have a disparate impact on the handicapped under the theory of the court of appeals? 
    We don't think so. 
    I think if you set a limit of three days in the hospital for an appendectomy, or six days in a hospital for a heart bypass, it seems clear that that's most likely to be insufficient for those who suffer from some other complicating chronic or handicapping condition. 
    So the point here is that the court of appeals' version of the discriminatory impact is fatal to any across-the-board attempt to limit or allocate Medicaid funds. 
    Any funding limit or allocation is going to entail some kind of differential in terms of result on some members of some protected group. 
    That's why we think that there has to be something very fundamentally wrong with the theory of the court of appeals, and in our brief we try to clarify what has gone wrong here. 
    We think that analytically what has gone wrong is that the court of appeals tried to solve the question of what is discrimination without first analyzing what is the relevant program or activity or benefit as to which 504 prohibits discrimination. 
    We submit that that question cannot be answered by reference to 504. 
    That question must be solved by looking at what program Tennessee has set up here and what program the Medicaid statute funds. 
    The... Tennessee is free to set up whatever program it wants to. 
    That program must, of course, be harmonious with the federal subsidy statute, here the Medicaid Act. 
    Now, this is the matrix as to which 504 applies, and here we think the relevant program or benefit which has been undertaken and subsidized is not the satisfaction of health needs, but the provision of a given level of health services. 
    Now, the other point I'd like to make, Your Honors, is that at a conceptual level what is troubling here is that the court of appeals' theory of discrimination simply dissolves all possible distinctions between nondiscrimination on the one hand and a major affirmative action program to aid the handicapped on the other.

    Mr. Paul M. Bator 
    --We feel, Your Honor, that insofar as the statute incorporates an impact test at all... a question which we, the government, has elided here... but on that assumption, assuming that no intentional discrimination needs to be proved, that a discriminatory impact within the meaning of 504 exists only if the effect of the practice adopted by the state bars the handicapped from equal access to or an equal opportunity to get the benefits of the program. 
    Now, that may sometimes require special measures for the handicapped.

    --We are assuming that with that... with respect to that kind of practice, intention need not be shown. 
    That's the assumption on which we write our brief. 
    But that's not this case, because there is no barring of the handicapped from access to this program or from an equal opportunity, unless you reduce equal opportunity again to what we think is an unacceptable form of formulation, which is that there must be an equal satisfaction of all health maintenance, that the result has to be exactly the same. 
    Now, as I say, we do admit that special measures for the handicapped, as the Lau case shows, may sometimes be necessary in order to create equal access or an equal opportunity; but again, that is not this case.

    Equal opportunity to take what they've offered and that the federal government has chosen to subsidize. 
    Now, that means that the practice or measure adopted by Tennessee must satisfy the reasonableness and also the equality standards of the Medicaid Act, which do very carefully provide that equal provision with respect to scope, amount, et cetera, of service is required. 
    So it is not the case that Tennessee here is wholly free to sort of gerrymander the handicapped out of this statute. 
    That is not this case.

speaker="g_gordon_bonnyman_jr" startTime="1320.898" stopTime="1361.875">
    Mr. G. Gordon Bonnyman, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Let me say first what this case is not about. 
    It is not about whether the State of Tennessee can reduce its Medicaid program or any other federally-assisted program. 
    The case is not about whether the state has to resort to affirmative action to satisfy Section 504. 
    The case is simply whether when it does impose a reduction in social program it can do so in a manner which disproportionately imposes upon the handicapped or any other protected group a grossly... in this case grossly disproportionate burden of bearing the brunt of the cutback.

    Your Honor, I think the record is not... the record is not clear, but it suggests that an annual limit itself is problematic; that the... the evidence that was produced below suggests that... it doesn't just suggest; it is very clear that we were talking about a limitation that the State of Tennessee employs that very few other states employ, and that there are a range of other ways of defining the service. 
    And I think this is critical. 
    What is it that the Medicaid program funded by Congress is designed to give? 
    And what it is designed to do if you look at the Medicaid Act itself is hospitalization.

    No, Your Honor. 
    I think the court of appeals' decision needs to be read more carefully than... than the way it is being read by the Government. 
    And the court of appeals said only what the regulations which were upheld in the Darrone case say, and that is not that there have to be equal results, but that there has to be an equal opportunity to achieve the benefit for the results afforded by the program.

    Well, I think if you define it in terms of hospital services... and I think that's the correct way to define it, because that's the way the Medicaid Act defines it... the state, after all, is not free to go out and make up another definition. 
    If you define it in terms of hospital services, then what that means in terms of equal opportunity to gain the benefits of that service is an equal opportunity to gain admission to the hospital to receive that care.

    Mr. G. Gordon Bonnyman, Jr. 
    Well, I... I think critical to the... to the Solicitor General's position are two fallacies. 
    One is a characterization of our argument and the court of appeals' decision as mandating equal results. 
    And again, we are not asking for that. 
    We are only asking for what the regulations mandate, which is an equal opportunity. 
    If... if someone, for example, is quadriplegic and has pneumonia, as is common among... commonly occurs among people who are quadriplegic, goes to the hospital in June, the chances are he's not going to be admitted. 
    If he is not handicapped, the chances are very likely that he will be.

    Mr. G. Gordon Bonnyman, Jr. 
    Well, I think if you... if you adopt the Solicitor General's approach to impact tests, it's going to be very easy for any defendant in these case to resort to the tautology that the benefit, which is being distributed unequally, is whatever we define it to be. 
    We have defined this benefit as 14 days. 
    Well, clearly everybody has access to 14 days. 
    But that is not the benefit that Congress was concerned about. 
    Congress, when it put out the billion dollars of Medicaid dollars that this state had received had prior to the filing of the case in the district court, was concerned about meeting the health needs of people and mandated that states who receive this money provide hospital services. 
    So they were... I think you'd have to turn the Medicaid Act on its head to say Congress wasn't concerned about the effect on treatment of patient conditions. 
    It was only concerned that you pump out these dollars.

    I mean we have shown an alternative that... because we realized that the concern of any court was going to be... isn't, as Justice Stevens alluded... I mean the handicapped are going to need more health services generally, and it isn't anything subject to challenge. 
    And we simply wanted, not because we're proprietary about a particular alternative, we just put on proof to show that there are a range of alternatives, that the one we've talked about being one of them, which are available.

    Mr. G. Gordon Bonnyman, Jr. 
    Well, under... under the Medicaid Act it has not defined what would be minimally necessary in the number... in the amount of hospital services to satisfy the Medicaid Act. 
    Our contention, of course, is that HHS under its regulatory authority under 504 has limited that. 
    I mean that's central to our position; that the regulation which says the state cannot employ methods of administration which have the effect, if I may be permitted to read it, 
    "methods of administration that have the effect of substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipients program with respect to handicapped persons. " 
    That's 45 CFF 84.4. 
    And they are employing a method of administration that they... they are basically putting form above substance. 
    The substance under the Medicaid Act is meeting the need for hospital service... again, not completely. 
    It's not a guarantee that all needs will be met, but that is the focus, meeting that need. 
    Section 504, which is attached to that as a funding condition, says in meeting that need or in imposing a limit on the extent to which you're going to meet that need, you may not employ a method of administration which impairs the accomplishment of the objectives of the program for the handicapped. 
    And that's exactly what this annual limit does.
