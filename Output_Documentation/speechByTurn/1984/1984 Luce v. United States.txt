Luce v. United States

    Mr. Marcus, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. James I. Marcus 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issue presented for review this afternoon is, must the defendant give up his right not to testify in order to preserve his right to appeal an erroneous ruling by the trial court admitting a prior conviction under Rule 609A of the Federal Rules of Evidence? 
    The context in which this case arose is by way of a motion in limine filed in the United States District Court in Memphis. 
    In his motion, the defendant firmly indicated a desire to testify in his defense. 
    The issue was briefed, and the relevant case law cited to the court. 
    After argument, both the government and defendant moved for a ruling. 
    The trial court definitively held that a defendant may testify on the issue of flight, absent impeachment by way of the prior conviction. 
    However, if the defendant were to testify on any substantive issues in the case, the evidence of the prior conviction could then be admitted against him. 
    The rationale behind the court's ruling was simply that the earlier conviction, first, involved a crime of moral turpitude, and secondly, that it was a felony.

    Mr. James I. Marcus 
    After the defendant was convicted, post-trial motions in this matter once again raised the issue of the earlier conviction being improperly admitted as impeachment. 
    And again, the trial court ruled, this time in a written opinion, that the previous conviction was a felony involving moral turpitude, and therefore would be proper impeachment in this case. 
    On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, stating in part that, since the defendant had failed to testify and suffered the impeachment, he could not now complain of error. 
    In this case, the defendant should not have been required to waive his constitutional right to remain silent in order to preserve a ruling which is patently wrong. 
    The right to remain silent or to testify is a fundamental right of all defendants. 
    It is, more importantly, a personal right to each defendant. 
    It would stretch the doctrine of waiver beyond its limits to suggest that a defendant faced with these facts, that being an erroneous ruling of the trial court, a ruling which certainly will impact on his decision whether or not to take the witness stand to testify, cannot--

    Well, in this case, I think the motion itself, in looking to the facts of the case, arose at the last possible moment prior to the defendant's testifying. 
    The motion was filed at trial, and the ruling was just before the defendant was to take the stand during the course of the defense in this case. 
    So indeed... again, looking to the facts of this case, the trial court had all the information, we submit, certainly necessary to make the ruling at that point, and indeed it was the last possible moment for him to rule, prior to the defendant testifying, of course,-- 
    Indeed, if the defendant were coerced to testify and relinquish his constitutional right to remain silent, we submit this would be fundamentally unfair, based on an erroneous ruling of the trial court.

    At some point in time before that impeachment was admitted, the district court would have to rule.

    Well, I don't think it's that high. 
    And, if I could, Your Honor, I'm speaking simply not at the state level, but merely at the federal level. 
    I think... it has been my experience that the federal prosecutions often involve a number of white collar criminals who often times don't have prior convictions. 
    They do arise, from time to time though, in other situations, more violent types of crimes, bank robberies and things like that, where prior convictions are probable.

 The defendant could move for a series of rulings in limine on each piece of evidence the prosecution was going to tender, each prosecution... each piece the defense was going to tender, because presumably decision as to admissibility of any one of those pieces of evidence might affect the defendant's trial strategy.

    Well, certainly, I think in this particular instance, we have a rule, a federal rule of evidence which has to be construed at some point in time. 
    Certainly motions in limine are filed to attack motions to suppress certain other crucial pieces of governmental evidence. 
    It's not unknown. 
    Again, a motion to suppress is not the same as a motion in limine, but something akin to it certainly. 
    This is not unheard of.

    Mr. James I. Marcus 
    My reasonings being... this Court, I am aware, is the author the Gordon decision which predates, of course, the federal rule. 
    But we specifically found that the earlier conviction was an old one. 
    It was eight years old. 
    The rule provides for ten.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1008.135" stopTime="1009.218">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Eight years old?
speaker="james_i_marcus" startTime="1009.218" stopTime="1108.034">
    Mr. James I. Marcus 
    Eight years old. 
    That is correct. 
    The similarity of the conviction was extremely crucial in this case. 
    It was a drug-related crime. 
    And the defendant in this case was on trial, of course, for a cocaine conspiracy. 
    So the similarity of the conviction was significant. 
    We also found that the defendant had no subsequent criminal history, or I should say no conviction subsequent to that incident, earlier incident. 
    And we feel that the factors and the fact also... the case was, we submit, weak as to this particular defendant. 
    His testimony was extremely important. 
    The facts in this case were not particularly strong as to the defendant Luce. 
    We're not contesting, as the solicitor notes in his brief, the sufficiency of the evidence, but certainly his testimony was sufficient or was important in this case and was indeed extremely significant. 
    The effect of a ruling such as in this case, which was not in any way tentative, again as we indicated, but rather definitive, on a specific motion to limit evidence should not escape review merely because a defendant adjusts his trial strategy to meet the court's ruling. 
    The defendant took the judge at his word. 
    The court ruled. 
    We accepted that ruling and took this court at its word. 
    There was not any indication that he would later modify his ruling, but that he needed more information to make his ruling. 
    I think this is an important point. 
    The court felt it had enough information at that point to make its ruling. 
    And indeed, under the terms of this ruling, which again we submit is somewhat significant, it would not have mattered what the defendant said on direct or cross-examinations.

 Could the court make a better or sounder ruling as to the prejudice if the defendant had testified? 
 Because the question before the court wasn't... I mean, presumably, the defendant might have testified for several hours on direct examination, and you would never get to the question of impeachment until you get to cross-examination. 
 So that the trial court would have the advantage in that case of having heard the defendant's testimony.

    Well, again, in this case, the district court did not feel it needed that information. 
    It felt it had sufficient information to make the ruling, absent the defendant's testimony. 
    I think this would be, again, a rather harsh rule to adopt, for this Court to adopt; to, first, require the defendant, as the Sixth Court of Appeals does, take the the stand and wait for the court's ruling until the cross-examination.

    Again, in the facts of this case, it was not an abstract question. 
    The district court did not need more information, did not need additional matters to consider, did not need the defendant's testimony, but felt it had all the information necessary to make the ruling. 
    We would also suggest that the district courts rule on these motions routinely, and the appellate courts review them routinely.

    Mr. James I. Marcus 
    That is correct. 
    I agree with that proposition. 
    And I agree that the trial judge did decide this point, albeit, we submit, incorrectly. 
    And the Circuit Court of Appeals never saw fit to review that decision. 
    I don't quarrel with that proposition at all. 
    The trial judge is in the best position. 
    The single most important evidence to a defense case is the defendant's testimony. 
    Its force and effect on the course of the trial is well-recognized by this Court. 
    Often times, without it, the defense can only argue that the government did not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    With it, they are armed with a direct denial of the accuser's accusations. 
    It is also fair to say that the most significant factor in determining whether a defendant will testify is whether or not this prior conviction is admitted. 
    This, as Justice Marshall has noted, is certainly one of the crucial points in determining whether a defendant will or will not take the stand. 
    On the one hand, the government does not need this evidence to prove its case. 
    It is merely general impeachment of the defendant. 
    On the other hand, the defendant would be reluctant to testify in the face of this devastating impeachment. 
    The balancing considerations clearly favor the defendant. 
    We further hold that the conduct of the entire defense case will be altered because of the introduction of the general impeachment, and the defendant must either be coerced to testify to preserve error in the point, or remain mute and waive his right to appeal an erroneous ruling would be intolerable and fundamentally unfair. 
    To further suggest the defendant's testimony may not be relevant is unrealistic. 
    Anything a defendant says is important to the tryer of fact. 
    In virtually every case, the jury would want to hear from the defendant himself. 
    The more sensible approach, we submit, is that what a defendant says is relevant and pertinent, especially to his own defense. 
    We also submit that if a motion such as this is made, it is made in good faith. 
    The defendant indeed intends at that point to testify. 
    If there is reason to question a defendant's willingness to testify or the motives in filing of the motion, the government, of course, may address itself to this issue in response to the motion. 
    Also, to suggest that trial courts will not be able to rule on these motions is without merit, since they have been ruling on these issues for years, and in virtually every circuit, as we had pointed out earlier, except the Sixth, review is permitted. 
    I will reserve the remaining time, unless there are more questions, for rebuttal.

   Argument of Bruce M. Kuhlik
speaker="bruce_m_kuhlik" startTime="1480.172" stopTime="1664.172">
    Mr. Bruce M. Kuhlik 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioner seeks review of an advisory evidentiary ruling when the evidence was never actually offered or admitted at trial. 
    The Court of Appeals in this case determined that in that circumstance, the petitioner had failed to preserve his claim of error for appeal. 
    And I would like to suggest that the facts of this case show vividly why that rule is an appropriate one in these circumstances. 
    Petitioner made his motion in limine on the second day of trial, before the government had rested, while the government was still putting on its case. 
    Petitioner stated in the motion that he intends to testify in his own behalf; did not state that he intended to testify only if his motion were granted. 
    He did not lay out any testimony that he wished to give, and has never done so. 
    The court's ruling on the motion, to the extent that it can be identified, is set forth in the Joint Appendix at pages 21 and 22. 
    And I think it bears close scrutiny. 
    The court stated that if the petitioner testified concerning his flight to avoid arrest, his flight from the arresting officers, then the court would keep the impeachment evidence out. 
    The court then went on to say if, on the other hand, petitioner testifies about drugs, 
    "I've never had any prior drug involvement. " 
    then I'll let the impeachment evidence in. 
    And I take it, petitioner has no quarrel with either of those rulings. 
    Certainly, petitioner does to quarrel with the proposition that the evidence would not come in if he testified concerning the flight. 
    Moreover, in his brief on pages 14 through 15, petitioner states that, if indeed he did testify that he had no prior drug involvement, the impeachment would clearly be proper. 
    What is it, then, that petitioner seeks to review on appeal? 
    He has never offered any sort of evidence that he wished to present, that he was precluded from presenting by the court's ruling. 
    Moreover, the very fact that the district court looked to the substance of what petitioner would testify to in determining how it would rule on the motion, demonstrates that the court was, in fact, applying the balancing test that is required under Rule 609, and it demonstrates a more general point under that rule as well; that the court cannot make its final intelligent, informed ruling under Rule 609 until it has in front of it the defendant's actual testimony, until it has seen what the defendant has to say and seen how his demeanor and his credibility have been demonstrated before the jury.

    --Well, I think it would have been helpful, but I don't think it would have been enough, Your Honor. 
    I think that the informed definitive ruling can only be made, can only be intelligently reviewed by a Court of Appeals in terms of looking at the reasonableness of the district court's exercise of discretion, and perhaps most importantly, determining whether there was any harmless error, whether the error, if any, was prejudicial to the defendant. 
    That can only take place in the context of a defendant's actual testimony at trial. 
    That's the only time when the district court can say in light of... the district court may find that the defendant's testimony was so irrelevant or his demeanor so inherently incredible that impeachment would not be justified.

    Mr. Bruce M. Kuhlik 
    --Your Honor, and in that circumstance, the showing of prejudice is particularly difficult for the defendant to make. 
    You're talking about relying on a representation that the defendant intends to testify. 
    As this Court has recognized in Brooks v. Tennessee, the actual conduct of the trial with the defendant's own witnesses is an important determination in whether or not the defendant will decide to testify. 
    That's why the court said, in Brooks, that it was unconstitutional for a state to require a defendant to be his own first witness. 
    So, without in any way doubting a defendant's good faith, counsel's good faith, I would wonder about the advisability of relying on a representation made weeks before trial, simply that the defendant intends to testify.

    That is the narrowest ground on which you could decide the case. 
    I would suggest that the Court of Appeal rule is the best one and should be adopted by the Court, but the Court certainly need not go that far to uphold the judgment in this case. 
    I would like to stress a few points in response to petitioner's points. 
    The first is that, there is clearly no right under the Constitution or under the rules to an advanced ruling of this sort. 
    Courts are well within their discretion to refuse to rule on them, and they do it quite often. 
    And it differs significantly from motions to suppress, for example, for several reasons. 
    Perhaps the most important is that a motion to suppress can be decided without trial of the general case. 
    You're talking about a motion to suppress a ruling of law which can be clearly decided before trial. 
    Here, on the other hand, you're talking about a district court's exercise of discretion under the rules, balance and probative value, prejudicial effect. 
    These things are quintessentially things that the court can only finally determine at trial and, for that reason, there is clearly no right to an advanced ruling. 
    I would also emphasize that Rule 609 itself is not of constitutional magnitude. 
    Even where there is error, it's not... it does not rise to the level of due process, simply because a conviction is admitted into evidence in violation of the rule. 
    And I would remind the Court as well that limiting instructions are available on the proper use of this impeachment evidence. 
    The rule adopted by the court below, requiring that evidentiary claims be preserved only where the evidence is actually offered at a trial, has several benefits. 
    I've touched on some of those already. 
    One of the most important is that it makes for a clear showing of actual prejudice to the defendant. 
    Where the evidence is actually admitted, you have the defendant taking the stand, you can see the relevance of his testimony, you give the government a chance to decide in light of the defendant's testimony, and not merely in light of his pretrial proffer, either through counsel or through voir dire, to decide whether to offer the evidence or, in the middle of trial, to decide perhaps that the defendant's testimony is so weak and the government's tastes so strong, that it need not risk a reversal because it is far more likely to convict, even without the conviction. 
    You give the district court one last chance to decide the motion finally, when the evidence is offered at the right time. 
    This allows the court the opportunity, the appeals court, to clearly identify the ruling that it's reviewing. 
    I have suggested here that the district court's ruling was simply a denial or a grant of the motion. 
    In fact, it was rather complicated. 
    The court attempted to step into the vacuum created by petitioner's failure to proffer any evidence, and suggest if you testify this way, I'll rule this way; if you testify that way, I'll rule another way. 
    Petitioner may suggest a broader reading of the district court's ruling here, but when you are reviewing the ruling admitting the evidence at trial, its far simpler. 
    The Court of Appeals need not guess. 
    It's got the ruling right there, it knows what it is reviewing. 
    Finally, note that reviewing the rulings only when the evidence is actually offered at trial makes the job of the Court of Appeals in determining whether any error is harmless, far simpler.

    When the rulings aren't reviewable, both parties benefit from an advance notice of how the district court is feeling about it, how it intends to exercise its discretion, and both sides better plan their case.

    Mr. Bruce M. Kuhlik 
    They can't, Your Honor. 
    I would suggest that the Fearwell case, which is cited by the court below, and is a case from the D.C. Circuit, was one where the defendant had not made any proffer, and the Court of Appeals, without discussing the reviewability question, reviewed the ruling, determined it was error, said but we can't determine whether it's harmless, remanded to the district court to hold a hearing and for the defendant to introduce what he would have testified to. 
    Now, that sort of--

    Mr. Bruce M. Kuhlik 
    That's the kind of difficulties that you get into when you review these sorts of rulings outside of the actual testimony. 
    That type of result makes no sense from any sort of viewpoint. 
    And we suggest it's wrong. 
    Finally, I would turn to the fair and consistent treatment of defendants. 
    Petitioner has suggested that it is unfair to him to require him to testify, but this is really the sort of decision that defendants and their counsel are confronted with all through every trial. 
    The only risk, the only real risk at the present, I would suggest, is that defense counsel might inaccurately predict how the Court of Appeals would come out. 
    If defense counsel believes that a ruling admitting the evidence would be upheld on appeal, then the path is clear; the defendant does not take the stand. 
    Similarly, if defense counsel believes it's erroneous, the path is similarly clear. 
    Defendant takes the stand. 
    Perhaps the evidence is offered. 
    Perhaps the district court does admit it. 
    Then defendant has his point for appeal.

    Your Honor, there are some circuits, I believe, that have gone the other way. 
    This Court, in the Calderon case, stated that that is the correct statement of the law. 
    And that's a circumstance where defendant is put to what we concede to be a difficult choice: Do I do my best to be acquitted here by putting on evidence, or do I stake my chances right on my motion to acquit, which I believe was a good one? 
    Very similar to the circumstances here.

    Mr. James I. Marcus 
    Just briefly, in response to the Chief Justice's question, how can a district court ever review a motion in limine such as the one in this particular case, we submit the factors are present to balance prior to the testimony of the defendant, the age of the earlier conviction, the nature of the earlier conviction, the district court has the charge before it that the defendant's standing trial on. 
    There are enough factors present in the record that the Court can indeed make a decision. 
    We would also point out, as I just briefly mentioned earlier, district courts have consistently ruled on these types of motions for years. 
    Appellate courts have reviewed these rulings for years, whether or not the defendant does indeed testify. 
    The cases are well set out in both the solicitor's and petitioner's brief.
