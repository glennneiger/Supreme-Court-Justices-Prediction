    Mr. Theophil C. Kammholz 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court: 
    At issue in this case is the extent to which a state, by application of state law, may regulate the legal obligations of parties to a collective bargaining agreement and adjudicate the legal consequences of the breach of such agreement. 
    A majority of the Wisconsin supreme court held that Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 did not preempt a state court suit brought by a union employee against his employer, alleging tortious bad faith in the administrative handling of a disability claim, even though the employee's right to benefits derived entirely from a collective bargaining agreement, and the employee did not resort to the contractual grievance procedure which included arbitration at the terminal level. 
    The facts are simple and undisputed. 
    Allis-Chalmers and the UAW union for many years have been parties to collective bargaining agreements. 
    The current agreement at issue here incorporates a group health and disability plan funded by Allis-Chalmers and administered by Aetna Insurance Company. 
    Disability benefits are provided for non-occupational illness and injury to all UAW represented employees, including Lueck. 
    The agreement between the UAW and Allis-Chalmers also contains a provision for resolution of disputes, as I have noted earlier. 
    It's a typical union contract dispute resolution procedure, grievance procedure, culminating in arbitration at the final level. 
    Lueck suffered a nonwork-related disability. 
    Payments were initiated under the plan. 
    Lueck ultimately received all that was due him under the plan, but there was some delay in payment with respect to some of the obligation under the plan. 
    Lueck did not go to his union. 
    He did not go to the grievance procedure. 
    What he did do was to go to the circuit court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin and file a lawsuit against Allis-Chalmers alleging contemptuous, deliberate, repeated conduct on the part of the company in failing to pay... make payments promptly. 
    He further alleged that as as result of the defendant's bad faith, he incurred emotional distress, pain and suffering, physical impairment, all to his damages to the extent of $10,000 compensatory and $300,000 punitive. 
    With respect to the circuit court suit, Allis-Chalmers and Aetna raised two defenses. 
    First, that the suit was preempted by Section 301 of the labor Management Relations Act; and secondly, that Lueck had not resorted to the contractual grievance procedure.

    Mr. Theophil C. Kammholz 
    --The record does not show this. 
    It may well be. 
    The reason I say the record does not show it, the case went up on summary judgment. 
    And I was about to come to that motion for summary judgment on the failure to exhaust the grievance procedure and on account of preemption under 301. 
    The circuit court granted motion for summary judgment on behalf of both defendants Allis-Chalmers and Aetna. 
    An appeal was taken to the Wisconsin court of appeals. 
    It affirmed the lower court decision. 
    And further appealed to the Wisconsin supreme court with respect to certiorari, to wit we're here today. 
    A majority of that court in January of last year, relying on what it said were long-established principles of state insurance law, held that any violation of the labor agreement was irrelevant to the issue of bad faith handling of the disability claim. 
    Further, the court said there was no 301 presumption 
    "even though the insurance contract is part of a labor agreement otherwise governed by federal law. " 
    By implication, the court further held that there was no need to resort to the grievance procedure because it did not comment on the grievance procedure. 
    The single dissent in the Wisconsin supreme court concluded that any duty allegedly violated by Allis-Chalmers was specifically created by the labor contract and would not exist absent the labor contract. 
    Consequently, the dissent concluded, it must fail within... on account of the ambit of Section 301 which governs labor agreements. 
    The dissent further noted that there should have been an exhaustion of remedies under the grievance procedure which did not occur. 
    Finally, the dissent concluded that the mere existence of a state tort of bad faith is insufficient to override uniformity in application of federal labor law, and to do as the majority holds fragments federal labor law. 
    I have gone into some detail here on what happened in the court below because I think that puts into sharp focus precisely the issues before you here this afternoon. 
    We respectfully submit that this is a 301 case, pure and simple... a labor agreement, grievance procedure, arbitration at the terminal level, no attempt to grieve. 
    Since the enactment of LMBA in 1947 and beginning with the first significant decision in that area in 1957, the Lincoln Mills case, and continuing through the Steelworkers trilogy in 1950, Boys Market in 1957, I believe, the law has consistently held that it's federal law that must be fashioned by the courts, federal law and not state law. 
    And yet, the result of the supreme court decision of Wisconsin here would fragment that federal law and permit encroachment on the exclusivity that is created under LMBA and under the decided cases. 
    With respect to the preemption aspect, we suggest also that the law is crystal clear. 
    In Lucas Flower in 1962 the Court first articulated the concept of preemption of state law. 
    This has been applied consistently and without exception over the years. 
    The erosion that would result from acceptance of the Wisconsin doctrine would be... would have very serious implications on the federal labor scene. 
    In that respect I think it is appropriate for me to note the cogent amicus brief filed by the AFL-CIO and a similar brief by the United States Chamber of Commerce. 
    These briefs state in some detail their view as to what would result if state action could be accorded the kind of finality that would apply under the Wisconsin decision. 
    The issue is simple: does Wisconsin as a state have the right to impose insurance principles in the context of a collective bargaining agreement governed by federal law with arbitration in the grievance procedure also included in that contract, and which--

   Argument of Gerald S. Boisits
speaker="gerald_s_boisits" startTime="905.978" stopTime="944.446">
    Mr. Gerald S. Boisits 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court: 
    Before proceeding into my response to Mr. Kammholz's argument, I'd like to clarify a few of the facts that I believe are part of the record. 
    First of all, while Mr. Kammholz does admit to the fact that these disability benefits on behalf of Mr. Lueck were eventually received, the record should show that Mr. Lueck received these benefits only after Allis-Chalmers and Aetna Insurance Company were served with his cause of action.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Did his claim arise under the union contract?
speaker="gerald_s_boisits" startTime="951.755" stopTime="978.838">
    Mr. Gerald S. Boisits 
    Your Honor, yes and no, all right. 
    First of all, as far as the union contract is concerned, we've got a contract that on one hand provides for the normal things that a labor contract provides for... labor, conditions of employment, wages, that type of thing. 
    Then we have a peripheral thing where the insurance or the employer has, in addition, provided some health benefits and--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="978.838" stopTime="983.445">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Did that derive from an agreement between the company and the union?
speaker="gerald_s_boisits" startTime="983.445" stopTime="1054.370">
    Mr. Gerald S. Boisits 
    --It did come from the agreement. 
    It's specifically mentioned in the union contract. 
    It was something that was negotiated. 
    I can't argue with that. 
    The problem I have in looking at the case is primarily the situation where they've accepted the obligations to insure Mr. Lueck under a disability policy, and they've therefore basically put on the hat of an insurance company and are now attempting by virtue of Section 301 to avoid some of the obligations that the state recognizes as mandatory as far as someone that's acting as an insurance company. 
    And in that situation, Mr. Lueck is really caught between a rock and a hard place basically, because he can go through the union procedures, and what's basically provided under those union procedures is that he's going to collect whatever disability benefits he's entitled to if they were denied, and perhaps maybe some interest that he lost... that's not clear by the contract... and that's it. 
    The insuring employer can therefore basically be entitled to a free play with his insurance benefits.

    Mr. Gerald S. Boisits 
    The state can step in and allow Mr. Lueck compensatory damages and punitive damages just like was discussed in the previous case. 
    They cannot rule as to the eligibility as far as disability benefits are concerned. 
    That's something that the parties to the labor agreement anticipated, and that's something that they've agreed to go through arbitration process on. 
    But they have not... there is nothing in that contract to indicate what... if there are any procedures in respect to how the employer, who is an insurer... I think the key thing here as far as the Court should consider is that the... that the employer now has stepped out of the shoes of an employer and has taken on the guise of an insurance company; and as a result, they become amenable to some of the equitable principles.

 --Well, if the union became convinced that Allis-Chalmers was horsing some of its members around, as you put it, on these disability payments, couldn't the union decide that we don't want to submit that kind of thing to arbitration and simply withdraw that from the arbitration contract, and that then you'd really be in a lot better position, I would think.

    Mr. Gerald S. Boisits 
    Just the disability, not... Wisconsin looked at this as a separate tort action, just like it looked... this Court has looked at as emotional distress, intentional causing emotional distress, malicious libel... those type of cases. 
    This Court has looked at those things and has designed a policy to show that yes, you can go into court... if the action is of a particularly contemptuous nature, you can go into court and sue on that. 
    There won't be any infringement on it. 
    It was said in Farmer. 
    It was said in other cases, which admittedly do deal with the Garman exceptions or the Garman preemption doctrine and the related cases. 
    However, I think that it's important to note that the first criteria under the Garman ruling is basically, one, number one, that the court has got to see whether or not there's any conflict with Section 301, with the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    That's the first criteria that's stated in the Garman case.

    Justice, I'm not trying. 
    I'm just saying, though, that the way the forces are on this course that there's danger on... as far as contracts are concerned, that individuals cannot have any redress if someone on a labor contract horses them around, unless that contract is renegotiated and re-evaluated by the parties. 
    And what if it isn't? 
    Both parties have interest not to have a bad faith claim brought against them. 
    They don't want to have to deal with that.

    I think that's why they're there. 
    I don't think they're looking at this as an infringement. 
    This is a... this is a type of case where... that they can become amenable to this type of action.

    Well, may I ask you on that point, this contract, as I remember it, there's some supplementary correspondence about insurance-related matters, that they had some kind of a special arbitration procedure. 
    If they had said in those documents insurance-related matters shall include arbitration of claims that the company was slow in paying, for bad faith or otherwise, and that the arbitrator would have the authority to grant appropriate relief if that happens, would you then feel you had to go through that procedure?

    Well, then, may I ask why couldn't one argue that your first step in this problem, if it's a general problem, is to ask the union to negotiate such a provision, or to bring a proceeding and see whether they might not even interpret the existing documents to give that relief? 
    I suppose it's conceivable that if you took the claim to arbitration and said that insurance-related matters includes claims of this kind as well, and if you have very sympathetic facts, as presumably you do.

    --Well, I'd say as far as Mr. Lueck was concerned, if he looked at the thing and he determined that this is a wage-related or he felt it was a wage-related condition of employment situation, yes, he would go to the arbitrator. 
    However, he could be misled because of the statements that are in the Joint Appendix on page 42 and 43. 
    When looking at this, it was my feeling and, of course, Mr. Lueck's as a result, that the statements that the... the... are in that letter are supplementing the labor agreement. 
    They're treating it as a separate thing. 
    They're treating the insurance benefits as a separate thing, and there they're just referring to the discontinuance of weekly disability payments.

    Mr. Gerald S. Boisits 
    --But they're making the final decision as to whether or not we're going to refer it back to the labor agreement, Justice. 
    And, in addition... well, 42, page 42, that letter again shows that it only deals with disability benefits and nothing else. 
    So, again, we would be consistent with what they're saying here, that we'd be going through the labor agreement in respect to discontinuance of weekly disability benefits, and that's it. 
    If I may make a suggestion to the Court, I think the Court, at least as far as the philosophy is concerned, has addressed this question in respect to the Garman preemption situation. 
    A short note: the Garman preemption arguments as presented by myself were originally brought up in the circuit court and determined by Justice Lamponi in the circuit court on the two grounds: one, Section 301 preemption; and number two, on the basis of Garman. 
    That argument was brought all the way through the Wisconsin courts, and that's why the Wisconsin court relied heavily on the Garman argument, primarily because it was raised by opposing counsel and Allis-Chalmers. 
    I'd like to bring out just two points as far as the Garman preemptions considerations are. 
    The Court did appear hard-pressed when they talked about, say, emotional distress in the Farmer decision. 
    In other words, it appeared to me as reading the decision that the Court wanted to make perfectly clear that as far as the emotional distress situation is concerned, that that would have to be something completely separate out of this wage and conditions of employment argument. 
    That the... the... we have to... we have to look at the type of conduct that was promulgated by the tort feasor. 
    In other words, in that case it was my understanding that the emotional distress was a function of the particularly abusive manner in which the claimant was handled by the union officials, and that the matters dealing with the negotiation of the contract or the rates under the contract were completely separate. 
    And you can see, at least from my reading of it, it seems that this Court has attempted to distinguish that. 
    That's basically all that Mr. Lueck is doing. 
    He's attempting to show that there was a particularly abusive manner in which he was treated that's separate and distinct from the labor contract, and that yes, he can go through the remedies that are afforded by the labor contract, and yes, he can go into state court and go after that separate tort and the remedies that are available there. 
    The dual functions are served. 
    The Section 301 is remaining intact, and the state interest in making sure that insurance companies don't horse an individual around are also remain intact. 
    They can go hand in hand. 
    They do not necessarily butt heads. 
    Another argument as far as the Garman philosophy is concerned is that the Section 301 preemption argument is incorporated in the Garman exceptions. 
    Number one, the number one criteria where it talks of whether or not the action is one of peripheral concern to the Labor Management Relations Act, that directly goes to Section 301 considerations, whether or not Section 301 applies. 
    The Wisconsin court saw the tort as separate and distinct and that it did not infringe on the Section 301 rights. 
    And as a result, he's able to bring that state court action. 
    And again, the whole situation, it accommodates, it accommodates. 
    Mr. Lueck's action accommodates both the state interest and the federal interest under 301. 
    The decision of the Wisconsin supreme court noted that. 
    They paid due deference to the decisions of this Court. 
    They're just saying that he's proceeding on a different... he's proceeding on a different track. 
    He's trying to get some recovery and redress, something that you're entitled to. 
    He's trying to get the redress for... for the abusive manner he was treated in. 
    Now, I know that the ERISA argument as posed by Justice Day is going to probably depend on how the decisions come out on the case that was previous to this one. 
    However, I'd like to note again that there is a federal policy, at least as we stand now, that the federal policy that's put in the McCarran-Ferguson Act clearly shows that there should be no preemption here of the state right to regulate the insurance activities. 
    The situation that we have here is pretty much like what happened... the provisions in the labor agreement, as far as the insurance benefits are concerned, the insurance portion of the brief, of the contract, indicates that Allis-Chalmers had a choice of whether or not to self-insure or whether or not to hire somebody, an insurance company, to insure them and that type of thing. 
    Now, the question I'd pose to the Court is what would happen if Allis-Chalmers in this case allowed another insurance company to insure the disability plan; rather than Allis-Chalmers being self-insured, they hired another company, and they paid premiums to that company for those benefits. 
    If the argument of opposing counsel remains consistent, apparently that insurance company can claim the exemption for the same reason that they're claiming it now; that they are not amenable to any state regulation; that it's a Section 301 situation; and that if the insurance company doesn't pay, we'll go through the arbitration process and determine whether or not they have an obligation to pay in this case. 
    They have now... the insurance company has now been able to avoid any liability by attaching itself to Allis-Chalmers. 
    In big letters in my argument I basically would like to show the Court is a distinguishing case as far as Section 301 is concerned. 
    The employer has changed hats. 
    They are providing for insurance benefits. 
    They've taken a self-insured position, and now they're claiming an immunity because of that self-insured position. 
    And in addition to that, I guess that immunity would go to anybody they'd hire, because the labor agreement provides for that type of benefit, and therefore, anybody they hire or anybody that does anything in respect to that insurance is going to be immune from the type of action that Mr. Lueck has brought. 
    He has nowhere to go, and to not allow him to go anywhere I think steps on a state decision, a majority decision, that can accommodate the vague statements as far as Section 301 is concerned. 
    It's for actions arising out of contract. 
    Wisconsin says it has... this does not arise out of the contract. 
    It's a separate and distinct tort. 
    And therefore, it's my opinion... and I--

    I have a question, Mr. Kammholz. 
    Supposing that in this contract Allis-Chalmers, instead of acting as a self-insurer, had simply provided that as one of the benefits it was giving employees it would provide them with a disability policy with Aetna Life Insurance Company, but the contract also said that any disagreement between the employees and Aetna Life Insurance Company over the payment of a disability would be submitted to arbitration the same way a grievance is to the conditions in the plant. 
    Do you think federal labor policy requires a state court to apply federal law to that situation?
