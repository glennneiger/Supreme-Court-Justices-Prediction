    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in Oklahoma against Castleberry and Raineri. 
    Mr. Lee, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. David William Lee 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issues in this case which primarily arise under the principles announced by this Court in United States versus Ross are as follows: first, whether there was probable cause to believe that the defendants' vehicle in this case contained contraband, and secondly, assuming there was such probable cause, whether the police acted properly in searching without a search warrant three suitcases in the trunk of the car and the bandaid box which was found on the dashboard of the car. 
    Of course, the state contends that the answer to these questions is in the affirmative. 
    The facts in the present case are that at noon on the day in question, Officer Taylor, a narcotics officer with the Oklahoma City Police Department, received a telephone call from a confidential informant. 
    The informant stated that he had been within the room in question, Room 113, within the last ten hours and had observed a large quantity of marijuana, some cocaine, and some other white pills. 
    The informant stated that some of the drugs in question were in a blue suitcase. 
    The informant gave the officer a description of the men that were in the room. 
    The informant also stated that one of the names of the men who were in the room was named Tim Castleberry, and that the other man was named Nick. 
    The informant stated that these men were driving a blue 1980 or '81 Thunderbird with Florida license plates. 
    Officer Taylor took this information and immediately proceeded to the motel in question, which is located on an interstate highway in Oklahoma City--

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Didn't the informant add a little more, that they were carrying this material in suitcases that were a particular color?
speaker="david_william_lee" startTime="173.211" stopTime="425.088">
    Mr. David William Lee 
    --Yes, Your Honor, the informant specifically told the officer that some of the narcotics was in a blue suitcase which was... which the informant stated that he had observed in the last ten hours. 
    Officer Taylor drove to the motel, went in, and drove through the parking lot and observed parked in front of Room 113, the room which the informant had referred to, he noticed parked immediately in front of the room a blue 1980 or '81 Thunderbird with Florida license plates. 
    Taylor parked his car, went in, and found out from the room clerk that the room was registered to Tim Castleberry, which is the name of the person referred to by the informant. 
    He said Castleberry had paid for only the previous night, and that checkout time was at 1:00 p.m., and that he would be leaving at 1:00 p.m. At this time, it was approximately ten minutes until l: 00 o'clock. 
    The officer then returned to the car, which was approximately five space away from the blue Thunderbird, and called for a backup. 
    While waiting there for his backup to arrive, he observed the defendant Castleberry come from Room 113 carrying a blue suitcase which matched the description of the one given to him by the informant which stated that some of the narcotics were in that particular suitcase. 
    Taylor watched him put the blue suitcase in the trunk of the Thunderbird. 
    He then saw the defendant Raineri also leave Room 113 carrying two green plaid suitcases, which he also observed him place these in the trunk of the car. 
    He then observed Castleberry come out of the room a second time and place a blue suitcase in the back seat of the car behind the driver's side. 
    At this time Officer Taylor felt like he needed to take action. 
    He got out of the car. 
    He drew his gun. 
    He approached the two men. 
    He advised them he was an Oklahoma City police officer. 
    He stated that... he had his badge displayed and his gun pulled. 
    He asked both men to place their hands on the car. 
    It should be noted that there was a third person come out of the room who at this time stated, 
    "I am not involved in any of this. " 
    "I am scared. " 
    "I am not any good at this. " 
    In response to the request by the officer... and I need to add that Officer Taylor testified that as he approached the trunk of the car, he was able to detect a strong odor of marijuana coming from the trunk of the car, which was open. 
    He said after he gave his command, Castleberry, who was standing on the driver's side of the car, near the trunk, slammed the trunk shut. 
    He said that the defendant Raineri, who was standing on the passenger side of the car, immediately complied with the request, but Castleberry, after slamming the trunk shut, stepped back further toward the driver's side and placed his hands behind his back. 
    The officer testified that he gave Castleberry two more commands to put his hands on the car, and Castleberry refused, and finally threw an object into the car. 
    Officer Taylor approached and attempted to force him to place his hands on the car. 
    A certain amount of wrestling ensued, and they both went to the ground while Officer Taylor was trying to subdue Castleberry. 
    During this time, Castleberry was able to reach up, lock the inside of the driver's car, and slam the door shut. 
    The car keys to the car were at this time in the door on the driver's side of the car where the two men were. 
    At this time the backup, Officer Citty of the Oklahoma City Police Department arrived. 
    He stated and it was the testimony of both these men that he came up, that he was given the keys to the car by Officer Taylor, and advised by Officer Taylor that he had smelled an odor of marijuana coming from the trunk. 
    He took the keys, opened the trunk. 
    He, too, said he smelled an odor of marijuana coming from the trunk. 
    He unzipped the two plaid suitcases that the defendant Raineri had taken from the room and placed in the car, and he found there a large amount of marijuana. 
    There were 25 pounds of marijuana in one of the suitcases and 34 pounds of marijuana in the other. 
    He then proceeded to... he had to forcefully open the blue suitcase that the defendant Raineri had... defendant Castleberry had brought from the room and placed in the car first. 
    He forcefully opened that, and in that suitcase was found $2,700 in cash and approximately ten ounces of methaqualone. 
    The state contends, of course, that the search of these four containers, the three suitcases which were found in the trunk and the bandaid box on the dashboard, were properly conducted without a warrant.

    Mr. David William Lee 
    It is the bandaid box. 
    We think that the suitcases and the bandaid box were all searched pursuant to the automobile exception rule in Ross and of course the more recent case announced by this Court, United States versus Johns. 
    We also feel that the bandaid box was properly searched as a search incident to a lawful custodial arrest under the doctrines of this Court in United States versus Robinson and New York versus Belton. 
    It is the state's position that the officers had probable cause to believe that the vehicle in question contained contraband, and that a search of the entire vehicle for drugs was justified by the facts. 
    The fact that checkout time was at hand, that the baggage had been loaded into the car, that the informant had stated that some... that one of the suitcases contained drugs, that a strong odor of marijuana was coming from the trunk, coupled with the actions of the defendant Castleberry and the third party as Officer Taylor approached the car, all support the belief that the drugs had been removed from somewhere in the motel room and were now somewhere in the vehicle. 
    Therefore, the entire automobile could have been a hideaway for the drugs. 
    This Court specifically held in the Johns case that when the officers approached the trucks in question and detected the distinct odor of marijuana which was around the back of the truck, they had probable cause to search the entire truck. 
    The Court in Johns stated also that the officers in the Ross case had probable cause to search the entire vehicle in that case. 
    The state believes that the facts in this case present an even more compelling case involving probable cause. 
    In this case, the convictions of the defendant were reversed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in a two-to-one decision. 
    The court stated the reason why they reversed was because they felt like if an officer had tried to apply the Ross and the Sanders and the Chadwick doctrine, they felt like that taking all those cases together, that if an officer knows of the specific location within a vehicle where contraband is located, the officer should get a search warrant. 
    However, if he only knows that there is contraband generally in the vehicle, the officer can go ahead and search it without a warrant. 
    The court held in this case since the suitcases and the bandaid box were suspected locations of contraband, they should have been detained while the search warrant was being obtained. 
    However, in the Johns case, the Court observed that when the officers detected the odor of marijuana coming from the back of the trucks, they no doubt suspected that the odor was coming from the packages which were in the back of the truck, but the Court, of course, in that case did not require a search warrant. 
    In Ross, the police were advised of the specific location of drugs in that case. 
    In that case they were advised by an informant that the drugs were in the trunk, but this Court upheld the search of the brown paper bag and the zippered pouch in the trunk of the car without requiring a search warrant. 
    Under the same rationale, the search of the suitcases found in the trunk in the present case should be upheld. 
    The rule announced by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals we feel means that there would now be endless litigation over whether or not the police suspected of a particular location of contraband within a particular container in a vehicle. 
    Furthermore, this Court in Johns specifically noted that the fact that a container is involved does not in itself either expand or contract the well-established exception to the warrant principle recognized in the Carroll case. 
    In Ross this Court stated that there was no distinction between containers and compartments, and that the object of the search is limited... and that the officer's search is limited only by the object of the search, and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that that object may be found. 
    In both Ross and Johns and in Justice Powell's concurring opinion in the Robins case it was noted that in neither Sanders nor in the Chadwick case did the police have probable cause to search the vehicle or anything in it other than the footlocker in the Chadwick case and the suitcase in the Sanders case.

    There is no record of that. 
    Of course, we think that on the basis of the Carroll search, where, as you pointed out in the Ross case, the police ripped open the upholstery in the back seat of the car, that that would have been proper, but there is no record there was anything like that done. 
    The suitcase in the trunk was forceably opened.

speaker="david_william_lee" startTime="907.730" stopTime="940.701">
    Mr. David William Lee 
    --Yes. 
    All the facts in this situation show that there were drugs in the motel room parked on the interstate highway in Oklahoma, in a room. 
    All the facts that were observed by the officer showed that the drugs were being moved from the room to somewhere in the car. 
    The informant made his observations within the last ten hours. 
    We think it is clear that there was at least probable cause to believe that the individuals with those drugs were going to place them from the motel room that they were just checking out of into the car. 
    That is why we think it is an automobile case.

    Mr. David William Lee 
    Well, I am saying that... and I believe Justice Stevens' hypothetical was, if the only thing he would have known was, he pulls up and sees Castleberry with a suitcase getting ready to get into the car, I am saying that would probably fall more into the Place, and in your concurring opinion in the Jacobson situation. 
    Here we have much more. 
    We have him putting four suitcases in the car, one of which the informant had specifically told him within the last ten hours he had seen narcotics in the suitcase. 
    We have him approaching the car, detecting a strong odor of marijuana coming from the trunk, which I think puts it right on point with the Johns case, where the officers approached the trucks and detected the odor of marijuana, and the Court in that case said there was probable cause to search the entire trucks everywhere, and the Court specifically stated that contraband could have been concealed anywhere in the trucks.

    How much do you rely on the resistance and flight of the people involved?
speaker="david_william_lee" startTime="1086.013" stopTime="1143.765">
    Mr. David William Lee 
    Certainly resistance generally reflects a consciousness of guilt, and we think that the actions of Castleberry... we don't think a law abiding citizen who was not doing anything would react this way when he was approached by a police officer. 
    We think the fact that at gunpoint he refused two commands to place his hands on the car, that he finally threw the item, the bandaid box in the car, that he struggled with the police officer, that he locked the car and slammed the door shut during the process of this, he obviously didn't want the police to get the bandaid box, and he obviously didn't want them to get in the car. 
    He didn't want them to get in the trunk of the car, too, because the actions of Castleberry in slamming the trunk shut as he approached, as the officer approached the car, should also be considered, I think, to be a probable cause fact. 
    So here we have much more than just an individual who happens to be standing on a curb with a suitcase next to a car. 
    Here we have all these facts which I think and which we contend places it clearly within the Johns situation.

    Well, they also observed packages in the back of the truck, but you stated all these facts together said there was probable cause to make a search. 
    So, I think, yes, the odor of marijuana is a very critical fact, but in this case we have much more we feel like than the officers did in the Johns case.

    I think that all those facts move it completely into the automobile exception case, all those additional factors.

    I think you have a situation in Ross where the informant told the police that the individual was selling drugs out of the trunk, and the Court in Johns and in Ross said that when the officers opened the trunk and saw the brown paper bag and the zippered pouch, they had probable cause to search both those containers, and then the Court came along in Johns and said they could have searched the entire car, and I think Ross also said that, too, although maybe not as directly as the Court did in Johns.

    There could have been a beer can, a crumpled up cigarette pack in the car, a wastebasket, a rolled up floormat, any other container they would have had to get a search warrant for.

    Mr. David William Lee 
    Well, I think if there was a situation where there was no reason to believe that the contraband could have been anywhere other than in the suitcases, and the suitcases are placed immediately right in the car, I think that Ross and Sanders still apply. 
    But this case, we have... contraband could have... we all know that narcotics traffickers are liable to place narcotics anywhere in a car, in the hubcaps. 
    In Carroll, the individual put it in the back seat, in the upholstery.

    Justice White 
    --I take it you wouldn't say that if you had independent probable cause to search the car, every hubcap, every piece of upholstery in it, if you also had probable cause to search a specific suitcase that was in the car, I take it your position is, you couldn't search the suitcase.

    Under Ross?
speaker="david_william_lee" startTime="1830.488" stopTime="1895.882">
    Mr. David William Lee 
    No, I think Ross allows that. 
    Even... in Ross they knew the specific location of the drugs. 
    They had been told by the informant that the drugs were in the trunk, and that is what we are arguing, that just because they suspected a particular location in a car or in a particular container in a car, they are not limited to that if probable cause supports the search of the entire vehicle. 
    Here we have a situation which for all the reasons I have stated, and I might add that the fact that the car has Florida license plates I think is relevant. 
    The Court in the Gates case said that Florida is a well-known source of narcotics. 
    I think that all these things, if they had been placed in an affidavit and presented to a magistrate, the magistrate would have issued a search warrant for the entire car to search for contraband anywhere in that car. 
    Therefore, under the principles announced by this Court in the Ross case, the police were not required to resort to the warrant process. 
    We think that the bandaid box in the car also should be upheld on the basis of it being a search incident to a lawful arrest under the Robinson case and the New York versus Belton case.

   Argument of Charles Foster Cox
speaker="charles_foster_cox" startTime="1902.970" stopTime="1992.175">
    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    Mr. Justice Burger, and may it please this honorable Court, respondents' position in this matter is that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals was entirely correct in their analysis of the law and their application of the law to the facts of the case. 
    This quite simply is not an automobile exception case. 
    This is quite simply a container case that can be disposed of on the basis of Arkansas versus Sanders and Chadwick. 
    The government would argue that Johns and the Court's decision in Johns is analogous to the facts of the case at bar. 
    I would only remind the Court that in Johns the police had probable cause to search that truck long before they ever knew there were any packages around. 
    They discovered the packages only as a result of the search based on probable cause of the truck. 
    Here there was nothing, I submit, absolutely nothing to suggest to this police officer that there was any probable cause to search that automobile at any time. 
    The information provided to this police officer was from a confidential informant who had never been used before, who the officer did not know, who did not even identify himself to the officer, whose only--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1992.175" stopTime="1994.460">

    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    --Because the officer admitted so on the stand, Your Honor. 
    That is in the record. 
    He had never been used before. 
    It also said in the record that he had been referred... that was the way the officer put it... had been referred to him by another police officer. 
    I think it is significant to note that in that referral, the confidential informant never gave his name or mentioned the other officer, Officer Joe Smith or whatever told me I could call you. 
    The informant is unidentified. 
    There is no basis whatsoever to believe he even has any idea what he is talking about.

 I am wondering whether there wasn't probable cause to search the entire vehicle, given the information the officer had and the fact that the defendants who were suspected on the basis of the tip of dealing in narcotics had been loading the vehicle and on the sight of one of the defendants tossing a package inside the car and trying to lock it and trying to put evidence out of the way. 
 Did that give rise to probable cause to search the entire vehicle?

speaker="charles_foster_cox" startTime="2147.194" stopTime="2195.358">
    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    I think not, Your Honor, and the reason for my answer is that in the very practical context of police enforcement, and particularly drug enforcement, very seldom do you see a police officer dressed in uniform step out of a marked vehicle and say, I am a police officer, pay me heed. 
    That doesn't happen. 
    As a practical fact, you have some guy in bluejeans with a beard and scruffy appearance who gets out of an unmarked vehicle which may be a '54 Dodge with a gun drawn and says, I'm a police officer. 
    The defendants' actions are entirely consistent with trying to protect their property from being robbed as opposed to protecting it from police officers. 
    I know police officers always say, and on television they always do draw their badge and their gun at the same time--

    On the information that the police had when they saw Castleberry come out of the motel room, loading the precisely described suitcases into the precisely described car, would a reasonable officer had a reasonable basis to think that they were about to take off?

    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    I think it is reasonable to assume anyone leaving a motel room and loading their luggage is about to leave that location, certainly. 
    However, just because they placed the suitcases into the automobile, and the only information they had regarding narcotics was either the motel room or the containers does not turn this into an automobile exception case. 
    The automobile, as the state of Oklahoma mentioned, was parked in a parking lot, and that parking lot of a motel was adjacent to an interstate highway, but it must be emphasized that the automobile was never entered by the defendants. 
    They never had that opportunity to get into the automobile as if they wanted to drive off.

    Mr. Justice Burger, Chief Justice Burger, members of the honorable Court, if I may continue, I would like to begin once again by going back to a question, I think, from Mr. Justice White which I think I misinterpreted earlier, before our lunch break. 
    I believe you asked if I felt that if there were probable cause to search the automobile and also probable cause to search the containers therein, did I still feel that there was a warrant necessary to search those containers. 
    I think I answered in the negative this morning, and that is not my feelings at all.

    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    --Well, it does indicate to the contrary, Mr. Justice White, and I merely was flustered and didn't understand your question. 
    I would like to go on with the argument and address the point raised by the state of Oklahoma regarding the smell or odor of marijuana which the officer testified to, and it has been brought up in relationship to the Johns case. 
    I think it is particularly significant that the officer did not mention any odor of marijuana until after the trunks were placed in the trunk of the vehicle, the suitcases placed in the trunk of the vehicle. 
    The record is absent of any smell of marijuana prior to the time those containers were placed in the vehicle.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2615.346" stopTime="2628.506">

    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    I am not questioning, Mr. Chief Justice, whether it is true that he smelled marijuana or not.

    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    The record reflects five to ten minutes, Your Honor. 
    And I think that is particularly significant, because that would further show an absence of probable cause to search the vehicle independent of the containers contained therein. 
    The state of Oklahoma mentioned at the very end of its argument that they thought that the search could be justified under Belton as a search incident to lawful arrest. 
    It is the respondents' position that the decision in Ross so effectively undermines Belton as to render it virtually ineffective. 
    We think that the facts of Belton could be decided under the automobile exceptions as delineated in Ross.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Is it not clear now, whatever the law had been, that when there is probable cause to search a car, the search may be what could be called the French Connection search? 
    Justice White's question suggested that this morning. 
    You can take off the hubcaps, you can take off the tires, and you can tear the upholstery apart and see if the drugs are hidden in those places. 
    Now, of course, if it turns out that you don't find anything, someone has got quite a bill to repair the car, but that is a totally different matter. 
    You say there is no probable cause to search the car in the first place.

speaker="charles_foster_cox" startTime="2783.923" stopTime="2791.177">
    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    I think based on the information that the officer had, there was no probable cause to believe that, Your Honor.

    No probable cause to believe that the car would be part of the transferring, transporting the drugs?

    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    Well, certainly if the container... they have probable cause to believe a container contains contraband, and that contraband, that container is then placed in a vehicle, then the logical extension of that is that if the vehicle moves, it is used to transport the contraband. 
    So, to that extent, Mr. Chief Justice, I would agree with you.

    Mr. Charles Foster Cox

    Mr. Charles Foster Cox 
    --No, I don't. 
    There are arguments in the brief by the state of Oklahoma and also in the brief filed by amici, the various amici, friends of the Court, which ask this Court to further expand the decision in Ross to eliminate any distinction between containers and automobiles. 
    I would only submit to the Court that I think this Court's decision in Ross is sufficiently clear that no further expansion or delineation is necessary. 
    The argument is made in the briefs that it is difficult to teach the principles, the teachings of Ross to police officers. 
    I think the decision in Ross is perfectly clear that if you have probable cause independently of anything, any containers, to believe that an automobile, not knowing whether it has any packages in it or not, any containers in it or not, contains contraband, that is the situation that Ross applies to, and it authorizes a search of that vehicle and any container found therein. 
    The contrary is true, that if you have knowledge of the suspected locus of contraband, that being in containers, then a warrant is required under the Fourth Amendment, the warrant clause of the United States Constitution. 
    I don't think that the argument made in the briefs by both the state of Oklahoma and amici that the police are encouraged to share less of their probable cause information with an examining magistrate according to Ross because they would be rewarded by sharing less is a valid argument. 
    I think that if officers cannot be trusted to tell the truth, and to tell what they know exactly about their probable cause information, then they should not be rewarded by an expansion of Ross to eliminate any distinctions whatsoever. 
    In total, I think the Court of Criminal Appeals of the state of Oklahoma was exactly correct in its application of the law, that this was a Chadwick, Sanders type case, a container case, and not in fact a Ross case. 
    This case falls on the Chadwick, Sanders side of the line as opposed to Ross.
