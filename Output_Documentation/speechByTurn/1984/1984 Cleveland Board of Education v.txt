Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="15.171">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in Cleveland Board of Education against Loudermill. 
    Mr. Wyman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. James G. Wyman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented by the cases at bar today is whether or not the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the Cleveland Board of Education and the Parma Board of Education to grant respondents a hearing before they were terminated from their employment. 
    It is the petitioners' position that the precedents of this Court do not require a pretermination hearing, and further, that the Ohio Revised Code, Section 124.34, comports with the due process clause and adequately protected the respondents' rights. 
    Mr. Loudermill was a security guard for the Cleveland Board of Education. 
    In order to get that job, he filled out an application form. 
    On that form, he was asked if he had ever been found guilty of any felony. 
    He answered he had not. 
    He further attested at the end of that application that the answers he gave were not only truthful but accurate. 
    A routine check of his record was done by the Cleveland Board of Education. 
    He was found to have had a previous felony conviction, that of grand larceny, and he was terminated.

    Mr. James G. Wyman 
    After his appointment it was approximately eleven months, Your Honor. 
    What had happened in that case is, we had originally hired on a number of security people during the institution of our desegregation case. 
    We thereafter reorganized our organization and as a part of the reorganization we went through routine checks for a newly created safety and security department.

    Mr. James G. Wyman 
    There were no known reasons or any incidents that had happened with Mr. Loudermill. 
    That is correct. 
    But the Cleveland Board of Education, upon finding out of his criminal past, did in fact release him. 
    Mr. Donnelly was a mechanic for the Parma Board of Education. 
    He was required as a part of that job to have an annual eye examination. 
    He took and failed that eye examination. 
    He was given the opportunity to retake that exam. 
    He declined to do so, and he, too, was fired.

    Mr. James G. Wyman 
    As far as I know, yes, that is true. 
    The most recent decisions of this Court have consistently held that in analyzing the requirements of due process vis-a-vis the termination of an employee who has a protected property interest, the Court will take a case-by-case approach based upon the facts of each case, and further, that the timing and the nature of the required due process hearing depend upon an appropriate accommodation of competing interests. 
    Those interests include the private interest of the employee. 
    They include the timing or the length of deprivation, the risk of error that is involved, and the governmental entity's interest. 
    It is petitioners' argument that in weighing and in balancing these particular factors, the Court should determine that the governmental interest outweighs that of the individual employees in this case. 
    The private interest of the individual in this case would be his right to continued employment and the possible interruption of his income. 
    The length of loss in these cases turns out to be exactly ten months. 
    Throughout the administrative procedure, it took ten months for a resolution of the status as to whether or not they had been rightfully or wrongfully terminated--

    Mr. James G. Wyman 
    Under the facts of this case, certainly. 
    It is in fact admitted that Mr. Loudermill was the person who was convicted of the grand theft felony previously, but again, the important thing, I think, for this Court to realize is that we are talking about the boards' use, both Parma and Cleveland boards' use of objective criteria. 
    We are not using subjective criteria, where the possibility is that we might have made some sort of error, even though again I admit that certainly even with objective criteria there may be an error somewhere in that process.

    It is the Parma Board of Education's position that they did give him that opportunity. 
    They gave him a chance to retake the eye examination, and said, here, take it again. 
    Before we do anything take the exam again. 
    Maybe there was an erroneous medical determination. 
    Maybe there is something else that can happen.

    Mr. James G. Wyman 
    --that we would like you to, yes. 
    We realize, obviously, that there are some constraints to that, and with the definition of due process. 
    Another important point is that the cases of this Court that have come down that dealt with pretermination hearings dealt also with situations where there was a permanency of the effect of the discharge or the effect of the taking of a property right. 
    We do not have that type of permanency in this case. 
    When we are talking about the deprivation here, we are talking about, assuming we are wrong, which we do not concede, obviously, we are talking about the fact that it is a temporary loss of employment, a temporary loss of wages which, if we are found to have been wrong, he may be reinstated, and he may be entitled to his back pay. 
    He can be made whole entirely. 
    The other cases of this Court which dealt with and, of course, which there is a valid and obvious concern, is when you have a deprivation such as the taking of someone's benefits that might in fact leave them poverty stricken and they would be unable to survive. 
    We are not talking about that type of situation.

    We are talking about both Mr. Loudermill and Mr. Donnelly dealing in very sensitive areas. 
    We have Mr. Loudermill being a security guard, and charged in the Cleveland Board of Education with millions of dollars worth of real estate, and also millions of dollars worth of assets, computers, educational materials, and to find that we have a person who is an ex-felon as our security guard is very distressful to us. 
    We need, and I believe this Court should find, the right to immediately discharge an employee who, pursuant to some objective criteria, in this case again a court order, is found to have... to pose a risk, a potential threat to the system. 
    We have to be able to immediately act on that.

    --An immediate suspension itself would kick in the same thing.

    Whether you call it a suspension pending termination or whether you call it termination, under the Ohio Revised Code the same due process rights are afforded, and I believe under the dictates of this Court the same due process rights would be required.

    Now, is the state concerned with the existence of a felony conviction, or concerned that he got confused about it?

    We are concerned that he got confused about it.

    While the felony itself might raise some concerns, to find that he had misrepresented that, the felony was relatively old, but the misrepresentation was relatively new. 
    And if we are dealing with someone who we can't trust in regards to an application, how can we trust him again, not only with the assets, but the security guards deal with the safety of the children. 
    They deal with part of the educational processes. 
    They are part of the providers. 
    That is the difference in these cases, that we are dealing with boards of education. 
    The interests of not only the governmental entity but those to whom it serves merge. 
    We are serving pupils. 
    Education is our business. 
    And we have to get on with the business of that. 
    We don't... the Civil Service Commissions are totally independent bodies, and once the process kicks into the Civil Service Commission, the board of education has very little to do with it. 
    Under the Ohio Revised Code, promptly afterwards, within ten days he has the right to file an appeal, and it kicks out and is handled by Civil Service. 
    It is not handled by boards of education.

 Isn't that perhaps a relevant point, that maybe there would have been room for clemency immediately before the board, but it wouldn't be a legally sufficient basis for objecting before the Civil Service Commission? 
 Isn't there a possibility of a different disposition, depending on the timing?

   Argument of Robert M. Fertel
speaker="robert_m_fertel" startTime="1549.220" stopTime="1648.016">
    Mr. Robert M. Fertel 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think this Court's recent decision in Davis versus Scherer makes clear that the issues in this case are not whether some pretermination procedures are to be required before termination of a discharged employee, but what procedures are to be required. 
    And I think in Note 10 of the case the Court says that we have to consider the factors in Matthews versus Eldridqe, and the first factor in Matthews versus Eldridge is the private interest involved, and this Court in Logan versus Zimmerman held that there is a substantial interest in the continued government employment. 
    We are also dealing with 16 million governmental employees, federal, state, and local, and when you are dealing with the dependents of such employees, you are possibly dealing with one-fifth to one-fourth of the population of the United States, so the right to continue governmental employment is clearly a substantial interest. 
    The second factor is the risk of wrongful deprivation, and whether the use of additional procedures would lessen such risk. 
    First of all, under Ohio law, there is no procedure whatsoever to guarantee pretermination procedures. 
    It is like a knockout punch. 
    You get a letter that says you are going to be terminated, and you have to get up off your feet and file an appeal within ten days. 
    A lot of times you are without counsel. 
    And you just get this letter and they say, you are hereby being terminated. 
    In the Loudermill case, he received the letter dated November 3rd saying that he was going to be terminated. 
    Then the board of education on November 13th rubber stamped it, confirmed it. 
    But all the letter said was, you are here being terminated.

 You are saying that presumably he could have gotten this letter and six months could have gone by before the board acted, and yet if the board hadn't specified that there were pretermination procedures, your argument would be the same, wouldn't it?

    You can't... somebody can't be terminated for a felony conviction prior... for two years prior to the date of the termination.

    The Civil Service is an impartial decision-maker, but you are dealing within the appeal, right, instead of the initial decision. 
    I think that would have the employer then... had he had the opportunity to respond to the employer, he could have said, well, there could have been maybe only suspension or maybe no action at all, saying it was eleven years prior. 
    He says I did think I was convicted of a misdemeanor. 
    My service record is clean.

    Right. 
    Also, I would like to say that you have to have a prompt, full hearing prior to termination. 
    I think first of all you have the awesome power of the government going against the individual, who is a lot of times not represented by counsel. 
    I think the procedure now in Ohio where you file an appeal and have a hearing and go through the courts, you've got the awesome power of the government, who has all their attorneys, against the individual. 
    You have an employer who is all of a sudden... who has geared his lifestyle to a certain income, who all of a sudden has lost wages.

    Mr. Robert M. Fertel 
    In Mathews versus Eldridge it was a... the question was liability. 
    First of all, the issue in Mathews versus Eldridge was not whether a hearing was required, but whether a prior evidentiary hearing was required. 
    There was no issue of pretermination procedures. 
    Number Two, in Mathews versus Eldridge, the question was... basically the Court said it was a straightforward medical determination. 
    It was just whether or not the person... all those... it was by a medical doctor's medical reports, so basically it was a straightforward medical determination. 
    In this it was dealing with a fact standing, whether or not there were certain facts. 
    Also, in Donnelly's case, it wasn't just a medical determination. 
    There was a question of whether or not a prior employee, who also could not pass the eye test, was still employed, and that was a defense which was raised in front of the Civil Service Commission, that another employee who also could not pass the test, that plus the reasonableness, because he was a bus mechanic, he was not a bus driver, and the reasonableness of why a bus mechanic would have to pass the eye test was also raised, so those were the two issues. 
    Also, in Arnett versus Kennedy, they talked about... I think the hearings was three months, the... proceedings was three months, but I think in the fact in this case it was nine months before the termination and the actual notice, and I think you have... first of all, you have a question... you have the great emotional damage to the employee. 
    He is without wages. 
    Loss of self-esteem. 
    In these cases, you go with the awesome power of the government. 
    You have a hearing in front of the Civil Service Commission. 
    You take ten or eleven months to go through the administrative procedures, and you have to file it through the courts. 
    It could be another two or three years with the courts. 
    And then you also have problems with future employees. 
    A future employer, you have to train somebody, you have to train another employee.

    Mr. Robert M. Fertel 
    I think you would be entitled to damages for denial of due process. 
    First of all, there was a full hearing in front of a referee. 
    The referee determined that Mr. Loudermill was credible, and recommended that he be reinstated without back pay. 
    The Civil Service Commission never held a hearing. 
    It just made a determination without holding a hearing, so the only really adjudicated facts you have in this case was that Mr. Loudermill was credible, and that he was... that he honestly believed that he was convicted of a misdemeanor. 
    So, on the record of this case, the only determination made after a full factual hearing was by the referee, who stated that he believed that Mr. Loudermill was sincere in knowing that he was convicted of a misdemeanor instead of a felony.

    Mr. Robert M. Fertel

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Do you think that would be true of airplane mechanics as well as automobile mechanics?
speaker="robert_m_fertel" startTime="2362.539" stopTime="2411.420">
    Mr. Robert M. Fertel 
    The rationale they gave was that sometimes there is bad weather and they need substitute drivers, and therefore they should have... that sometimes they supposedly would have bus mechanics drive buses, and so I made the Point Number One, I thought if you are going to terminate everybody who can't pass an eye test, if you terminate somebody, you have to terminate everybody. 
    You can't single out between one employee and another. 
    So, the fact that one employee who... another employee who also can't pass an eye exam was not terminated, I thought that was a defense, plus the fact that I think they could hire substitute bus drivers instead of having the bus mechanics. 
    I thought it was very unreasonable to also require the bus mechanic to also be a bus driver. 
    He was hired to be a bus mechanic and not to be a bus driver, so I argued basically the fact that, Number One, another employee who could not pass an eye exam was not terminated, and Number Two, that it was unreasonable to have bus mechanics be substitute bus drivers.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2411.420" stopTime="2425.850">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    I suppose there are degrees of eye defects, too. 
    Two people could have different defects, one of which would not warrant termination, and the other one such a defect that it would.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Is that not so?
speaker="robert_m_fertel" startTime="2427.732" stopTime="2574.127">
    Mr. Robert M. Fertel 
    --The only defect was that he couldn't pass the state requirements for a bus driver. 
    That is why he was terminated. 
    And because when they needed substitute bus drivers they could not use him as a substitute bus driver. 
    His work as a bus mechanic has never been questioned. 
    I would also like... as far as the delay issue, we are dealing here with nine months. 
    During the nine months he said there was no right to unemployment, there was no right to welfare unless he sells his assets, like his house and his car, which, you know, if you are dealing with somebody who has geared his lifestyle to a certain level and all of a sudden gets a notice saying he is being terminated, you have a long, drawn out proceeding where the person not only loses wages, might not be able to get welfare, has to sell his house, has to probably sell his car, will probably lose his marriage and his children, basically the decisions of this Court say that a person should be given a full and fair hearing prior to final deprivation. 
    In this case Mr. Wyman says, well, it is temporary deprivation, ten or eleven months, if he is proven lawful, you get your back wages, but during those ten or eleven months, the person probably loses his house, he probably loses his car, his family, he loses his self-esteem, plus the right of the government, which is the third factor in Mathews versus Eldridge. 
    They have to decide when... they have to train somebody else. 
    What happens if the government says the termination is proved lawful? 
    Then they have already somebody hired who may reach tenured status and this employee, so it is not just an issue of back pay. 
    The final deprivation when a person loses his house, loses his car, loses all his assets, and probably loses his family, is already taken prior to the administrative procedure being over, and this Court has said that the purposes of the due process is before final deprivation, so back pay, a person has to give up his house, has to give up his car, probably loses his family, loses his self-esteem, plus he is in limbo. 
    He doesn't know whether or not he should try to get other employment, and also the reasons for his termination, like in Donnelly's, or, excuse me, Loudermill, he was terminated for dishonesty. 
    Every time he filed another application, what is your last employment, Cleveland Board of Education, was terminated for dishonesty. 
    So how do you expect somebody to get another job? 
    And so here you are dealing with a lengthy period where actually the effects, the deprivation is final. 
    He loses his house, he loses his family. 
    There is definitely final deprivation before you get... prior to resolution. 
    So it is not just a temporary termination and back wages. 
    I think there is very emotional... I think it is not just monetary damages, but the emotional--

    Mr. Robert M. Fertel 
    --No, but I think you need clarity in this case. 
    I think here you are dealing with 16 million employees. 
    Like in Miranda warnings, when an alleged criminal is arrested, you said you have to give him warning, so I think that is clarity. 
    I think we need clarity so that every Civil Service employee, federal, state, or local, and every government knows exactly what procedures have to be employed. 
    And I think by considering the factors, I think... first of all I think the government's interest also would be furthered in having a full evidentiary hearing, first of all because there is no two-tier procedure where they have to have one hearing at an administrative level, and another hearing where you go to two hearings, plus the fact that if there is a decision to be made, that the employer... at least there could be finality. 
    The employer could make a determination, this employer is going to be discharged. 
    Then we could hire somebody else. 
    There is no position where they have to hire somebody else and go through, pay for training while this, while the appeals process, and then when the appeals process is done and determines that he has to be rehired and you have two people for the same position, plus the fact that he said there may be excessive back pay. 
    The longer the procedure takes, the longer back pay. 
    So, especially if you get a court judgment, then you have interest.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2920.644" stopTime="2929.871">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Does Ohio have a statute comparable to the federal statute that makes it a crime to give a false answer in an application for employment?
speaker="robert_m_fertel" startTime="2929.871" stopTime="3174.152">
    Mr. Robert M. Fertel 
    I don't believe there is a specific statute. 
    Of course, the whole point being there is a question of whether or not it was actually a felony or a false answer. 
    Also, I think there is a big point here about the promptness. 
    I think that the Court of Appeals stated that Mr. Loudermill had a hearing two and a half months. 
    However, the decision was not made until nine months. 
    And I think you can't just say give a hearing and then allow an unreasonable time for resolution. 
    This Court has stated you are not only entitled to a prompt hearing, but you are also entitled to a prompt disposition, and I think just the fact that a person was given a hearing in two and a half months when the whole procedure took ten months, I think, is very unreasonable. 
    Also, the Court of Appeals mentioned the procedure used of mandamus. 
    I think that is a very extraordinary remedy. 
    It is discretionary whether or not the Court would grant it. 
    You don't know how many months it would be, especially when you are dealing with somebody who doesn't have counsel. 
    You are dealing with the government on one hand, the awesome power of the government against the individual, who a lot of time isn't represented by counsel. 
    Also, this Court in Mennonite Board of Missions versus Adams stated that the fact that an individual can protect his rights still doesn't relieve the government of its responsibility to guarantee due process rights. 
    Also, the Sixth Circuit held that there was no liberty interest violated because the grounds for Mr. Loudermill's and Donnelly's terminations weren't published, and it is our position with the Court that it was communicated to the employers, that when Mr. Loudermill filed employment applications prior to... this is his past employer, Cleveland Board of Education, they said, well, he was terminated for dishonesty, and was unable to get any future employment. 
    So there was communication. 
    This Court in Paul versus Davis stated that the constitutional violation is defamation in... deprivation of a governmental interest. 
    Here he was terminated. 
    He had a right to continued employment. 
    Therefore he had a governmental interest, and he was terminated in there, so that the procedures, constitutional requirements would be provided by the publication. 
    It doesn't have to be "publicized", but there was publication because other employees, employers, or potential employers were notified. 
    I would like to say that in Gaus versus Lopez, where there was suspension of high school students, they said that there would be a liberty interest, because future employment opportunities would be involved, and in their case it wasn't "published", but yet this Court found a violation of a liberty interest. 
    I would like to point out to this Court in Parrott versus Taylor you said that there are only two instances where no pretermination procedures would be provided. 
    One is where there is implausibility of pretermination procedures, which is certainly not the case. 
    And Number Two, where there is necessity for quick action, and I think if there is an emergency situation, which we deny, because there was no prior violations or disciplinary procedures, that a suspension could be made with the opportunity to respond to the charges. 
    So therefore the two requirements in Parrott versus Taylor to dispose of any pretermination procedures will not be applicable herein. 
    The main thing that we need... basically is that we need clarity, that there has to be some... that public employers have to know what exactly the procedures are before they can terminate somebody. 
    As you know, the police know that they have to have probable cause. 
    They have to know that they give the Miranda warnings. 
    And so we need clarity. 
    I would also like to say that you can't really have due process on a case by case basis. 
    Mr. Wyman says, well, the greater the risk, the more the need for pretermination procedures. 
    You leave it up to the employer to determine whether or not there are risks involved. 
    There is no statutory right to grant pretermination procedures. 
    Well, this case there is a big risk so we have hearings. 
    This case we won't. 
    I think you need a statutory right that says you are going to give them notice, you are going to give them an opportunity to present witnesses, and have a decision by an impartial decision-maker, and also that you need a prompt procedure, it has to be held within 30 days, so not only the government can make its determination of whether or not they are going to have to hire somebody, but also the employer can get on with the rest of his life. 
    Thank you.

   Rebuttal of James G. Wyman
speaker="james_g_wyman" startTime="3177.935" stopTime="3330.233">
    Mr. James G. Wyman 
    Yes, I do, Your Honor, a number of statements, possibly factual clarifications. 
    First of all, the liberty interest is not at issue here. 
    There are no facts in the complaint or the pleadings before this Court which would reflect that there was any communication of any of the allegations or the charges made by the board of education in regards to dishonesty. 
    In further way of clarification, Mr. Donnelly's initial hearing was well within the 30-day time limitation. 
    I think it is important for this Court to know that. 
    Very briefly, Mr. Fertel has chastised me possibly, and with all due respect to him, concerning the what-ifs and the fact that Mr. Loudermill would have in fact been fired even if we had had some sort of pretermination, but he has then gone on with a number of his own what-ifs, what if he loses his house, his wife, his children. 
    I don't think that is valid for the Court to consider. 
    I don't think those facts are before it. 
    We have one issue before this Court, and that is due process, and what is fundamentally fair to the employees involved. 
    It must be kept in mind, and I would urge this Court to keep in mind the fact that the due process rights impact not only upon the governmental entity in this case but also upon those whom we serve, which are the pupils. 
    We are in the business of education, as I said before, and there are treatises out that consider us to be a nation at risk. 
    It is important for us to get on with the business of education, not with establishing elaborate routines and procedures for our employees. 
    That is taken care of under Ohio Revised Code 124.34. 
    It provides for due process hearings. 
    They are de novo hearings. 
    They are hearings that are by an objective board. 
    We feel they are appropriate underneath the Ohio Revised Code and the due process standards of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We respectfully request this Court to affirm the District Court's decisions of the dismissal, to reverse the Sixth Circuit in regards to the pretermination issue, to find that Ohio Revised Code Section 124.34 is in fact constitutional and adequately protects the rights of those that are affected. 
    The process that the respondents were due was given. 
    Thank you.
