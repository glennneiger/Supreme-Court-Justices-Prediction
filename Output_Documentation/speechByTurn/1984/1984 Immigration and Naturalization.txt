    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    It's possible that Congress might want to do something about it at that point, but certainly it's within the Attorney General's authority to revoke the regulation, and the fact that he himself promulgated it suggests that the Attorney General is the one who knows what it means and that he has considerable discretion in how it is to be applied. 
    In addition, Congress has granted the Attorney General discretion to suspend the deportation of a deportable alien who meets certain threshold criteria. 
    In this case, Respondents have sought to reopen their deportation proceedings in order to seek suspension of deportation. 
    The question in this case is whether in exercising his twin discretion that I have described the Attorney General could take into account the fact that Respondents achieved eligibility, this threshold eligibility, for suspension of deportation only by filing frivolous appeals and engaged in other conduct flouting our immigration laws. 
    The Court of Appeals found that the Attorney General abused his discretion by taking these factors into account. 
    We have sought certiorari here because this ruling threatens substantial disruption of our immigration processes.

    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    --We think if the Court of Appeals' decision is correct here, there's really no room left at all for the Attorney General to apply any discretion, and that to the extent the opinion suggests that abuse of discretion is the correct standard the court was really only playing lip service to that but in fact was not applying it. 
    In 1974, with the assistance of a professional smuggler, both Respondents entered the United States without inspection. 
    In 1978, Mr. Rios-Pineda was discovered by Immigration officials and was granted the privilege of voluntary departure. 
    But he did not depart as promised and deportation proceedings were instituted against both Respondents. 
    Respondents conceded deportability at their deportation hearing and in December 1978 they were ordered deported. 
    Because they had been in the country for only four and a half years and the suspension of deportation relief requires seven years continuous presence in the United States, Respondents were not eligible for that relief and their request for that relief was denied at the deportation hearing. 
    Respondents took an immediate appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, raising several wholly unmeritorious contentions. 
    And I should perhaps note here that both Respondents' brief to the Board of Immigration Appeals and their later brief to the Eighth Circuit are reprinted in the joint appendix. 
    In accordance with agency regulations, this appeal automatically stayed Respondents' deportation order. 
    When the Board dismissed the appeal, Respondents filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals raising essentially the same contentions. 
    That appeal also stayed, automatically stayed their deportation pursuant to statute.

    It denied it for several reasons. 
    It found it was filed in an untimely fashion, an issue that has disappeared from the case. 
    It also found that the motion did not make a prima facie case of extreme hardship. 
    And I think this is the point where the Court of Appeals in its second opinion disagreed and found that in its view the first opinion had stated that the Respondents had already made a prima facie case.

    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    --Well, in general, when something new comes up and the Court of Appeals just asks the Board to consider it, normally the Board is willing to do that, unless it considers it completely unreasonable. 
    And I would say they did not consider the 1982 decision completely unreasonable. 
    I think, just to clarify this law of the case question, there are two grounds for the Board's later denial of the motion to reopen. 
    One was that no extreme hardship has been shown. 
    The Court of Appeals disagreed on the second appeal and found that it had found extreme hardship. 
    That's not really an issue in the case any more in this Court. 
    But the Board separately... an independent ground for its decision denying the motion to reopen was that, regardless of whether extreme hardship had been shown, it was going to deny the motion to reopen in its discretion because: A, the Respondents had achieved their threshold eligibility for suspense remedy only by filing frivolous appeals; and B, because they had in other ways showed their disregard for the immigration laws, because of their use of a smuggler and because they had--

    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    The Board had to be complying with the mandate of the Eighth Circuit, and I think any fair reading of the first Eighth Circuit decision... this is discussed in our petition more than actually in our merits brief... is that the Board did comply with the mandate of the Eighth Circuit.

    Well, they have only two choices: either to comply with it or petition for cert. Isn't that so?
speaker="alan_ira_horowitz" startTime="483.346" stopTime="522.085">
    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    That's right. 
    But the mandate of the Eighth Circuit was just to allow Respondents to file this motion to reopen and then to consider the motion to reopen. 
    And as I said at the outset, the Attorney General has considerable discretion in deciding whether to reopen deportation proceedings. 
    He allowed them to file the motion to reopen, he considered it. 
    He denied it for several reasons that were stated in an opinion. 
    That's all the Eighth Circuit asked him to do. 
    To the extent the Eighth Circuit later decided that it had decided the extreme hardship the first time around, it was really reaching well beyond its powers, since extreme hardship is committed to the Attorney General to decide in the first instance.

    They had not been able to apply for suspension of deportation earlier because they had not met the seven year requirement. 
    The second... at the first appeal, the Court of Appeals decided that it would give Respondents an opportunity to apply for this relief, now that the seven years had passed. 
    So it simply sent the case back to the Board to consider an application, something that had never been ruled on before.

    Well, the seven years had been satisfied at that point. 
    The Board denied the motion for other reasons, the main reasons the ones that are at issue here, that the eligibility had been achieved only through these dilatory tactics, filing frivolous appeals, and because of the other disregard for the immigration laws.

    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    Well, that is the second Board decision. 
    That decision was then appealed to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals on the second time around, addressing this decision of the Board for the first time, said that it was an abuse of discretion for the Board to rely on those two factors, that the fact that these appeals which completely lacked any substantive merit were the only way in which Respondents had become eligible for this relief. 
    That, the Court of Appeals found, was irrelevant and an improper factor to be relied on. 
    The Board couldn't rely on it. 
    Second, the fact that Respondents had agreed to depart voluntarily but then not shown up for voluntary departure, the fact that they hired a smuggler to bring them into the country, these were also considered by the Court of Appeals to be improper factors on which the Board could not rely. 
    The Government has serious problems with that decision because in fact it completely eliminates any discretion for the Attorney General in ruling on these things. 
    There just aren't other factors. 
    These are the kinds of factors that the Attorney General ought to be relying on.

 Well, but there was a petition to review the decision of the INS in the first Court of Appeals case, and you say the Court of Appeals didn't hold anything but simply directed the INS to consider a petition to reopen. 
 Well, they have to hold that something the INS did was improper, don't they, to come to that conclusion? 
 Otherwise they'd have to affirm it.

    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    Well, I don't think they have to hold that anything the Board had done was improper, and they did not, certainly did not hold that anything the Board had done was improper. 
    Perhaps what... I'm not sure what you're driving at, Justice Rehnquist, but it is true that the Court of Appeals, I think, did make a mistake in the first appeal in that they did not really rule on Respondents' appeal, the contentions that they had made. 
    These contentions were that the deportation order was wrong, and the Court of Appeals should have ruled on those because that was really... the Respondents were asking for more relief there than what they got from the Court of Appeals. 
    So they should have ruled on those and rejected them.

    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    Well, I think we're really getting to the crux of the case. 
    All that happened during the course of the appeal to the Ninth Circuit was that time passed, three and a half years passed. 
    And this enabled, because the relief that the Respondent wants ultimately, which is suspension of deportation, is relief that is not available to him until he's been in the country for seven years, what he got was managing to stay in this country until the seven-year period had passed. 
    At that point it didn't matter what the Court of Appeals said. 
    He then had the opportunity to file this motion to reopen. 
    And that's exactly the point here, is that by filing appeals that had absolutely no merit he's just been able to hold up the system long enough to achieve eligibility for relief.

    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    Yes. 
    I would say, getting back to Justice Rehnquist's point, I think the Board could say that the time... from the Board's perspective, they are not going to reopen deportation proceedings just because further time has now run after the deportation proceedings have closed, just because appeals were taken. 
    I think they could take a flat rule. 
    They have not done that. 
    They are willing to consider these applications. 
    But I think, given that, at a minimum, at a minimum, the Board is not abusing its discretion unless the appeals have been taken for good reason, unless a case like you posit, where the appeal... we described this in our reply brief... where it would be reasonable for Respondents to have taken an appeal quite apart from the delay that they were going to gain from it, but rather to take the appeal on their own merits.

    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    Well, I think it's hard to... I find it hard to say that that claim was not frivolous. 
    It was frivolous. 
    It had been rejected by several courts, including the Eighth Circuit. 
    There was no argument made in any of the briefs suggesting why the claim had any merit, no case citation, nothing suggesting why the cases were wrong. 
    And I think on its face, although it is true that one district court had once accepted this, the claim is really quite ridiculous, because it means that anyone could come into this country and all they have to do is run and have a baby as soon as they can and then they can't be deported, and that's clear.

    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    Well, no; he may just walk across because he sees no one stopping him. 
    I think the more important factor here, though, other than the use of a smuggler, is that the Respondent here deceived the Immigration Service even after he had been apprehended. 
    They offered him administrative voluntary departure. 
    He accepted that. 
    He asked for extensions of time because his wife is pregnant, and then when they finally told him there was going to be no further extensions he just didn't show up for voluntary departure. 
    And in fact the record I think strongly suggests that he never had any intention of voluntarily departing. 
    In fact, at the Immigration Judge's hearing where the judge asked him whether he wanted to apply for voluntary departure, a prerequisite to applying is stating at the hearing that you will in fact depart if you're granted voluntary departure. 
    And if you look at the transcript of the hearing you'll see that it took several minutes for the Immigration Judge to coax this statement out of him, because he said several times that he was not going to leave no matter what. 
    And once someone is caught by the immigration system, I think the Attorney General is entitled to take into account whether that person is going to comply, sort of play by the rules of the game at that point, I mean, here is someone who has really taken, every step of the way has taken whatever steps he can, even if it includes deceiving the immigration authorities, to escape deportation.

    Well, the statute says that the alien has to meet three threshold criteria: seven years continuous presence; he must be of good moral character; and he has to show extreme hardship. 
    Once he meets those three criteria, at that point the Attorney General then has discretion to decide whether he should stay or not. 
    Some of the thing she would take into account I think are the degree of the hardship, even if it meets the extreme hardship.

    --In the second decision, the decision that's the subject of this petition. 
    I'd like to focus on what the Court of Appeals actually decided, rather than the Government's characterization of it. 
    The Court of Appeals never held that the Government could not consider, that INS could not consider, that the Board could not deny motions to reopen where the seven years of continuous physical presence were obtained by frivolous appeals. 
    To the contrary, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals considered decisions from the Ninth Circuit which had basically said there could not be discretionary denials where the three threshold requirements had been met and it rejected that. 
    It said, we assume that the Board has this power, but we reverse the Board here because the decision isn't rational because the petitions and appeals were not themselves frivolous. 
    That's what the court held. 
    As to the disregard of the immigration laws, they said disregard of the immigration laws might well be a factor to be considered by the Board, but the Board hasn't explained why the disregard in this case is any different from any other deportable alien. 
    The remedy of suspension of deportation only applies to deportable aliens. 
    It's a statutory prerequisite, so we can't find them not entitled because they're deportable.

    The derivation of the term 1956 decision of this Court in Jay versus Boyd. 
    On the previous... that's on page 354. 
    On page 353 of that decision, the Court talks about the sound discretion of the Attorney General. 
    And since Jay this Court has of course decided INS versus Wang. 
    In INS versus Wang, footnote 5 talks about the discretion of the Attorney General and it doesn't talk about the unfettered discretion.

    The language... that's footnote 6 in Phinpathya, which of course you wrote. 
    If it were entirely within the discretion, then there'd be no jurisdiction in the Court because there'd be no purpose to have jurisdiction. 
    But Congress has provided for jurisdiction, and this Court in Jehovah versus Rosenberg in 1964 found that there was jurisdiction by petition for review in the Courts of Appeals to review motions to reopen to assert a suspension of deportation claim.

    No, I don't think that the Court of Appeals was... I think what the Court of Appeals was applying was an arbitrary and capricious standard, and saying there's a range of decisions that we might disagree with, that we have to uphold, we must affirm, because you are the primary enforcer of the immigration laws; but we as a Court of Appeals have a duty to make you make those decisions in a rational way. 
    You have to explain why you treat A differently from B, and that has been the thrust of the post-Wang Court of Appeals decisions. 
    In Ramos versus INS, which is a Fifth Circuit case cited in both briefs... that's the thrust of virtually all of the Court of Appeals decisions since Wang.

 It seems to me, I thought the Court of Appeals was expressing kind of an equal protection idea, that you may have let other people stay about whom these same things could be said. 
 But now you suggest that it's kind of a due process thing, that no rational Attorney General could refuse to reopen just on these facts.

    That's correct. 
    As to the question from Mr. Justice Stevens as to delays, a lot of the delays in this case can be laid at the feet of the Immigration Service and not at the feet of the alien. 
    Just to note that the appeal was taken in December of 1978 and there wasn't any decision from the Board until May of 1980. 
    That's not time chargeable to the alien.

    Oh, no.

    In fact, I think it's perfectly ambiguous. 
    What the second opinion gave, the second opinion orders the Board to grant the motion to reopen. 
    The first opinion arguably did. 
    The court felt that it had. 
    It's arguable, but it's not... it wasn't well established. 
    Now, the Attorney General clearly continues to have the discretion to... I use the word... sanction, to pretermit or to cut off applications for suspension of deportation where the seven years have been improperly gained. 
    The Court of Appeals didn't say they couldn't do that. 
    What the Court of Appeals said is: You said it was frivolous; we've taken a look at it and most of what, the conduct that was alleged to be frivolous, took place in front of us, and we have looked at it and we have determined that it's not frivolous.

    Mr. Lawrence H. Rudnick 
    I think some deference is due the decision of the Court of Appeals, since the activity talked about took place in front of them. 
    I wouldn't say it's an abuse of discretion standard. 
    I think that would be an overbroad argument. 
    I think some deference is due, since it did take place in front of them. 
    Not as much deference as due to the Attorney General by the Court of Appeals. 
    As to the... I want to stress again on the issue of disregard, the Court of Appeals didn't say the Board couldn't apply that rule, but that, as we've gone into, that they only had to apply it in a manner that made sense, that was rational, that wasn't arbitrary and capricious. 
    I have nothing else, unless there are other questions.

    May I ask you a question about Jay against Boyd, which I hadn't read before the argument and I've just read it, and the scope of the discretion in the case. 
    The analogy that the Court made in that case, which is quite interesting, is to the probation proceedings, which in 1955 were proceedings in which there was total discretion by the authority that had discretion to grant or revoke probation or parole. 
    Has anybody ever argued that, just as the law of parole has changed, that maybe the rules here also require the same kind of procedures?

    Mr. Lawrence H. Rudnick 
    I think in terms of expertise, this isn't something that the agency was set up to decide. 
    They're no set up to decide what are frivolous appeals. 
    That's more of a judgment that courts make. 
    I think less deference is due a decider, an administrative agency, when they decide something that's not within their expertise than something that's within. 
    When the Board makes a decision as to what category of conduct raises peculiar problems under the immigration laws, that's where deference should be high. 
    That's what they're set up to do. 
    They're set up to be experts. 
    But where they say a petition for review to the Court of Appeals was frivolous, that's not something within their expertise. 
    Thank you.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Anything further, Mr. Horowitz? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Alan Ira Horowitz
speaker="alan_ira_horowitz" startTime="2422.296" stopTime="2552.015">
    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    A couple points. 
    I think there's a little bit of confusion here about exactly what's been held. 
    The Government does not dispute, the Board did not dispute in its remand, that the seven year standard has been satisfied. 
    It doesn't really matter whose fault the delay is, because this is not like a speedy trial case, where parts of the delay are being excluded. 
    We agree that they met the seven year standard. 
    What the Board held was that, because the standard was met only because they took these frivolous appeals, thereby bringing these automatic stay provisions into effect, the Board in its discretion was not going to exercise its discretion favorably towards the Respondents to reopen the deportation proceedings that had already been closed. 
    I think it's important to remember that they were found deportable back in 1978. 
    Nothing that has happened in this case since then has suggested that that determination was in error at all. 
    With hindsight, it is clear that they should have been deported in December of 1978. 
    The Respondents have already gotten... even at the time that the Board ruled, they had gotten three and a half years of an additional windfall of being in this country, just because they filed these appeals and invoked the stay. 
    What the Board has said that, in addition to that windfall, we're not also going to let you achieve eligibility for relief that would let you stay in this country permanently just because you filed these appeals. 
    If they do that, it's going to create a tremendous incentive for everybody to file whatever kind of papers they can to delay things until they meet the statutory requirements. 
    If the Board takes the position that it did take here, then at least a person knows that by taking these sorts of dilatory tactics he's not going to put himself in a position to create new equities that is going to give him relief to which he was not entitled. 
    And one more point about the Court of Appeals' statement about the appeals not being frivolous. 
    I just don't think the Court of Appeals disagreed with what the Board said about the merit of the appeals. 
    They said the appeals were not frivolous. 
    The only reason they gave is that they had enabled the Respondents to get relief, that is, that they enabled them to gum up the works for long enough that the seven years passed. 
    That's not... in our judgment, that is not something that--

speaker="alan_ira_horowitz" startTime="2552.781" stopTime="2566.524">
    Mr. Alan Ira Horowitz 
    --makes them not frivolous. 
    And the Board in fact... I'm sorry. 
    The Court of Appeals, if it didn't think the appeals were frivolous, it should have ruled on them, because what they were asking for in the Court of Appeals was relief from deportation, not this discretionary relief.

    I guess I don't want to go on a limb with that. 
    I don't recall that the standard there was very different. 
    Let me just say one more thing. 
    This was really not a procedural decision by the Eighth Circuit. 
    They didn't complain that the Board didn't give its reasons good enough. 
    They didn't send this case back to the Board for a foolish statement of reasons, as to what the reason was for the Board's decision. 
    They sent it back to hold a hearing and basically to grant the suspension relief.

    If you comply with all the procedures that are required for a fair hearing comparable to a parole proceeding, would you say you've done everything that would be reviewable, that the only thing that's reviewable is procedural fairness?
