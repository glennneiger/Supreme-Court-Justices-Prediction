Ramirez v. Indiana

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in Ramirez against Indiana. 
    Mr. Ripple, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Kenneth Francis Ripple 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of the State of Indiana. 
    It presents a single question with respect to the interpretation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. 
    The Court must decide whether Indiana could try the petitioner on a charge which was not mentioned in the detainer used to obtain his temporary and limited custody from the penal authorities of the State of Michigan. 
    The facts of this case are complicated, and I would like to state very succinctly the essence of our position on that question before I spend a good deal of time on the facts, which I think are difficult to grasp. 
    In essence, our submission is that this question can be answered by a straightforward of the IAD. 
    The trial court of the receiving state... in this case Indiana... only has authority to try a prisoner on those charges mentioned in the detainer or on those charges which arise out of the same transaction as those charges mentioned in the detainer. 
    For all other purposes the sending state... in this case the State of Michigan... retains both custody and jurisdiction of the prisoner.

    Mr. Kenneth Francis Ripple 
    --They are subsequent to trial, but I think pertinent to the disposition of the case, and I think, therefore, I have an obligation to inform the Court of them. 
    After trial on June 6, 1930... 1982, the petitioner was in fact paroled into the custody of the State of Indiana and was incarcerated by the State of Indiana. 
    On the second... I'm sorry... on February 19th, 1984, Michigan in fact discharged the petitioner from his sentence to incarceration in the State of Michigan. 
    He therefore continued his incarceration in the State of Indiana. 
    He is due for release on April 24th of the current year, but will be subject to probation for one additional year. 
    I am indebted to my colleagues from the state for helping me obtain that information, and I thought I had a duty to the Court to mention that to you. 
    Again, our basic position is that for all purposes other than the charges mentioned in the detainer, the prisoner remains subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state; that therefore, in this case the trial court in Indiana was without authority to try the petitioner on the Diazepam charges and, as a result, its judgment of conviction is void. 
    Now, the facts of the case are difficult to get a grasp on because they cover a long period of time. 
    And I suggest to the Court it would be helpful if the following factors were kept in mind as I go through them. 
    First of all, Indiana has incrementally recognized the correctness of the straightforward approach I have just suggested. 
    Indeed, the basic error in this proceeding, now admitted by Indiana, could have very easily been corrected at an earlier stage in these proceedings. 
    We are only here today because despite its confession of error, the State of Indiana refuses to give up the product of its earlier overreaction: the void conviction of the petitioner. 
    We submit that this reluctance of the State of Indiana is indeed contrary to their own best interests as signatories to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. 
    Now, we have set forth the operative facts in summary fashion on pages 2 and 3 of our brief and in more plenary fashion at pages 3 through 8. 
    The facts involve what we in Indiana call two criminal causes. 
    The first cause, Section 424, involves three charges of dealing with a controlled substance called Diazepam. 
    The second cause, Cause 470, deals with delivery of marijuana. 
    Now, the underlying events with respect to the first of those causes, the Diazepam cause... that's the cause we contend he should not have been tried upon... took place over a three-month period in early 1979. 
    And the petitioner was arraigned on those charges in April of 1979. 
    Now, as we've noted in some detail in our brief at page 4, he initially pleaded guilty... not guilty to those charges, and then later attempted to plead guilty pursuant to a plea agreement. 
    But the trial judge refused to accept the plea agreement, because he considered the plea to be improvident. 
    The trial was set eventually for March 1980 but later continued. 
    Before trial was had on that first Diazepam cause, the one which is in question here, the petitioner was arraigned in May of 1980 on the second cause, the marijuana cause. 
    The underlying events with respect to that cause took place in December 1979, almost 12 months after the underlying events for the first cause, and therefore, there is no question that they were not in any way related crimes, and no one has contended that. 
    In November 1980, after he had been arraigned on both causes but not tried on either, the petitioner was incarcerated by the State of Michigan pursuant to an unrelated felony charge. 
    In March 1981, after he had been in Michigan incarceration for several months, the prosecutor from Howard County, Indiana mailed to the warden of the prison in Jackson, Michigan a detainer which indicated that he wished to bring the petitioner to trial on two counts of dealing in marijuana. 
    Now, if I may anticipate a question at this point, it ought to be noted that one of the follow-up documents which was sent to Michigan to obtain temporary custody of the petitioner several months after the actual detainer was filed erroneously listed the cause number for the Diazepam counts, and said the petitioner was wanted on three counts of dealing in marijuana. 
    Now, at trial the State of Indiana contended that this in fact was an independent detainer with respect to the Diazepam counts. 
    The court of appeals of Indiana in its opinion... and you'll note this at the Joint Appendix page 168... said that no reasonable factfinder could reach that conclusion. 
    And I note that the State of Indiana has in fact dropped that contention at this point. 
    So in short, having been told that he was going to return to Indiana to stand trial on two counts of delivery of marijuana, the petitioner waived his rights under Article 4 of the IAD, came across the border and... in the custody of Indiana authorities. 
    He came across on July 21st, 1981 from Jackson prison in Indiana over to Howard County, city of Kokomo in Indiana. 
    That's northcentral Indiana. 
    On July 23rd he did file with the court a suggested plea bargain with respect to the Diazepam cause on the ground, but later withdrew it, and he filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that he had been brought across the border unwittingly with respect to the Diazepam charges.

    No, Your Honor, I do not believe so because, as the court of appeals of Indiana stated, it simply did not put either the prisoner or the Governor on notice that in fact he was wanted on those charges. 
    As a matter of fact, if I may invite your attention to Defense Exhibits 4 and 5 in the record, Michigan later by letter verified that their understanding was... the Michigan authorities were under the understanding that only the delivery of marijuana charges were at issue, that they did not know anything about these Diazepam causes.

    --No. 
    Justice O'Connor, first of all, your question really has two parts to it. 
    It is our submission that Section... that Sections 5(d) and 5(g) of the Interstate Agreement do in fact indicate exactly what the remedy ought to be, and that is, the judgment is void and therefore cannot stand. 
    In its brief in the court of appeals of Indiana, although not in this Court, the State of Indiana did note the lack of remedial language in Section 5(g). 
    But I submit we really ought not to expect that there would be remedial language in 5(g). 
    The drafters of the IAD, like the drafters of any statute, do their work against a general jurisprudence. 
    When you say that a court has no jurisdiction, it is well understood in our law that in fact its handiwork is void; it has no effect.

    Mr. Kenneth Francis Ripple 
    I think there are two points that need to be made on this. 
    First of all, that remedy is not unknown in our law. 
    That's standard practice, for instance, under the Uniform Act to secure the attendance of witnesses. 
    If a person has immunity to be in a jurisdiction to testify at a criminal trial and you serve... and you process on him that you shouldn't, that process is void, the proceedings are void. 
    He has a chance to return to the state from whence he came, and you extradite him again. 
    It's wasted judicial energy, but it's wasted judicial energy because of the error of the state. 
    Indeed, in this case, as I indicated earlier, the state... we were in a position at trial to remedy this in a very easy sort of way, and indeed, if our position here is upheld, this will be remedied very easily in the future. 
    In reading through the entire motion to dismiss you will notice that both counsel for the accused at trial and counsel for the state at trial both suggested an alternate remedy to the trial judge at trial; that in fact he could have severed the two causes at trial, proceeded with the marijuana cause, and permitted both the petitioner and the State of Michigan to exercise their rights under the IAD. 
    It would have amounted to at most a 31-day lapse of time, and they could have tried the man on this second charge again. 
    Now, if I may return just for a moment--

    --We have, Mr. Justice, in this case because it has gone on for so long and because the facts of the situation have changed, we have a rather unusual circumstance. 
    Our position is, number one, that the judgment of conviction is void because it was entered by a court which had no authority to act with respect to that cause. 
    If this had happened, for instance, at the court of appeals of Indiana level, it may well have been proper to reverse the conviction, require that Indiana send the man back to Michigan, and that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers in fact be followed. 
    Here we don't have that option, because he's been discharged in Michigan. 
    We submit that under those circumstances, at the very least Michigan needs to... or rather Indiana needs to retry the petitioner. 
    This conviction cannot stand.

    We submit that that is at least the minimum that ought to occur. 
    The conviction cannot stand. 
    The judgment must be reversed.

    --Well, it may very well be impossible for the man to get a fair trial at this point, to defend himself at this point, among other points, Justice O'Connor. 
    If I may return to your question for just a moment, because I don't think I completely answered it, with respect to why there's no remedial actual remedy spelled out here, but there is for the other... in other areas of the IAD, my submission is we would not expect it here, because the general jurisprudence indicates that a court without authority has a void judgment. 
    That's not true in the other areas where a remedy is actually spelled out. 
    In those areas we're dealing with the thou shalt nots of the IAD. 
    But the general jurisprudence really gives no answer and where one would expect the drafters to have to specify exactly what they did mean.

    He was also prejudiced by being charged... by being tried by a court which did not have authority to enter a judgment of conviction against him and give him a consecutive sentence with respect to the charge. 
    That indeed was prejudice as well. 
    And indeed, in other areas of the law we acknowledge the fact that a party can be prejudiced that way. 
    In World-Wide Volkswagen against Woodson the Court indicated, for instance, that a defendant might in fact not be subject unwillingly to the civil jurisdiction, even it it was not fundamentally unfair to that defendant if indeed interstate federalism concerns had been violated by the court's exercise of jurisdiction. 
    We all at times depend on legal process which perhaps was not developed exclusively for our benefit. 
    Here this was clearly developed for his benefit, as well as for the State of Michigan's benefit, and for the benefit of the interstate system. 
    And it is on that ground that this particular jurisdictional... that this particular really immunity existed for him from the exercise of the court's jurisdiction at that point.

    We are contending that at the time this court attempted to exercise this jurisdiction, it was prevented from doing so by virtue of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers which says you will not exercise your normal criminal jurisdiction under these circumstances.

    Mr. Kenneth Francis Ripple 
    We make no claim that there was purposeful deception by the State of Indiana ab initio. 
    We feel that Indiana is more at fault here for having perpetuated the problem at trial by taking what we suggest was an unreasonable position during the motion to dismiss. 
    Indeed, if the trial... if the state had acknowledged in the trial court what it now acknowledges, that there was a violation of the IAD, we wouldn't be faced with the delicate task of talking about a remedy for this particular accused today. 
    The trial judge could have severed these causes. 
    He could have proceeded. 
    He could have tried the marijuana cause. 
    He could have tried the Diazepam cause about a month later. 
    There would not have been a problem. 
    Section 5(b) and Section 5(g), we submit, when they are read together clearly indicate what the result ought to be. 
    This prisoner in effect was on loan from the State of Michigan, on loan for a very temporary and specific purpose, and the jurisdiction of the State of Indiana was limited by the terms of that law. 
    In fact, we know... it's our reading of the state's brief that they really do not dispute that reading of the statute; thus, in effect, narrowing even further the difference between us. 
    The state's concern at this point seems to be in maintaining this particular conviction, and we submit that's an understandable but rather shortsighted goal. 
    The State of Indiana, like every other state in the Union, has an overwhelming interest in seeing that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers is in fact observed according to its expressed terms. 
    Indiana joined this compact for the same reason the other 47 states did: to accommodate the daily interreaction of state governments in this very important area of the interstate rendition of prisoners. 
    As this Court pointed out in its past cases in this area, the IAD protects not only the criminally accused; it also protects the federal system. 
    It protects our interstate federalism. 
    Whatever the long-term vitality of the Ker-Frisbie rule might be in other contexts... and in a footnote in our brief we suggested that it's not entirely compatible with some of the later holdings of this Court... you don't need to reach that question today. 
    It's clear that here in this area the states intended to adopt a far more cooperative approach. 
    The states don't need the kind of flexibility which Indiana has suggested. 
    It is indeed unusual, we suggest, that the State of Indiana stands here alone today. 
    We don't see an amicus brief from the other states of the Union saying this is how we want this interstate compact administered.

    Mr. William Earl Daily 
    --Michigan, in answer to another question, promptly paroled the defendant in this case after his conviction in Indiana, I presume so as not to have to pay for his upkeep during his incarceration. 
    He has not... if a remedy is a retrial in this case, I'm not certain that he can be returned to Michigan involuntarily. 
    Michigan has no longer a claim on him, and he is a resident, a long-time resident of Howard County, Indiana. 
    He apparently just want to Michigan for a drug deal, was caught and convicted there. 
    The petition in this case contends that we have somehow... that the court of appeals in Indiana somehow decided that his interpretation of the second document is correct. 
    I don't read that in the opinion of the court of appeals of Indiana. 
    The court of appeals did hold that there was a violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. 
    I don't find in there a holding that the second document sent to Michigan is not a detainer within the meaning of the interstate agreement on detainers. 
    And we contend that it is a detainer within that agreement. 
    The agreement does not define detainer. 
    A detainer is simply any document which puts the holding state on notice that the prisoner is wanted in another state for trial on a criminal charge. 
    The second document sent to Michigan, entitled 4-24, fulfills that test for a detainer. 
    Therefore, we maintain there was a detainer sent to Michigan on 4-24; therefore, Article 4(d), relied upon entirely by the petitioner, does not apply in this case. 
    The Kansas Supreme Court in a case entitled State v. Clark, and referred to in our brief, addressed that very issue and held that a request for temporary custody in the absence of some other document is a detainer. 
    We have a detainer in this case. 
    Unfortunately, the detainer, the request for temporary custody, used the word 4 controlled substance&gt; ["]. 
    But it did refer to the proper cause number, the proper counts; it did inform the holding institution that Indiana wanted this gentleman back for trial in Indiana. 
    The consequence for filing that request for temporary custody is that it triggers the speedy trial provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, and that's exactly the purpose for the adoption of the Interstate Agreement, to provide for incarcerated prisoners a method to obtain their speedy trial rights under the Constitution. 
    We provided that. 
    We have given the defendant here the benefit, the intended benefit of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. 
    Had we not tried him after getting custody back under 424, he would then have been entitled to the remedies provided by the statute. 
    If we had not tried him within 120 days, he was entitled to discharge with prejudice. 
    If we had sent him back to Michigan in order for this procedure that's talked about, the hearing procedure, if we sent him back to Michigan, the no return provision of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers says we cannot try him thereafter. 
    He is entitled to dismissal with prejudice. 
    So the prosecutor here is faced with a terrible decision. 
    If the request for temporary custody is a detainer, and he sends him back to Michigan, he is forever precluded from trying that defendant. 
    In that sort of catch-22 position, I think the prosecutor did the only thing he could do. 
    He proceeded to trial on Cause number 424. 
    If we assume for a moment that the defendant is right and that the court of appeals did say that this is not a detainer... I don't find that there, but if they said it's not a detainer on 424, we then must examine Article 5(d) to see if it provides what the petitioner says.

    Mr. William Earl Daily 
    Indiana's violation, although it doesn't specifically require the receiving state to be notified of the exact nature of the charge against him, I think it could be held to be a violation of the agreement to incorrectly notify the holding state as to the nature of the charge. 
    Michigan's violation is much more clear. 
    There was no indication, no notice to the defendant that he was wanted on charge 424 in Indiana.

    Mr. William Earl Daily 
    Yes, Your Honor, we do, clearly. 
    If there was a detainer, Article 5(d) doesn't apply, and the Indiana court had clear jurisdiction to try the defendant on Cause number 424 the drug charge with no problem. 
    If it's not a detainer, as maintained by the petitioner, then we need to examine Article 5(d) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. 
    That article has eight paragraphs, those numbered paragraphs or lettered paragraphs (a) through (h). 
    Each deal with a different aspect of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. 
    The petitioner has lifted out the first sentence of 5(d), but 5(d), in order to be understood, must be read as a whole. 
    The first sentence provides that temporary custody shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the untried charges which form the basis for the detainer. 
    And if it stopped there, the petitioner's position would be much stronger. 
    But the second sentence of Article 5(d) I think explains the purpose for it. 
    It goes on to say that except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place where his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in jail. 
    That is the purpose for that first clause, to ensure that the prisoner is held in jail and returned to the sending state after his trial in the receiving state. 
    And that interpretation coincides exactly with the expressed purposes of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. 
    The final provision of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, Article 9(1), indicates that the agreement is to be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. 
    If you liberally construe Article 5(d), you do not come to the conclusion reached by the petitioner in this case. 
    The purposes--

    --One of the benefits that petitioner has in this case and that prisoners have under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers is that they can, unless the court indicates otherwise, serve these sentences concurrently. 
    So that in this case the petitioner, rather than having to delay his sentence on 424 until he'd been sent back to Michigan, and if we could have brought him back, then brought him back and tried him, he had the benefit of being able to serve concurrently both his Michigan and Indiana sentences.

    That's certainly one of the reasons for the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, so that prisoners can get rid of pending charges, and unless they are sentenced to consecutive sentences, they can serve them out concurrently rather than consecutively. 
    But the prisoners get the benefit of that provision, assuming there's not a consecutive sentence imposed by the second state.

    Mr. William Earl Daily 
    Well, in this case it turned out it be... it turned out to be more than the Michigan sentence. 
    He has since his conviction served in Indiana. 
    If Article 5(d) could be read as limiting the number of crimes for which the prisoner can be tried while in temporary custody, it's the State of Michigan which should be asserting that. 
    Article 5(d) was enacted for the benefit of Michigan, not the benefit of the prisoner. 
    If the prisoner is released from custody in the receiving state, if we do anything with the prisoner, the receiving state not permitted by Article 5(d), Michigan has the right to go to court and seek a remedy, a relief. 
    Michigan has not done that. 
    If Michigan were sitting at that table arguing in this case, I would be in very bad trouble, assuming that there's not a detainer in this case. 
    But Michigan is not there, and Michigan is not asserting its rights, and there is nothing in this agreement which appears to transfer from Michigan its right to the defendant. 
    This Court in past cases has looked at interstate agreements and applied contract law or treaty law. 
    If you apply that law and you say was this an intended third-party beneficiary, I don't think you could find anything in the agreement that indicates that this is an intended third-party beneficiary who is intended to have the rights to assert Michigan's claim here.

    Mr. William Earl Daily 
    The petitioner asserts that by adopting this agreement the state has somehow waived its right to bring prisoners into a state illegally. 
    Of course, the state doesn't have a right to bring prisoners into a state illegally, but under the Ker-Frisbie cases, even though the state violates a federal law, the state can try that defendant, and the conviction should be affirmed. 
    The Frisbie v. Collins case is extremely relevant to this case. 
    In that case the defendant was arguing that we have a new law, a new federal law which changes the Ker doctrine. 
    And this new law says that you can't kidnap someone from one state... that's the Federal Kidnapping Act that was adopted by Congress... and the defendant in the Frisbie-Collins said because of this new statute, you can't kidnap me from Illinois and take me into another state and try me in the other state. 
    That's pretty much the argument here. 
    You cannot violate the federal law, grab me in Michigan, bring me back and try me. 
    Justice Black rejected that argument and held that there's nothing... he want on to hold that there's nothing in the Constitution that requires a court to permit a guilty person, rightfully convicted, to escape justice because he was brought to trial against his will. 
    I think if you insert in that sentence, change "Constitution" to "Interstate Agreement on Detainers", you came to the same result. 
    There's nothing, there is nothing in the Interstate Agreement on Detainers that requires a court to permit a person, guilty person rightfully convicted, to escape justice because he was brought to trial against his will. 
    A federal law is a federal law, and whether it is the Federal Kidnapping Act or whether it's--

    --There's nothing, I submit, in the Interstate Agreement on Detainers which says the receiving... the court in Indiana has no jurisdiction. 
    It does say in 5(e) and 5(g) that jurisdiction remains in the sending state.

    The Seventh Circuit... the case was brought against the officers who went to Michigan and brought him back. 
    Now, I would assume that those officers, since the petitioner has agreed that he was brought back validly under 470, it would be hard to state a claim against them. 
    But he is claiming that once he gave them notice of the fact that he was going to be tried on something other than 470, they had some duty to grab him out of jail and take him back to Michigan. 
    He's also suing the administrator of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.

    If violation of federal kidnapping law does not trigger some sort of retrial, I don't think breach of a promise to abide by the Interstate Agreement on Detainers triggers... triggers that retrial remedy.

    Mr. William Earl Daily 
    That's correct, and that's why we're here. 
    This Court has acknowledged that granting new trials is an extreme remedy, and it doesn't always comport with the interest of sound judicial administration. 
    That's a quote from Jackson v. Dence filed in an amicus brief that I apologized for in yesterday's Black v. Romano case. 
    We are looking here at something that comports with the interest of sound judicial administration, and I think the concerns addressed or expressed from the bench earlier are valid here. 
    Sound judicial administration does not require a retrial in this case. 
    The agreement doesn't require it, and sound judicial administration does not. 
    I don't want to leave without addressing the question of whether or not there is a here an interstate compact. 
    That's one of the most important aspects in this case. 
    I want to present here an opportunity to reconsider Cuyler v. Adams. 
    In 1978 Mr. Justice Powell wrote, 
    "At this late date we are reluctant to accept this invitation to circumscribe modes of interstate cooperation that do not enhance state power to the detriment of federal supremacy. " 
    That was in U.S. Steel v. Multistate Tax Commission. 
    They found there, the Court found there no compact, no interstate compact because there was no enhancement of state power to the detriment of federal supremacy. 
    I think had that test been applied in Cuyler v. Adams, there would have been a different result. 
    The Cuyler Court, quoting from a law review article by Justice Frankfurter, said... began by noting that the traditional role of the Compact Clause was to give Congress supervisory power over cooperative state action that might otherwise interfere with the full and free exercise of federal authority. 
    I think if you had applied that test to determine whether the Interstate Agreement on Detainers interfered with the full and free exercise of federal authority, you would have come to a different result. 
    The test actually adopted by this Court in Cuyler used the language "appropriate for federal legislation". 
    I submit that under the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment and certain other provisions of the Constitution, there's very little that's not appropriate in some sense, appropriate for federal legislation. 
    That's a very broad test. 
    Appropriate for federal legislation covers a great many things which do not and have not traditionally been considered to be interstate compacts. 
    In this case had this agreement merely been between Indiana and Michigan, it is still, I submit, in the analysis of Cuyler v. Adams appropriate for federal legislation. 
    The fact that 47 other states have entered into it doesn't change the nature of the agreement or the nature of the compact. 
    The finding of a broad Compact Clause application in Cuyler v. Adams leads the states into a precarious situation. 
    Any agreement that we enter into with another state, whether we intend it to be so or not, becomes an interstate compact if in some sense it's appropriate for federal legislation. 
    I don't think that was intended by the Compact Clause, and I would request this Court to reconsider the ruling in Cuyler v. Adams. 
    The only response by the petitioner to that is stare decisis, but stare decisis has never and should never prevent this Court from examining a case which appears to me to be clearly wrong. 
    Although the petitioner will not admit it, the violation of the statute here worked to his benefit. 
    He was tried sooner than he would have been had he been sent back to Michigan, if that could have been done. 
    He then began serving his term here sooner than he would ordinarily have done. 
    He is due for release next month rather than several months or several years in the future, which would have been the case had the agreement not been used as it was intended for the speedy disposition of pending criminal charges. 
    Article 9(1), I refer to again, indicates the agreement is to be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. 
    The constructions proposed by the petitioner do not effectuate the purpose of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. 
    The express terms of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers do not entitle the petitioner to a new trial. 
    To paraphrase Justice Black one more time, there is nothing in the Interstate Agreement on Detainers that requires a court to permit a guilty person, rightfully convicted, to escape justice. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Kenneth Francis Ripple 
    Although we submit that's impossible in the context of this case, that indeed a 1983 remedy would not be... it would not make the petitioner whole. 
    Uncertainty is what Indiana argues here for, uncertainty for the sending state. 
    It will never again know why it is sending someone across the border. 
    Uncertainty for the prisoner. 
    He won't know whether to waive his rights or not, because he doesn't know what's going to happen to him when he gets across the line. 
    And uncertainty for every other state in the union and the federal government, because they no longer will know whether or not the states will abide by the agreement they freely entered into here. 
    In short, Indiana argues for wax teeth for this agreement; and we respectfully submit that it is in the best interests of the State of Indiana that our position on the law prevail here. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
