United States v. Young
speaker="michael_mc_connell" startTime="0.000" stopTime="173.525">
    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Respondent's conviction for mail fraud and false statements was reversed by the Court of Appeals because the prosecutor in his rebuttal argument to the jury expressed his personal opinion that Respondent had committed fraud. 
    Ordinarily, such a holding would be unremarkable, one that this Court would not be called upon to review. 
    However, there are three aspects of the case that do make the holding remarkable; indeed, that make the holding directly contrary to precedents by this Court. 
    First, the error, if it was error, was not noticed by trial court or counsel when it occurred. 
    It was not preserved for appeal by an objection, and the trial court was not asked to take any curative action. 
    Indeed, the first time that Respondent mentioned this alleged error was in his papers before the Court of Appeals. 
    Second, the issue of the prosecutor's personal opinion on Respondent's guilt was not interjected into the trial by the prosecutor but, rather, by defense counsel who opened the issue during the course of his argument that the prosecution had been unfair and his argument that the prosecutor did not, in fact, believe his own case against the Respondent. 
    And, third, the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction without any inquiry into whether the Respondent's rights to a fair trial were substantially prejudiced by the prosecutor's comments.

    Is this the case where there was no oral argument in the Court of Appeals?

    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    Your Honor, I'm not aware of whether there was oral argument.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    In one of our cases today, there was no oral argument. 
    It's a decision on the briefs. 
    But no matter, we'll check that. 
    Mr. McConnell, may I just ask at the outset, is there a Tenth Circuit rule that if either prosecutor or defense counsel thinks that his adversary has gone out of bounds, that the rule requires that he object to give the trial judge an opportunity to correct?
speaker="michael_mc_connell" startTime="213.461" stopTime="271.048">
    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    No, Your Honor. 
    That appears not to be the rule. 
    The rule does appear to be that if the defense counsel goes out of bounds, the prosecutor must object but may not pursue that line of inquiry; but that if the prosecutor goes out of bounds and there's no objection by the defense counsel, apparently the practice in the Tenth Circuit, as in this case, is that that has no bearing or very little bearing upon whether the Court of Appeals will take that issue upon on appeal. 
    Which we would suggest, incidentally, is exactly the opposite of the correct rule, because the contemporaneous objection requirement is itself a rule of appellate procedure. 
    It isn't a rule which is designed to govern trial practice when one side opens a line of argument, whether the other side can pursue that line of argument during the course of the trial. 
    That isn't what the contemporaneous objection requirement is all about.

    What I'm getting back to, a long, long time, but I recall in my own experience as a trial judge that somebody in summation, whether prosecutor or defense counsel, stepped outside proper limits, his adversary had better get up and object to give me a chance to say to the jury, ignore it, or forget it, or something like that. 
    Isn't that the sensible rule?

    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    --There are several reasons why it may not be. 
    And the most important is that there is a tendency, a tradition if you will, of giving very wide latitude to defense counsel in the course of a closing argument. 
    One of the main reasons for this is that when defense counsel is pursuing a line of argument, the prosecutor can't always tell where it may lead. 
    And if the prosecutor cuts off a line of argument that might later have proved to have been a permissible line, he may have created a reversible error where none would have existed before.

    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    Your Honor, two points. 
    First of all, the contemporaneous objection requirement is a requirement that has to do with appellate procedure. 
    When one side, during the course of a trial, introduces the line of argument, it is not ordinarily required that the other side launch an objection before pursuing the same line of argument. 
    He simply pursues that line of argument. 
    It may have been irrelevant. 
    It may have been prejudicial in some sense, but the other side pursues that line of argument.

    Well, aren't you entitled to take the position that the prosecution had its option? 
    It could object at the time and ask the court to instruct the jury to disregard the false statements and to reprimand counsel, or wait and do what he did; respond and challenge the statements.

    Interruption of closing argument, though, is something that often doesn't sit well with a jury. 
    I think lawyers are generally much less willing to interrupt closing argument than to make objections during the presentation of evidence.

 Interruption of closing argument, though, is something that often doesn't sit well with a jury. 
 I think lawyers are generally much less willing to interrupt closing argument than to make objections during the presentation of evidence. 
 I would think that would be a factor that could be taken into consideration by whichever side feels it's aggrieved by the argument of the other side.

    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    And that is why it is our position that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing this conviction here when the trail court had not been given an opportunity to rule on whether the prosecutor's closing arguments were in error.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="811.536" stopTime="845.742">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I think we'll resume at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. McConnell. 
    Mr. McConnell, you may resume your argument.
speaker="michael_mc_connell" startTime="845.742" stopTime="1226.682">
    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, before lunch, you asked whether this was a case in which oral argument was dispensed with before the Tenth Circuit. 
    It was, in fact, and so states in the first paragraph of the opinion. 
    I wanted to return to the issue that we were discussing before lunch and the question specifically whether the doctrine of invited response is not one that encourages the prosecutor to fail to make an objection when he ought to. 
    I would like to point out that we are not arguing the equivalent of two wrongs make a right here in this case but, rather, that when examining the prosecutor's comments to see whether they constituted error at all, they have to be examined in context. 
    And in the context of the defense provocations the prosecutor's comments were not error, they did not prejudice the accused, they did not have any detrimental effect on the right to a fair trial in that particular context. 
    Ordinarily, there are two dangers involved when the prosecutor expresses his personal opinion on a matter at trial. 
    The first is that the jury may conclude from the prosecutor's opinion that there is evidence outside of the record that's known to the prosecutor, but which was not presented to the jury, which would support a finding of guilt or innocence. 
    Thus, the jury may be tempted to convict not on the basis of the evidence, but rather on the supposition of this extra record evidence. 
    It would suggest that in this context, after the defense provocation, that there was no danger of that whatsoever, just as Long v. United States, the prosecutor did not say or insinuate that his comments were based on personal knowledge. 
    Indeed, the comments of the prosecutor were repeatedly interlaced with comments on the evidence, and his comments were truly opinions on the evidence and not opinions based upon anything outside. 
    For example, after reviewing what the various Apco officials had said to Respondent and Respondent had said to them, the prosecutor stated, 
    "I don't know what you call that. " 
    "I call it fraud. " 
    "You can look at the evidence and you can remember the testimony. " 
    "You remember what they said and what he admitted they said. " 
    "I think it's a fraud. " 
    Note the way the prosecutor continually refers the jury back to the evidence. 
    Admittedly, the prosecutor is expressing his opinion because the defense had raised the issue of the prosecutor's opinion, but in this instance, the response did not infringe upon the right of the accused to have the jury decide the question on the basis of the evidence before it, because the prosecutor's remarks in this context did not imply or suggest or insinuate the existence of extra-record evidence. 
    The second danger from prosecutors expressing their personal opinions on matters is that, as the representative of the government, they may over-awe the jury with the power or prestige of the government. 
    Thus, it may tempt the jury to convict not on the basis of the evidence before it, but rather out of a respect for the position of the government in the case. 
    This danger is also remote in the context that we're talking about, that is to say, in a fair response context where the defense has challenged the integrity of the prosecution. 
    The prosecutor in this case did not invoke the power and prestige of the government. 
    He did not make any of the types of arguments that one sometimes sees quoted, particularly in older decisions in which the jury was being exhorted to follow the lead of the government. 
    Indeed, the prosecutor specifically labeled the opinion that he gave as his personal impressions, since it was asked of me. 
    Thus, the jury was informed by the prosecutor that he was just giving his personal opinion because it was asked of him by the defense counsel. 
    And indeed, there is something a little peculiar about the thought that the jury in this case might have been over-awed by the power and prestige of the government because, after all, it was the defense that had introduced this notion that the prosecution had been behaving unfairly and that it had been reprehensible, and that the prosecution did not even believe its own case. 
    When the prosecutor responded by saying, 
    "Yes, we do believe in our own case. " 
    that did nothing more than cancel out the defense counsel's remarks, thus refocusing the jury's attention where it belonged, namely, on the evidence, instead of upon the baseless accusations by defense counsel. 
    Thus, in this case, just as in Long v. United States, where the court... and the court's words there: 
    "Defense counsel's own comments clearly invited the reply which he now attacks. " 
    Now, again, the question for the Court today is whether this type of response constitutes reversible error, whether there was prejudice to the defendant, and whether the defendant was denied a fair trial as a result of this. 
    It is certainly relevant to that analysis of the prosecutor's comments that defense counsel himself had introduced this line of argument, that he had opened the door to the discussion of the prosecutor's views.

 Say it had a recurring problem in the circuit; they thought the prosecutors needed to realize the court was serious about enforcing a rule. 
 Or do they always have to confine themselves to the particular case before them?

    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    Your Honor, I think that it is perfectly permissible for that to be taken into account. 
    When the Court is considering whether an error is plain, there are two determinations that should be made. 
    The first is that the error was plain in the sense of its being obvious or clear, and the fact that the Court has spoken to that precise issue on other occasions would certainly contribute to that portion of the finding. 
    But there's a second determination that needs to be made as well, which is that the error, as well as being obvious, was an error of substantial prejudice to the accused. 
    In this instance, we would submit that the error failed under both of those considerations since we do not consider it plain in the sense of being obvious. 
    We believe, rather, that it was quite permissible under the precedents of this Court. 
    And in any event, it is not plain in the sense of prejudicing the substantial rights of the accused.

    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    That certainly is the usual rule, Your Honor. 
    Where the defense has charged the prosecutor with hypocrisy in bringing the charges, however, the prosecutor is certainly within his rights in informing the jury that that is certainly... that that is not the case; that they have been misled by defense counsel. 
    Just as in Long v. United States, this Court held that the prosecutor was entitled to express his view on the credibility of the witnesses before the Court because of the fact the defense counsel made an improper attack upon that issue of credibility. 
    When the defense chooses to open a line of argument, it is to be expected that the prosecution is going to follow it. 
    This is a very different principle than the principle, the contemporaneous objection requirement, which has to do with the relationship between appellate courts and trial courts. 
    The contemporaneous objection requirement is needed in order to narrow the issues for the appeal, in order to make sure that the trial court, which is in the best position to judge this kind of error, gets a first crack at it, and in order to make sure that an error that can be cured is--

    Mr. Michael Mc Connell 
    --Well, yes, Your Honor. 
    The appellate court, when considering a possibility of an error, has the benefit of the trial court's ruling. 
    In this case, for example, neither the defense counsel nor the trial court apparently saw anything amiss in the prosecutor's argument. 
    Had there been an objection, we would have had the benefit of the trial court's view. 
    The trial court that had seen the prosecutor's argument could have ruled either yes, this was, in context, a fair response given the gestures and the context and the tone and the emphasis; or no, it was not. 
    But in the absence of an objection, there was no such ruling, and thus the appellate court was denied the benefit of that. 
    Just to summarize... and I see that my time is growing short... it is our position that the prosecutor's comments in this case were not error. 
    And that is because once the defense had opened the door to the line of argument concerning the prosecutor's integrity in bringing the prosecution, the prosecutor was within his rights in making a moderate, perfectly direct, not disproportionate response to that. 
    We do not believe that in anyway that that interfered with the respondent's right to a fair trial. 
    But, in addition to that, the failure of respondent to lodge an objection required a still more exacting review of the nature of the error and the nature of the prejudice which the court did not engage in. 
    And then, finally, since the court failed to consider the issue of prejudice, at least as a matter of their burden to ensure that they're not reversing on the basis of harmless error, they should have done so. 
    Having not done so they reversed, we contend, needlessly on the basis of an error that was, in fact, invited by the defense and not noticed by defense at trial. 
    We believe that this is a serious and needless drain upon the resources available within the criminal justice system. 
    If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Burck Bailey
speaker="burck_bailey" startTime="1765.529" stopTime="1960.794">
    Mr. Burck Bailey 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Bill Young's defense was that he had no fraudulent intent whatsoever. 
    The evidence showed that he had worked for Apco Oil Company for, oh, several years and his best friends were the people he was dealing with on this transaction. 
    Apco's refinery at Cyril, Oklahoma, a small town in southern Oklahoma, was chronically in need of product. 
    It was land-locked and had difficulty getting product down there, and the evidence showed it could not very efficiently meet its fixed costs without a lot of product. 
    So the president or the vice president of Apco in charge of that end of their business, a man named Hugh Bradley, asked Billy Young if he could get any product. 
    Billy had been called by a fellow named Ross many times, saying that he had fuel oil he could certify as crude oil under the then-existing tier procedures under the regulations of the Department of Energy. 
    And Bill Young then bought condensate, which is very rich in hydrocarbons... it's gathered at the wellhead... and paid more for it than he could charge, for that matter, and blended the condensate with fuel oil, and his testimony was he was putting the barrel back together. 
    There were two things that strongly, we felt, supported the proposition that he was acting without any fraudulent intent. 
    First, for the six or seven months that Compton was selling this product to Apco Oil Company at Cyril, they had no difficulty with their output of the refinery. 
    They still got the same gasoline, the same products they always had. 
    It was only after another company, totally related to any of the parties or procedures in this case, started selling to Apco pure burner fuel, a residue product that has no other products in it, that the Apco Oil Company noticed a change in their output and tested it, and found that there was fuel oil going in. 
    Also, the government witnesses who knew Mr. Young testified that he was an honorable and honest person, a person of integrity and, in their opinion, had no intent to defraud Apco. 
    In fact, Hugh Bradley, the very person that he contracted with, the Apco vice president, so testified. 
    So it was in that situation that we reached closing argument. 
    The government used the blending as an indication of fraud. 
    That was the view the government took of it; that yes, that increased the gravity of the oil; that was designed to cover up the fraud. 
    Young's version was, no, that's just quite the reverse. 
    It was designed to give Apco the equivalent of what they were getting elsewhere.

speaker="burck_bailey" startTime="1967.448" stopTime="2029.579">
    Mr. Burck Bailey 
    It's because of the issue of good faith, Your Honor, and that was the issue in the closing summation. 
    When counsel was confronted, when counsel for the government was confronted with this state of affairs... this was immediately after Mr. Young had testified that he was putting the barrel back together, he had no intent to defraud anybody... that, we submit, the prosecutor felt he needed something outside the evidence to carry the day, and started in the closing part of his... excuse me... the opening part of his closing argument, to talk about the victims. 
    That word had never been used in this trial. 
    No one had ever used the word "victim". 
    But the prosecutor says, "They say there's no victim". 
    There's never been any such statement made in the whole transcript. 
    "You and I are victims because we're getting charged for this indirectly. " 
    No testimony at all, Your Honor, that that was so. 
    No testimony that remotely supports that.

 I mean certainly some latitude is allowed in closing argument.
speaker="burck_bailey" startTime="2040.636" stopTime="2066.626">
    Mr. Burck Bailey 
    I think a great deal of latitude should be permitted if there is any evidence to support it, Your Honor. 
    Here, we submit there is no evidence at all. 
    It is quite the reverse. 
    Apco stated that they had not been requested, that is, their accountant, to make any kind of reimbursement or any kind of adjustment under the Denver Bailing regulations. 
    There was no evidence whatever.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    When I made my closing argument, I said this is what they're complaining about. 
    And I submit to you... well, let me back up. 
    The indictment says that Billy Young is charged with intending to devise a scheme to defraud Apco and to obtain money and property by false and fraudulent pretenses. 
    And I submit to you that there's not a person in this courtroom, including those sitting at this table, who think that Billy Young intended to defraud to Apco. 
    Now, if you think that Billy Young intended to defraud Apco, if that was his scheme and intent, Filly Young is dead. 
    But that's an element of this charge that the government is obligated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    I say I never recall a case in 20 years where virtually every government witness that was called, that knew Billy, testified to his honorableness, his integrity, his rectitude, and I say that makes the case unique. 
    And it goes to undercut any contention that that man had any intention to defraud anybody. 
    I think that was a fair comment on the evidence. 
    It was what the testimony was. 
    And then in the closing portion of the government's argument, the prosecutor just went berserk. 
    He went far in excess of what any reasonable rule would permit. 
    Question: Do you think that any of the comments were not responsive to your own closing argument?

    Well, the statement here from Mr. Drinker, writing on legal ethics in this case, which is quoted, I think addresses that point, Your Honor: 
    "There are several reasons for the rule, long established, that a lawyer may not properly state his personal belief, either to the court or to the jury, in the soundness of his case. "

    He goes on to say, 
    "I don't think you're doing your job as jurors in finding facts as opposed to the law that this judge is going to instruct. " 
    "Do you think that's honor or integrity? " 
    "Stand up here in an Oklahoma courtroom and say that's honor and integrity. " 
    "I don't believe it. "

    --There was the deep concern that this would only emphasize this to the jury. 
    It had already been said. 
    It's not like an objection to an improper question. 
    This was already out there. 
    And maybe in retrospect, it would have been better to have done so. 
    I take comfort in the notion that all these cases that we have cited, where there is no objection made, that was done by a lot better lawyers than I, and they apparently reached the same conclusion.

    No. 
    The truth is, Your Honor, that it never occurred to me. 
    But I was just responding to Justice Steven's remarks that one can see in retrospect where, from a tactical point of view, you could come to that conclusion; that, well, here we have a situation where the jury has been fatally prejudiced by what has been said, and no curative instruction, as is pointed out in some of these cases, would rectify that or cure it. 
    But if you ask for it, and it was granted, then presumably you would be in a dramatically weakened position to argue on appeal.

    Mr. Burck Bailey 
    Not in my judgment, Your Honor. 
    I think that the statements of the prosecutor, of his personal opinion of guilt of the defendant, cannot be cured by any curative instruction. 
    I don't think it's possible to do that. 
    I think that the weight that that carries is so heavy, that there is no way to cure it. 
    And it simply cannot be permitted. 
    The statement by this Court in Berger that the prosecutor has a duty to try the case fairly, not just to see victory, and that he cannot give his personal expressions of the defendant's guilt, as language as emphatic as this Court could write, is the proper rule; that it is simply denial of a fair trial for the prosecutor to make himself a witness and to say that... it suggests that there are things he knows outside the record that have not come forward at trial, or else we would not bring this case.

    It still makes the prosecutor a witness. 
    It has no place in a trial. 
    Drinker goes on to say if expression of personal belief were permitted, it would give an improper advantage to the better-known lawyer whose opinion carries more weight, an undue advantage to an unscrupulous lawyer if such were permitted. 
    It would be something... let's see... it might be taken as admission that he lacked faith in his own case. 
    It would turn it into not a trial on the merits.
