    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in a recent swearing in ceremony, in several, as a matter of fact, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has admonished new admittees that in the court's view New Hampshire lawyers should not just be merchants of law, but instead should be servants of justice. 
    The residency requirement involved in this case is one of the ways the New Hampshire court has chosen to reinforce the court's aspirations for New Hampshire lawyers as part of a system for administering justice in the state. 
    The New Hampshire court has concluded that requiring residency at the time of admission assists in assuring that New Hampshire lawyers will be available to perform obligations that the court has imposed on lawyers in the course of defining the nature and characteristics of the proper practice of law in the state. 
    At stake in this case, we submit, is whether the New Hampshire court can continue to reinforce its aspirations for New Hampshire lawyers through use of a simple residency requirement that New Hampshire lawyers be residents of New Hampshire at the time they take the oath of admission.

    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    We suggest not, having acted in good faith with the New Hampshire Supreme Court. 
    The New Hampshire Supreme Court requires residency at the time of administering the oath, and in order to become a resident, one has to undertake to the court that one has become a resident with the indefinite intention of remaining.

speaker="martin_i_gross" startTime="198.010" stopTime="279.564">
    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    Yes, and that, of course... therein lies one of the great challenges of our brethren in this case, because they seem to say that because New Hampshire does not revoke licenses if someone moves away, that somehow there is something wrong with this requirement. 
    If I may just express to the Court what the New Hampshire court's reasons are for that requirement, then I would like to address why the revocation argument doesn't hold any water. 
    I think the facts bearing on the New Hampshire Supreme Court's reasons are extremely important. 
    We have no need to guess in this case. 
    Those reasons are embodied in an affidavit of New Hampshire Chief Justice King. 
    Those reasons appear at the Joint Appendix on Page 32, and the case comes here on summary judgment. 
    There are no findings contrary to Justice King's affidavit, and on this record I don't think there is any room to doubt that Justice King accurately states what the New Hampshire court is doing with the residency requirement. 
    And what it is doing is as follows. 
    As the affidavit recites, the New Hampshire court regards residency as establishing New Hampshire as the principal place of physical residence for the indefinite future. 
    So residency at the time of admission is the New Hampshire court's chosen proxy for promoting sustained physical presence in the New Hampshire community.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    What is the requirement for taking the examination in the first instance? 
    Is it either residence or a statement of intent to become a resident?
speaker="martin_i_gross" startTime="288.420" stopTime="289.520">
    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    Yes, precisely.

speaker="martin_i_gross" startTime="290.203" stopTime="310.366">
    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    Either one will do. 
    And the only time that one has to become a resident is at the moment before the oath of admission is administered. 
    That is the time that the admission requirement bites. 
    And it is at that time that we say that it has proven effective to accomplish the goals that the New Hampshire court wishes to carry out.

    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    --Let me just simply say that the New Hampshire court doesn't, and the reason it doesn't is that it has found, and I think the facts in this case demonstrate that it need not in order to accomplish what it is trying to do in requiring the requirement in the first place. 
    Referring to Justice King's affidavit, we invite the Court's particular attention to the reasons in Paragraph 9, and I might say this is an important statement of reasons because it was totally overlooked or disregarded by the lower courts. 
    It is possibly most important in the terms of the New Hampshire court's high aspirations for the New Hampshire bar that the New Hampshire lawyers not just be merchants of the law, but be servants of justice. 
    In the New Hampshire court's view, the residency requirement supports availability of lawyers for the extra activities the New Hampshire court expects of them above and beyond basic concerns for competence and ethical conduct.

    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    No, and I might observe, Your Honor, that New Hampshire does not go as far as some states do in requiring residence at some point prior to the admission of the oath. 
    There are several states that require residence. 
    And I believe Virginia may be one of them that require residence at the point of actually taking the bar examination, or at the point of applying for admission to the bar, and those are far more rigorous requirements than New Hampshire's, which is a simple requirement.

    No, that would not be sufficient, and the reason it wouldn't be sufficient is because in order to achieve the New Hampshire court's purpose of sustained physical presence in order to provide availability for these tasks that the Court wants lawyers to perform over and above basic competence and ethical conduct, the requirement of an office doesn't seem to work as well. 
    The reason: If it is not a primary office, it doesn't assure physical presence. 
    And if it is not a primary office, it could simply be a mail drop or an answering service or something like that.

    She was aware of the residency requirement to begin with. 
    She took the exam, or she actually applied, signed a statement of intention to reside in New Hampshire, giving the address of Littleton, New Hampshire. 
    Beyond that, I don't believe the record indicates any place of intention to take up employment. 
    I believe she stated in her letters to the court that she intended to have employment in New Hampshire in order to avoid professional conflicts with her husband, who is a Vermont attorney.

    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    There is no admission on motion. 
    I think I'd like to pay some attention to the question that Judge Marshall asked about the lack of revocation, because I gather it is a matter of concern. 
    There are two reasons why I suppose it is being argued in this case that it is important to attach... important that the New Hampshire Supreme Court doesn't chase lawyers to assure they remain New Hampshire residents after they take the oath. 
    The arguments seem to have two purposes. 
    The first is to insinuate bad faith or unworthy motive on the part of New Hampshire's court, but again, we suggest there is nothing in the record to support unworthy motivation. 
    New Hampshire's reasons are what they are, and they are plainly set forth in the Chief Justice's affidavit. 
    The other apparent purpose, at least the purpose that appears to me, is to argue that the New Hampshire residence requirement fails to meet this close tailoring test of standard privileges and immunities analysis, and I would just like to observe that it is an odd argument that the rule would have to be more restrictive in order to meet the close tailoring test, that is, more restrictive by requiring people to remain New Hampshire residents to infinity in order to keep their license.

speaker="martin_i_gross" startTime="784.687" stopTime="995.340">
    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    --Yes, it does, and I would like to demonstrate to you why in practice it supports the justifications. 
    First of all, we are not talking about a mere scintilla of time. 
    If people are going to deal in good faith with the New Hampshire Supreme Court, which I sincerely hope they would do if they are asking to be admitted to the bar, they are asked to express their intention to become residents in the indefinite future. 
    Secondly, the present requirement, and I think this is important to grasp, does the job of promoting sustained physical presence without further restrictions. 
    Even the beyond the record figures cited in the Vermont bar amicus brief show that almost 90 percent of New Hampshire lawyers remain in the state, and so the present requirement seems to be a practical success to accomplish these objectives that the New Hampshire Supreme Court wants to accomplish without additional restrictions. 
    The statistics offered by Mrs. Piper and the Vermont bar brief don't even really show that the 13.6 percent number they claim are out-of-state lawyers. 
    The problem with their statistics is that they rely on business mailing addresses, not residence addresses, and the statistics sweep in lawyers who may be away temporarily on government service. 
    For example, the numbers show that 24 New Hampshire lawyers had business addresses in the District of Columbia, the second highest number of supposed absentees. 
    Virginia had 18, the fourth highest. 
    So, we are talking about lawyers who may leave New Hampshire temporarily to come down here on government service, and then may go back. 
    They are swept into these statistics, and the statistics also sweep in lawyer who may practice in neighboring states but may retain New Hampshire residence, and so they are still available to participate in these additional activities that the court requires of New Hampshire lawyers. 
    And there again, we see those statistics presented, and these are at Joint Appendix Page 30: Massachusetts, 96; Main, 19; Vermont, 13. 
    So, what we see is a rule which bites at the time of admission of the oath, and as a practical matter, that is all that's all it needs to do, because as Judge Campbell of the Court of Appeals noted, the New Hampshire court could reasonably conclude that not many New Hampshire lawyers will both pull up stakes and continue practice in New Hampshire, and the bureaucracy required to keep track of their comings and goings would not be worth the effort. 
    And I suggest to you that that is exactly what the New Hampshire court has concluded, because their present rule does work, and it does work as a reasonable proxy for sustained physical presence in the state in order to carry out these extensive additional duties that the New Hampshire court expects of members of the New Hampshire bar. 
    If I can turn now to the legal points that we are talking about, the first legal point that we made is that the New Hampshire court's residency requirements shouldn't be subject to federal judicial scrutiny under the privileges and immunities clause. 
    At the outset, I would like to make it clear that we are not contending that state court regulations of the bar are immune from all constitutional scrutiny by federal courts. 
    That is simply not the law. 
    It is not our argument, and we don't make it here. 
    What we do argue, as the Court recently pointed out in United Building and Construction Trades, is that there is a threshold issue to be determined in every case involving the privileges and immunities clause, whether the interest at stake is fundamental to the promotion of interstate harmony. 
    And in this case, the question is whether state court control over the legal profession involves regulation of an interest fundamental to the promotion of a state--

    Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, you are assuming, aren't you, Mr. Gross, that the lawyers in question do business as individuals when you say that the privileges and immunities clause applies to. 
    For instance, a lawyer doing business as a professional corporation, I presume, couldn't claim the benefit of the privileges and immunities clause.

    That may be the Fourteenth Amendment, but in any event, in New Hampshire, while we may practice as professional corporations, in respect to our duties to the court, we are always individuals, and we are held responsible as individuals to the court. 
    And while there may be a distinction for some purposes, where, as here, we are talking about the relationship of a lawyer to the court and what the court expects of lawyers, I would not want to claim that somehow practice in a corporate mode would somehow insulate a New Hampshire lawyer from responsibilities that they would otherwise have to the court.

    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    Yes, and I understand and accept that. 
    I guess it does not lie well in my argument to take any refuge in that, because I believe that New Hampshire lawyers' relationships with the court are individual relationships, and so I wouldn't want to claim the benefit of saying that anybody who was practicing in the corporate form was any different from a lawyer practicing as an individual. 
    The matter of whether the privilege and immunities clause applies is a threshold question. 
    We rely on a long line of this Court's decisions which say that instead of being an interest fundamental to the promotion of interstate harmony, regulation of the bar is a sovereign function of the state court, is at the core of the state's power to protect the public, is essential to the primary function of administering justice, and involves the pursuit of an especially great state interest.

    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    Without violating... I don't think it is good law to say that a state court could exclude women from the practice of law for any reason, and to put the privileges and immunities clause in there, I guess, would raise some technicality with me about what the privileges and immunities clause is designed to do. 
    If I were bringing the case on behalf of a woman applicant who had been denied admission simply because she was a woman, I wouldn't use the privileges and immunities clause. 
    I'd use the Fourteenth Amendment, and I think I'd win.

    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    The privileges and immunities clause, in Article 4, Section 2 of the Constitution. 
    And as this Court has held repeatedly, that is a constitutional protection which is relative. 
    It applies as a threshold matter only where there is an interest fundamental to promotion of interstate harmony is concerned. 
    It doesn't apply at all where, as here, we argue that the function of regulating the bar is a very, very high matter of importance to the state.

    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    --Yes, I do, and I think probably it would be more restrictive than the rule we have. 
    And I am not here to campaign for a high degree of restriction. 
    I am here to campaign only for the degree of restriction that this Court has deemed necessary to accomplish these purposes. 
    The point that we have is this on the threshold question. 
    If the interest of individual states in regulating the bar is as great as this Court has repeatedly recognized, then we are not dealing with an interest fundamental to the promotion of interstate harmony. 
    The two would seem to be logically reciprocal, because the greater degree of regulatory interest recognized in individual states, the lesser the interest in promoting interstate harmony through national treatment of the subject, and this isn't a mere result of a game of logic. 
    The amicus brief of Virginia and other states shows a solid historical foundation for our position in the sense that at the time of the adoption of the privileges and immunities clause, state bar residence requirements existed side by side with the clause, and were well recognized at that time. 
    And our brief points out that the lower courts in this case didn't deal adequately with the threshold issue even though we strongly argued it. 
    The matter of In Re Griffiths has figured prominently in my brother's brief, all through this proceeding. 
    We think that Griffiths doesn't say anything about how to decide this case. 
    Particularly does it not say anything about whether we have got here an interest which is fundamental to the promotion of interstate harmony. 
    Griffiths was an equal protection case dealing with the suspect classification of alienage, and it simply held that the political function exemption doesn't apply to lawyers. 
    We don't claim lawyers have a political function here. 
    We claim that lawyers are subject to this high degree of regulation, and that the states have this tremendous interest in regulating lawyers, because lawyers in effect share the judicial power. 
    They are different from physicians. 
    They are different from the health care profession. 
    They are different from professions which the states regulate in the ordinary exercise of the police power. 
    Lawyers share in the administration of justice. 
    They share in the administration of the judicial power, and we think the state's interest in regulating lawyers is fundamentally different.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Gross, before you do that, and with reference to your last argument, do you think that In Re Griffiths, where the Court rejected the kind of argument you are making on behalf of lawyers, is relevant?
speaker="martin_i_gross" startTime="1542.511" stopTime="1576.065">
    Mr. Martin I. Gross 
    --I don't believe the case is relevant, and I think it is not because I don't think that the case rejected an argument like the one I am making, because I think in Griffiths what the Court said is that alienage doesn't make any difference for bar admission under any circumstances, and we say that... we are not arguing with that. 
    We are saying the New Hampshire Supreme Court wants his physical presence in order to perform these duties, and a resident alien can do that as well as a resident citizen, and a resident alien can do that better than a nonresident citizen.

   Argument of Jon Meyer
speaker="jon_meyer" startTime="1788.604" stopTime="1825.461">
    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is our position under the standards of review developed by this Court under the privileges and immunities clause of Article 4 that it is incumbent upon New Hampshire to establish that out of state attorneys admitted to the New Hampshire bar would be the peculiar source of a substantial problem relating to legal practice, and furthermore, that the particular terms of the New Hampshire residency requirement are closely related to remedying the problem stated.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1825.460" stopTime="1835.633">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    What provision of the Constitution do you rely on to say that the burden is on the state of New Hampshire rather than on the person in the position of your client?
speaker="jon_meyer" startTime="1835.633" stopTime="1878.995">
    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Your Honor, I think under... although I don't think the Court's jurisprudence is that clear in allocating the burden of proof, it is my understanding of Hicklin and Toomer and the other cases interpreting the privileges and immunities clause in Article 4, and it is that we rely upon rather than the same clause in the Fourteenth Amendment, that once the applicant establishes that the measure is discriminatory against out of staters, and this measure is discriminatory on its face, that the burden then shifts to the state to establish, as Hicklin put it, that the out of staters are the peculiar source of a substantial problem, and that the particular measure is closely related to remedying the problem stated.

    Do you think Camden changed that test somewhat?
speaker="jon_meyer" startTime="1883.547" stopTime="1953.893">
    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Your Honor, I think that Camden is significant because it restated the case. 
    The precise language this Court has used in developing the test has varied slightly from case to case. 
    I think Camden is significant because it restates that test, and restates it, I believe, precisely in the terms I use, peculiar source of a substantial problem, and that it be closely related. 
    And I think Camden is also a significant case because in that... again in that case the city had some fairly strong claims to be exempt from the clause's coverage altogether, insofar as the measure only applied to public employees. 
    Nevertheless, this Court held that the clause applied, and I think that shows an intention to give Article 4 a broad reading, which we believe is consonant with the values that are protected by it. 
    What I would like to do in the time allotted is respond to New Hampshire's contentions that it should have... in effect, the rule should be examined under a lesser standard of review or no standard at all, and then to look at the New Hampshire justifications in the context of the standard that this Court has set forth.

    Is the issue before us only related to lawyers who are willing to take the bart in New Hampshire and who have taken it?
speaker="jon_meyer" startTime="1965.434" stopTime="1996.470">
    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Yes, Your Honor, that is correct, and I want to clearly distinguish the challenge raised in this case from the challenge, for example, raised in the case of Leis v. Flynt, where the lawyer in fact coming from out of state said he had a right under due process to practice without meeting the requirements of the state. 
    We acknowledge the right of the state of New Hampshire to establish admission standards. 
    Our position is, though, that those standards cannot violate the constitutional rights of applicants.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Meyer, in looking at the privileges and immunities clause issue, do we have to look at the threat posed by the whole class rather than as to the particular individual?

    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    --Yes, Your Honor, we do. 
    We concede that. 
    But on the other hand, the requirement, I think, there has to be concern as to whether the class encompassed is substantially overbroad beyond the particular problem that is designated. 
    There has to be some, I think, connection, and this Court would say close connection, between the class actually negatively affected by the discrimination as opposed to the class raising what the state alleges to be the peculiar and substantial problem. 
    I would like to briefly respond to this question of the lack of a residence requirement after admission. 
    There is no information either in the record or to my knowledge anywhere else as to how many New Hampshire attorneys actually reside out of state. 
    I think it is instructive in itself that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has never seen fit to collect this information. 
    The only information we have is how many attorneys had a principal office address outside of New Hampshire, and that number in 1982 was 269.

    --Out of, in 1980, it was 1,987... in 1982. 
    We think, though, that that total substantially undercounts the number actually out of state. 
    We think there is likely to be a significant class of people who practice in New Hampshire, as my client desired to do, who actually live outside of the state. 
    But I think the principal fallacy as we see it in New Hampshire's argument on these statistics is, they say, well, most New Hampshire attorneys live in state, and we concede that that is probably true, and they therefore jump to the conclusion that the reason they live in state is because of the residency requirement.

    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Your Honor, the only information contained in the record is what I cited before, her statement to the Supreme Court that she had a possible job offer in Littleton, that she wanted to practice in New Hampshire to avoid conflicts with her husband, practicing in Vermont. 
    But again, we think that the claim that because most people live in New Hampshire, the residency requirement has been effective is fallacious, because although I may be prejudiced, we believe that the reason most people live in New Hampshire, most attorneys, is not because of the residency requirement, but because New Hampshire is a nice state to live in, and because if you happen to practice in New Hampshire, it is a convenient state to live in. 
    So, we think residency requirement or no residency requirement, the likelihood is that the majority of New Hampshire practitioners are going to continue to live in New Hampshire. 
    Now, the significance of a lack of after admission residency requirement is, Number One, that it suggests that the particular requirement is really not closely tailored to the problem stated, but more importantly, it suggests that the problems alluded to really are lacking in significance. 
    If in fact lawyers residing out of state but admitted to the New Hampshire bar pose such a substantial problem, then why has New Hampshire not even made any effort to count how many there are?

    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    --But, Your Honor, it was not necessary for the District Court to reach that issue, because even if the New Hampshire residency requirement has been successful in ensuring that most New Hampshire attorneys live in New Hampshire, we don't think that that is an adequate justification. 
    We think that then it comes to the specific justifications provided by the state, and the principal one they are relying upon is saying, well, it is important that New Hampshire attorneys live in New Hampshire in order to be available for public service and pro bono assignments from the court. 
    We don't question that that is an important interest. 
    However, we think it is paradoxical to say that, in terms of the interests of the clients, that by admitting more attorneys, you are going to have a problem with pro bono work. 
    We believe, if anything, it is the opposite, that by permitting previously excluded attorneys, there are going to be more attorneys available.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2539.648" stopTime="2557.943">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Meyer, on that particular question, what if the lawyer lives in Chicago, or San Francisco, or New Orleans? 
    Is it your view that the New Hampshire court would have the right to appoint him to defend an indigent criminal and compel him to come to New Hampshire to try it?
speaker="jon_meyer" startTime="2557.943" stopTime="2583.510">
    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Your Honor, assuming that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has a right to make involuntary appointments, I do not believe that the court should be limited by the geographical location of the individual. 
    If the individual applies to the New Hampshire bar, which is an integrated bar, and joins that bar, then it is our position that he or she are subject to the exact same obligations as attorneys who reside in New Hampshire.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2583.510" stopTime="2589.581">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Do you think as a practical matter they could perform those obligations? 
    Depending on where they live, I suppose.
speaker="jon_meyer" startTime="2589.581" stopTime="2619.950">
    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Your Honor, I think it depends not so much on where they live. 
    It depends on where they have a law office. 
    Presuming they... well, if they want to join the New Hampshire bar in the first place, the likelihood is not that they are going to live in California. 
    The likelihood is that they are going to live in Massachusetts. 
    In any event, if they are going to practice in New Hampshire, and getting admitted to the bar involves a substantial commitment in time and resources, so one would presume that they intend to practice in New Hampshire, and if they are available to practice in New Hampshire, then they should also be available to take criminal or other types of work.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2619.950" stopTime="2639.847">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    It does impose a burden on the court. 
    I know when I was practicing law, the judge would call you on the telephone and say, we have an indigent who needs counsel, are you available, and he gets an answer right away. 
    I suppose he could call long distance to New Orleans.
speaker="jon_meyer" startTime="2639.847" stopTime="2661.943">
    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Your Honor, I think that goes another justification asserted by New Hampshire, and that is availability for court appearances and for disciplinary hearings. 
    And it is our position that New Hampshire already has adequate assurances of availability in terms of the long arm jurisdiction, and also the Supreme Court, state Supreme Court disciplinary rule making you subject to the court's jurisdiction by becoming a member of the bar.

    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Well, Your Honor, I don't think that the phone system... I mean, communication is obviously possible on an immediate basis in any event, but I don't think that an attorney can say to the court, you have to hold off the hearing because it is going to take us three days to get to New Hampshire. 
    I think that clients in making their choice of attorney can look to that factor, and I think an attorney representing a client involved in those sort of proceedings is presumably going to want to have an office in New Hampshire, or are going to want to have a relationship with somebody who has an office in New Hampshire.

    --Your Honor, it is conceivable certainly that somebody from California would join the New Hampshire bar, but we don't think that that person, because he resides in California, can use that fact as an excuse for not being available for court appearances. 
    But the other point is that what really in our mind is critical in terms of where an attorneys' availability is not where he lives, but where he practices law, and if he lives in California and practices law in New Hampshire, we think he will be available in New Hampshire. 
    If he lives in New Hampshire and practices law in California, he is not likely to be available in New Hampshire.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What about a state requirement charging out of state residents more tuition to go to a state university than in-state residents? 
    I suppose getting an education is a fundamental right as well. 
    Would charging out of state students more tuition or making entrance requirement more difficult for them at an in-state institution survive your kind of privileges and immunities analysis?

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Why?
speaker="jon_meyer" startTime="2896.023" stopTime="2934.315">
    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Because that involves a state's use of its own very scarce financial resources, and I think the state has a... and what this Court has seen to be a compelling interest in providing that residents who through their own tax expenditures help fund this public university have first shot at attendance there. 
    So, I think that that really involves a legitimately substantial and important interest, and I think the difference with this case is that New Hampshire really is not ultimately able to establish that where you live makes much difference in terms of your ability to meet all the requirements and obligations of the New Hampshire bar.

    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    No, Your Honor, there is nothing in the record. 
    I did want to briefly address the Griffiths case, because I think in many ways that is the closest case to this one, and New Hampshire has attempted to distinguish it, saying that it really... issues there involve the lawyer as a quasi-public officer, and this is different. 
    Well, I think if you look at the position of the state of Connecticut in the Griffiths case, and in particular if you look at the opinion of the Connecticut Supreme Court, they basically rely upon many of the same powers, in fact, all the same powers of attorneys, and the same functions of attorneys as is relied upon by the state of New Hampshire in this case. 
    And the significance of Griffiths is not its holding, because that involves a different standard of... a different constitutional provision. 
    The significance of Griffiths in our eyes is that the Court rejected the claim, Number One, that because their attorneys should be immune from constitutional review, and Number Two, that a different constitutional standard should be applied. 
    I think this Court has consistently recognized the importance of regulation of the legal profession, and the special interests that courts have in this area, but this Court has also consistently recognized that that discretion and that special interest is never sufficient ground for violating a constitutionally protected right. 
    And that the four state Supreme Courts which have considered in adversarial fashion whether a state residency requirement violates the privileges and immunities clause have all found that it does. 
    And we think that indicates at least for those courts that they do not see the imposition of federal constitutional values to the state courts as being an undue federal imposition.

    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    Yes, Your Honor, but they have not taken the position New Hampshire has, that simply imposing... that the New Hampshire... that the state... the federal... New Hampshire's position is in fact that the federal standard shouldn't apply, and the state courts that have looked at this, and I am referring to Massachusetts, New Jersey... New York, West Virginia, and Alaska, have all said that this Court's standards in Hicklin should apply, even in the area of state regulation of the bar. 
    And this Court has repeatedly recognized that among all the privileges and immunities, the most fundamental and the most central really relate to occupations, and I think it would be very anomalous should an exception be made or should a lower standard of review be applied in this area. 
    The justification in addition to the others that is relied upon by New Hampshire is knowledge of local rules, but we think they have entirely failed to demonstrate that this... out of state attorneys are in any way peculiarly deficient in this area. 
    All applicants to the New Hampshire bar must take and pass an examination on New Hampshire law. 
    They must also take a practical skills course after admission. 
    Finally, under the New Hampshire Code of Professional Responsibility, they are all obligated to maintain and improve their knowledge of the law.

    Mr. Jon Meyer 
    No, I don't, Your Honor. 
    But if... I want to emphasize that we believe there are adequately in place adequate protections of attorney knowledge of local rules and procedures, and in fact lawyers are tested on it, but if they are not sufficient, then the state has open to it numerous other means of assuring that knowledge. 
    For example, requiring continuing legal education. 
    For example, requiring a linkage between less and more experienced attorneys. 
    And we think that the need to exclude all out of staters is both unconnected and too broad. 
    Now, there is also a concern, a justification raised about concern about your reputation in the legal community. 
    But we think that what counts is not the legal community... is not the community you live in, but the legal community you practice in. 
    And if an attorney practices in New Hampshire, that should be more than adequate assurance that he is concerned about his reputation in the state. 
    And if he doesn't practice in New Hampshire, you don't really care. 
    But I would also like to point out that for lawyers who practice in more than one jurisdiction, under the New Hampshire Supreme Court rules there is a requirement that anybody suspended or disbarred, that that be sent to all of the jurisdictions where the attorney practices. 
    So that would surely provide, in our opinion, a substantial incentive for any attorney to conform to the opinions of his New Hampshire peers. 
    Thank you, Your Honors.
