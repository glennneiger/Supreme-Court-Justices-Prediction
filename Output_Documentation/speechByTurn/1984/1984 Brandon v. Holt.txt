Brandon v. Holt

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented by this case is neither complex nor novel. 
    The issue, simply put, is whether a judgment against a public official in his official capacity runs against the official personally or against the entity for which the official works. 
    The District Court in this case found that the director of the police department in Memphis was liable in his official capacity. 
    The Court of Appeals concluded... I think this is maybe best cast as a construction of what such a judgment would mean... that a judgment against an official in his official capacity runs against the official personally, not against the entity of which he is an employee. 
    The question before the Court is whether the District Court erred in this regard.

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    Well, I think there are... that would be a somewhat different question. 
    The first issue is, if we have a judgment against the official in his official capacity, assuming that judgment was correctly entered, who has to pay. 
    The second question, I think, encompassed within your own is, might such a judgment be improper because of the nature of the case and the way it was tried.

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    Well, I don't think we have an ambiguous situation as of the time the case went to trial or even as of 19 months before that. 
    As I indicated, 19 months before trial, we filed a memorandum in the District Court making crystal clear that we sought to impose liability on the defendant only in his official capacity, and noted that this Court's decision in Monell had held that an official capacity judgment ran against the entity.

    Well, on our reading of the federal rules, no such amendment was necessary. 
    The defendant was certainly on notice as to what we were trying to do and on whom the liability would be imposed. 
    There is nothing in the federal rules as they now stand that requires that notice be in the complaint.

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    Well, Your Honor, the Supreme Court had decided the issue twice by 1979, both in our favor. 
    All the Courts of Appeals had concluded that Rule 25(d) means what it says on its face, that a judgment against an official in his official capacity is a judgment against the entity. 
    I don't disagree that we would have avoided a trip to Washington had we amended the complaint in that way, but in our view the trip should have been unnecessary, and the rules mean what they say.

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    Well, prior to the existence of Rule 25(d) and its predecessor under the 1937 Rules of Federal Civil Procedure, there were lawsuits against officials in their official capacity. 
    There was an enormous amount of confusion as to just what that meant, and Rule 25(d) was meant to clear that up. 
    But I would argue were we now standing and arguing this in 1936, that the result would be the same. 
    It would be a more difficult argument, however. 
    But the notion, the concept of official capacity lawsuits has been around for quite some time, going back well into the previous century. 
    In any event--

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    Well, I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    We do have a number of very specific findings of governmental practices here set out in the District Court's opinion. 
    There was a finding that it was the policy of the department never to fire a violent officer, not to transfer officers for disciplinary reasons. 
    There is a finding that it was the policy of the director of the department to insulate himself from knowledge of any abuses by officials, and there is also a finding of what I think is clearly a custom within the meaning of Monell, a code of silence among all the officers involved not to disclose what abuses might be going on within the department. 
    We think those findings are sufficient to meet the Monell standards, and they are express findings. 
    This is not a case like Wainwright against Witt. 
    We aren't arguing that just because we won in the District Court, the Court should presume there must have been some unstated findings in our favor. 
    We think that Rule 52, like Section 2254, refers to real live written or oral findings, but we have those here. 
    And we think they are entirely sufficient. 
    Indeed, they are considerably more specific in detail than are present in ordinary Monell cases.

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    Yes, and I don't mean by my response to Justice O'Connor's question to suggest that that is an issue that ought to be addressed here. 
    It, like the problem of Peratt against Taylor, was not raised at the trial court, was not raised in the Court of Appeals. 
    It probably can't be raised at this stage in the litigation in any event, but certainly if it can be raised it ought to be looked at in the first instance by the Court of Appeals. 
    I think the only thing that is properly addressed by this Court is whether the judgment that we won, assuming it was correct, ran against the city. 
    We are delighted to win this case at any time on any issue in any forum, but I am constrained to acknowledge that, as Mr. Justice White suggests, under the ordinary practice of this Court, the Monell issues are issues which should be dealt with in the first instance by the Court of Appeals. 
    The specific events which gave rise to liability in this case are set out in the findings of the District Court. 
    The most important finding with regard to that incident was that the assault in question happened under color of law. 
    Patrolman Allen used his police weapon. 
    He used his police identification to get one of the petitioners out of the car, and then assaulted one petitioner with a knife, and as the petitioners fled used his service revolver to attempt to kill them. 
    The District Court, as I also noted, found a number of specific policies which had been engaged in by the police department, and concluded, I think correctly, that--

    Certainly the Judge made it clear he understood that the city was going to be liable. 
    Not only did he reiterate on three occasions that Chapman was liable in his official capacity, but in his opinion he quoted that portion of this Court's decision in Monell which said a finding of liability against an official in his official capacity runs against the entity rather than the official person.

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    --Let me answer those questions in reverse order. 
    I think your description of the policy is correct. 
    It was not the policy of the city to encourage assaults on teenagers parked in shady lanes in the middle of the night, but it was the policy of the department to take no action and indeed to make no effort to remove from the force officials whom were well known to be dangerous officers, people who have a propensity for violence, who were regarded in this case as so dangerous by their colleagues in the department that other police officers would not ride in the same squad car with the patrolman who committed this offense. 
    This is a case in which there was virtually a complete breakdown in control. 
    I mean, people were given guns and badges and set loose on the citizenry. 
    There was simply no control over them. 
    If they turned out to be dangerous, violent human beings who went around beating people up or shooting at them, the police department in Memphis had a policy of doing nothing about it. 
    And we think that such a policy certainly is sufficient under Monell. 
    Monell contemplates that liability is imposed not merely for--

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    I think that your characterization of it is a very strained one. 
    Reviewing the trial transcript, and indeed the briefs on appeal, looking at that very issue, my reading of what happened is that no one really questioned that there was a constitutional violation here. 
    You had two individuals accused of no crime whatsoever who were assaulted by a police officer acting under color of law. 
    There doesn't seem to have been a point in the litigation where the defendants denied, and I think no defendant reasonably could, that that violated the Constitution in a number of ways. 
    The issue as all parties perceived it below was whether or not liability for that extended beyond the particular patrolman who wielded the knife and pulled the trigger. 
    And again, like the problem about Monell, that is an issue which was not raised in the District Court, was not raised in the Court of Appeals, probably can't be raised at this late date, and in any event shouldn't be raised in the first instance here without the Court of Appeals having a chance to look at it. 
    The District Court judgment, as I indicated, ran against the director in his official capacity. 
    The Court of Appeals concluded that that judgment in fact was a judgment against him personally. 
    Based on that premise, it then applied the good faith and immunity rule of Scheuer against Rhodes and Procunier against Navarette, and found that Director Chapman had acted in good faith. 
    At the point of the District Court opinion, as chance would have it, by operation of Rule 43(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Director Chapman was no longer a party to the litigation. 
    Of course, he had left office prior to the decision of the Court of Appeals, and the nominal defendant at that point was Police Director Holt. 
    In any event, the narrow issue which we think is before this Court is not an issue of first impression. 
    In our view, it is an issue of fourth impression. 
    The question of whether a judgment against an official in his official capacity runs against the entity or against the individual personally has been resolved three times before. 
    It was first resolved by this Court in Monell. 
    In Monell, the question was what standard would apply in the case of an action against a municipality, and the Court noted that that same standard, the precise scope of which I think we agree is not entirely clear yet, was equally applicable to a suit against an official in the official's official capacity.

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I perhaps understated the language in Monell. 
    Monell says that a claim against an individual in his official capacity is generally the same as a claim against the entity of which he is an official. 
    Now, the word "generally" I take it was sort of precautionary language the Court customarily and wisely uses, you know, to guard against the possibility that some situation might arise where such a claim wasn't to be treated as identical to a claim against the city. 
    But Rule 25 in our view contemplates that they are to be treated as the same thing, and no case comes to mind which would be different. 
    It is one of the annoying things about the law that cases which don't come to mind sometimes do come to pass, and I don't want to... as the President is prone to say, Presidents never say never, I am a little reluctant to say never myself. 
    But certainly no case that I can imagine exists in which these... in which a judgment against an official in his official capacity would be any different than a judgment against the entity itself. 
    In any event, the specific question at issue here is whether there is any difference between a judgment against an official in his official capacity and a judgment against the entity with regard to the good faith defense recognized by Percunier and Scheuer against Rhodes. 
    That was the precise issue that was before the Court in Owen against City of Independence, in which the officials... the defendant was not just in that case the City of Independence, but a number of officials who were sued in their official capacity, and the Court in Owen noted that only the liability of the municipality was at issue in Owen, not any liability of the individuals. 
    A similar reading of what it means to have a judgment against an official in his official capacity was made by the Court in Huddo against Finney with regard to liability issues and the Eleventh Amendment. 
    We think that all of these decisions are clearly correctly decided, and one need look no further than the actual language of Rule 25(d), which provides that upon the removal from office of any official in an official capacity action, his or her successor is to be substituted. 
    That rule would make absolutely no sense if an official capacity judgment imposed personal liability. 
    That would mean that if we had a judgment against Mr. Chapman in his official capacity for $1 million, he resigned and was replaced by Director Holt, that we could then garnish Director Holt's salary and seize Director Holt's house. 
    It is simply inconceivable that the framers of Rule 25 contemplated that an official capacity action could produce personal liability of that sort. 
    On the contrary, the committee note makes it quite clear that official capacity actions are actions which, although brought in form against a named officer, are intrinsically against the government.

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    I am not sure about that, but I would say that certainly must have been its intent, because the problems which arose that Justice Frankfurter referred to in 1951 about official capacity lawsuits were mostly lawsuits against government officials for money. 
    Snyder against Buck and the like were actually damage actions, and it had long been assumed in those cases, in suits against a postmaster or whatever, that the government was going to actually have to pay the bill. 
    The problem in those cases was one postmaster would leave office, another postmaster would come in, and there would be procedural chaos. 
    But I expect if we took another look at the committee notes, there would be reference to a number of these cases, most of which, as I say, were damage actions, not injunctive actions. 
    I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

    The Court of Appeals in its opinion clearly stated that this was a suit against an individual and not against the city, and further went on to say that what claimants were doing in effect was attempting to amend their complaint at this stage to include the city under the guise that it was an official capacity lawsuit.

    Mr. Henry L. Klein 
    --Because Mr. Chapman as police director should have known of Officer Allen's dangerous propensities, the courts find that he must be held liable in his official capacity to the complainants. 
    But the problem there, if Your Honor please, is that that is really an inconsistent finding, because if the only question is whether he should have known, this is obviously a negligence type question, not a Monell type question. 
    Nothing ever came into play in the District Court's findings with regard to Monell. 
    No reference whatsoever. 
    No reference to the Monell standards. 
    That is the part about the District Court's opinion that becomes a little bit confusing, because on the one hand you are dealing with the issue of should have known, which we submit is clearly nothing more than a negligence issue, and then on the other hand it is finding him liable in his official capacity, and as we read the law, there would be no way under a simple negligence finding that he could be liable in his official capacity. 
    But in any event, the court did, as Your Honor points out, the court did make such a finding, but then when it got up to the Court of Appeals, it was obvious that they considered it nothing more than a negligence type question as to whether or not there were any dangerous propensities or he should have known, but then went further to say that in that this is just a case against the city... or against the individual, and not against the city, that the director was entitled to good faith immunity.

    Well, the fact that we did not object I don't think was inconsistent with what we were trying to do or what our theory was. 
    There could be no question before the Court of Appeals what our theory was. 
    And frankly, we did... I say ignore. 
    We did not respond. 
    That's true. 
    But we did not consider that that had any merit, because it didn't apply or should not apply in an individual capacity case.

    --Not... well, if Your Honor please, the Court of Appeals didn't treat him as having been removed, because a reading of... the Court of Appeals opinion talks about Director Chapman throughout, and never makes any reference to Director Holt. 
    Of course, what had happened was, Chapman had left office, and Director Holt had been appointed by the mayor, and that is when this attempted substitution was filed. 
    But a reading of the Court of Appeals opinion clearly shows the Court of Appeals didn't consider that Director Holt was in the picture because they considered that it was an action individually against Director Chapman, and so stated. 
    So, they didn't pay, so to speak, didn't pay any attention to the fact that there had been this proposed substitution.

    Mr. Henry L. Klein 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, again, from an analysis of the Court of Appeals opinion, what is clear is that they were dealing with only one issue, and that was whether or not there was any liability on the part of Director Chapman, and we say individually, and the standard that should be applied to determine that liability. 
    The court comments that the parties in the case expended considerable energy either relying on or distinguishing in their opinion an opinion in the case of Hayes versus Jefferson County, and that was a Sixth Circuit case that applied the applicable standards. 
    The question was whether the standard in Peratt v. Taylor would apply or whether a greater degree of negligence should be applied. 
    And by the fact that both parties were spending a considerable amount of time addressing themselves to that issue, it was obvious to the Court of Appeals that the only issue that was before them was one... a question of negligence, and not a question of policy under the Monell standard. 
    And as I say, they go ahead to find that in reality, the plaintiffs are attempting to amend their complaint so as to treat the police director as though he were the city in order to provide the qualified immunity which shields Director Chapman. 
    Nothing was ever referred to, no mention was ever made of any Monell standards in the Court of Appeals. 
    The case started out clearly as a case against Director Chapman, without any reference to it being an official capacity lawsuit. 
    There was any attempt to bring the city in. 
    There was never any attempt to amend to bring the city in, which they clearly could have done. 
    And even though this case was filed before Monell was decided, the Sixth Circuit in various opinions had held that the city could be brought in under Section 1331 and the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    But be that as it may, no attempt was ever made to bring the city in.

    Mr. Henry L. Klein 
    --If it were an official capacity suit. 
    That is what the cases have held, Your Honor. 
    That is correct. 
    But since this was not done, it is our position it was clearly tried as an individual capacity lawsuit. 
    Interestingly enough, a motion for summary judgment was filed pretrial, and at that time there were three defendants in the case. 
    There was Officer Allen, and there was the mayor, and there was the police director, Chapman. 
    And the court dismissed the mayor on the grounds that he did not actively participate in the acts that were involved, and as a supervisory personnel, there was nothing to establish any liability on his part, and considered very carefully whether or not Director Chapman should have been dismissed, and then finally concluded that because through discovery there were two letters that were found that may indicate that he may have known something about this individual officer, the court declined, on that basis and that basis alone, the court declined to grant the summary judgment, and said that there may be some genuine issue as to whether Director Chapman knew or should have known about the danger.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    How do you get away from this being an official capacity case under Monell?
speaker="henry_l_klein" startTime="2407.350" stopTime="2582.876">
    Mr. Henry L. Klein 
    Well, the way I get away from it, Your Honor, is because of the standard which should be applied under Monell. 
    The fact that he was acting in his official capacity, and there are many cases which I am sure Your Honor is fully familiar with where we deal with individuals acting in their official capacity in the operation of whatever it may be, school board, police department, or what have you, and there can be no question that he was acting in that role. 
    He wasn't acting as just an individual off the street. 
    Of course not. 
    He was acting in his official capacity. 
    But the standards that have to be applied are entirely different, we contend, with regard to whether or not he would be liable in his individual and liable in his official capacity, and the only way that he could be liable in his official capacity would be under the Monell standards, whereas he is the alter ego of the police department. 
    The police department obviously can't function without its representatives, and he, of course, stands in that position, and anything that he does, of course, does represent the police department. 
    But in order to hold the police department liable or the city liable in this circumstance, we would have to, as we say, apply the Monell standards. 
    But I cannot say that he wasn't acting in his... in an official capacity, but I think it is quite common that suits against officials, whether they be individual or in his official capacity, he was certainly acting as school board member, or as an officer of the state, or as a member of the police department. 
    But the fact that whether he is individually liable or liable in his official capacity really brings into play two different standards, and if you are going to say that liability or at least suing him in his official capacity is just another way of suing the entity itself, we submit that the Monell standards would have to apply, and not the typical negligence standards which apply in cases against individuals who, although are acting in a so-called official capacity, but who would be liable individually rather than as a representative of the city. 
    As I mentioned, the court preliminarily came very close to dismissing Director Chapman on a motion for summary judgment, and it was obvious at this point that the Court was only considering Director Chapman in his individual capacity.

    --If Your Honor please, in the appendix there is a reference to the order granting the motion for summary judgment, and in denying the summary judgment as to Director Chapman, the court said that it was denied, but granted leave to file a renewed motion for summary judgment if additional discovery shows that there was no actual or genuine issue as to Chapman's lack of knowledge. 
    So, when we say close, if Your Honor please, what we are saying is, the court was giving very careful consideration to whether there was even enough in the case to hold Director Chapman liable based on what he knew or should have known, and did grant leave to file a renewed motion on that one point. 
    But again, what we are saying is, it was clear that the only thing that was being considered was Chapman as an individual, and not in an official capacity, which would be another way of holding the city in. 
    The findings of the court, the District Court, with regard to the liability of Director Chapman, as I have stated previously, do not meet the Monell standards, and the court talks about, for example, unjustified inaction.

    Mr. Henry L. Klein 
    Well, to that extent, but, Your Honor, again, this is the point I was making before. 
    That's the confusion and inconsistency with the case. 
    When you look at the standard on which it was actually tried, whether he should have known, which is clearly not an official capacity, official policy case, and then the District Court's conclusion that, yes, he was found liable in his official capacity, that's where the inconsistency comes, and that's where the confusion comes. 
    And of course if the city had been brought in initially, then a lot of this would have been avoided, but unfortunately that wasn't--

    Mr. Henry L. Klein 
    --Well, my theory of the defense was that it was strictly a negligence question whether he should have known, and of course our whole effort was directed toward showing that there was really no way that he would have known, not having come and been there for the short period of time, and that he was trying to implement new policies, trying to make changes, but that it was almost as if they expected that he went back and read every file on every... on some 1,250 or 1,275 police officers to determine who was good and who was bad. 
    It was our argument that the law just didn't impose that standard on him.

   Rebuttal of Eric Schnapper

    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    No.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3043.897" stopTime="3045.836">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    That's what I understood.
speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="3045.836" stopTime="3199.438">
    Mr. Eric Schnapper 
    A couple of quick things. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist earlier asked whether under Monell one had to have a policy. 
    At 436 US at 690, the list of things that are sufficient under Monell includes a decision, so a discrete act or, I would think, failure to act as well as an ongoing failure would be sufficient. 
    Mr. Klein suggested, though I may have misheard him, that there was no discussion at the trial court level of the Monell standards. 
    At Page 21 of our brief, we refer to a discussion of just those standards, and the need to prove policy under Monell. 
    However, we think that much of the discussion that we have presented runs a bit far afield of what the Court should appropriately decide at this juncture. 
    There are two, perhaps two questions that we have been considering. 
    First, did the District Judge properly find Chapman liable in his official capacity, and second, is such a judgment against an official in his official capacity a judgment which runs against the city rather than against Chapman personally. 
    It is only the second question that was decided by the Court of Appeals. 
    Indeed, it was only the second question that was raised in the Court of Appeals. 
    The Court of Appeals at three points in the Joint Appendix, Pages 30, 39, and 46, characterizes this as a suit against Director Chapman in his official capacity, and at Page 46 squarely holds that a judgment against an official in his official capacity runs only against him personally. 
    Now, at this juncture, that finding, I think, stands almost undefended. 
    I think Mr. Klein came close to conceding that it was wrong. 
    Certainly he has not gone to the point of arguing that it is right. 
    But in any event, that is the only decision that was actually resolved by the Court of Appeals, and we think that is all that need appropriately be considered here. 
    The question of whether the District Court should have imposed liability on Chapman in his official capacity is a much more far-reaching, far-ranging kind of bundle of problems, none of which were addressed below. 
    In discussing them, we have conducted something of a grand tour of civil procedure jurisprudence, the problems of Monell, of Percunier. 
    Mr. Justice Stephens raised some issues about the Swind against Pullman standard. 
    We've got problems under Rules 8 and 9 and 12 and a bunch of other rules. 
    None of these questions were raised below. 
    None of these questions were decided below. 
    And none of these questions in our view need be decided here.
