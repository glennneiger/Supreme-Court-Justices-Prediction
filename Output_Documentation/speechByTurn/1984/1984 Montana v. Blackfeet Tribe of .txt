    Ms. Deirdre Boggs 
    Thank you, Your Honor, and if it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether the express tax authorization provision in the 1924 Indian Mineral Leasing Act which would allow Montana to tax the Blackfeet Tribe's mineral royalties has been eradicated. 
    The 1924 Indian Mineral Leasing Act allowed the Secretary of the Interior to enter into long-term leases for oil and gas on unallotted lands on treaty reservations with the consent of the affected tribe. 
    That Act also allowed for the taxation of all minerals, not just oil and gas, produced on these same allotted lands. 
    No regulations were ever drafted to implement the taxation provision of this Act. 
    The State of Montana has taxed oil and gas production on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation since 1936 when this Court held in British-American Oil Producing Company that the 1924 Act applied to the Blackfeet oil and gas leases. 
    In 1977 the Solicitor held that the 1938 Indian Mineral Leasing Act replaced completely the 1924 Indian Mineral Leasing Act, so that the tax authorization that was specifically included in the '24 Act was limited to pre-1938 Act leases. 
    This case was filed by the Blackfeet Tribe shortly afterwards. 
    The Blackfeet Tribe alleged and insisted that some of the state's taxes fell under royalties. 
    They alleged that the 1938 Act completely replaced the '24 Act, and that that replacement did away with the taxing provisions in the '24 Act. 
    And they alleged that the language in the 1924 Act which refers to such lands that can be taxed is limited to lands that are leased in fact under the 1924 Act. 
    In Montana the oil and gas producers file all the tax returns with the state, and they are solely responsible for all tax payments. 
    The producers are not parties to this case, and the tribe doesn't challenge the taxes on the producers' share. 
    The predecessor taxes to the Montana taxes challenged here were challenged in 1935 within months of a written opinion that was issued by the Department of Interior stating that Montana's taxes could not be imposed on the production of oil and gas on the Blackfeet Reservation. 
    The taxes on both the producers' share and the royalty owner's share in that case were specifically challenged in British-North American Oil Producing Company. 
    The only difference in the operation of the taxes in that case and this case is that the net proceeds tax in that case had a mandatory pass-on provision where although the producers paid the taxes and filled out the forms, there was a mandatory requirement that a pro rata share of the taxes that would fall on the tribal royalties would be collected from the royalty owners. 
    The taxation authority of the state was upheld on all taxes in that case. 
    Montana has collected all of the taxes since the British-American decision, notwithstanding the passage of the 1938 Indian Mineral Leasing Act. 
    The purposes of the 1938 Indian Mineral Leasing Act were set forth in the reports that accompanied that legislation. 
    The purposes were to cure specific defects that Congress had observed in the Indian mineral leasing statutes. 
    It did not change the taxation authority that was granted in the '24 Act. 
    None of the contemporary commentators of the... or around the '38 Act suspected that the taxation authority had been eliminated by the passage of the '38 Act. 
    Felix Cohen in his 1942 edition of 328 talks about the intent of the 1938 Act. 
    He refers to the letter from the Department of Interior that we've included in the Petitioners' appendix where the defects in the Indian mineral leasing scheme are itemized in detail. 
    And he says that 
    "A reading of that letter throws considerable light on the problems intended to be met by the Act. " 
    And again, the letter that's in the report... this is Senate Report 985... goes into the most specific details about the defects that Congress sought to cure.

    There are three references to the 1977 Solicitor's opinion acknowledging that opinion and accepting it; that is, that the '38 Act wiped out the tax authority. 
    That was not the position in any of the previous editions... either of the two previous editions of the book.

speaker="deirdre_boggs" startTime="428.876" stopTime="694.197">
    Ms. Deirdre Boggs 
    --Justice O'Connor, it can't. 
    The taxation provision can't, I think, because the taxation provision allows for taxation of oil and gas and other minerals on the unallotted treaty reservation lands. 
    The leasing part of that Act only permits the Secretary to enter into long-term leases for oil and gas on those lands. 
    I think the only grammatical and logical way to read that taxation provision is that it applies for all mineral productions on those unallotted treaty reservation lands. 
    I think that if nothing else, the inclusion of other minerals in that taxation provision... that is, minerals other than the ones that the leasing provision allowed for... would make it so that we have to read the tax provision to apply to more than just lands leased under the Act. 
    The administrative practice, in addition to the Solicitor's opinions up till 1977, was to allow Montana to levy and assess the taxes on the leases on the Blackfeet Reservation. 
    We and the tribe both refer to the variety of Solicitor's opinions and the opinions from the Department of Interior which reaffirm the power of the state to exercise its tax, and in one case in 1954 talk about a procedure that would be allowed that Montana statutes implement; that is, the procedure where the producers themselves pay the taxes, fill out the tax forms, and then subtract the tax payments from the royalty payments to the tribes. 
    Then in the Montana situation, the USGS then credited those tax payments to the royalty payments. 
    In 1978, shortly after the Solicitor issued its opinion, the U.S. Geological Survey issued a letter to the producers in Montana warning them that no longer would the tax payments that they were making and deducting from the tribal royalties be credited to their royalty payments. 
    The en banc opinion of the Ninth Circuit held that if you impose the policy of Congress in the Indian Reorganization Act and other acts on a reading of these two acts together that the taxation provision in the 1924 Act has disappeared. 
    Congress has not acted since 1938 in relation to this issue. 
    The state urges in this case that rather than overlay a policy or a perceived policy of Congress or a changed policy of Congress on the interpretation of the taxation provision or whether it still exists, that the Court look at the statutes using more ordinary analysis for statutory construction. 
    We would urge that the Court look at the Section 7 repealer in the 1938 Act which repeals acts or parts of acts inconsistent with the '38 Act, and read that the way this Court has always read that, which means that those provisions of previous acts, especially specific ones specifying certain things that are not inconsistent with a later act, remain.

    I feel that the part of the 1924 Act that provides specifically for state taxation remains; that it's never been eliminated and that it therefore remains. 
    I think that an analysis of whether or not there has been a repeal has to be made when you have a specific provision in an earlier statute, and there's a later statute that's a general statute dealing with the same subject.

    Ms. Deirdre Boggs 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In British-American Oil Producing this Court had to struggle with what "such lands" meant, and one of the challenges in that case was whether or not these were unallotted lands, because in fact... it's rather peculiar situation... in fact, the surface lands that we're talking about here were allotted. 
    The minerals were reserved. 
    And the position taken by the producer in British-American Oil was that Section 10 of the 1919 Mineral Leasing Act had to apply to those lands, because you're not dealing really with unallotted lands. 
    This Court held that the reserved mineral rights beneath the surface lands were on allotted lands. 
    That was a specific... one of the specific holdings of this Court in British-American. 
    Most, if not all, of the surface lands in dispute here were allotted lands with the minerals specifically reserved under Section 10 of the 1919 Act, which this Court held did not limit the application of the '24 Act to the leases.

Reynolds as it applies to an interpretation of the repealer language that we have here, it's our position that even if the Court were to overlay Indian Reorganization Act policies on its interpretation of what the 1938 Act does and doesn't do in relation to these taxes that the conclusion does not have to be that these taxes were wiped out. 
    The IRA policies that the Ninth Circuit looked at were the policies to undo the Allottment Act policies. 
    They were concerned there with the land losses that had taken place under those policies, and that was what they wanted to reverse. 
    And in doing that, they made a specific provision exempting from taxation lands that were purchased under the IRA. 
    That is the only tax exemption provision in the Indian Reorganization Act. 
    And this Court has held in the Kescalero v. Jones case that even when you're dealing with the specific lands referred to that were to be tax exempt that that reference doesn't mean that any income received from those lands are to be tax-exempt. 
    There's absolutely no mention in any of the materials relating to the Indian Reorganization Act in any of the reports or voluminous hearings related to that Act where Congress gave any suggestion at all that they wanted to undo the previously authorized tax provisions in any of these mineral leasing acts. 
    The result and the conclusion that the Ninth Circuit reached here, the way they reached it I think is quite extraordinary; that is, they read the various congressional policies as they say them to eradicate something that Congress had never eradicated. 
    In Hess v. Reynolds this Court said that when there's a repealer such as the one in the 1938 Act that repeals acts or parts of acts inconsistent with the Act, that that in itself means that there remains... there remains the specific provisions in previous acts so long as they're not contrary to the later general act. 
    And it's that sort of analysis that I think this issue presents to the Court. 
    I think that if that sort of analysis is given to these statutes, even if the Court were to look at the Indian reorganization policy, that the tax provision that was written specifically in the 1924 Act would be found to stand.

    Ms. Jeanne S. Whiteing 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case turns on a question of statutory construction: the meaning of the 1938 Mineral Leasing Act. 
    It is our position that the '38 Act is a prospective replacement for prior leasing laws, and that it is a comprehensive statute which governs all terms and conditions for the leasing of tribal lands for mineral purposes. 
    References to other statutes are therefore unnecessary and are neither... and are not required.

    --I think... yes, we are saying that. 
    And in fact, the Sections 1 and 2 of the 1938 Act essentially track the language in the 1924 Act. 
    In effect, they incorporate and carry forward that language; but significantly, they do not... or Sections 1 and 2 do not, and nothing else in the 1938 Act carries forward or incorporates the tax.

 It's quoted at page 37 of the appendix of the Petitioners. 
 It's the Ninth Circuit's rendition. 
 It starts out saying, "Unallotted land on Indian Reservations", with an exception. 
 Then you go to the proviso: 
 "that the production of oil and gas and other minerals on such lands. " 
 --parenthetically, I take that to mean unallotted lands... 
 "may be taxed by the state in which said lands are located. " 
 Now, don't you think that literally applies to the leases in this case?

    Ms. Jeanne S. Whiteing 
    That's correct. 
    Now, Montana makes the point that the oil... the taxing consent in the 1924 Act cannot just apply to 1891 Act leases because it authorizes taxation of not just oil and gas but other minerals as well. 
    But the 1891 Act as a whole certainly authorized leases for mining purposes and not just oil and gas mining. 
    And after all, the 1924 Act is an amendment to the 1891 Act, so the tax consent is consistent with those lands that were subject or those purposes for which the 1891 Act was a leasing authorization. 
    Basically, it is our position that the terms of the 1924 Act in themselves make clear that the tax consent applies only to lands leased under the 1891 Act, and that these lands at issue here or the leases at issue were not subject to lease under the 1891 Act after 1938.

    And under the test in White Mountain Apache, even things like gasoline taxes and other more minor taxes were found not to be applicable.

    Ms. Jeanne S. Whiteing 
    That's correct. 
    So our argument that the 1938 Act is a prospective replacement for prior leasing laws rests on several premises: first, the wording of the statute, which we've talked about; second, its legislative history and purposes; historic Indian policies and administrative treatment in practice. 
    One other point about the wording of this 1938 Act is that Sections 1 and 2 do essentially incorporate and refer to the words of the 1924 Act. 
    Congress was obviously looking at that act when it enacted the 1938 Act, and it chose to incorporate the most important provisions of that Act governing leasing, but significantly, it did not carry forward and incorporate the tax provision of the '24 Act. 
    Montana insists that the tax consent is ambulatory and that it attaches to other provisions, but... unless it is specifically repealed. 
    But our argument does not raise any specific issue of repeal, although we do recognize that the '24 Act may still continue to exist to govern prior leases. 
    The second premise of our argument is that the legislative history and purposes make clear that the '38 Act is a replacement statute. 
    The legislative history is clear that prior laws were considered inadequate; that the '38 Act was proposed as a more satisfactory law for leasing of Indian lands for mining purposes; and it was proposed as an act to regulate mining on Indian land and not to amend prior laws. 
    There were three major purposes of the 1938 Act: to bring uniformity to the area of Indian law or Indian mining; to bring mining leases into harmony with the Indian Reorganization Act; and to ensure that the Indians received the greatest economic return from their land. 
    Each of these purposes would be thwarted--

    --Well, it does support like treatment, and this is our point for '38... from 1938 forward. 
    We do recognize that there is some lack of uniformity because post-'38 leases and pre-'38 leases would be treated differently; but that uniformity I think is... or lack of uniformity is less... is more acceptable than the lack of uniformity found otherwise.

   Argument of Edwin S. Kneedler
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2430.038" stopTime="2546.423">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The state concedes in this case that there's nothing in the language or the legislative history of the 1938 Act to authorize state taxation of leases issued under the Act, and that, in our view, is a sufficient answer to the state's claim in this case; because it is well established that in the absence of an express authorization, states have no authority to tax on Indian reservations. 
    There are a number of reasons why that principle is particularly forceful here. 
    First of all, in 1937, just a year earlier, the same Congress that passed the 1938 Act revised the special Kwapaw Taxing Act that we discuss at page 19 of our brief in which Congress, in response to this very concern that states might be viewed to have power to tax absent some express authorization in the statute, put in statutory form the rule that it understood to be applied in such cases; and that is that Indian resources are held without being subject to state taxation in the absence of a waiver. 
    And the Kwapaw tax statute is significant for another reason: because that tax, even though it applied in the special circumstances of Oklahoma that we describe at some length in our brief, induced Congress to authorize taxes. 
    Congress nevertheless narrowed that particular tax to limit the type of tax, to limit the amount of the tax, to limit the minerals that it applied to. 
    And in our view it seems quite unlikely that Congress, having done that for Indians that Congress had believed were appropriately subject to state taxation, would have intended to preserve by mere inference the much broader and open-ended tax authority that had been enacted in 1924. 
    And this is especially so since the '24 Act was specifically patterned after the Kwapaw taxing statute in Oklahoma.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler

    What I am suggesting is that the... is the tool of construction for construing the 1938 Act. 
    I'm not suggesting that the Indian Reorganization Act or this Kwapaw statute of their own force narrowed the prior taxing authority, but for example, when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, it expressly did that to bring the '38 leasing schemes into harmony with the policies of the Indian Reorganization Act. 
    It's that fact that makes the Indian Reorganization Act relevant, because Congress decided that the leasing program should be coordinated with the IRA, and for that reason it is appropriate--

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, the 1938 Act is a break with the past. 
    Section 1 of the Act says, 
    "Hereafter, unallotted lands on Indian reservations shall be leased pursuant to the terms of the 1938 Act. " 
    That is a break with the past of the prior leasing laws, including the 1924 Act. 
    And, in fact, the 1924 Act itself reinforces that because it... as has been pointed out, the taxing proviso mentioning such lands refers back to unallotted lands that were subject to leasing under the 1891 Act. 
    After 1938, no such lands were subject to leasing under the 1891 Act. 
    And I don't understand Montana to dispute that proposition.

    No. 
    They were subject to leasing under both. 
    This Court's decision in British-American viewed the 1891 and 1924 Acts as a unit and said that there. 
    So they were... they were... they were actually subject to leasing under both acts. 
    And there's another reason why the taxing provision can't be thought to be carried forward here, and that's that it's in the form of a proviso. 
    And this Court has established a presumption that a proviso is ordinarily thought to refer simply to the substantive provision to which it's attached. 
    And here, as has been pointed out, all of the substantive provisions dealing with the leasing... the term of the lease, et cetera... has been entirely superseded by the 1938 Act. 
    If that's the case, then the proviso that was simply appended to the prior substantive leasing authority--

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --The leases themselves do not reflect the taxing, to my knowledge. 
    I wanted to mention one other thing about the Indian Reorganization Act, and that is that the taxing authority here was part and parcel of the allotment policy, because the tax applied here to lands, unallotted lands that were expected to find their way into the full jurisdiction and taxing authority of the states when they passed into non-Indian hands. 
    And the 1934 Act abandoned the allotment policy.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, they are not... they are not binding, but this Court has indicated that the... that the persuasive force of the views of an administrative department depends on the factors or various factors, including whether it was contemporaneous. 
    Here it wasn't. 
    The thoroughness with which it was considered. 
    Here there's just a paragraph and a half in the 1956 opinion on the subject. 
    So all of the factors that this Court said and identified in Skidmore and General Electric v. Gilbert point against deferring to the administrative interpretation.

   Rebuttal of Deirdre Boggs

    Ms. Deirdre Boggs 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Your Honor, we would agree with Mr. Kneedler that the 1942 edition of Cohen should be looked at here. 
    And Mr. Kneedler cites us to Cohen for the proposition that the '38 Act superseded the '24 Act and that that supersession does away with the tax authority. 
    Mr. Cohen on another page that none of us have cited in our briefs, page 257, talks about--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3105.360" stopTime="3106.570">
    Unknown Speaker 
    257 of what?
speaker="deirdre_boggs" startTime="3106.570" stopTime="3322.324">
    Ms. Deirdre Boggs 
    --Of his 1942 edition of "Federal Indian Law"... excuse me... talks about the authority of states to tax. 
    This was after 1938 that he put out this edition. 
    And there in that section he refers to the 1924 Act as the example of states' authority to tax as granted by Congress. 
    It's clear that in the earlier page that Mr. Kneedler refers to that Felix Cohen is referring to the leasing provisions, not the taxation provision, in the 1924 Act. 
    The tribe insists that this is a case involving statutory construction, and it is. 
    And the tribe went through the fact that the '38 Act incorporates and carries forward all parts of the '24 Act except the taxation authority. 
    The reason for this is that Congress had very specific defects in mind with the Indian mineral leasing that it set forth to cure; and it has told us what those defects are. 
    One is that on some reservations no leasing was permitted. 
    A major defect is that in many cases where leasing was permitted... for example, in the 1919 Act... the tribe had absolutely nothing to say about whether or not there would be leases. 
    They didn't have a thing to say about it. 
    Another defect was that in many cases there could not be long-term leases, which, of course, prohibited production. 
    And, in general, the defects inherent in the 1919 Act for metals where the public land laws applied to minerals... mineral leasing on Indian reservations were seen as things that needed to be cured. 
    They do not see taxation as a problem that needs to be cured. 
    The replacement theory I think doesn't work, can't work in this case where you have a repealer that repeals only things inconsistent with the act stated, especially when we have Congress telling us what they're doing with the '38 Act. 
    And what they're doing is taking care of specific defects which do not include taxation. 
    I'd just like to quickly say one other thing. 
    I wasn't clear on whether Mr. Kneedler indicated whether or not the U.S. knew or didn't know about the taxation in the state of Montana. 
    Part of the evidence submitted to the district court by the tribe included sheets where the U.S. Geological Survey specifically credited to the tribal royalty the amount of taxes paid by the producers. 
    There are sheets and sheets of this where the United States has given credit to the producers on the royalty payments. 
    And the other thing that again was in the district court record... it's not part of the printed record here; it's attached to briefs in the district court... is a letter, 1978, from the Geological Survey, again to the producers, indicating that this past policy of crediting to the royalty payments the taxes or some of the taxes that they paid will no longer happen, indicating again that the practice had been to do that pretty consistently. 
    Thank you.
