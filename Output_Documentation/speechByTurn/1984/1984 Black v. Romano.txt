    Mr. John M. Morris, III 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the respondent, Nicholas Romano, entered a plea of guilty in November of 1976 to two felony counts of the transfer and sale of a controlled substance. 
    The record indicates that Romano had sought to trade 26 pounds of marijuana to a person who turned out to be an undercover police officer in exchange for heroin. 
    In April of 1977, after the preparation of a presentence investigation, a hearing was held before the circuit judge, the state circuit judge who had accepted Romano's guilty plea on the issue of sentence, and at that hearing Romano's attorneys presented testimony and evidence which sought to mitigate the offense and consequently keep Romano out of prison. 
    After hearing this evidence, the court observed that he had labored with this case, as he had with any in which a person might be sent to prison, and the court also remarked that Romano's past track record was not very good. 
    Nevertheless, the court said, because this was not a personal crime, a crime against a person, he was inclined to and would grant probation. 
    So saying the court sentenced Romano to two concurrent terms of 20 years' imprisonment, suspended the execution of those terms, and placed Romano on probation for a term of five years, and at that time indicated to Romano that in all probability when that five years were up he would add a second five-year probation term for a total of ten years' probation on this offense. 
    Two months after he was placed on probation, a car driven by Romano struck and seriously injured a young man outside the bar where Romano was employed as a bartender. 
    Romano did not after the accident remain at the scene or identify himself. 
    Instead, he absconded. 
    He drove away. 
    He sought to conceal his car at the home of his employer at the bar, who parenthetically was the only live character witness at his sentencing proceeding. 
    He stayed out of sight for some eleven or twelve hours, and then finally after that period came to the victim's hospital room and sought to blame the victim for the accident. 
    At the revocation hearing... the offense of driving while intoxicated under Missouri law is a felony, and revocation proceedings were instituted, and at the revocation hearing, the only issue that was advanced by Romano and his attorneys was whether he was guilty of leaving the scene of an accident. 
    No contention whatsoever was made by evidence or by argument that if he were guilty, that he should no be and could not be sent to prison. 
    The state circuit court, the judge who had originally heard his guilty plea and made the decision on the sentence, heard the case, concluded in written findings and conclusions that he had indeed committed this act, and based upon that, stated that his probation was revoked. 
    Three years after he was incarcerated, Romano filed the first of a series of state and federal--

    Mr. John M. Morris, III 
    It is rather a substantial additional period of time. 
    I think he is currently... until the District Court's decision reversing his... overturning his revocation, I think he was scheduled to be on parole until the turn of the century, 2000 or thereabouts. 
    The District Court in granting this habeas corpus petition professed to find in this Court's decisions of Morrissey versus Brewer and Gagnon versus Scarpelli a procedural due process requirement that any revoking authority, revoking court or presumably a board in a probation or parole revocation case was required to specify on the records that it considered various alternatives to incarceration, which the District Court said included driver training classes and public service and restitution and such like, and that the court is not only required to specify that it considered such alternatives, but it must specify as to why it rejected them. 
    The District Court in fact said if this was not done on the record at the time of the revocation that the revocation is not only invalid but perpetually so. 
    The District Court refused the petitioner's request for an evidentiary hearing in which the state circuit judge might have been called to testify about his state of mind. 
    The Eighth Circuit affirmed this, what we submit to be a novel principle even though it had previously rejected a similar attempt in a federal probation revocation case called United States versus Burkhalter.

    Well, that is a matter of some uncertainty, Your Honor. 
    The petitioner and respondent dispute, and Missouri law really hasn't settled whether or not, for example, the court could reduce the sentence that was originally imposed, instead of 20 years, put it down to ten years. 
    It just simply hasn't come up in appellate cases. 
    I believe it is safe to conclude that the court could have changed the terms of his probation or imposed some other sort of equitable remedy, not that there is any direct authority for it, but that has been the procedure in the past. 
    There has been no problem with that. 
    The petitioners submit that the decision of the Eighth Circuit below is not only not supported by Morrissey and Gagnon but is directly contrary to it and is not consistent with any reasonable due process analysis.

    Mr. John M. Morris, III 
    Yes, I think that is fair to say. 
    I don't have any... I am not an attorney who does probation revocations at the trial level, but I have that impression. 
    In Morrissey and Gagnon, this Court acknowledged a significant liberty interest in revocation and probation and parole. 
    And the court said, I think perfectly correctly, that there are two stages to a revocation decision, the first being whether a person is guilty of the alleged probation or parole violation, and the second is what this Court called the predictive and discretionary decision as to whether he should be sent to prison or what other disposition should be made of this person because of the violation. 
    The Court stated that both of these questions involve factual bases. 
    Obviously, the first decision, the guilt decision is almost entirely factual, but even when one is talking about a decision on sentencing after one finds that a violation of probation has been committed, this Court said it is important to know not only that some violation was committed, but also to know accurately how many and how serious the violations were. 
    Thus, this Court established a framework, a procedural framework whereby the facts of the case, the facts pertinent to both these issues would be reliably and fairly determined. 
    This Court described the remedy, the procedure it was requiring under the due process clause in Morrissey as an informal hearing structured to assure that the finding of a parole violation would be based on verified facts, and that the exercise of discretion would be informed by an accurate knowledge of the parolee's behavior. 
    And this Court expressly in Morrissey rejected the concern that this procedure that it was mandating would impair or affect the exercise of discretion. 
    It said, a simple factual hearing will not interfere with the exercise of discretion. 
    Yet that is exactly what the Eighth Circuit is doing in this case, and that is exactly what respondent demands. 
    There is not the slightest contention in this case that the facts of this matter were not adequately developed, that the state circuit court was not fully aware of all pertinent facts both pertaining to the person's guilt of the revocation and to enable him to make a decision as to what disposition should be made. 
    Rather, what they are asking, and what the Eighth Circuit is saying can be done and should be done as a matter of federal constitutional law is that for the federal habeas court to look into the mind, based purely upon the record, of the state revoking judge or revoking authority and say that that court or authority did not use the right mental process in arriving at its conclusion. 
    And I submit respectfully that that is completely beyond the contemplation and beyond the policy that was stated by this Court in Morrissey and Gagnon.

    Mr. John M. Morris, III 
    That is how I understand the Eighth Circuit and the District Court's requirement to be, that the court is required to make some sort of record statement by which it can be determined what it was thinking about when it made the decision on sentencing. 
    It must say, I consider A, B, C, D, and E as alternatives to incarceration, and I don't think they are adequate because A, B, C, D, and E. 
    And again, that is... goes beyond the factual concerns that this Court had in Morrissey, and it goes to the question of the exercise of the Court's discretion. 
    Now, the respondent has very heavily relied upon one passage in this Court's decision in Morrissey, and it was in the early part of the decision, in Part 1 of the decision, in which this Court said, as I just mentioned before, that there are two states, the stage of determination of guilt of the violation and the decision on sentencing. 
    He has not only cited this over and over again, but he cited lower court state and federal cases that simply quoted the language, as if the language supports his conclusion. 
    The difficulty, the petitioners submit, is that this language was a purely factual statement in this Court's opinion. 
    It contained no constitutional holding or principle. 
    It is a correct factual statement. 
    Exactly the same thing could be said that this Court said in Morrissey about a criminal trial. 
    One could say that there are two stages in a criminal trial, a determination of whether the person is guilty of the offense charged, and if he is guilty whether he should be sent to prison or put on probation or whatever the alternatives may be. 
    Yet this Court has repeatedly recognized in cases too numerous... I can cite several, but this Courth has well established that as a matter of constitutional law one cannot review the sentencing discretion of the state court unless the sentence itself is inherently unconstitutional, or there is some other due process defect. 
    This Court has, in Roberts versus United States, United States versus Grayson, and other cases, has acknowledged that that area is not a constitutional question.

    Respondent had two attorneys at the hearing. 
    Evidence was introduced, and there was after the evidence full argument by both sides. 
    The other language in Morrissey that has been relied upon besides the two step language, which again, we submit, is not constitutional in its character, is the admittedly constitutional requirement that the revoking authority state the evidence it relied upon and the reasons for revoking probation. 
    The respondent has sought to draw this into what he believes to be the constitutional right to consideration of alternatives to incarceration, yet that requirement is easily understandable as permitting and facilitating an appellate review of the decision to revoke probation. 
    For example, in this Court's decision in Douglas versus Bruder, this Court held that due process was violated because the person who was revoked, there was no evidence to support a finding that he had committed a probation violation. 
    Particularly where you have multiple charges of probation violation, obviously a finding is essential to allow a court to make that sort of decision. 
    Similarly in Bearden versus Georgia, there had to be something on the record to indicate that the probationer was revoked because he could not pay his restitution.

    Mr. John M. Morris, III 
    --Nothing regarding the appropriateness of a sentencing decision was said. 
    Their only theory at the revocation proceeding was that he was not guilty of leaving the scene of an accident, and that was their evidence, and that was their argument. 
    There was nothing else. 
    In the present case, as far as the finding, a finding requirement is concerned, there was only one issue at this revocation hearing, and that was, again, whether or not he was guilty of leaving the scene of an accident. 
    The court indubitably found and expressly and extensively found that he was indeed guilty of leaving the scene, and the court said based upon the evidence that he discussed and the credibility of the witnesses he discussed, the court said based upon this evidence, this probation is revoked. 
    The court has by its finding, which is in the Joint Appendix, in the last few pages, the court has by its finding stated the evidence upon which it relied and the reason for revoking probation, and that is all that this Court has ever asked of a revoking authority, be it a court or a parole board. 
    Had respondent originally been sentenced to imprisonment, there is no dispute that there would be no requirement, and respondent has not attempted to dispute that there would be no requirement that alternative incarceration be specified by the sentencing court. 
    Although we acknowledge that there may be some difference in terms of liberty interest, although frankly I find it very hard to analyze what liberty interest or what due process principles apply to sentencing, because this Court really hasn't directly addressed it, we submit that the two decisions are qualitatively the same, and in fact in many cases, principally involving a suspended imposition of sentence, they are identical. 
    They are one and the same. 
    In a suspended imposition of sentence, of course, a person is convicted or pleads guilty, and no sentencing decision is made, and he is placed on probation. 
    The decision is simply deferred until such time, if ever, that his probation is revoked. 
    I submit that it is not reasonable or it is not an offense against fundamental fairness to hold that these two are essentially the same, and the discretion that exists as to one should and does as a matter of due process exist as to the other.

speaker="john_m_morris_iii" startTime="1313.823" stopTime="1516.172">
    Mr. John M. Morris, III 
    The latter, Your Honor. 
    Our position is that there is or there should be, there has never been in the past, at least, any requirement that alternatives to incarceration is a constitutional question. 
    The purpose of the statement of the revoking authority is to show that it has... the facts upon which it relies to permit appellate review of its decision on that subject, and that is pretty much the extent of the statement. 
    There is no requirement according to the state's position that there be alternatives to incarceration considered because this is a matter no longer of fact, which Morrissey and Gagnon cover, but of discretion. 
    It should be clear, I think, why the State of Missouri and the 19 other amici curiae states oppose this holding of the lower court. 
    We submit that this is an engraved invitation to a whole new front of federal habeas corpus litigation involving probation and parole revocations. 
    I know the inmate writ writers, some of them I am acquainted with would just be absolutely ecstatic at the notion of saying in every case in which one has a probation or parole revocation, trying to come up with new and creative alternatives that the revoking court did not consider. 
    On top of that, we submit, and the respondent has cited no cases, and we are not aware of any, in which this alternative, this requirement of consideration of alternatives to incarceration exists. 
    He cited a number of state cases. 
    Most of these cases... and federal cases, and most of these cases simply cite the two-step language, which does not get him anywhere. 
    There are a couple of cases that address the question of whether one can prevent the introduction of evidence in mitigation at as revocation hearing, and that is not in issue here. 
    In fact, that was pretty well covered in Morrissey. 
    With one possible exception in, I believe, Hawaii, this is an entirely novel principle that respondent is urging. 
    And for reasons I have already discussed, we think it is completely out of line with what this Court has previously demanded in terms of due process of probation and parole revocation. 
    There is one final reason why this holding should be opposed, and I think if respondent didn't benefit from this, the lower court's decision, I would think it would oppose it on the same grounds. 
    The fact is, and as we have stated it is absolutely undisputed that there is, according to respondents' position and according to the decisions of the court below, they seek to create a disparity, a difference in burden between a sentencing decision after the original pleading of plea or finding of guilt and a sentencing decision after a revocation of probation. 
    In fact, in doing so, they have created an additional risk, an additional concern for a state sentencing court in deciding to put someone on probation. 
    If he puts the person on probation, there is a possibility that a number of years down the line that habeas corpus can be filed, and a number of years down the line the person can be... if the right words are not said at the time of the revocation, that he can be, in this case, discharged completely, whereas if a person sentences this individual to a term of imprisonment initially, that is undisputably by the holdings of this Court not a subject of review unless there is an inherent constitutional--

    Here is the sequence, Your Honor. 
    He was, of course, placed on probation. 
    He was revoked. 
    He was sent to prison based upon the revocation of probation. 
    In about 1983 he was paroled, so therefore his current custody status if this case as we hold it to be, that the lower court decision is invalid and the decision of the... the revocation proceeding was proper, the proper remedy is to restore him to parole, which is where he was when this case was decided.

    Mr. John M. Morris, III 
    Your Honor, it is no different than if he were originally sentenced to 20 years, he had done five or whatever he did and was released on parole. 
    We are not asking that he be sent back to prison. 
    We are just asking that he be restored to the custody level at which he was at the time of the... that the Missouri law provides for and which he was on at the time. 
    But the final point I would like to make is that this does create a greater risk, a greater concern for a court in deciding to put someone on parole, and I just would... I am amazed to hear this point advocated, because it would seem to me in close cases, and I submit this was a close case involving a decision on prison versus incarceration, this individual amazingly, even the presentence investigation recommended that he be incarcerated, that he not be placed on probation. 
    He had committed a rather serious, rather large-scale drug offense, and his record, as the Judge said, was not very good. 
    I can't believe that there wouldn't be or couldn't be in some cases, that this would, this disparity of consequences, this risk is not going to weigh upon judges' minds, and that is no more in the interest of the State of Missouri than it is in the interest of persons who are candidates for probation and parole, because Missouri, like every other state, has its concern with prison population. 
    So, we submit for all these reasons and under this Court's decisions in Morrissey and Gagnon, this decision of the Eighth Circuit should be reversed. 
    Thank you.

speaker="jordan_b_cherrick" startTime="1815.682" stopTime="1979.888">
    Mr. Jordan B. Cherrick 
    He is on parole. 
    However, that parole term extends until the year 2002, which is a very serious and difficult, grievous loss to his liberty. 
    We are asking in terms of the remedy that this Court affirm the lower court's decision and release him from all custody because he in effect has served out his probation term in jail, and that is the remedy under Missouri law, as the District Court found. 
    When the District Court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals granted Romano a writ of habeas corpus, we submit they remedied a very gross injustice in this case. 
    Jim Romano spent five and a half years incarcerated as a result of an unconstitutional probation revocation hearing which occurred almost eight years ago in Lebanon, Missouri. 
    This Court should require and should hold that the due process clause, the Fourteenth Amendment requires that trial judges should state on the record whether alternatives should be considered before revoking probation, and we submit that this Court should make this holding and follow this holding for three principal reasons. 
    First, it is the precedent of this Court, a 12-year precedent in the landmark decisions of Morrissey versus Brewer and Gagnon versus Scarpelli. 
    In those cases this Court stated that alternatives to incarceration should be considered before a trial judge revokes probation. 
    We have cited numerous federal and state cases which have applied that rule, have it applied it consistently and uniformly. 
    There is no conflict among the state and the federal courts as to this issue. 
    Mr. Cherrick, do you think then that Morrissey and Gagnon included a substantive requirement like that along with their procedural requirements? 
    Justice Rehnquist, we believe that was part of the procedural requirement of Gagnon. 
    Indeed, all the numerous cases which we have cited in our brief follow that rule. 
    There is a two-step rule requirement in a revocation hearing. 
    First is the issue of whether a probation violation existed, and second, if a violation is found, and this, of course, is the critical issue in this case, should the probationer be recommitted to prison or should other steps be taken to protect society-- 
    Supposing that the state law provides and the sentencing judge sentenced under a statute that says I am giving you parole, but if your parole is revoked, your probation is revoked... was it probation or parole? 
    Probation in this case.

    Mr. Jordan B. Cherrick 
    Yes, Justice O'Connor. 
    However, the Court noted in Bearden that fault was not the standard by which the alternatives to incarceration requirement should be considered. 
    Indeed, we believe that Bearden stands for the proposition that this issue must be decided, as the Eighth Circuit said, on a case by case basis. 
    There can be no bright line drawn as to when alternatives to incarceration must be considered. 
    There are an infinite amount of factual possibilities as to what the underlying crime is and what the probation revocation is. 
    That indeed is why Bearden was decided on its facts. 
    The Court was able to look at those particular facts and state under those particular facts that an indigent who fails to make restitution, it would be fundamentally unfair to revoke probation without considering alternatives under those facts.

    As to the crime, the probationer is punished later by the state. 
    In this case, for example, the state decided that this crime which Romano committed involving this traffic accident was careless and reckless driving, and they punished him under the state's purposes.

    Mr. Jordan B. Cherrick 
    --It is fundamentally unfair if, for example, the probation violation is a technical offense. 
    For example, if a probationer does not report, let us say, one Friday afternoon to his probation officer, and the court states, yes, we think the law is that for any probation violation probation must be revoked, no matter whether it is significant and whether it has any relationship to the underlying offense, whether it reflects that the probationer can no longer be supervised or rehabilitated in the community. 
    Indeed, this is the situation here. 
    Petitioners have conceded that the record is silent as to whether Judge Whipple in this case considered alternatives to incarceration at the revocation hearing, but the record does say something very interesting, and that is at the sentencing hearing Judge Whipple told Jim Romano in no uncertain terms that he was prepared to revoke the probation for any violation. 
    We suggest that while that possibly may have been hyperbole on the judge's part, if indeed Judge Whipple thought that was the law, it violated Morrissey and Gagnon and deprived Romano of his due process rights, because on the face of it his conduct involved in the probation violation had no rational relationship to the underlying crime. 
    It did not compel the conclusion that his probation had failed.

    No, Your Honor, that language was from the Eighth Circuit opinion, but our basic point is that there is a requirement that the trial judge look at the facts or the probation violation and see whether it indicated that the probationer could no longer be rehabilitated or supervised in the community.

    When Judge Whipple restored that liberty to Romano at the sentencing hearing and said, this court as a matter of law does not think that you need to be incarcerated, that you can be rehabilitated or supervised in the community, that liberty interest which is so strong cannot be taken away upon arbitrary reasons.

    That is true, and the only... and the condition of parole or probation in this case that was relevant was the general condition in which Romano stated, I will obey all the laws of the state of Missouri. 
    If this Court does not hold that reasons or alternative be considered, this Court in effect will be saying that if a person runs a stop sign or gets a speeding ticket, and a judge decides that he should automatically revoke probation, that that is fundamentally fair.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Let me ask you a hypothetical question quite close to this. 
    Suppose that after the verdict of guilt on his drug charge but before the sentence, he had then been involved in this hit and run situation, and that on the sentencing then the judge said to him, I was giving serious consideration to putting you on probation, but here within weeks after this verdict you committed this other offense, and I just want you to know that that is one of the reasons I am not going to put you on probation. 
    You are hereby sentenced to whatever the sentence was. 
    Would you have a constitutional question, do you think?
speaker="jordan_b_cherrick" startTime="2522.356" stopTime="2549.623">
    Mr. Jordan B. Cherrick 
    Mr. Chief Justice, no, because under the facts which you state, that is the classic sentencing situation of which a person is not entitled to significant due process rights. 
    A person who has been convicted of a crime has been constitutionally deprived of his due process rights, and therefore we accept the traditional rule, and we are not asking, as the state suggests, to extend this rule that sentencing judges state reasons on the record or state alternatives. 
    But when Judge Whipple--

    How do you--

    --In Gagnon the Court stated that the second step of a prohibition revocation hearing is that the judge should determine whether the probationer should be recommitted to prison or should other steps be taken to protect society and improve chances of rehabilitation. 
    Later in the Gagnon decision the Court stated as part of the due process requirements that a court must state its evidence relied on and reasons for revoking probation. 
    There were no reasons that were articulated by the trial judge in this case on the record.

    The basis for the rule in Gagnon is the Court balanced the various interests. 
    The Court in a due process balancing context looks at the individual's interest, the state's interest, and society's interest, and we submit that all of these interests are identical in that they... that all these interests feel that... have an interest in probations not being revoked for arbitrary reasons.

    Mr. Jordan B. Cherrick 
    --Justice O'Connor, as to the remedial question, first, it is supported under Missouri law, and under Missouri law once a probation term has expired, the court must release the probationer from all custody. 
    As that original probation hearing was unconstitutional, Romano spent the maximum term of probation is five years in jail. 
    The trial judge in this case, District Judge Cahill, an experienced judge... sat on the state bench for five years, and in the same position as Judge Whipple, sat as a state judge in St. Louis... was well familiar with this law and ruled that the probation term had expired. 
    So, first, we think it is a question of state law which this Court traditionally defers to lower courts to interpret state law. 
    We would agree that... we feel that this is the rare case. 
    Certainly in the typical case the simple remedy is to remand for a new hearing which would comply with due process, and we do not dispute this. 
    The remedy in this case is unique because of the time that has elapsed, the five and a half years in jail, the eight years between the probation violation and the revocation hearing. 
    So this is really a unique case.

   Rebuttal of John M. Morris, III
speaker="john_m_morris_iii" startTime="3578.944" stopTime="3638.483">
    Mr. John M. Morris, III 
    Just one point, Your Honor. 
    There has been some persistent questioning about what it is that respondent in the lower court expects in the way of findings. 
    Just in addition to what has been said and the questions that have been asked, I would like to direct the Court's attention to the District Court's opinion, and it says... and oddly the court says if this issue is raised there needn't be a finding. 
    But if it isn't raised, the court says, the trial court must express a rudimentary explanation for the rejection of alternatives. 
    A record devoid of anything but a mere recital that alternatives have been considered and denied does not comport with justice. 
    So, I do dispute respondent's assertion that all one has to... this seems to be an open-ended requirement. 
    Not only you cannot say, well, I considered alternatives, but you have got to say, by my inference, at least, that you considered a certain number of alternatives and presumably if someone comes up with some new ones later, like apologizing in the town square, that is going to be a violation of the Constitution.

    Thank you, gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
