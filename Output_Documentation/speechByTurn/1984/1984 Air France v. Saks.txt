    Mr. Stephen C. Johnson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case turns on the proper construction of a treaty. 
    It also involves important considerations of judicial restraint under our constitutional system in the treatymaking process. 
    The treaty is the Warsaw Convention, the agreement governing it a national aviation. 
    This Court considered and enforce the liability ceilings under that treaty last term in its Franklin Mint decision. 
    We are asking the Court now to consider and enforce prerequisites for that liability under the Convention. 
    As the Court has noted this treaty has been in effect now for over 50 years, and has provided stable and internationally uniform rules governing international air transportation. 
    There is, however, now pending a balanced package of amendments to the Warsaw Convention which have not yet been ratified by the U.S. Senate. 
    As the Court noted last term, those amendments remain on a... calendar. 
    The majority below has nevertheless upon judicial fiat enacted only one of those amendments by removing a prerequisite for carrier liability for personal injuries under the treaty as it now stands. 
    In so doing, the majority has misinterpreted the treaty and has inappropriately interfered with the treatymaking powers of the political branches. 
    In this case we ask the Court to enforce the provisions of Article 17 of the treaty. 
    That article establishes as a prerequisite for carrier liability for passenger injury and death claims the requirement that such injuries or death be caused by an accident. 
    That prerequisite for liability has been universally recognized by the courts. 
    The Third Circuit has properly, in our view, applied that prerequisite in its DeMarines decision by stating its two basic elements, first, that there be an accident, and second, that that accident proximately caused the injury. 
    The majority below has acknowledged the requirement. 
    However, in the guise of treaty construction, their decision would effectively abolish that requirement by allowing recovery where a flight has been normal in all respects and no accident has occurred to cause the injury.

    And in his comments he stated that because there was a different case for liability in each of the three categories, that was the reason they broke out the three different articles, and he specifically stated, let me quote to you, he told the Conference that their committee 
    "had deemed it would be better to begin by setting out the causes of liability for persons, then for goods and baggage, and finally in the case of delay. "

    I think, Justice Stevens, yes, we probably do, but I think first of all you should realize that in this case I think we are dealing with the two extremes, the air catastrophe and the absolutely normal flight. 
    I don't think under any interpretation can that be considered to be an accident. 
    I think that the dissent below has properly used the DeMarines standard.

    It's difficult, isn't it, when you get into the middle area, and in fact I think the parties to the Convention have had difficulty with this themselves. 
    I have some comments to talk about these pending amendments, and even there, when they are talking about expanding the scope of carrier liability to include all events, which is not the current treaty, the treaty parties still hold back an exception for any injuries due to the internal state of the health of the passenger.

    No, I don't think so, because I think you can easily see that a carrier has a duty to retain people that don't go about the airplane spilling coffee. 
    Also in the air turbulence situation, there are regulations that require an airline to take measures to try to avoid air turbulence. 
    So it is something that certainly is within the scope of things that the airline should be avoiding.

    --Yes, I think that has been fairly well established now. 
    The Husserl decision was the first one to reach that point, and it did find some basis in actual discussions among the treaty parties for finding that the accident liability would extend to those incidents, which is quite distinct from our situation here, you realize, where we have a perfectly normal flight, where there is no indication anywhere in the history of this Convention that that should fall within the prerequisites for liability.

    I think there again you can view that in terms of the duty of the carrier. 
    It certainly is unexpected from the standpoint of the carrier, and I think that the carrier does have the duty to protect passengers from unexpected events like that, and assault by another passenger would well, I think, fit within the DeMarines definition.

    In other words, once you have an accident, liability is presumed.

    Mr. Stephen C. Johnson 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    I think the task for this Court is simply to decide what the accident requirement means. 
    That is correct. 
    There is a very good analogy, I believe, to what the majority below has done here. 
    It is the strict product liability doctrine, where a manufacturer is held absolutely liable for the consequences of defects in their products. 
    They are not held liable for all the injuries caused by their products. 
    So the task as I see it under the Warsaw Convention now is to recognize that there must be an accident before the absolute liability doctrine comes into play under the Montreal Agreement.

    Mr. Stephen C. Johnson 
    If that happened, Justice Marshall, I think it would definitely be an accident. 
    Aircraft are not expected to slam on their brakes and throw passengers out of their seats. 
    It is a broad standard that the Third Circuit has enunciated to try to effect the intention of the parties. 
    I think it is important, though, to come back to the narrow issue presented by this case, and it is whether the respondent's injury in this case was caused by an accident within the meaning of Article 17, and the question is whether the everyday normal conduct of an aircraft, in fact the necessary operation of an aircraft pressurization system can be the independent accident that causes the injury. 
    As the Court well knows, the beginning point in the construction of a treaty is, of course, the language of the treaty itself, which should be construed to avoid rendering any word meaningless. 
    This Court has recognized, as it did last term in Franklin Mint and long ago in the amiable Isabella, that the courts are not at liberty to dispense with any of the conditions or requirements of the treaty. 
    If we adopted the respondent's view of what the Warsaw Convention means, you could simply withdraw that phrase if the accident which caused, and just go on to say that the damage. 
    There is no basis in the history of this Convention to suggest the majority view below is correct, and the decision below has departed from these basic principles by reading the word "accident" to mean any occurrence associated with the operation of the aircraft. 
    Carrier liability under Article 17 requires that the injury be caused by an accident, not by an occurrence, and this should be compared, Justice O'Connor, with the language in Article 18, where the word "occurrence" is used. 
    As I indicated, the Convention's history and the comments of the president of the drafting committee to my mind indicate that that was a deliberate choice. 
    Also, the parties' subsequent construction of the treaty, which is also ignored by the majority below, confirms that the respondent is now asking this Court to amend Article 17 as it now stands. 
    I speak specifically of the proposed treaty amendments adopted in the Guatemala City Protocal of 1971 and included in the 1985 protocols, which as this Court recognized still await Senate ratification. 
    Several proposed amendments were adopted in those two diplomatic conferences which constitute a balanced package significantly increasing the carrier's scope of liability, increasing the liability limits in an exchange for more a unbreakable ceiling on carrier liability. 
    Part of the proposed compromise specifically amends Article 17 to change the word from "accident" to "event". 
    If the amendments are adopted, the carriers will become liable for a broader class of injuries not now covered by the Convention. 
    The pending amendment to Article 17 reads exactly like what respondent is proposing this Court should have done. 
    The treaty parties, however, have not yet adopted it. 
    The present treaty is limited to injuries caused by accidents and not by normal events or occurrences. 
    You mentioned the Montreal Agreement. 
    Both the respondent and the majority below assert that that 1966 private agreement among international air carriers effectively removed the Convention's act as a prerequisites for carrier liability. 
    The U.S.'s brief explains, as does the history, that that agreement addressed only the due care defense and in no way affected the prerequisites for carrier liability. 
    The task of this Court is to apply the provisions of Article 17 as they now stand. 
    The rewriting and renegotiation of treaties are the tasks of the political branches. 
    You have the amicus briefs of two of the principal acting nations responsible for the Warsaw system. 
    The Republic of France was largely responsible for the creation of the system in the 1920's.

    Your Honor, I don't believe so, because normally in all other countries that are not affected by the Montreal Agreement, they go immediately to the due care defense. 
    So there are some decisions in France, but those are the only ones that we have been able to find. 
    In addition to the Republic of France, you have their amicus brief, the United States, as the Court well knows, has been a most important force in the history of the Warsaw system since this country adhered to the treaty in 1934. 
    Both governments join the petitioner--

   Argument of Carroll E. Dubuc
speaker="carroll_e_dubuc" startTime="1142.757" stopTime="1279.280">
    Mr. Carroll E. Dubuc 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on behalf of the Republic of France, as indicated by Mr. Johnson, one of the principal signatories and one of the initiators of the original Warsaw Convention, we rise to emphasize to the Court on behalf of France and other countries of Western Europe as well as throughout the world the extreme importance to these nations of the continued enforceability, reliability, predictability, and uniformity of result with respect to dealing with matters arising under this treaty until such time as the signatories and the parties have come to a mutual agreement to modify it as might be necessary if desirable. 
    There have been questions from the Court today concerning a number of hypothetical situations and also a question of how other countries would have decided this issue. 
    The Haddad case is cited in our brief in two or three opinions. 
    There is an Air Intere case in France which is cited in our brief. 
    There is also some commentary as to a Polish case by Razinsky, a commentary by the Societe Du Francaise Arien in France, the French Legal Society. 
    The thrust of those decisions is that an accident must be unpredictable and sudden in some aspects. 
    They have accepted to some extent the hijacking circumstance. 
    Haddad was in fact a case arising out of the infamous Entebbe hijacking, and the liability in that case, as Mr. Johnson mentioned, went off on the issue of Article 20, Sub 1, which provides the due care defense.

    There were two or three Montreal tickets which had been issued and delivered in the United States, and for the most part the rest of the tickets had no stopping place or destination place or destination here.

    --Ms. Justice O'Connor, I believe that we already are seeing, this Court is seeing a number of cases in the last couple of years dealing with interpretations of this treaty which is under revision and which is spawning a lot of litigation to interpret some esoteric terms that have existed for 40 or 50 years and have been interpreted that way worldwide. 
    The uniformity of this interpretation is important. 
    The decisions of this Court are very important. 
    The fact that we are getting lots of challenges at this point is spawning litigation, because not only in the area of personal injury or death, but in the area of commercial matters, baggage, cargo, this is a commercial code, so to speak, a partial uniform commercial code worldwide for aviation matters. 
    And when we disturb the balance, when we disturb the balance of interpretation, particularly in a treaty which is under dynamic reconsideration by 120 parties, I believe we are creating litigation.

    Mr. Carroll E. Dubuc 
    Ms. Justice O'Connor, the prompt resolution of claims anticipated by the Montreal Agreement was part of a quid pro quo which came as a result of the United States denunciation of the entire Warsaw Treaty in 1966. 
    There was a balance and a quid pro quo between the other signatories in the United States to do two things only, only two things. 
    One was to increase the limitation as an interim measure while this negotiation in Tokyo, Guatemala City, Mexico City, and Paris went on driving toward a potential amendment. 
    The second was to eliminate the defense of due care, but not to make an absolute liability. 
    Even absolute liability has a proximate cause inferring an accident as an element. 
    Even in California. 
    Even in the Ninth Circuit. 
    To make this an absolute, the interpretations of commentators are not the interpretations of signatories. 
    We submit to change a treaty definition or intent, you have to have the signatories agree. 
    The United States agrees that it requires an accident. 
    France agrees it requires an accident. 
    Most of the 120 signatories, virtually all of them, although we haven't polled them all, but we certainly haven't seen any opposition, agree with that accident interpretation. 
    So, the Montreal Agreement is still interpreted to require an accident with a presumption of responsibility, but not automatic liability. 
    I suppose the plaintiff's--

   Argument of Bennett M. Cohen
speaker="bennett_m_cohen" startTime="1820.500" stopTime="1894.892">
    Mr. Bennett M. Cohen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented is whether a total hearing loss suffered by an airline passenger through no fault of her own is a compensable injury under the Warsaw Convention as modified by the Montreal Agreement where her hearing loss was proximately caused by the operation of the aircraft, and was a risk inherent in and peculiar to air travel. 
    I would like to make three factual points at the outset. 
    Number One, if this Court were to affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision and return this case to trial, a one-day court trial would consist in part of the testimony of a board certified ear, nose, and throat specialist who would testify to a reasonable medical certainty that but for those pressure changes in that aircraft, the microhemorrhaging and consequent hearing loss in Ms. Saks would not have occurred, and that this hearing loss closely resembles other hearing losses he has treated due to pressure changes in aircraft.

    Mr. Bennett M. Cohen 
    No, Your Honor, we do not--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1909.902" stopTime="1925.692">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Suppose, then, suppose that she was the only one out of 225 passengers, she is the only one that suffers this. 
    You are suggesting that would stand, that would be a compensable injury?
speaker="bennett_m_cohen" startTime="1925.692" stopTime="2133.062">
    Mr. Bennett M. Cohen 
    --Yes, Your Honor, if she is the one out of 200, yes, and I think to answer the Court's question, we should look to the intent of the original framers and as the Republic of France stresses, we should look at the intent of the framers in light of the conditions and circumstances which existed at the time the treaty was drafted. 
    If we could imagine ourselves back in 1929, when aviation was admittedly and according to a CAP memo we cited an extremely risky mode of transportation, and imagine ourselves at an airport where we are watching passengers embark and disembark onto prop planes which today would be museum pieces, and say on Day One, because of the normal routine spinning of the prop, a boarding passenger has a piece of glass or a particle or something flung into his eye, causing blindness. 
    The next week, a passenger is boarding, and due to the normal, routine noise made by the prop on the plane he is boarding or one nearby, he suffers a total hearing loss. 
    The next week, we are on the plane itself, and due to the normal, routine noise inside this insulated passenger cabin, another passenger suffers a hearing loss. 
    Wouldn't the original framers have intended, and their primary purpose was to protect these fledgling airlines with a liability ceiling, wouldn't they have intended to have this ceiling protect these airlines from potentially ruinous liability to allow these airlines to not only have their operating costs, but to channel money into research and development to correct these types of deficiencies, or, as petitioner suggests, would the framers have intended that these injuries, that the airlines be exposed to unlimited exposure. 
    If we imagined back in 1929 that at year's end there are not just these three people but a half-dozen more or 30 more lined up at the county clerk's office, complaint in hand, alleging $50, 000 each in provable damages, surely the original framers would have wanted these fledgling, financially insecure airlines protected in those situations. 
    Now, Justice Stevens raised an important point with regard to air turbulence, because the entire thrust and common thread throughout the cases dealing with the Warsaw Convention is the interest to protect both the airline and the passenger from risks inherent in air travel. 
    The petitioner stresses that the common thread is really a sudden, unexpected occurrence, but let's look at air turbulence. 
    When you board the plane, the pilot says to you, fasten your seat belt and keep it fastened when you are seated. 
    The pilot may thereafter come on the intercom and say, we can expect to experience turbulence at this time, over this state, and it is going to be this rough. 
    Yet no court has questioned the right of the passenger to recover in that situation where due to the totally anticipated usual and expected turbulence he suffers some kind of injury.

    Mr. Bennett M. Cohen 
    There is a good reason for that. 
    Number One, in the preliminary draft of the treaty, there was no... they weren't distinguished. 
    They were all listed under the same article. 
    However, as Daniel Goodhice, who will be cited in our brief, who was a highly respected aviation expert back in the thirties, states, the word "accident" was used because the airlines should not be responsible for intentional wrongdoing by passengers. 
    In other words, if one passenger stood up and decided to strike a fellow passenger, that is not something for which the airline should be responsible. 
    The term "occurrence" was meant to cover, since the baggage was totally in the custody and control of the airline, it was meant to cover such things as theft or perishable goods going bad, which would not necessarily be accidents.

    They mean... the distinctions are slight, Your Honor, and let me give you one example why we should not make much of that distinction. 
    If on an airline you have in the baggage compartment a dog with his owner traveling above, and due to the normal, routine pressure changes or noise levels in this airplane both suffer hearing losses, under petitioner's view, the dog, or I should say the owner of the dog can recover for the hearing loss of the dog, while he himself is foreclosed. 
    The dog is entitled to a presumption of liability to which the owner is not.

    Mr. Bennett M. Cohen 
    I don't agree that that is the ramification of the position we are advocating. 
    Number One... there are two reasons for it... the Montreal Agreements deprive the airlines of all due care defenses. 
    Number Two, the cases dealing with terrorism, such as the Day case and the Evangelino case, all state that terrorism should come within the definition of accident because now in the present day world they are risks inherent in air travel. 
    And that is what I meant originally when I said the common thread throughout these cases was not something sudden, unexpected, and unusual, but rather risks inherent in air travel.

    Let me put this one to you. 
    Suppose someone comes on board, a lawyer, and puts his briefcase with five heavy books in on the open overhead rack, and the general practice of airlines is that they don't let you put heavy things up there. 
    Then some turbulence occurs, whatever degree, and the briefcase, with five or six or seven U.S. Reports in it, falls on the head of a passenger. 
    Now, that is an accident, isn't it?

    Mr. Bennett M. Cohen 
    Yes, it is now, and that raises an important point. 
    The Senate bill, the bill currently before the Senate to which I believe both Air France and Republic of France cited, would substitute the word 6, produced the result respondent seeks. 
    If it would produce the result respondent seeks, then it would necessarily work a radical departure from the present scheme and bring with it the parade of horribles they say the Ninth Circuit's decision causes. 
    And I ask the Court why, then, would President Gerald Ford, a conservative Republican, President Jimmy Carter, and President Ronald Reagan all give their full support to such a system which would open the floodgates and cause all these problems? 
    Additionally, in the letter of transmittal cited by the United States and the Senate hearings and the report of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, there is absolutely no mention of any intent to change the scope, the meaning, or do any type of historic reform of Article 17, the accident causing injury. 
    Rather, and the most sensible interpretation is that the change in language was rather intended to better express what the Warsaw drafters originally intended. 
    There are consequences of finding this case not to be under the Warsaw system, which I think are worth discussing in the few minutes left. 
    As the cases uniformly state, if this case does not come within the Warsaw system, this or ones like it, then it is back under common law negligence, and duty of the common carriers we know since the late 1800's has been that of the utmost care and diligence. 
    Again, let's imagine we are back in 1929, and these types of incidences are not covered by the Warsaw Convention. 
    We have a skillful plaintiff's attorney who goes into court, and blessed by a jury instruction of the utmost care and diligence, obtains a jury verdict of $100,000 or more, well in excess of the carrier's ability to pay. 
    There we have a situation where the principal purpose of the Warsaw Convention, which was to invoke a liability shield or ceiling for the airline, is totally defeated.

    Absolutely, Your Honor, and that is what the Abramson case says, the Husserl case, and all the other cases we have cited towards the end of the brief, and it is not subject to serious dispute, though petitioner attempts to distinguish those cases. 
    Article 24 of the Convention says for cases covered by Article 17, the limitations and conditions apply, meaning the liability ceiling. 
    The courts have clearly said in the Abramson case, and the Third Circuit said it in 1984, that if Article 17 doesn't apply, in other words, if there is no accident, you are allowed--

    --Not, Your Honor, respectfully, not as phrased. 
    We are asking for a broader interpretation which would allow the airlines to have a liability ceiling applied to more situations. 
    The consequences of not allowing a plaintiff to sue at common law, assuming grievous negligence on the airline, would be to in effect insulate the airline, provide him an immunity for what could be routine negligence. 
    For example, take the Abramson case, facts where the man got on the plane with a hernea condition, and he told the stewardess that he needed to lie down. 
    Knowing, aware of his problems, having the ability to correct the problem, she nevertheless declined to do so. 
    And she may have violated TWA or whatever it was express policy. 
    There was a wrong. 
    If he is not allowed... and the court clearly held it was not an accident and not an accident in part because it was not... that type of injury was not a risk inherent in flight, and therefore not an accident. 
    If there is no remedy, then Mr. Abramson has no chance of recovery--

 Well, if the Warsaw Convention is modified by the Montreal Agreement, says an airline is to be liable to a passenger in a case of accident, and this is not an accident, then you have to ask yourself, was this meant to be the exclusive liability for international carriers, and I dare say a lot of airlines probably thought it was. 
 I mean, the fact that one particular person can't recover for some kind of peculiar situation isn't a denial of justice across the board.

    --I think the Court is correct that originally the... and that was my argument at the outset when I cited those examples from 1929 with the ear injuries due to the normal rotation of the prop, the airlines and the countries probably wanted this to be extremely comprehensive, indeed, the sole exclusive remedy. 
    However, if we are allowed to interpret the word "accident" narrowly as petitioner contends, then the inevitable effect under all the cases will be, we will be back in state law court with unlimited exposure and seven-figure verdicts against the airlines.

 What you are saying, as I understand it, is, if the normal operation of an aircraft in a few seconds is to change cabin pressure by increasing it from... the equivalent of 6,000 feet change in altitude immediately, that is normal, and if that frequently and repeatedly caused hearing loss to passengers, normally did so, you might say that is not an accident under their definition. 
 It is nevertheless negligence to continue to do this, and you have a common law remedy.

    Mr. Bennett M. Cohen 
    Yes, that is correct, and petitioner's argument would have the following effect if you assumed you had a new airline which had a much better pressure system than Air France's, and Air France continued to fly its own planes. 
    The pressure system in this new airline malfunctioned so as to achieve the same type of pressure changes in Air France's 747. 
    The incongruous situation would be that you could recover against this superior airline that had the slight malfunction so as to function like the Air France plane, yet Air France would be immunized or would be not subject to the Warsaw Convention.

    There are values higher than uniformity. 
    It is better for this Court to be out of step with the Republic of France and right than to be in step with the Republic of France and wrong. 
    Years ago segregation was the uniform law of the land, and that was changed despite the fact that it was uniform because our value system said it was wrong. 
    We are not asking this Court to change the Warsaw Convention or make a modification in it.

    The short answer to the question of remaining state law claims is very simple. 
    It is on the face of the treaty itself. 
    There were two purposes in that treaty. 
    One was to establish some limits for liability. 
    The other was to provide uniform rules governing international air transportation, as stated in the preamble to the convention, and Article 1 states that the treaty applies to all international aviation persons and aircraft for hire. 
    Article 24 in the convention states that all the claims brought under that treaty shall be subject to the conditions and terms of the convention.

 Are you saying that even though this happened to thousands of people in normal operation, it could therefore be proved to be negligence, and I am not suggesting it could, but this I am on a hypothetical, that they would not then be able to sue you in negligence for saying that you normally operate your aircraft in a negligent way even though there are no accidents caused by it? 
 Couldn't they sue you at common law?

    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    Most of the cases that have said there are remaining state law claims apply to incidents that occurred outside the course of the transportation. 
    The convention doesn't apply at all.

    Well, in a sense it wouldn't apply because you have to have a direct... for liability first under the convention's uniform rules before you begin to consider a limit on liability. 
    I refer the Court to the Benjamin decision in the Second Circuit where they address this issue and also discuss the uniformity aspect, looking to some legislation outside of this country on the exclusivity question.
