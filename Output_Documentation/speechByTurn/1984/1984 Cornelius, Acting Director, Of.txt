    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the federal government's ability to fire or discipline employees who have engaged in serious misconduct. 
    Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, an employee who is fired or subjected to another form of so-called adverse agency action may challenge that action in one of two ways. 
    Any employee may seek to have the action set aside by filing an appeal with the Merit System Protection Board. 
    Alternatively, an employee who belongs to a bargaining unit may invoke the grievance procedures set out in the contract between his union and the agency that employs him. 
    No matter which of the routes the employees follow, the statute sets out the standards of proof and substantive rules that must control the decision in the case. 
    One of these statutory standards is the harmful error rule, which provides that an employee may have otherwise justified adverse action against him overturned if he is able to demonstrate harmful error in the agency's application of its procedures in arriving at its decision. 
    Reversal also is in order if the employee may demonstrate that the agency committed harmful error in the application of a procedural rule set out in the collective bargaining agreement. 
    The issue here is the application of this harmful error rule to two federal employees who undoubtedly engaged in serious misconduct. 
    The two were employed by the General Services Administration as officers in the Federal Protective Service when their employer received information that they had falsified law enforcement records to cover up misbehavior and had misused government property. 
    After conducting an investigation, GSA concluded that the charges had been proved, and it ordered the two employees separated from federal service. 
    The employees, who were members of a bargaining unit, elected to challenge this action by filing a grievance through the negotiated procedure. 
    The case went to arbitration. 
    The arbitrator found that--

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    They may differ, Your Honor. 
    In this case, the arbitrator found that the employees had committed the acts alleged, and that those acts fully justified the separation of the employees from federal service. 
    The arbitrator also found that GSA had misinterpreted its contract with the employees' union, and that misinterpretation led it to commit two procedural errors during the investigation into the employees' misconduct. 
    The employees had not been informed that they had a right to request the presence of a union representative when they were interviewed by investigating agents. 
    And the agency had delayed unnecessarily before informing the employees that they would be fired. 
    But the arbitrator concluded that these procedural mistakes in no way prejudiced the grievance case, did not affect the course of the agency's investigation, and had no impact on the agency's decision to fire the two employees. 
    Despite these findings, however, the arbitrator, in order to penalize the agency, ordered it to reinstate the two employees in the Federal Protective Service after they had served a two-week suspension. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld this decision. 
    The court accepted the arbitrator's findings that the grievants had committed the acts alleged and that those acts fully warranted their being removed from federal employment. 
    The court also accepted the arbitrator's finding that the procedural mistakes had no effect on the outcome of the case, and the court acknowledged that the statutory harmful error rule controls arbitral decisions. 
    But the court went on to conclude that a union may assert its own institutional interests during the course of an individual employee's adverse action challenge, if that challenge is brought through a negotiated grievance procedure. 
    As a result, the court found that an arbitrator must set aside otherwise justified adverse action taken against an employee on account of non-prejudicial that that error was in some undefined sense harmful to the employee's union.

    Could the government begin all over again and remedy the defects seen by the court?

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    It is not clear whether they could, Your Honor. 
    Since the arbitrator and the Court of Appeals imposed or took away the sanctions that had been imposed by the agency to penalize the agency, it might well be that the court would then find that the agency would be circumventing its order if it attempted to get around the penalty by reinstituting proceedings. 
    So, it is not clear whether--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="356.615" stopTime="368.533">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    On this holding of the Court of Appeals, would it be correct to say that it wouldn't make any difference what the offenses of these employees were?

    The focus--

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Purely a procedural problem.
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="382.224" stopTime="409.389">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --The arbitrator focused solely on the procedural mistakes that were made by the agency, and in fact the actions of the employees in this case were serious violations which the arbitrator noted could be subjected to criminal penalties. 
    The case had been referred to the United States Attorney, and he delayed taking action because he believed that it could be settled through the agency process. 
    So, even violations of law obviously are affected by the arbitrator's decision and the Court of Appeals' affirmance in this case.

    Justice O'Connor 
    Mr. Rothfeld, what remedies do you propose for the union under your view of the case to enforce the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in this regard?
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="409.389" stopTime="424.349">
 Justice O'Connor 
 Mr. Rothfeld, what remedies do you propose for the union under your view of the case to enforce the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in this regard?
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="424.349" stopTime="473.533">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, there are two points to make in response to that, Justice O'Connor. 
    First, most procedural violations will be addressed during the course of an adverse action challenge anyway, because any consequential violation of the collective bargaining agreement which had an effect or might have affected the agency's decision will be taken into account and may lead to the overturning of adverse action. 
    In those cases in which procedural errors had no effect on the agency's decision, the Act gives unions their own distinct remedial procedures that they can use. 
    Any union can file a grievance of its own challenging any violation of the collective bargaining agreement, and if it prevails, it might ask the arbitrator to issue a cease and desist order to the offending agency. 
    In clear cases of contractual violations, the union could also file an unfair labor practice charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Private arbitrators generally direct the remedy to whatever violations have been found, and I think that... if this is an instance where the union is asserting its institutional interests, and as the statute clearly allows it to do for any violation of the collective bargaining agreement.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, past misconduct or past procedural violations that had no effect on the outcome of the agency's decision, one thing the arbitrator certainly cannot do is reinstate penalized employees. 
    The harmful error rule forecloses the arbitrator from taking that action. 
    So, to that sense, procedural violations won't be addressed by the arbitrator except to the extent he will prevent the agency from committing... or direct the agency not to commit further violations in the future. 
    I think, Your Honor, the interpretation of the harmful error rule that is provided by the Court of Appeals can only benefit one narrow class of federal employee under any reading of the rule. 
    An employee whose adverse action was affected by procedural error will have that action overturned. 
    And under any reading of the rule an employee who brought his adverse action to the Merit Systems Protection Board will have that action overturned only if he can demonstrate that the procedural mistake had some effect on the outcome of his case.

speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="649.907" stopTime="758.508">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, Congress recognized that there are a variety of advantages to arbitration, and certainly we don't dispute that. 
    Arbitration is faster and is often less expensive than litigation, and may well be less acrimonious. 
    But Congress did not make arbitration preferred in the sense that it intended there would be outcome determinative differences between arbitration and appeals through the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
    It was quite explicit on that, providing that they were to be governed by the same standards and that... in fact, the legislative history said they should be applied identically. 
    So, I don't think arbitration was the preferred method in the sense that it intended every employee with a claim of procedural error to go to arbitration because he knew that he would win in arbitration and might not win before the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
    But that in fact is the only... the only category of employees who are benefitted by the Court of Appeals' ruling are those who have been demonstrated to be unfit for federal service who are challenging a procedural error that concededly did not effect the outcome of their case, and who chose to go through the negotiated grievance procedure. 
    And this result, for a variety of reasons, is clearly not what Congress intended when it enacted the Civil Service Reform Act. 
    I think the problem with the Court of Appeals decision is plain on the face of the statute. 
    In so many words, the Act places on the affected employee the burden of demonstrating that harmful procedural error was committed while the agency was arriving at its decision. 
    Given any straightforward reading, this appears to place on the employee the burden of demonstrating that the agency's result in the case might have been affected by the error, and that is the definition of the term given by the Merit Systems Protection Board, which is the agency that is given responsibility for interpreting the Act's standard of proof provisions, and it is the only interpretation that gives effect to the full Congressional purpose.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    No, if the employee opts not to go through the grievance procedure, the union has no recourse. 
    And if the employee... if the case goes to arbitration and the arbitrator issues a decision adverse to the employee's interest, it is only the employee who can then appeal to the Federal Circuit. 
    The union has no independent right to appeal on the employee's behalf. 
    So, the entire procedural structure of the adverse action proceeding is focused on the rights of the employee, not on the rights of the union.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Members of bargaining units, whether or not they are dues-paying union members, may invoke the negotiating procedure. 
    When Congress placed the harmful error rule in the statute to address these problems, it did so expressly to provide that a federal employee adverse action would not be overturned simply because of technical or procedural mistakes on the part of their employers. 
    And it did this with the express purpose of overcoming the widely held view that federal employees cannot be fired no matter how egregious or unacceptable their conduct, and it cannot be consistent with this intent to keep employees on the federal payroll after they have been demonstrated unfit simply because their employer committed a concededly non-prejudicial procedural mistake while attempting to fire them, but that is the effect of the Court of Appeals' ruling. 
    That is its primary effect. 
    Here, for example, the court reinstated in the Federal Protective Service two employees after the arbitrator, in his own words, found that their actions had rendered them unworthy of their employer's trust. 
    And the decision will lead to other results that Congress wished to avoid as well. 
    While the Civil Service Reform Act gives unions broad leeway to negotiate the procedural rights, it also insists that arbitrators and the Merit Systems Protection Board apply identical standards in judging adverse action challenges. 
    Congress placed that provision in the Act expressly to promote consistency between board and arbitral decisions, and to prevent forum shopping on the part of the aggrieved employees between those two decision-makers. 
    But it seems undeniable that the Court of Appeals decision will frustrate both of those purposes. 
    It guarantees that there will be inconsistent decisions because it establishes two entirely distinct harmful error rules, one to be applied by the board, one to be applied by arbitrators. 
    Had one of the employees in this case gone to the board, for example, he would have lost, while his identically situated co-worker was being returned to his job at the Federal Protective Service by the arbitrator's decision. 
    And this state of affairs in turn guarantees that forum shopping will occur. 
    The Act gives the aggrieved employee the right to choose between which two forums he will bring his challenge. 
    If employees realize that arbitrators are applying their own outcome-determinative, more generous standards in cases involving procedural error, every sensible bargaining unit employee who has a procedural claim will choose to go through the negotiated grievance route. 
    The result will be consistently more favorable treatment for the 60 percent of federal employees who are bargaining unit members than for the 40 percent who are not. 
    Not only is this result inequitable, but it distorts the procedural scheme that Congress envisioned. 
    The Act establishes a single uniform system for disposing of adverse action challenges which gives the bargaining unit employee the right to choose between two... what are supposed to be two roughly equivalent fora for bringing their appeals. 
    While Congress certainly recognized that a variety of factors would impel employees to choose one route rather than the other for their challenges, the Act's emphasis on consistency makes it plain that one of those factors should not be the existence of substantive rules that make one forum predictably more likely to grant relief than the other. 
    The Court of Appeals sidestepped all of these considerations by asserting that the union's role as the representative of the employee in an adverse action challenge means that it can assert its own institutional interests during the course of the employee's adverse action appeal. 
    But this reasoning is squarely inconsistent with the language and purposes of the harmful error rule and with the Act's emphasis on consistency between board and arbitral judgments. 
    As noted before, the emphasis of the adverse action procedures is squarely on the protected employee.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    In this case... in every case in which arbitration is invoked, the union represents the employee. 
    So the union did provide representation in this case. 
    A final point. 
    The Court of Appeals apparently believed that the collective bargaining process would be made meaningless if employees were not permitted to have adverse action overturned on account of non-prejudicial procedural violations. 
    Now, it is obvious that this concern was vastly overstated. 
    Under any interpretation of the harmful error rule, unions will be free to negotiate for whatever procedures they wish. 
    Under any interpretation of the rule, agencies are obligated to abide by those procedures.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    That's correct. 
    Any adverse action affected by a violation of rights contained in the collective bargaining agreement will be overturned either by the board or by an arbitrator. 
    As a result, it is only the least meaningful of procedural violations, those found by an arbitrator or the board to have had no effect on the outcome of the case, that will not be taken into account during an employee's adverse action challenge. 
    And the union may obtain a remedy even for these types of procedural mistakes by filing its own grievance or an unfair labor practice charge if appropriate. 
    In drafting the Act, Congress explicitly balanced all of these concerns and protected the interests of unions by giving them their own set of remedies, and by providing that agency decisions affected by violations of the collective bargaining agreement cannot stand. 
    It protected the rights of employees by giving them a variety of procedural options to challenge adverse action, and by providing that action taken against them in violation either of regulations or of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, so long as the action was affected by the violation, will be overturned. 
    And it explicitly protected the public's interest in a competent and efficient government by providing that inconsequential agency errors will not force the retention on the federal payroll of demonstrably unfit federal employees simply because the agency committed a procedural mistake while attempting to remove those employees from federal service. 
    If there are no further questions, Your Honor, I will reserve.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented this afternoon may be more simply stated than the government has done. 
    The question is, does the arbitral award violate the harmful error provision of the Reform Act. 
    It is not disputed that if the award is not inconsistent with the Reform Act, it should be upheld. 
    We contend that the Court of Appeals correctly decided that the extension of the harmful error rule to be applicable to important rights of the rest of the members of the collective bargaining unit, the collective rights, if you will, of employees represented by the union, is entirely consistent with law. 
    The government claims specifically that only error harmful to the rights of the individual grievant may be considered in the arbitral context. 
    This contention is based on an interpretation of the statute by the Merit Systems Protection Board.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    By the arbitrator, but, Your Honor, I would point out in the context of this particular case early in the arbitral decision the arbitrator makes reference to a previous arbitration award by another arbitrator involving the same parties, GSA and this local. 
    In that situation, which happened the previous year, again, the agency had not provided the grievant with the opportunity to be represented by the union. 
    So the arbitrator in this case, knowing that this violation had occurred just the previous year, would, I suggest, be reluctant just to issue a cease and desist order, because he knows the agency last year did exactly the same thing, and was put on notice by another arbitrator not to do it again, and yet they go ahead and do exactly the same thing.

 Well, suppose an employee is discharged for what... if he did what he did, anybody would say he shouldn't be working for this agency, and it goes to arbitration, and the arbitrator says, yes, you certainly shouldn't be working for this agency but you didn't have the benefit of your union at the initial sit-down, so we are going to put you back on the payroll.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    Our argument is, Your Honor, that the arbitrator is in the best position to devise a remedy for the situation. 
    In this case, these were police officers. 
    One of them... both of them were accused of tampering with agency records to cover up misconduct, and the arbitrator recognized that the employee who had access to agency records should not be returned to that position, specifically ordered that upon reinstatement this employee should not be returned to a position of trust such as he had occupied before. 
    The other employee, who was not directly involved in that kind of tampering with records, Mr. Rogers, who was just guilty, if you will, of picking up the beer and misusing a government vehicle for that purpose, there was no such limitation in his case because it was not appropriate in view of the facts.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    Well, the particular officer, Your Honor, to answer your question, was returned to a custodial position. 
    Now, of course, that involves a certain amount of trust, but it is not the same as being a police officer. 
    Our point is that in this award, the arbitrator did not violate the statute, he only violated an interpretation of the statute made by the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
    The board can never have the union before it as a party. 
    To answer the question, I believe, of Justice Brennan concerning whether in fact the union could represent the grievant before the MSPB, the Merit System Protection Board, the answer is, if they did so, it would be out of good will, if you will.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    Yes, I would agree.

    Procedurally, might they not have come out just where they came out?

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    --Procedurally they would have. 
    The difference, however, Your Honor, between the arbitral context and the Merit Systems Protection Board is important in analyzing that particular question. 
    The arbitrator is given a certain amount of discretion, if you will, in the arbitral system. 
    That discretion is reviewable by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which is charged by statute with, if you will, enforcing the overall symmetry of the system.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1826.379" stopTime="1833.524">

speaker="charles_a_hobbie" startTime="1833.524" stopTime="1921.912">
    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    We wouldn't be here today, Your Honor, if it had been a theft case, I am quite sure. 
    I believe if you look directly at the language of the award and note the circumstance of the unions participating in this procedure and asserting from the beginning that the violations of the collective bargaining agreement so tainted the evidence before the arbitrator that the union wasn't even going to put on any case, and they didn't. 
    They didn't even contest the misconduct. 
    The arbitrator, however, expressly declined to accept the union's invitation to apply some sort of exclusionary rule. 
    He said he would not agree with the union that this kind of technical procedural violation should result in the voiding of disciplinary action. 
    He specifically refused... he refused to void the discipline on the basis of minor, if you will, procedural irregularities, as the government has characterized them. 
    What he did do, though, was to mitigate the penalty. 
    He examined the discipline that had been imposed, and he said that under the circumstances, in view of the totality of the circumstances, including the incident of the previous year which is referred to in the award, where the agency had pervasively violated the agreement before, under those circumstances, mitigation of the penalty was appropriate.

    The procedural rights, Your Honor... that's correct, Your Honor, but the procedural rights nevertheless are very important in this scheme, particularly when one recalls that procedures are the only thing in the federal sector that unions may bargain over. 
    There are certain management rights that are reserved for management exclusively, and only the procedures by which management implements that authority are negotiable. 
    Wages in the federal sector are not negotiable. 
    They are set by statute. 
    Most conditions of work are set by statute. 
    Therefore, procedures are the only thing that is negotiable.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    --that there was no case, because the agency's infractions had so grievously tainted the evidence that had been obtained against the grievants that the matter could not be supported at all. 
    All of the evidence should be excluded, in other words. 
    That was the union's position, and the arbitrator did not accept that position. 
    He refused to void the action, and instead used the remedy of mitigating the penalties. 
    Returning to the question of what would be a proper remedy, I believe, that Justice O'Connor posed, it is possible to go to the Federal Labor Relations Authority and file an unfair labor practice charge. 
    In fact, in this case, that is exactly what the union did. 
    They filed a charge alleging that the agency had violated the contract. 
    The Federal Labor Relations Authority, which is charged with administering the labor relations statute, declined to issue a charge because it said the matter was more appropriately resolved through grievance proceedings. 
    Therefore, the union would be in the position of having to go back and file another grievance before a different arbitrator, involving a whole nother proceeding, additional costs for both the union and the agency, of course. 
    In other words, it would be a waste of the resources of the government and the union. 
    We would submit that in the facts of this case in particular, it is a much more economic use of resources to have one arbitrator address all of the issues that happen to be attached to a certain set of circumstances.

    Justice O'Connor, the Merit System Protection Board, however, would also have the right to mitigate a penalty based upon the consideration of all the relevant factors in the record. 
    The board has delineated those factors in a case, Douglas versus Veterans Administration. 
    They delineated factors that did not include, I will admit, violations of a collective bargaining agreement, but again, a union is not properly before the MSPB, and the board specifically stated there that these were not exclusive factors, that there could be others.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    The board could have done that under the... in my own opinion, Your Honor. 
    The board could have done that. 
    In fact, as I said, by judging, if you will, the appropriateness of a particular penalty, the board does that all of the time. 
    It says that a particular penalty is not appropriate, constitutes an abuse of discretion or an abuse of authority, based on many factors, and mitigates a penalty without using the harmful error rule. 
    It is important to realize here the nature of the differences between the arbitral context and the Merit Systems Protection Board, and how Congress specified in the statute arbitration and collective bargaining were to fit into the overall scheme. 
    Taking the latter first, in Title 7 of the Civil Service Reform Act, even the government does not dispute that collective bargaining is of primary importance, and that the intent of the statute was to promote collective bargaining. 
    In that scheme, arbitration was expressly the mechanism by which the procedures negotiated in collective bargaining were to be enforced. 
    This can easily be seen when you realize that in the previous scheme, under the executive order, Executive Order 11491, arbitration was not mandatory. 
    The Congress expressly departed from this past practice, if you will, by mandating arbitration in the new scheme. 
    They also departed from the scheme under the executive order by requiring or by permitting, I should say, that adverse actions could be aggrieved and arbitrated under the new scheme. 
    In the past, adverse actions had been excluded, had been excluded from the coverage of grievance procedures negotiated by the parties. 
    In view of the fact that the union is the one who selects an arbitrator, in fact, invokes, has the authority whether or not to invoke arbitration, and the union has the authority to negotiate the exclusion of adverse actions from the arbitral process, the union jointly with the agency selects the arbitrator, pays the arbitrator, pays the costs of the arbitration, in view of all of these circumstances expressed in the language of the Act, the Courts of Appeals have found that the union is an important party in the arbitral process, a party whose significant interests are to be protected. 
    The government implies in their argument that some kind of a per se rule is here involved, that any kind of violation of a collective bargaining agreement could cause an arbitrator to throw out this discipline that has been imposed. 
    In a later case, Devine versus Brisco, the Federal Circuit addressed this exact question, and held that there must be a demonstration by the union of prejudice to its rights, and the kind of demonstration that the Court was talking about in Brisco was exactly what occurred here, and they referred to this, the filing of an unfair labor practice charge indicating that the union in fact believed that its rights had been prejudiced to the degree that they are going to file a charge. 
    In the face of Brisco, I think that this argument of the government cannot really be given any credence. 
    Clearly, the Federal Circuit, which has been charged with the oversight of this whole arbitral process, has determined that contractual violations which are demonstrably harmful to the union have to be considered.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    That's correct, Your Honor, and that's a very important addition to what I said, because in fact we are talking about the integrity of the whole collective bargaining process here, and the only effective mechanism to really preserve the integrity of that process. 
    A very important question would be, what would be the effect of this Court's refusing to permit an arbitrator to so mitigate penalties. 
    We would submit that this would result in the subordination of arbitration and the statutory scheme to the point where it would virtually disappear as a mechanism. 
    The union, which again has the power to invoke arbitration, is hardly going to invoke it if it feels that arbitration is going to be a completely ineffectual remedy. 
    There would be no incentive for the union to expend its resources unless it believes that the arbitrator who has been selected by the parties is actually going to be able to effectuate a remedy that protects the union's interests.

    The union's interests are, after all, the collective interests of the employees it represents. 
    We are not talking about purely institutional interests like the collection of dues and things like this, obviously. 
    Here we are talking about prejudice to the rights of the... the collective rights, if you will, of the members of the bargaining unit, and this would include the grievants, of course.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    That is correct, Your Honor, but that interpretation of the statutory harmful error rule is the MSPB's interpretation, and we are saying that that interpretation does not necessarily relate to the arbitral process, because the union cannot be a party before the Merit System Protection Board. 
    Had they argued that before the board, the board might have adopted that position, but they could not have. 
    It would have been an impossibility. 
    So, what the government is alleging is merely that it is... the arbitration award is inconsistent with an interpretation of law. 
    The Federal Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have repeatedly held in three different cases that nothing in the Civil Service Reform Act requires that the standards be applied in exactly the same way. 
    We would admit, and it is plain in the language of the statute, that Congress intended the standards of proof and the burdens of proof, if you will, to be uniformly applied in both parallel appeals processes, arbitration and before the Merit System Protection Board. 
    But the fact that Congress has chosen to impose a certain symmetry on the appeals processes to discourage, as the government has said, forum shopping, and to promote consistency in adjudications, does not mean that in every application of the statute, of the standards of proof, that arbitrations must be exactly the same as the MSPB proceedings. 
    In Devine versus Sutermeister in the Federal Circuit, this question was expressly addressed by the Federal Circuit, which concurred in the prior holding of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    Yes, because... I will clarify that. 
    I don't disagree with the interpretation that the board has put on the harmful error rule with respect to the individual grievants. 
    That is not the question in this case. 
    I think the government would concede that with respect to the individual grievants here, the arbitrator correctly applied the harmful error rule. 
    He refused to touch the penalty imposed because of his finding that they were not prejudiced.

    Then the union is faced with the option of electing arbitration or not. 
    If it chooses not to elect arbitration, that is the end of the process. 
    The employee is foreclosed from going anywhere else. 
    He cannot then file an appeal to the Merit System Protection Board.

    No, the employees did notify the union, Your Honor. 
    That is not a problem in this case. 
    What is a problem is that the union was unaware at first of the investigation, and the employees were never afforded the opportunity to have the union present during the investigation and at the time they executed these admissions of guilt.

    Mr. Charles A. Hobbie 
    The arbitrator did not indicate that they knew of the right to have the union present. 
    He merely said that because they were police officers, in the execution of these all-important admissions of guilt, they were aware of their right not to do this. 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    My time has expired. 
    Thank you.

   Rebuttal of Charles A. Rothfeld
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="3229.416" stopTime="3287.797">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    A few quick points, Your Honor. 
    First, while it is true the Merit System Protection Board may mitigate an employee's penalty, it does so based on an analysis of the employee's situation to make the remedy fit the offense. 
    It does not in any event consider the harmless procedural error in deciding whether mitigation is appropriate. 
    There is no reason to believe that the board would ever take a union's institutional rights into account, because the board's own regulation defines harmful error as error that affects or might have affected the outcome of the case. 
    It follows from that we are not arguing that the arbitrator here abused his discretion, or that the arbitrator was wrong because he departed from the board's interpretation of the harmful error rule. 
    The arbitrator was incorrect because he departed from the statutory standard that Congress laid down to control in a parallel way both the decisions of the board and the decisions of arbitrators.

 Is that it? 
 He cannot go to the board at all.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    That is right, Justice Rehnquist. 
    Congress explicitly gave employees a choice, one or the other. 
    And to answer one of your questions, Chief Justice Burger, there is no indication in the opinion of the Court of Appeals or the arbitrator that the type of crime or violation committed by the employees should make any difference in the remedy that is provided, because it is not the employee's situation which is being considered by the arbitrator. 
    It is the violation of the union's institutional rights. 
    And in either case, no matter what the employee did, that violation presumably is the same. 
    I think two quick final points. 
    There certainly is no reason to believe that arbitration will be made meaningless in any sense if inconsequential procedural errors cannot lead to the overturning of adverse agency action. 
    Any important violation would be remedied in precisely the same way that it would be remedied before the board. 
    In fact, coming to any other conclusion would be entirely inconsistent with the Congressional emphasis on avoiding forum shopping. 
    It seems undeniable that forum shopping will occur if the arbitrators are permitted to take into account the violations that the board, by statute and by its regulations, cannot take into account. 
    Finally, one final point, it is true that there are a variety of management rights that are not negotiable with unions. 
    One of the things which the federal circuit has also found is not negotiable is the harmful error rule. 
    A union and an agency cannot agree to dispense with the harmful error rule because Congress believed it was so important that unfit federal employees not be retained on the federal work force because of inconsequential procedural mistakes. 
    If there are no further questions, Your Honor.
