United States v. Bagley

    The Court will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Bagley. 
    Mr. Strauss, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit awarded respondent a new trial on the ground that the government had not disclosed to respondent certain documents in its files that respondent claims he could have used to impeach two government witnesses. 
    The issue concerns the standard of materiality that should be applied in determining whether such evidence is significant enough to require a new trial. 
    The respondent in this case was indicated in 1977 on multiple counts of violating federal narcotics and firearms statutes. 
    Before trial, respondent served on the government eleven broadly worded discovery requests. 
    Among those requests was the one that has now become the focus of the case, a request for any deals, promises, or inducements made to prospective government witnesses in exchange for their testimony. 
    In response to all the various discovery requests, the government gave the defense a large number of documents. 
    Now, respondent elected to waive a jury trial, and he was tried by District Judge Vorhees of the Western District of Washington. 
    Among the witnesses against him were two state law enforcement officers named O'Connor and Mitchell, who had witnessed criminal transactions involving respondent while they were operating in an undercover capacity. 
    O'Connor and Mitchell were supervised during the investigation of respondent by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, ATF. 
    At trial, O'Connor and Mitchell testified primarily about the firearms charges. 
    Now, after the seven-day trial, Judge Vorhees found respondent not guilty on the firearms charges, but guilty on the narcotics charges. 
    Some years later, respondent filed a Freedom of Information Act request, and he uncovered two form ATF contracts that had been signed by O'Connor and Mitchell before the trial, but that were not among the materials delivered by the government to the defense. 
    Respondent then brought this action for collateral relief under 28 USC 2255, alleging that if he had known of these form contracts at the time of the trial he could have used them to impeach O'Connor and Mitchell. 
    Respondent's 2255 motion came before Judge Vorhees. 
    The prosecutor testified at a hearing that he had been unaware of the form contracts, which apparently were in ATF files, and that if he had been aware of them, he would have given them to respondent. 
    Judge Vorhees found that well after the trial O'Connor and Mitchell were each paid $300 by ATF, but that the ATF form contracts were blank when O'Connor and Mitchell signed them, that no AFT representative signed them until after the trial, and that no government agent at any time had promised O'Connor or Mitchell compensation for his services or his testimony or anything else.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Strauss, may I interrupt? 
    You refer to these as form contracts. 
    They do have some typed information in them that I gather is tailor-made for the particular... for Mr. Bagley. 
    Was that not true?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="237.052" stopTime="254.863">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    That is right, Justice Stevens. 
    There was a finding, however, that at the time they were signed by the witnesses, O'Connor and Mitchell, and in fact at the time of the trial the only thing typed into them was the unique identifier, a numerical code in the upper righthand corner.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="254.863" stopTime="256.429">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Not even the name Mitchell?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="256.429" stopTime="261.267">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    There was no finding about the name Mitchell. 
    I assume it was typed in at the time.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="261.267" stopTime="269.856">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The language that he will provide information regarding T1 and other violations committed by Hughes A. Bagley and so forth, that was typed in after the trial?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="269.856" stopTime="271.389">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    That is the finding.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="271.389" stopTime="275.177">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I see. 
    And it is based on... whose testimony was this?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="275.177" stopTime="279.979">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    I believe the testimony of the supervising ATF agent, named Prins.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="279.979" stopTime="285.033">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And I notice it is signed by three officers of ATF, and they all signed after the trial, too?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="285.033" stopTime="370.885">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Yes, that is right. 
    Judge Vorhees further found that O'Connor and Mitchell had at most a unilateral expectation that they might receive some compensation for their services, although not necessarily for their testimony. 
    Finally, Judge Vorhees ruled that since he himself had found respondent guilty, he was uniquely positioned to determine the impact that the ATF form contracts would have had on the trial, and he stated that he was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the form contracts would have made no difference to his verdict. 
    Now, as I said at the outset, the Court of Appeals reversed and ordered that respondent be granted a new trial. 
    This happened in 1983, six years after respondent was convicted. 
    The Court of Appeals did not explain at any point in its opinion why Judge Vorhees was mistaken in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that his own verdict would not have been affected by the form contracts. 
    Instead, the Court of Appeals stated, and I am reading the last sentence of its opinion, 
    "We hold that the government's failure to provide requested Brady information to the respondent so that he could effectively cross examine two important government witnesses requires an automatic reversal. "
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="370.885" stopTime="380.408">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Strauss, the government here doesn't challenge the application of the Brady doctrine to purely impeaching materials, I take it.
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="380.408" stopTime="388.095">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    We do not dispute that there are some circumstances in which the prosecution has an obligation to disclose purely impeaching material. 
    That is right, Justice Rehnquist.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="388.095" stopTime="390.847">
    Justice Rehnquist 
    And this case is one of them?

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    No, this case, we would submit, is not one of them.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Can you imagine any way this case could have gone the other way and for the Judge to say I was wrong?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="401.671" stopTime="410.593">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    You mean for Judge Vorhees to say? 
    Oh, I think very much so, Justice Marshall.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="410.593" stopTime="412.527">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I mean, I think it is a horrible burden to put on somebody.
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="412.527" stopTime="425.370">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Well, I can understand, Justice Marshall, where a judge might in fact have an overreaction the opposite way and be incensed that this material was not brought to his attention.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="425.370" stopTime="432.607">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    When you were told to explain why you did something six years ago, your subconscious tells you to defend it.
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="432.607" stopTime="438.428">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Well, I think that is certainly right, Justice Marshall, and there are decisions of this Court predicated on that, but Judge--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="438.428" stopTime="439.613">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    But was he--
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="439.613" stopTime="459.157">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    --I am sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Judge Vorhees found respondent guilty on the basis of a record which turned out according to respondent to be incomplete, and I think Judge Vorhees might very well have reacted the other way and said that if the government was going to conceal this information, he would teach it a lesson. 
    It is not obvious to me that the psychology cuts in favor of the government in these circumstances.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="459.157" stopTime="466.328">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    --When the case was tried before the court without a jury, was any of this information before the court?

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    These form contracts were not before the court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="469.097" stopTime="471.632">

    Yes, and that is the only issue in the case, isn't it?

    Well, Mr. Strauss, it is your position that the request of the defense counsel when requesting prior criminal records of witnesses to be called by the government and any deals, promises, or inducements made to the witnesses simply didn't cover the document that had been given to the witnesses to sign?

    We think that is right, Justice O'Connor, although that is not the argument we are primarily relying on. 
    The request was for deals, promises, or inducements made in return for the testimony. 
    That is different from whether the government would compensate these people for their services. 
    I think it is one thing to compensate a person for specifically giving certain testimony in court and another to say that because he has performed certain undercover services he will receive compensation.

    These were blank... the finding was, these were blank contracts with only the witnesses' signatures on it, that no promises of any kind were made to the witnesses, and that ultimately the witnesses were paid some money, well after the trial. 
    I think to suggest that the witnesses' credibility would have been substantially impaired at all by the fact that they signed one of these documents I think is incorrect.

    And the issue is how material this evidence must be in order to cause us to question the basic fairness of the trial. 
    Our submission is that it is not necessary to find that the evidence would not have affected the outcome beyond a reasonable doubt in order to conclude that the trial was fair, that a much lower threshold is appropriate. 
    The Court dealt with an issue quite similar to this, obviously, in United States against Agurs, where the Court specified a standard of materiality for cases in which the defense either does not request information from the government's files or makes a general request, and the Agurs standard is that the defendant must show that the undisclosed evidence raises a reasonable doubt about his guilt.

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    As I said, the Agurs standard applies in cases where there has been a general request, and this really follows from Justice Stevens's last question. 
    The request in this case was for deals, promises, or inducements. 
    And in our view, it is not appropriate to regard that as a specific request in the contemplation of Agurs. 
    If a prosecuting attorney receives a truly specific request, a request, for example, for the criminal record of the victim, or a request also from a defendant contemplating a defense of self-defense for any evidence in the government's possession that the victim committed acts of violence. 
    If a prosecuting attorney receives a request like that, we know with some clarity precisely what he is to do. 
    He is to go to his files and look for certain specific information, and he is to give instructions to the law enforcement officers working on the case that they are to come forward with certain specific documents or evidence if they have it. 
    It seems to us that when a prosecuting attorney receives a request like respondent's for deals, promises, or inducements, he is really in no better position than he would have been in if he had received no request at all. 
    He has a duty under Brady and Agurs.

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    If it please the Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the respondent's constitutional right to confront and cross examine his accusers was materially obstructed as a result of the government's failings in this case. 
    As a result, at issue here is whether the Court of Appeals correctly reasoned that the non-disclosure in this case resulted in constitutional error and whether it applied the appropriate standard in reaching that decision. 
    We obviously disagree with the petitioner's position that the Court of Appeals failed to consider the issue of materiality at all, and we take strenuous exception to its characterization of this sort of evidence that wasn't disclosed as non-constitutional, and its attempts to sort of trivialize its meaningfulness within the context of this case. 
    And I think in order to resolve the case and to really, truly determine what the character of that evidence was in relation to your decision, we have to look to the facts, because there are several facts, as you have already discussed in your questions of counsel for the petitioner, which are especially relevant to this case.

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    I have represented Mr. Bagley on prior occasions, but I was not counsel in this case. 
    The developments which occasioned this case occurred back in April and May of 1977, and during that time these two railroad employees were under the direct supervision of one single case agent in this case, a gentleman by the name of Mr. Norm Prins. 
    Between April 12th and May 4th of 1977, the two of them executed four separate affidavits each, a total of eight affidavits, detailing their contacts with Mr. Bagley within the context of their investigation, and at the end of each one of those affidavits, the boilerplate paragraph indicated by counsel stated that they had received no rewards or promises of rewards in return for the statement that they had just made. 
    On May 3rd, 1977, the day before each of these individuals signed in the presence of Mr. Prins, they executed the contract which is at issue here today, a contract which is labeled For the Purchase of Information and Payment of Lump Sum Therefore. 
    On May 3rd they executed that contract, indicating an expectation, an objective expectation of return for their investigative efforts. 
    On the following day, they executed again affidavits indicating that they had not. 
    Mr. Prins supervised and observed both of these signings one day apart. 
    Pretrial, as indicated, Mr. Lundine, who was representing Mr. Bagley, filed a comprehensive Brady... or a comprehensive discovery motion. 
    It is important to note that this pretrial request came in November of 1977, a year after the Agurs decision, which required some sort of specificity if we are going to have the complaint that we do here today. 
    Within that pretrial discovery request, Mr. Lundine requested, as indicated, any promises or expectation... promises or inducements made to witnesses in exchange for testimony, but that is not all, and we don't rely upon that solely. 
    As we indicated in our brief, the request was comprehensive. 
    It goes on. 
    If I could, and it is in the record, of course, Mr.... pursuant to Brady in a subsequent paragraph Mr. Lundine requested 
    "notice and copies of all material in possession of the government which is exculpatory, which may be favorable to the defendants or would assist in the preparation of the defense, including promises or representations of any kind made to government witnesses. " 
    And finally, he stated, 
    "I would also request any information which goes to the reliability of the two government witnesses in this case that are the subject of this inquiry as it relates to the search warrant. " 
    So, there were three separate recitals in that discovery motion requesting information about any sorts of inducements or representations or promises which may have been made to the witnesses in this case which may in effect taint their testimony. 
    In that same month, on November 30th, the government responded to that request and indicated in their discovery response that all statements made by these two witnesses had been turned over to the defense, including the affidavits which are at issue here. 
    It is interesting to note that in that response government counsel represented that these were the two principal government witnesses. 
    Missing, of course, was the contract to purchase and pay for information provided in return for their services. 
    We submit that Agent Prins, who failed to disclose that document, however, didn't forget about it. 
    Trial commenced in mid-December, from December 12th until December 23rd. 
    On December 21st, before the trial was even over, Agent Prins went to his supervisor with the contracts in question and requested payment to each of these individuals, $500, in return, as he stated in his documents, which are before the Court, for their investigative efforts and for their testimony at trial. 
    During trial Agent Prins did this, despite having turned over nothing with regard to those representations to counsel for the accused.

    Mr. Hillier, it seems to me another fact you have got to contend with since you are stressing the facts is that we are not here just judging the conduct of some particular government witness. 
    We have a habeas proceeding in which Judge Vorhees after this bench trial that you are just describing had all the information that was apparently withheld and said it just wouldn't have made any difference to him.

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II

    Judge Vorhees--

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Does it make any difference why he said it?

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    --Well, I believe it does, because it goes to the factual underpinnings for his decision, the facts which you must analyze now when you are independently reviewing the constitutional basis for his decision. 
    Judge Vorhees indicated that, I make this finding because the testimony of these agents as it regarded the drug counts was largely exculpatory. 
    That simply wasn't the case. 
    And in fact his verdict belies that. 
    In reality, and contrary to what government counsel has indicated, what happened here, these two witnesses were key not only in the proclamation of the entirety of the government's case, but they were the only witnesses produced by the government on the drug count. 
    They were key--

    Well, the government's testimony, of course, came first, and our argument here is that the defendant was denied the opportunity to prepare a defense which contemplated effectively cross examining these individuals in anticipation of discrediting them. 
    The reason they didn't do that, of course, was because the government failed to disclose information that they had a right to.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, no, that is going around in a circle. 
    I am asking you a very simple question. 
    I will start over. 
    If the only testimony before the court was the testimony that the defendant himself gave, would it support a guilty decision?
speaker="thomas_w_hillier_ii" startTime="2229.643" stopTime="2253.242">
    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    I think the simple answer to that is, I am not entirely certain. 
    If the exact drugs which were charged in the indictment were the ones which he testified to delivering, I think that you are correct, but of course the defendant ought not to be put in that position of having to... I think what the government is attempting to do is to put the cart before the horse here. 
    What we are trying to argue--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2253.242" stopTime="2255.360">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    He testified voluntarily, didn't he?

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    --Well, he did, but the strategy employed there was, there was a need to confront the credibility of these witnesses. 
    They had not any opportunity to do that pretrial or during trial, during cross examination because of the denial of the existence of promises made to these witnesses.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2272.505" stopTime="2287.848">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Are you suggesting that if they had... if the defense had been able to have this material so as to challenge the credibility of the two government witnesses, that then he might not have taken the stand and disclosed his guilt?
speaker="thomas_w_hillier_ii" startTime="2287.848" stopTime="2328.075">
    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    That is entirely possible, Your Honor, and again, what your teachings have been, this Court's teachings are that we cannot speculate as to what might have happened. 
    What we are required to do here is to look at the nature of the error, to analyze the character of the evidence to determine whether its non-disclosure may have impacted a constitutional right. 
    The constitutional right here is the right to cross examine on a material witness, a key witness, and that wasn't accomplished because the government in effect affirmatively said that there were no promises made to these people by handing over the affidavits which were presented, by Agent Prins's failure to disclose, and, we submit, willful withholding of those documents.

    And the judge said, despite these, I still find you guilty.
speaker="thomas_w_hillier_ii" startTime="2416.697" stopTime="2576.268">
    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    Then we would be arguing to the Court of Appeals that the court was in error in reaching the decision it did, and we would have a difficult time doing that, Your Honor. 
    But that isn't the issue here, and that is why Judge Vorhees's analysis was incorrect. 
    He did not perceive the constitutional significance of analyzing impeachment material pretrial to determine what strategy the case may take. 
    Judge Vorhees did not have the benefit of this Court's decisions in Strickland and Cronic, which came more recently outlining what effective counsel really is, and Justice O'Connor in her decision said, what we are looking to within the Sixth Amendment context is whether we can have justifiable reliance upon the outcome. 
    And what that means in Justice Stevens's opinion in Cronic was, a lawyer who is going to truly test the adversarial process of the trial court proceeding, and the way that you do that is through cross-examination, of course, and Justice Stevens then alluded to the Davis decision, which indicates that this type of information, the ability to cross-examine a government witness with impeaching information, is of the most important kind of information when analyzing that effective cross examination question, and that failure to disclose it or to provide it or to limit is constitutional error of the first magnitude, and that is what we are dealing with here. 
    We never got to the point where we could involve ourselves in that very necessary constitutional right to effective cross examination of these witnesses. 
    Entire trial strategies were affected, and as Justice O'Connor said in her opinion in Strickland, ineffectiveness, or the effectiveness of counsel includes the ability of counsel to make independent decisions about how to conduct a defense. 
    We had a jury waiver in this case. 
    We had no cross examination of the key government witnesses. 
    We don't know what would have happened, and Clancy and Goldberg and your other teachings suggest we should not speculate as to what might have happened, but rather we look at the character of the evidence which was withheld, determined whether it was in fact of such magnitude that it impacted the constitutional rights of the defendants, and if it does, then you are going to reverse under the harmless error doctrine. 
    And if there is government interference in that process, actual government obstruction, then it is presumptive error, and we submit, and the Court of Appeals found in this case that the government's failure to disclose and their affirmations that these witnesses had had no promises concerning rewards, it was tantamount to government interference with the ability of counsel to conduct his defense.

    But the effect of that language, of course, has to be dealt with, but what you look to in the decision is whether in fact the Court of Appeals analyzed the materiality, and of course the Court of Appeals in reaching its decision alluded to Brady, to Agurs, the standard set forth in Agurs, and to Davis, and the Court of Appeals then said, looking at Brady, the mandate of disclosure, and looking at Agurs, which says a failure will seldom, if ever, be excusable where there is a specific request, and this is a specific request case, and if it impacts a cross examination right, such as in Davis, then we are going to talk about reversal. 
    I think that the decision needs clarity, and that, of course, is the function of you at this point, is to add some clarity to the Court of Appeals' opinion.

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    That is not necessary, Your Honor. 
    I think what is necessary is to say that the language is improvident within the context of this decision, and that in looking at Giglio, there is a requirement of materiality in non-disclosure cases, but in this case there was materiality, so the result of the Court of Appeals was correct, but this does not mean that there is an automatic reversal rule that each case has to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, and that instruction should be sent forward to the Courts of Appeals. 
    To summarize, the constitutional basis for our argument is, the government here did fail to disclose information as mandated by Brady. 
    The failure was to a specific request, and under Agurs, those sorts of failures are seldom, if ever, excusable. 
    When looking at the character of the evidence, as urged in the Agurs decision, we find that it involved impeaching information of critical importance. 
    To answer your question, Justice Rehnquist, it is our opinion that Giglio did decide that impeaching information fell within the purview of Brady, that is, that it is favorable information, that is information that must be presented to the accused within the mandate of Brady. 
    And of course Davis, Napue, Giglio, and Brady all talked about the importance of impeaching information. 
    The character of that evidence is manifestly important to the accused. 
    We look to the counsel's effective assistance through cross examination as mandated by Davis, Strickland, and Cronic, and we find that there was no cross examination. 
    In fact, the trial court found that there was no cross examination in this case, and that is apparent. 
    We rely upon the statements of the government in this case. 
    And that brings us to the practicalities. 
    We are dealing in the federal criminal discovery process, and as indicated in Agurs, it is not perfect. 
    There is not full disclosure, and we are going to have problems like this from time to time. 
    Defense counsel in these situations is singularly reliant upon the forthrightness of the prosecutor in responding to government... or to discovery requests. 
    We have no capability to look into their file. 
    Here, where we ask for promises of reward or remuneration for any kinds of representations or inducements made to any witnesses, anything which might shed light on his reliability. 
    Then I agree that the prosecutor was charged with going to his agent and saying, hey, have you promised this guy anything? 
    Is there anything that we have got to let the defense counsel know which may impact the credibility of the witnesses in this case? 
    Well, the response to that in our case was to produce affidavits which clearly suggested to the contrary. 
    As a result, cross examination was limited effectively and materially, and the constitutional rights of this defendant, we submit, were impermissibly infringed.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I just ask one question, Mr. Hillier, there? 
    It is true, however, is it not, that the affidavits that were made available to you made it clear that these two men were cooperating with the government in an undercover capacity, even though they didn't know they got specific payment for it?
speaker="thomas_w_hillier_ii" startTime="2839.823" stopTime="2840.540">

    So there was some material that could have been used for cross examination purposes, even though they could not have made this particular--
speaker="thomas_w_hillier_ii" startTime="2846.144" stopTime="2858.368">
    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    There was the ability to cross examine the agents as to the factual basis for their conclusions. 
    There was no ability to cross examine as to their bias, their motive, their expectation of remuneration.

    --Why not?
speaker="thomas_w_hillier_ii" startTime="2858.718" stopTime="2866.206">
    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    Because there was an affirmative representation by the government that they had had no promises for payment.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2866.206" stopTime="2877.662">
    Justice White 
    Yes, but if there hadn't been those representations, you normally would have asked them... the trial counsel would normally have asked if they had been paid or if any promises had been made to them. 
    Is that right?

    If the government--

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    --I suspect you are correct, Chief Justice, but in this case we have had a representation from the government that nothing had been made. 
    It certainly is not a failing on counsel's part to not have asked that question, and if they had asked that question, we don't know what the answer would have been, and again, Goldberg and Clancy suggest that we don't speculate.

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    The adversary process does not require that an attorney ask every question if the question does not appear to be relevant or that a response will not be favorable to the accused. 
    If I ask somebody if he is being paid expecting that he is going to say no, then I am asking the wrong question, and I am hurting my client because I am reinforcing the credibility of that agent. 
    And even more so, in this case can you imagine the possibilities with the cross examination. 
    Here we have an affidavit executed on May 4 saying I'm not promising anything, and on May 3rd we have an affidavit, a contract for purchase of information. 
    Why, if that had been turned over, the possibilities for effective cross examination are immense, and it is particularly immense because there was no monetary amount--

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    --Well, the affidavits would have had to have been produced under Jencks, because they were statements of the accused, or of the witnesses, so the possibilities for cross examination, as I have indicated, are tremendous, and they are even more tremendous because there was no actual amount set forth, so we are dealing with a person who is testifying and hopes to get the most amount he can possibly get.

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    Well, because we are dealing with... Agurs simply states that when you deal with constitutional error, then you analyze it on the basis of whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3052.509" stopTime="3059.679">

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    Yes. 
    I agree with the Solicitor General that the analysis of that kind of error is a non-constitutional analysis. 
    It becomes constitutional error if the defendant is able to meet his burden of persuasion in that case of showing that notwithstanding the non-constitutional nature of the disclosure in this case, the failure to disclose, and it is non-constitutional because there is no specific request, or the prosecutor wasn't put in a position where he had to respond, or the prosecutor responded dishonestly, then the defense bears the burden of showing that it interrupted the fair trial process of that particular case. 
    Then it elevates to the constitutional... then it is constitutional error, but the analysis, the standard of review is different.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Hillier, even in Strickland, which involved a Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the standard applied was the Agurs standard of establishing a reasonable probability that but for the error, the result would have been different, and I wonder if that isn't the appropriate standard here if you are correct that there was an error.

    Mr. Thomas W. Hillier, II 
    No, Your Honor, it would not be, because Strickland was referring to the non-constitutional error aspect of the Agurs decision.

    There are other types of error which result from a non-constitutional basis, such as the failure to disclose in the Agurs situation, which then require a different standard of review from the court to determine whether--

   Rebuttal of David A. Strauss
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="3468.676" stopTime="3493.893">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    One or two brief points, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    We discussed the affidavits, which I think are a pure red herring in our redly brief, and I won't pursue them further. 
    We also mention in our reply brief that in addition to the testimony of the agents, there was a search of the defendant's residence that found some controlled substances. 
    I have two--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3493.893" stopTime="3512.522">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So the evidence supporting the drug charges other than the testimony of the two witnesses at issue here consisted of testimony of the defendant himself by way of some admissions, and physical evidence obtained in a search of his residence?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="3512.521" stopTime="3516.473">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    --That is right. 
    There was also that evidence in the case, Justice O'Connor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3516.473" stopTime="3521.793">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Weren't there two groups of drug charges, and weren't their testimony important on the ones he went to jail on?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="3521.793" stopTime="3638.418">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    I don't think it is clear which ones he went to jail on. 
    He received probation which was subsequently revoked on all counts. 
    I don't want to suggest that their testimony was unimportant on any of them. 
    But there was additional evidence. 
    It is a mistake to say that their testimony was the only evidence in the case. 
    I want to make one point about what has happened generally in this area since Agurs, and then one point about this case in particular. 
    In Agurs, the Court specified a standard that would apply to no request or general request cases, and the Court said that a request for all Brady material or all helpful material would be a general request. 
    But the Court left open the possibility that a specific request would be judged by a different standard. 
    Now, I think what the response to that has been, and this case is an excellent example of it, is that defense counsel have tried to take the general request for all Brady material and break it down into a dozen or so abstract categories, all deals, promises, and inducements, all information casting doubt on the reliability of the witnesses, all statements. 
    They have tried to rephrase the general request into requests that while not as all-encompassing, when taken together cover the waterfront, and as Mr. Hillier was arguing, that was essentially the way he presented his requests. 
    He said, we wanted to know everything they had. 
    We wanted to know if there was anything that would cast doubt on the testimony of these agents. 
    And he suggested that when the prosecutor received these discovery requests, he should have gone to the agents and said, is there anything we should let the defendant know? 
    That is our point exactly. 
    These were essentially general requests that left the prosecutor no better off than he would have been if he had just gotten a request for all Brady information or no request at all. 
    He would have had to go to the agents and say, is there anything we should let the defendant know?
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3638.418" stopTime="3645.358">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    If they perjured themselves in the trial, then Giglio and Napue--

    No, no, in these affidavits.

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    --I think that would probably not even be a Brady question. 
    I think that would be a more general fairness problem. 
    It would be as if the prosecutor lied to the defense counsel in a series of colloquies or in some other way took steps to mislead him. 
    It would present a fairness problem, but not one that really lends itself to Brady and Agurs.

    Would you approach it from the standpoint of a fair trial issue?

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Yes. 
    That's right.

    Justice White 
    You would, still would?

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Yes.

    Justice White 
    Not just some supervisory way of censoring the prosecutor?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="3800.636" stopTime="3812.826">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    It might be appropriate to censor the prosecutor as well. 
    I think there may be cases in which prosecutorial misleading of the defense would reach a level to call the fairness of the trial into question. 
    I see my time is up. 
    Thank you.
