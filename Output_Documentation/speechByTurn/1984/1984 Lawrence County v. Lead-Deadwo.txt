    Mr. Alan Raywid 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal challenges the validity of a state statute which would alter and redirect the distribution of federal funds payable to local units of government paid for the presence of non-taxable federal land which are located within the jurisdiction of these local units of government. 
    The federal statute known as Payment in Lieu of Taxes, or its acronym, PILT, is perhaps a new concept of awarding federal funds for the non-taxable lands by conferring upon local communities, local units of government, the discretion of how these funds may be best spent to offset the impact caused by the presence of federal lands within their particular communities. 
    It is the result of years of careful study as to how most effectively to offset this adverse impact of federal lands. 
    And it substitutes prior programs of designated use, such as designation for school districts or designation of roads, to allow the discretionary use by these governmental units and with the only caveat that they be for any governmental purpose. 
    The program is rather broad. 
    It goes to 49 states.

    Mr. Alan Raywid 
    I'm glad you called me on that, Justice Rehnquist, because no, I do not see that as a limitation at all. 
    And "caveat" is the wrong word. 
    "Any governmental purpose" is perhaps redundant. 
    I think the purpose that that was placed in the statute, to show that it could go for the whole panoply of government services that a local unit of government could make expenditures. 
    Of course it couldn't... no unit of government can make unauthorized or discriminatory payments.

    Mr. Alan Raywid 
    Perhaps the legislature could have declined altogether the federal aid. 
    This particular state statute, of course, is tiered upon and built upon the federal aid. 
    The federal aid precedes it by three years. 
    But in following your question, the state, of course, is sovereign. 
    The state created the counties, and conferred upon the counties particular authority. 
    It allows for elected officials; it allows for them to devise a budget; it allows them to make allocations between particular governmental responsibilities acting within that county. 
    Now, once having created such an entity under the state constitution of South Dakota, it cannot destroy that entity, except with popular vote. 
    But perhaps the state need not have created this county. 
    Having done so, and having conferred on it governmental powers, the state is obliged to respect those powers the same as anyone else.

    It's one thing to say that Congress has mandated these funds to the counties and notwithstanding the relationship between the counties and the state, the Congress wanted the counties to have the final authority to say that. 
    That is certainly an understandable argument based on federal law. 
    But I understood you to make an argument that federal law also somehow requires South Dakota, the legislature to observe the county status because there are provisions in the South Dakota statute... the South Dakota constitution that require it.

speaker="alan_raywid" startTime="455.192" stopTime="535.691">
    Mr. Alan Raywid 
    --Well, I think that what the federal statute attempted to do was to confer authority, discretionary authority for the expenditure of funds on the local unit of government. 
    It then, of course, looked to the state government as to what units of local government had been created. 
    In South Dakota, there is no question but that the State of South Dakota had created counties and conferred upon them general governmental authority. 
    Also, the statute, the federal statute, the PILT statute, distinguished between specific purpose districts, such as school districts or water districts or fire districts that did not have general governmental authority, even though they may not have been placed with authority by the state, and even though they might be governed by elected officials. 
    But, yes, the federal statute does look to the state to say which governmental unit has the local authority and which governmental unit has general governmental authority.

    Mr. Alan Raywid 
    No, Justice O'Connor. 
    I believe very definitely it could not. 
    If it wished to accept the federal aid... it would have to accept the federal aid subject to the conditions imposed by Congress. 
    It is obliged to carry out the purpose and intent of Congress; that is the fundamental precept of the supremacy clause. 
    And this Court has held again and again, in both majority and dissenting opinions, that the purpose and intent of Congress, of course acting within its constitutional authority, is paramount and that the state may not interfere with that purpose and intent. 
    And the fundamental purpose and intent of this act, both by its language and certainly by its legislative history, is to confer upon the counties, to confer upon the unit of local government that allocate funds for a variety of purposes, to decide how that government land has impacted by its presence, and to decide how those funds may best be used.

    Mr. Alan Raywid 
    --No, Justice Stevens. 
    I believe that is not true. 
    As I understand the process, each of the various recipients, respective recipients of funds, submit to the county their budgets for the year. 
    The county then has some discretion as to what budgets it will accept or whether those budgets have to be altered and adjusted. 
    Then it goes out and raised the money, and then it makes the distribution.

    No, Your Honor.

    It has a provision in its operating mandate that it cannot spend more than it takes in. 
    It takes... it receives budgets, as I was explaining previously. 
    It receives budgets. 
    It then allocates what it feels appropriate for each particular governmental service.

    It could. 
    It could mandate that. 
    Then it would be up to the Federal Government to decide at that juncture whether this was a general governmental unit with power to exercise such discretion. 
    But clearly, in accommodating, it seems to me, the state statute with the federal statute, which was to give discretion... and it specifically states in its legislative history and in its implementing regulations that this is not to go to special districts or not for special units of service such as school districts, and it is not to go to states.

speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1289.716" stopTime="1362.672">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, perhaps I could most usefully begin by descending to particulars. 
    This statute, that is, the federal statute, very pointedly directs that the payments be made made to the local government units, the general government units of the locality and not to the state. 
    It would have been much simpler for the federal payment to be made to the state and to leave the state free to make the distribution as it saw fit. 
    Congress chose to do otherwise, and the legislative history tells us why. 
    There had been an experience of making payments to the state with a view to the state's redistributing the funds to the affected locality, and all too often the state had failed to redistribute in the way Congress had expected. 
    Accordingly, on this occasion, Congress very clearly said we distrust the state. 
    We will pay directly to the affected county. 
    It is our intention that they be reimbursed for the burdens our land management imposes on them, and that the money remain there.

    --Yes. 
    But had that land been taxed, had it been sold to individual, had it been subject to taxation, presumably families would have lived on it and the school burden would have been increased accordingly. 
    Therefore, it would have been appropriate to increase the allocation to the school district. 
    Here, it is wholly inappropriate to allocate 60 percent of these federal funds which do not merely stand in lieu of the taxes, but which were intended to compensate for quite different burdens which federal ownership of the land imposes, as distinguished from private ownership of that same land. 
    Now, the point of having the payments go to the county and not to the state is importantly injured, if not destroyed, when the state is free to seize those monies as soon as they reach the country treasury, and redistribute them as it sees fit. 
    We might as well have given the money directly to the state.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    One aspect: If the state had power to allocate the money, it is difficult to see why that power was limited geographically. 
    If you read the statute as requiring the payment to the county so that the county will have discretion as to how to spend it, that is one thing. 
    If we say that state law can supplant the county's discretion, then why is the state law limited to redistribution within a geographic area? 
    Nothing in the statute would lead us to that intermediate conclusion. 
    Either the state is ousted, as the dissenting justices of North Dakota Supreme Court put it, but Congress was very clear that their noses were not to be intruded into this arrangement involving only supplemental federal funds as between the federal and local governments.

    Justice Rehnquist quoted the provision of the federal statute which says the unit of local government may use the payment for any governmental purpose. 
    Now that, too, was no accident. 
    Previous federal statutes had earmarked the funds. 
    Congress decided this time we will not do that.

    Indeed, Your Honor. 
    But it would be strange for Congress to have withheld its hand, contrary to prior practice, with a few to accommodating the flexibility that is needed from place to place, from time to time, depending on the kind of ownership, only to permit the state's heavy hand to come down with a uniform rule that destroys that flexibility which Congress was anxious to create and preserve.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Let me try and hypothetically... it may clear it up for me; it may not. 
    Suppose, instead of the Federal Government making this grant, it was the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation said we're going to give you six million dollars a year for these purposes. 
    There's no federal supremacy issue there. 
    But wouldn't that condition be enforceable?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1634.673" stopTime="1641.373">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    If that condition had been announced in advance and the state had accepted--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1641.373" stopTime="1644.480">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, aren't you suggesting that there's a condition announced in this statute?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1644.480" stopTime="1807.495">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    --Indeed. 
    And Your Honor's analogy seems to me sound; that is, that if the money is accepted on those conditions, those conditions are enforceable no matter who the grantor may be. 
    Now, finally, as an indication that this state statute does offend the federal purpose, one looks to Section 3 of the Act. 
    This case concerns Section 1 which involves the bulk of the funds, but Section 3 is a special provision which says in the event a national park or a wilderness is created out of land which was taxed just before and which is now removed from the tax roles, for five years there shall be a payment which will substitute for the taxes which have been lost. 
    And there, Congress directs that the allocation be as the taxes were the previous year, partly to the school district and so forth. 
    Now, what South Dakota has done is said we will impose the Section 3 formula on Section 1 funds, thereby destroying the whole point of Congress's making the difference. 
    Now, that is a plain indication of how hostile these two provisions are. 
    Now, one might wonder why the Federal Government cares, whether we're not simply intruding ourselves in a family argument between a county and a school board. 
    The government cares, first, because Congress had in mind benefitting a locality and not whatever agency of government the state might choose to benefit. 
    The least populous counties probably have the least voice in the state legislature and therefore they are not likely to failure. 
    The government was concerned that those who suffered the burden from our presence be the ones who benefitted from our funds. 
    The government also, since these funds were meant to recompense for burdens imposed by us, felt some degree of duty to see to it that the funds were available and used for providing the services that our lands required. 
    And, duty aside, our self-interest was that the counties have the funds available and that they not be deflected to the school board or elsewhere, but that they be available to furnish the services to our lands which otherwise we would have to contract and pay for elsewhere.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    It is so. 
    And Congress had to choose whether flexibility or trust with respect to the county was most appropriate. 
    Congress took it that the county could be trusted in its special relationship with the federal managers to expend at least a measurable portion of those funds on providing the services to the federal lands. 
    And let me say in the day-to-day management of the federal lands, there is a relationship between the federal managers and the county officials. 
    That relationship is indispensable to the success of the federal land program. 
    It is one which is measurably aided by the presence of federal funds to compensate for the burdens the government imposes, but it is only useful if the county is assured that those funds are not deflected or confiscated or otherwise directed by the state to be used elsewhere.

    Mr. A. P. Fuller 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case doesn't deal with a whole lot of things. 
    It doesn't deal with a sovereignty; we're dealing with a county government. 
    We are not dealing with where the "in lieu of" money is to be paid. 
    The money is paid to Lawrence County, and that's where it should be paid. 
    We're not asking the Secretary of Interior to make "in lieu of" payments to the school district. 
    We are not asking that these payments be used for anything but governmental purposes. 
    We're not dealing with the Secretary of Interior putting restrictions on the use of this money from the federal level. 
    That's not in here. 
    We're not dealing with any other statute because the State of South Dakota is the only state that has a statute like this. 
    The Arkansas statute dealt with all school monies in the Denning case; all school monies that come to the state shall be distributed to the schools. 
    Well, in the Denning case, it specifically pointed out in the decision that, assuming arguendo, that the monies are for school. 
    We are not even claiming that they're school monies. 
    We are not dealing with a statute nor a regulation which prohibits the county from distributing these monies to the school districts. 
    What we are dealing with is a statute that gives the counties, as well as many state statutes under Title VII of the South Dakota Code, direction and guidance and powers and responsibilities.

    --There are other governmental entities that the county distributes money to, like water conservance of the subdistricts, or water districts, conservance of subdistricts, fire districts, and other governmental entities that gather the money. 
    But as to the reason that the legislature passed this, I think you must recall, in the section, the section deals with "in lieu of" monies. 
    In other words, the state also pays in lieu of tax monies. 
    And the amendment added the word "federal". 
    So that all federal and state "in lieu of" monies would be distributed by the auditor as all tax revenues were then distributed, which is the counties--

    It does... the school district is not saying that the county is to use the money for school purposes or fire protection purposes or police protection or road building. 
    It's any purpose, any purpose that to the county seems fit and appropriate is the way they, under Title VII of our code, can handle the money. 
    I have to agree, though. 
    The practical effect is that the monies do... some of the monies, not necessarily 60 percent... it's whatever the budgetary amount of money that a school district needs for the next year.

    --That's what I was going to say. 
    But thank you. 
    You see, the county can give that windfall, if you want to call it a windfall, to the school district now; but let's say the statute's not there, they could. 
    The statute is there; they get a proportion share of that. 
    The county can get the windfall. 
    You know, there are many governmental services, any governmental service, many things that would then receive this governmental windfall. 
    It also, when the money goes to the school district, it's in lieu of real estate taxes, and real estate taxes are where the revenues are generated to support the school districts, support the counties, support the municipalities, and all these other local governmental entities.

    Mr. A. P. Fuller 
    Right. 
    But Congress did not have to pass that act because the county or the school district cannot tax those federal lands.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2263.075" stopTime="2282.709">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Another thing: Doesn't the legislative history suggest at least that Congress was somewhat concerned about what states did sometimes with these kinds of grants, in lieu of taxes and other types of grants, and they wanted to vest the control entirely in the county. 
    Isn't that what Congress said?
speaker="a_p_fuller" startTime="2282.709" stopTime="2310.072">
    Mr. A. P. Fuller 
    Congress was concerned about all the things you mention. 
    And that's why they gave the money to the county government, okay? 
    The county is merely distributing, as the statute says, as they distribute other tax money. 
    Now, it seems to me that if the distribution of other tax money is fair, reasonable, and equitable under situations of budgets and other matters, that this money is also being distributed in the same manner.

    --Correct. 
    And no one knows whether the people in the county... you see, not... I would say that the county will receive... they won't lose anything either. 
    They won't lose anything and the school district won't lose anything, except for... there's political considerations here. 
    And they're serious at our local level, and that is who's taxing us? 
    Is it the county taxing us or is it the school district taxing us? 
    And that has political significance at the local level. 
    So yes, it is important for all... for distribution of this money to be equitably distributed as the county does it now, so that it's spread; it's spread the same as all other tax dollars, and there's no harm to anyone.

    Mr. A. P. Fuller 
    That's correct. 
    The county is governed by the constitution of the State of South Dakota. 
    They are not a sovereignty unto themselves. 
    Article IX of our constitution creates counties... excuse me, it does not create counties, it allows the legislature to create counties. 
    And the legislature has created Lawrence County and 60-some odd other counties in South Dakota. 
    They are creatures of state government, and under Title VII of our statutes, they have been given the powers that our legislature has allowed them to have. 
    And this is a statute similar to all other statutes. 
    It gives counties guidance, instruction as to what they should do, and that's all the statute does. 
    It just seems that if counties, in their process, distribute monies in a fair, reasonable, and prudent way on an annual basis, that a statute that directs them to continue that proposition with federal in lieu of tax monies is not in conflict with the federal statute that is presently before this Court.

    Mr. A. P. Fuller 
    The county... well, the state is not telling them how to spend the money. 
    The county decides that at the local level. 
    They are just saying do it the way you do it.

    Mr. A. P. Fuller 
    You're talking about... yes, it tells them about vouchering and bonding and bonds of indebtedness and all that. 
    Sure, there are constraints. 
    But these are expenditures. 
    These are tax monies in and these are disbursements out, Your Honor. 
    And counties have pretty much general latitude as long as they're paying the bills that are authorized by law. 
    The restrictions aren't that great.

    Mr. Alan Raywid 
    This is the only statute in the country that seems... or the only state in the country that seems it is necessary to make some reallocation. 
    Mr. Justice White asked whether this will be a windfall for the taxpayers of that county. 
    That certainly was not the purpose. 
    The purpose in granting discretion for the presence of these lands was that the benefits would redound to the landholder, the United States of America. 
    And the funds are those from the taxpayers of the United States of America. 
    No other state has felt it necessary to take away this local discretion. 
    Arkansas attempted, in a somewhat different manner, and Arkansas failed. 
    So there is no necessity to instruct the county. 
    And this Court, in an unbroken line of decision since Chief Justice Marshall, has held that the purpose and intent of intent of Congress in trying to accommodate both state and federal statutes, must look to the intent and purpose of Congress. 
    There is no doubt in this question that Congress is acting in a field in which it has authority. 
    This is land management, given to it by the Constitution, and it also involves the spending power of Congress under what conditions Congress would impose. 
    Certainly, the legislative history and, we would submit, the Act itself says that its main purpose and intent is to confer upon counties discretion. 
    The South Dakota statute... and indeed if it is upheld, other states would follow... removes that discretion, supplants the local community where the lands are located--
