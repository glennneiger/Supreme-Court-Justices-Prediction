    Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Petitioner this morning argues that the jurisdictional exception noted by this Court in its 1912 decision, Diaz. 
    v. United States, has been implicitly or by implication rejected in the subsequent decisions of the Court in Waller v. Florida and Robinson v. Neil. 
    The Petitioner was involved in an automobile accident in August 1981 in southern New Mexico and, as a result of that accident, two things happened. 
    He was charged with violation of municipal ordinances for driving while intoxicated and for careless driving, and another party of that accident was injured. 
    The Petitioner went to court in Carlsbad, New Mexico, pleaded no contest to the charges, was convicted upon his plea, and was sentenced. 
    That sentence included confinement in an alcohol rehabilitation unit for a period of 21 days, followed by a six-month period of probation, which included mandatory weekly alcohol counseling sessions. 
    In September of 1981, the party who had been injured in that accident died, apparently as a result of those injuries, and the State commenced a felony prosecution for vehicular homicide. 
    The Defendant was tried and convicted. 
    His first conviction was set aside by the New Mexico Court of Appeals on an unrelated ground, and on remand his newly-retained defense counsel filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that based upon double jeopardy principles, the prior convictions for lesser included offenses in the Carlsbad Municipal Court barred a subsequent State prosecution for the greater offense of vehicular homicide.

    What did the second constitution have to establish that was not necessary to be shown in the first?
speaker="j_thomas_sullivan" startTime="190.705" stopTime="269.974">
    Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan 
    The State was required to prove either that as a result of unlawful operation of a vehicular and resulting accident, that a person had either been injured and sustained great bodily injury, or had died as a result of that accident. 
    The State was required further, in order to establish the felony offense, that the accused was either operating the vehicular while driving while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, or that he was operating the vehicular recklessly. 
    After his second conviction, the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed, applying double jeopardy law, principles enunciated in decisions in this Court, to hold that the prior convictions in municipal court for lesser included offenses barred the subsequent vehicular homicide prosecution. 
    In so doing, the Court of Appeals made four distinct important findings. 
    First, it rejected the argument advanced by the State that the necessary or essential facts exception of Diaz v. United States applied, to hold that the State was justified in waiting to commence its vehicular homicide prosecution until after that injured person had died. 
    The Court of Appeals looked to the wording of the New Mexico statute which permits the State to commence a felony prosecution.

    Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan 
    I believe it's necessary to understand the Court of Appeals' reasoning to understand why we believe that we're entitled to the bar of double jeopardy when the decisions of this Court were applied. 
    The necessary and essential facts exception of Diaz were rejected by the Court of Appeals because the State could have prosecuted because the injury, causing great bodily injury to the victim of that accident was available, was known to the State at the time the traffic offenses were prosecuted. 
    Second, the Court of Appeals held that the reckless driving and careless driving offenses are greater and lesser included offenses for double jeopardy purposes. 
    That's been conceded by the State throughout the litigation. 
    Third, the Court of Appeals held essentially that DWI and reckless driving are lesser included offenses under every case of the felony offense of vehicular homicide. 
    They are included because the vehicular homicide statute defines the offense in terms of a prior commission of one of three modes of driving unlawfully: driving while intoxicated, driving while under the influence of drugs, or driving recklessly. 
    What the Court of Appeals finally rejected was the State's argument that the jurisdictional exception which was noted by this Court in Diaz would apply as an exception to the double jeopardy bar. 
    As I understand it, the jurisdictional exception applies where a court does not have jurisdiction over an offense and therefore could not have adjudicated an offense. 
    And the New Mexico Court of Appeals held that by implication, Waller. 
    v. Florida, Robinson v. Neil, had overruled the applicability of the jurisdictional exception when you're looking at municipal court convictions for lesser included offenses of a felony prosecution which is later commenced in a court of general jurisdiction in the State. 
    This morning, I believe we are focusing on the Supreme Court decision, the decision of the Supreme Court of New Mexico, which held that Diaz v. United States is still applicable with respect to the jurisdictional exception. 
    The Court essentially held that because the Carlsbad Muncipal Court had no jurisdiction over the felony offense of vehicular homicide its judgments on the lesser included traffic offenses could not serve to bar prosecution for that felony offense in the State District Court, which is a court of general jurisdiction in New Mexico. 
    The State has argued in its brief to this Court an alternative theory which it suggests would have supported the judgment of the New Mexico Supreme Court, arguing a different lesser included offense analysis than was ever argued in the New Mexico courts. 
    And we would argue, for purposes of our petition and for purposes of decision of this Court, that the real issue to be focused upon is whether or not the jurisdictional exception of Diaz remains valid in light of Waller v. Florida and Robinson v. Neil. 
    In fact, in those cases, strikingly similar facts to those presented in the instant case resulted in reversals of subsequently obtained convictions--

    Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan 
    Not with regard to questions that focus on a preliminary municipal court conviction, followed by prosecution in a court of general jurisdiction of the State. 
    I think there is an argument to be made that the jurisdictional exception is really what you have in successive State and Federal prosecutions because neither court would have jurisdiction over the other's offenses, but not with regard to municipal State prosecutions because the jurisdictional exception in those cases hinges upon the notion of dual sovereignty which was what was expressly rejected by the court in Waller, and then applied retroactively in Robinson v. Neil. 
    In other words, without a concept of dual sovereignty backing the jurisdictional exception, you don't have another theory upon which the jurisdiction of the municipal court is limited such that it cannot... all charges could not be brought in a single prosecution.

    Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan 
    --That would be true, Your Honor, if in fact the felony statute required proof of the death. 
    It does not in New Mexico require proof of the death. 
    It requires either proof of death or proof of a great bodily injury. 
    And the Court of Appeals was very explicit in holding that the evidence available to the State at the time that the initial charges were filed would have supported a finding of great bodily injury. 
    There is no distinction in punishment between vehicular homicide predicated on death or great bodily injury, and therefore the State was compelled to bring all of its charges in one prosecution and at the same time.

    Does double jeopardy involve itself in punishment aspects of the case?
speaker="j_thomas_sullivan" startTime="666.649" stopTime="716.746">
    Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan 
    I think it is involved in the sense that we have successive or multiple punishments imposed in this case, Your Honor. 
    The Defendant served part of his sentence initially imposed, and after the conviction in State court, another sentence, the term of imprisonment was imposed. 
    I believe that's multiple punishments for the same offense. 
    For our purposes and I think, as I understand the rulings of this Court, the lesser included offenses, the traffic offenses, were clearly lesser included under New Mexico law and under the decisions of this Court, and thus prior conviction on those charges would have barred both a second trial, a second conviction, or the infliction of a great punishment, assuming as we must in New Mexico, because of the statutory language, the State had no reason not to bring the felony charge at the same time it charged and prosecuted the Defendant for--

    Yes, Your Honor, I believe they could. 
    The State law also defines DWI and reckless driving. 
    The New Mexico Supreme Court has expressly held in Manzanares that the District Court in New Mexico is accorded general jurisdiction, and in fact the Joinder Rule, Rule 10 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the District Courts, expressly directs that in a prosecution the State should bring all the felonies and misdemeanors which arise from the same transaction or occurrence. 
    In this case there was really no reason why the State should not have commenced its felony prosecution at the same time that the Defendant was tried on the lesser included offenses of DWI and reckless driving.

    No, it had no jurisdiction to try the felony, Your Honor. 
    Just as in Waller and Robinson v. Neil, as I understand those decisions, the Defendant in each case was tried on municipal ordinances, violations of municipal ordinances in the municipal court. 
    Those were deemed to have been the same offense, and if they were the same offense, in fact and in law, then the prior conviction on the lesser included offenses which were violations of ordinances would bar the subsequent State prosecution in a court of general jurisdiction.

    Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan 
    --Well, Your Honor, the essential fact is that parallel facts are presented in that case and in this case. 
    Whether Waller expressly or implicitly overruled Diaz, there is no question that looking at the pattern of double jeopardy decisions of this Court, including Illinois v. Vitale, conviction on lesser included offenses in a court of limited jurisdiction... and I believe that's also the situation in Brown v. Ohio... serves to bar a subsequent conviction for a greater offense in a court of general jurisdiction. 
    Whether or not the New Mexico Supreme Court was correct in saying there's still something called the jurisdictional exception... and there may be, and I would concede that... I don't think it can withstand the application of the principles of Illinois v. Vitale or Brown v. Ohio in this particular case, because here--

    Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan 
    Well, we do ask you to do so, Your Honor, and we would point out that Diaz has been virtually unfollowed for the proposition, except in New Mexico, that there is a jurisdictional exception which somehow allows a State to avoid the double jeopardy bar in cases exactly like this. 
    The history of New Mexico decisions is that the jurisdictional exception is well-recognized in New Mexico to say that a conviction on a lesser included offense in a court of limited jurisdiction does not bar a subsequent prosecution of the greater offense. 
    And I believe that there are numerous cases cited in both briefs in which the New Mexico Supreme Court has held exactly that position. 
    It's not a question of whether or not, in this isolated case, these facts gave rise to that. 
    But that's a position that's been generally held by the New Mexico Supreme Court. 
    The parallel situation is that the Carlsbad municipal ordinance is virtually identical to the State state defining the same offense. 
    The State had jurisdiction over the offense of DWI or over the offense of reckless driving. 
    There is no question that this is not a case where one court had jurisdiction over some type of conduct that--

    Mr. Paul G. Bardacke 
    It would not have to proceed. 
    What the fact is is that the municipal charges could have been dropped, and the State could have proceeded on State charges which are similar. 
    But the fact is in this case, is that we are dealing with different offenses. 
    These are not the same offenses. 
    I quarrel with only one fact mentioned by Petitoner's counsel, and that is that the Court of Appeals ruled that reckless driving and DWI were necessarily lesser included offenses of vehicular homicide. 
    The Court of Appeals did no such thing, nor did the Supreme Court reach that issue.

    --No, they did not. 
    The Court of Appeals treated reckless and careless driving as the same offense and lesser included in vehicular homicide but the Court of Appeals did not treat DWI and reckless as lesser included of vehicular homicide. 
    And if it had, it would have been in violation of the controlling law of the State. 
    There are clearly two cases cited in the brief, where the Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico ruled that DWI and reckless were not lesser included offenses of vehicular homicide and those are State. 
    Trujillo and State v. Tanton.

    We should look at the statutory analysis. 
    And clearly in Blockburger, it says whether each provision requires proof of a fact that the other does not. 
    And in this case, vehicular homicide can be proven without ever proving reckless driving or DWI. 
    And it is likewise clear that in this case you can prove reckless driving and prove DWI, and you haven't proved the death that is required.

    Well, I don't think you need to reach an exception if you're dealing with the same offenses. 
    But if this Court were to determine that they were the same offenses, which I think would be contrary to New Mexico law, then I would argue that in fact the Diaz exception is still alive and well in New Mexico.

    Mr. Paul G. Bardacke 
    Well, I don't believe that the State law can really be in dispute with respect to the lesser included offense issue. 
    However, just as in the case argued before this, it is often times... and that's what Dandridge and New York Telephone are often about... that a Respondent comes to this Court and asks you to affirm a judgment of the lower court, based on a different ground, and I think it is, on further reflection, a much more persuasive ground, and the Court need not get to the exception. 
    The exception is easier analysis, but should this Court determine that there is question about whether they are the same offense or not, then remand might be appropriate. 
    I don't think that question exists.

    As Petitioner's counsel pointed out, he was charged under an open charge, Justice Stevens, of vehicular homicide which amounts to the unlaw operation of a vehicle. 
    And unlawful operation of a vehicle in State v. Barela in our case can be failure to stop, speeding, crossing the double line, two of which, by the way, were present in the Fugate case. 
    At the testimony in the trial and part of the record in this case, he was speeding and he ran a stop sign. 
    Both of those could give rise to vehicular homicide the exact same statute with which he was charged in this case.

    It depends under the facts of reckless driving. 
    He would have been charged... if it showed intent and willful and wantonness, the failure to stop and the speeding could amount to recklessness, but not in all cases. 
    I think that if this Court were, however, convinced that it's either the jurisdictional exception or nothing, I think it's clear that the Waller case is a very, very narrow holding. 
    It merely held that the Florida court was in error for trying the same Defendant for the identical charge in two cases. 
    We're not dealing with the identical charge in this case.

    I think that what is clear in this case also is that the original circumstances which powered the rule of double jeopardy do not exist in this case. 
    I mean double jeopardy is founded in... has its roots in the harshness of penalties in the British system. 
    And I think it was intended to come to a point where mere traffic citations in a complex society could raise to a constitutional level.

    We have a two-tier system there where people routinely are supposed to go in and clear themselves of traffic citations. 
    That's what traffic citations are about. 
    We have a different societal purpose in dealing with traffic citations, prosecuting people for them, as many as we have resources for, processing them quickly, and getting these people off the street. 
    That is different than vehicular homicide where society and our legislature, in defining a separate statutory--

    --Well, it depends what the legislature intends. 
    And I think in this case they clearly describe two separate penalties, two separate crimes, and that is what is within the legislature's domain in this case. 
    And I think that if this case were reversed, there would be horrible consequences for both society and drivers like Mr. Fugate, because if this case were reversed, it would require the police officer in the field to charge the maximum consequences of the act of a driver. 
    If there were a minor injury, that police officer in one of the 98 municipalities of New Mexico that is often far away from any court of general jurisdiction, far away from any district attorney, would be out there and say, well, this may be vehicular homicide or great bodily harm, even though it's a minor injury. 
    And if you have to charge like that to avoid the consequences of perhaps a constitutional claim of double jeopardy, then what you have is, you have lots of people being overcharged. 
    You are requiring them to stay in jail longer, to have higher bail set. 
    You require the process to be clouded, while later on, a district attorney has to separate the wheat from the chaff, the meritorious case from the meritless case.

    Mr. Paul G. Bardacke 
    --I think the two-tier system is important and it's important in a complex society where we have lots of cars, lots of drunk drivers, lots of reckless drivers, and lots of people being killed. 
    I think the purposes that a legislature directs itself to when it describes crimes different and penalties different, recognizes the fact that we have a desperate need for an almost administrative system to handle traffic citations and a more serious, formal, criminal mode in which to handle a death case, because in that case the legislature intends to serve the public interest in punishing people for the consequences of the transaction that gave rise to the death. 
    I think that in this case, it is clear that we are not dealing with the same offense, and in not dealing with the same offense, we don't yet reach the issue of the jurisdictional exception. 
    But if we do reach the issue of the jurisdictional exception, I think it's viable. 
    Interestingly enough, the day this Court decided Waller, it also decided Ashe, and in footnote 7 of Ashe you continued the jurisdictional exception. 
    And in fact, in continuing that jurisdictional exception in Ashe, decided the same day, you have given it vitality. 
    It is alive, and I think it is a perfect kind of exception to deal with traffic citations, in recognizing that the society has an interest in handling almost administratively traffic citations, and in a separate criminal way handling vehicular homicide. 
    I would urge this Court to affirm the Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico. 
    Thank you.

    Just a few points. 
    Your Honor. 
    The Court of Appeals in its decision held under New Mexico statute 66A-101C, vehicular homicide can be committed only by reckless driving or DWI. 
    If you look at the statute that defines the felony offense of reckless... of vehicular homicide it's predicated on a finding of either DWI or driving while under the influence of drugs or a finding that the Defendant drove recklessly. 
    They are, by statute and by the decisions of the court, lesser included offenses of vehicular homicide. 
    With respect to the argument that Defendant received a relatively minor sentence and for that reason we should not apply the double jeopardy clause, the Defendant subjected himself at trial in the Carlsbad Municipal Court to a potential punishment of 90 days confinement in jail. 
    If there's a problem in this case, the problem results from the State legislature's decision in setting penalties, which the attorney general now apparently argues are their grant of concurring jurisdiction to municipalities to penalize DWI. 
    If that's the problem, if 98 municipalities cannot seem to have the police officers correctly assess the merits of a prosecution at the time, the simple solution to that is for the legislature to withdraw from the municipality the power to try DWI as a traffic ticket offense, to provide only that the District Court, upon review by the district attorney, and presentment of an indictment or filing of the criminal information, should have the power to assess which charges should be brought.

    Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan 
    I think that's a relatively simple solution if the problems the attorney general says are of the magnitude he claims that they are. 
    It seems to me that the Petitioner's punishment in this case was appropriate, and the legislature determined it was appropriate to fit a first offense DWI situation. 
    It might have been appropriate whether there was a death or not. 
    The trial court certainly was within its jurisdiction at the district court level to probate the entire sentence. 
    The Defendant was placed on a period of probation for six months after a 21-day confinement in an alcohol care unit. 
    I believe that's something more than DWI school. 
    But nevertheless, he was subjected to punishment, and he discharged at least the majority of that punishment before the State came back and charged him with the greater offense in District Court. 
    It seems to me that this kind of multiple prosecution is exactly what the double jeopardy clause protects against, the filing of a relatively minor charge in a court of limited jurisdiction, and then the subsequent filing of a greater charge with a minor charge was clearly the lesser included offense. 
    To follow the attorney general's reasoning, all significant or felony charges could be broken down into constituent elements, could be prosecuted in courts of limited jurisdiction; the State could evaluate the merits of its case and proceed to felony prosecution later. 
    That's the kind of thing that it seems to me the double jeopardy clause has protected against traditionally, and it seems to me that the opinions in Illinois v. Vitale and Brown v. Ohio implicitly recognize there is no question in this case but that these are lesser included offenses, that the Petitioner discharged his duty in going to court, pleading no contest, accepting his punishment, and then in discharging that punishment. 
    For that reason, we believe that the decision in the New Mexico Supreme Court in applying a jurisdictional exception, which I still think is rooted in the notion of dual sovereignty where you're talking about municipal and subsequent State prosecutions, was simply incorrect. 
    And this Court should reverse the judgment of the New Mexico Supreme Court. 
    Thank you.
