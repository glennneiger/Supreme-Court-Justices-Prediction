    Mr. Estes, I think you may proceed when you are ready.

    Mr. Robert L. Estes 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case comes to you after the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court judge's granting of a motion JNOV. 
    Our position is that there is no evidence in this case upon which a reasonable juror could have concluded that the Planning Commission in this case denied the Respondent bank with all economical viable use of its property or any economically viable use that would constitute a taking requiring compensation. 
    To whatever extent the property lacked economic use we say was a function of the property itself, its configuration, and the prior development of that property. 
    Now, to give you a brief history of this, this entire property consists of 676 acres that was purchased by a prior developer to the Respondent herein to develop into a cluster housing development around a golf course. 
    That was begun in 1973, at which time the developers convinced the Planning Commission to... or actually, the county commission, to pass a cluster zoning ordinance. 
    This ordinance did now allow greater density than one dwelling unit per acre, but it did allow you to cluster dwelling units closer together provided you preserved enough additional open space area within the same development so that you still ended up with one dwelling unit per acre. 
    Now, this prior developer submitted a plat, a preliminary sketch plat to the Williamson County Planning Commission in 1973 and had it approved. 
    That would be one of the two exhibits that have been passed out to the Court. 
    It's contained in the Joint Appendix at 90... at page 422, Exhibit No. 9700. 
    Now, at that time there was a two-step procedure by which a developer could have plats submitted and approved by the Planning Commission. 
    First, an initial or preliminary sketch plat would be presented which contained just generally the outline of the development, did not contain extensive engineering data. 
    That would be looked at and determined whether or not it generally complied with the ordinances and the regulations, and then later, before a building permit was to be issued or the developer start developing, he would have to submit a so-called final plat either of the whole development, if he desired, or a section of it if he desired to develop only a section of the development at a time. 
    In this case, the developer, the prior developer, submitted only sectional final plats for approval. 
    He got about three or four of those, or three or four sections approved through the years. 
    The subdivision regulations in effect in 1973 provided that though this preliminary plat was approved in '73, it only lasted one year, that approval did. 
    It had to be renewed yearly. 
    It was not renewed yearly; it was renewed several times. 
    There was a gap from around 1976 through 1978. 
    Then there was a gap again in August 1980 to November 1980. 
    Nevertheless, the Respondent bank herein had originally loaned approximately $900,000 to the original developers. 
    Through a rather complicated series of events, this Respondent bank's subsidiaries or some of the banks it was associated with, went into bankruptcy court. 
    This bank then bought out a greater interest through a swapping deal in this subdivision turned around... well, it got title to the property, the development at that time, but turned around and sold it back to the original developer. 
    He kept it another three or four years until Noember 1980, at which time he still wasn't able to develop the property out, he went under, and this Respondent bank then bought the remaining interest in this entire development that had not been fully developed. 
    It did not buy the original part of the development. 
    Now, several things occurred over the years that changed the entire situation with respect to this development that the Planning Commission had nothing to do. 
    We say here that the plat that the Respondent bank is relying on in this lawsuit that it filed suit on, that plat it says it's relying on complies with the 1973 regulations, and it should be allowed to continue to develop the rest of the property with the '73 regulations. 
    Actually, the Planning Commission had amended those regulations from time to time. 
    However, that plat on its face does not even comply with the original '73 regulations that the Respondent bank is claiming it's depending upon.

    Mr. Robert L. Estes 
    That's right. 
    The Planning Commission assumed that the new developer, the bank, that foreclosed on the prior developer, would come in and present a new plat that complied with the '73 regulations. 
    It didn't even do that. 
    It submitted another plat that still didn't comply with any of the regulations.

    Mr. Robert L. Estes 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In further answer to Justice Brennan's question, I would submit that and point out there was an Attorney General of the State of Tennessee's opinion that was rendered shortly after the Board of Zoning appeals made that decision which stated in effect that the Board of Zoning Appeals did not have the jurisdiction and the power to decide that general question of law, and that was relied upon. 
    Furthermore, as Mr. Nebel's letter points out, later on in June of '81 to the Planning Commission, that Hamilton recognized that it needed variances in order for its plat to be approved. 
    That's contained in the record at page 850 of the Court of Appeals appendix in this case.

    Mr. Robert L. Estes 
    The subdivision regulations again in the Court of Appeals Appendix at page 932 and 933 provide that in order for a variance to be granted, it must be requested in writing, and that without the application of any conditions shown on the plat which would require a variance, would constitute grounds for disapproval of the plat. 
    So the Planning Commission had every reason to disapprove this plat simply because it was submitted not in accordance with the old '73 regulations and without having applied for a variance. 
    Now, going on to the comparison of the two plats that were submitted to the Court, there are six major differences.

    Mr. Robert L. Estes 
    Right, right. 
    That gets into the... that decision that I think you are referring to, the California decisions. 
    Going on to... if Your Honor is finished with that, going on to a comparison of the plats, the preliminary plat that was submitted in 1973 and renewed several times thereafter but which had expired before the submission in October 1980 by the predecessor developer, and in June of '81 by Hamilton Bank, there are six major differences in those plats. 
    They are just not plats of the same property. 
    First of all, during that interim the State of Tennessee, by condemnation, took a portion of the property in this subdivision, 18 1/2 acres in the bottom right hand corner of the plat. 
    It is referred to on the No. 9702 as the Natchez Trace Parkway. 
    That created tremendous problems for this development to continue in that area. 
    It caused two long prohibited cul-de-sacs, one of 5000 feet in length, the other of 3000 feet in length, in violation of all regulations, even the old '73 lengths. 
    Cul-de-sac lengths were 400 feet maximum. 
    They were amended and actually liberalized by allowing up to 800 feet. 
    Here we have two long cul-de-sacs on the plat submitted by the bank for the first time. 
    Secondly, or thirdly, there had been a survey error by the prior developer which was finally corrected by the bank when it submitted its June 1981 submittal.

    That changed the configuration. 
    There were areas in the original plats, five major ones, that were clearly and unequivocally marked, this parcel not to be developed until approved by the Planning Commission.

   Argument of Edwin S. Kneedler
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1199.159" stopTime="1408.596">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In a number of respects, affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case would represent a substantial departure from established principles under this Court's Fifth Amendment decisions. 
    As an initial matter, as we point out in our brief, it doesn't appear that Respondents have ever alleged or proven that any taking that occurred in this case was without just compensation, because they haven't shown that a compensation remedy would be unavailable under state law. 
    To ignore this essential element of a Fifth Amendment claim would be in effect to convert the Federal District Courts into claims courts for the states by permitting them to entertain inverse condemnations in any case, even though the state might also provide an inverse condemnation remedy. 
    However, the submission of the United States in this case does not relate to the without just compensation aspect of the cause of action but rather to the question of whether there was a taking at all that required the payment of just compensation. 
    There are four points that are important to us, and I will identify them at the outset: first, that there was no taking in this case because the bank did not pursue procedures before the Petitioner to either obtain a variance or to seek to comply with the applicable regulations; secondly, that the Court of Appeals applied flawed analysis in determining what would be a taking in the zoning context; third, the Court of Appeals ignored the principle that unauthorized conduct by agents of the government such as the application of the wrong regulation here gives rise to a claim for just compensation rather than being in the nature of a tort for wrongful regulation that does not give rise to a claim for just compensation; and fourth, that no compensation was owed for a so-called temporary taking in the circumstances of this case. 
    Now, in answer to several of the questions that have arisen before, looking at the first point, it does seem to us that the failure of the bank to seek to pursue procedures before the Planning Commission does end this case, and I think that the fact that neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court passed on the question of whether the plat complied with the 1973 regulations only reinforces the conclusion that that's a matter for the Planning Commission to decide in the first instance, and in fact, the Planning Commission did decide that the submission did not comply with provisions that were present in both sets of regulations, the steep slope requirements, the length of the cul-de-sacs, the road grades, all matters pertaining to public safety that are quite aside from the density of the residential units on this piece of property. 
    And so the point is that the developer should submit his case to the Planning Commission, and as Mr. Estes pointed out, counsel for the bank conceded that variances would be required in this case to overcome the difficulties with the road grades and with the length of the cul-de-sacs. 
    He simply wanted the Planning Commission to grant approval to the preliminary plat and then he would apply for variances. 
    But in fact, the subdivision regulations applied by the Commission say that the variance has to be applied for before the preliminary plat is approved. 
    And that alone, the absence of a variance request is alone sufficient basis for rejecting the plat. 
    And the idea that the--

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --The only instructions on the question of taking are whether the landowner had been denied the economical... the economic viable use of this property. 
    The jury returned a verdict saying yes, and then the question of damages went separately. 
    There were very... the instructions on the question of compensation were not very detailed, and there is no indication that I can discern as to how those damages were computed. 
    The idea that administrative remedies have to be pursued ties in with the notion of a taking because a taking occurs in the regulatory context only when the government has deprived the owner of all or substantially all of the benefit of the use of his property, and that doesn't occur just because an agency has not approved a particular proposal for development, as was the case in Penn Central. 
    The Court pointed out that yes, the developer may not be able to build a 50-story building, but he might be able to build a 20-story building, and that only when it is clear that the agency is not going to permit any substantial development is the taking claim right.

speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1678.066" stopTime="1771.009">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Yes, yes, we are not arguing that regulations can never constitute a taking. 
    Our only point is that compensation isn't due unless the legislature has authorized the agency to do this. 
    We point out that there is a provision of the Strip Mining Act which is construed not to permit a denial of a permit to mine where it would result in a taking. 
    In that instance you couldn't have a taking claim because the agency isn't authorized to apply it, so the appropriate thing to do would be to bring an injunctive action or to seek APA review of the denial of the permit in those circumstances. 
    I also wanted to briefly address what we see as two flaws in the takings analysis. 
    The first is the notion of vested rights that the bank addresses. 
    Vested rights does not mean property rights. 
    It is a term of art in the zoning area which means as a matter of... when as a matter of state law a development has proceeded to a certain extent, state law permits them to complete the development. 
    That is not the same thing as a property right. 
    When the government grants a license or a permit, it is not purporting to confer a property right on someone, and ordinarily the permit could be revoked, and in fact, in the very case that the bank relies on in this case, Schneider v. Lazarov, from the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Tennessee Supreme Court said that very thing with respect to building permits in Tennessee. 
    If a building permit is granted, it can be revoked without automatically giving rise to the claim for just compensation. 
    So the mere fact that the bank once had approval, even if it were so, for 736 units, does not forever give it a permanent exemption from the application of changes in the zoning ordinance.

    I think under the federal system Congress could prescribe that APA review would have to be sought for the denial of a permit, and that's particularly so where the agency was not authorized to engage in conduct that would constitute a taking.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    I think that's less clear. 
    I think it tends to blend in with the question of whether there should be abstention on the state law question of whether the commission had properly applied state law. 
    It does seem strange that that should be something for a federal court to decide in the first instance which set of regulations should be applied. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

   Argument of G. T. Nebel
speaker="g_t_nebel" startTime="1829.047" stopTime="1897.442">
    Mr. G. T. Nebel 
    I thank Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue before this Court is whether the state will be required to pay just compensation when its regulations destroy all practical economic value of private property. 
    To resolve that issue, Hamilton proposes the following two propositions of law: 
    First, zoning regulations can effect a Fifth Amendment taking, at least in those rare cases in which the regulations go too far and destroy all practical economic value. 
    Secondly, when a Fifth Amendment regulatory taking has occurred, the appropriate remedy is compensation. 
    Now, returning to my first proposition which really leads me to respond to several of the questions raised by the Court, after 15 days of trial, 27 witnesses, and hundreds of documents, the jury was submitted the following special interrogatory: has Plaintiff been denied economically viable use of its property in violation of the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment.

    Mr. G. T. Nebel 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The $350,000 figure really came from the holding costs associated during the temporary taking.

    Mr. G. T. Nebel 
    Not the lost interest, not the lost profit that Hamilton could have made by reinvesting that money and loaning it to someone else and charging a higher rate of interest, but specifically, the record reveals that there were $393,000 in damages to Hamilton from loss of use of the money, and that formula came from very reasonable calculation, namely, the cost to Hamilton under the Fed Fund discount rate. 
    So really, all the jury found, among other costs associated, was that Hamilton was entitled to recover a portion of the holding cost of the property when the period was temporarily... excuse me, when the property was temporarily taken from Hamilton during that sixteen month period.

    --That is correct, and that is our position because cases that hold such, the fact that the state acted under color of state law, or the Planning Commission in this case acted under color of state law I think is sufficient to meet that requirement, and of course, that's not what we have here anyhow. 
    We have a Planning Commission that was acting pursuant to regularly adopted and promulgated state planning laws. 
    But the impact, it is the economic impact of those regulations that was illegal, unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.

    --Yes, that's the impact of the estoppel verdict, Your Honor. 
    Under Tennessee State law, the jury also determined, in addition to answering the taking question, the jury also determined that the defendant should be estopped from imposing those new regulations. 
    That doesn't mean again that the regulations are inherently illegal in and of themselves under a facial attack to the regulations. 
    It is just as they were applied to our property. 
    Many of the arguments raised by Mr. Estes during his argument will not be responded to except as the Court requires because, quite frankly, our position is that these issues have already been determined by the jury and have been affirmed by the Sixth Circuit after a full review of the record, and there was--

    Let me give you a hypothetical. 
    Suppose you got a case where nobody really questions the fact that some attempt at zoning regulation or government restrictions would deny the owner of the property all viable use of the property, but there is a good argument for doing it, environmental concerns and all the rest, and it takes five years to litigate the question, with procedural fairness all the way along the line, appeals up to this, and eventually the property owner wins, and then the government says okay, you can get an injunction against further interference with that property.

 Suppose you got a case where nobody really questions the fact that some attempt at zoning regulation or government restrictions would deny the owner of the property all viable use of the property, but there is a good argument for doing it, environmental concerns and all the rest, and it takes five years to litigate the question, with procedural fairness all the way along the line, appeals up to this, and eventually the property owner wins, and then the government says okay, you can get an injunction against further interference with that property. 
 Does it automatically follow under your theory that there are damages for temporary taking?

    Mr. G. T. Nebel 
    For the temporary period only, and the facts in this case demonstrate how reasonable that rule is. 
    As I have indicated in response to a question from Justice Brennan, Hamilton Bank suffered a number of holding costs in connection with this. 
    The record indicates that it was close to half a million dollars, according to the testimony of one of the officers of the bank, but they only got $350,000. 
    Our rule of law would simply spread the loss and not put it on a property owner when a regulation has been implemented that destroys all economic value. 
    And that is a very narrow set of cases that are going to... where the property owner is going to be able to come in and prove total destruction of the economic value of his property.

    And then on November 11, an appeal was taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
    The Planning Commission sent representatives, both the county attorney and the county planner showed up to argue their case. 
    They lost. 
    On November 25, or 26th, Hamilton foreclosed on the property. 
    Prior to that time, the evidence is clear in the record that the Planning Commission abided by the Board of Zoning Appeals decisions. 
    Temple Hills is the only instance that the record reveals where the Planning Commission refused to abide by the Board of Zoning Appeals decision. 
    Moreover, in addition to the fact that the Board of Zoning Appeals route was taken, in 1981, June of 1981, moving forward in chronology, Hamilton submitted two plats. 
    One plat was a plat that had been approved and reapproved on numerous occasions between '73 and '79. 
    The other plat was a plat that was submitted in an attempt to comply with the Planning Commission's request. 
    At that meeting, June 18 of 1981, the Planning Commission turned down both plats submitted by the Planning Commission. 
    The county attorney was asked by the developer's representative what do we do next?

 No, but you would say that the part that you are referring to, the east half of this large tract, must be entirely vacant and cannot be used for any commercial or residential purpose whatsoever because of interest in open areas and all that sort of stuff, and you have litigated that and say no, we are entitled to use that.

    Well, not, no... Your Honor, I disagree with that. 
    As this Court noted in Penn Central, for example, there was a total denial of the air space rights above the building, but that wasn't a taking because the owner had a residual use in the Grand Central Station terminal, an economically viable use. 
    That's not the case here. 
    We've got Hamilton... the only property that Hamilton owned was the 258 acre tract that it foreclosed on. 
    There were no residual rights, no economically viable use in that tract. 
    One hundred percent of Hamilton's property was subject to these regulations, and the economic impact was the total destruction of value. 
    I think that distinguishes Hamilton from the hypothetical of the Court.

    Mr. G. T. Nebel 
    Well, that's why I've tried to proceed from a practical standpoint. 
    Of course, any land has some value, but to develop those 67 houses, those lots, Your Honor, under the requirements of the applicable zoning ordinance, you would have to put sewers in, underground utilities, roads that met certain specifications, etcetera. 
    You can't just go out and build a house out in the middle of that property. 
    You would have to meet the Planning Commission's own requirements. 
    The cost of meeting those requirements would be approximately $2 1/2 million, according to the record, whereas the maximum that the developer, that Hamilton could have realized by selling those 67 scattered building sites would be $1 1/2 million. 
    So you would wind up... any developer who bought that property and wanted to build those 67 houses would have to do so knowing that he would lose a million dollars on the front end. 
    And of course, nobody is going to do that. 
    No alternative uses were available. 
    The record is clear, it was zoned only for residential. 
    You couldn't put commercial, agricultural or industrial uses on the property.

    No, it is not, Your Honor. 
    We of course appealed that to the Sixth Circuit, but the Sixth Circuit said that that issue was predominate by its holding on the taking issue which gave us all the relief that we sought. 
    On the exhaustion of administrative remedies and state judicial remedies, the Petitioners argue that we should have gone to state court first. 
    Of course, that isn't the law under Section 1983, and we had a right of course to bring our federal claim, a violation of a federal constitutional right, in federal court.

    Mr. G. T. Nebel 
    In this case I think yes, Your Honor. 
    I think as a general abstract proposition you have to exhaust your remedies except from a 1983 standpoint, I am aware of a lot of cases that say that rule doesn't apply, but I think from a... number one, normally yes. 
    In this case, not only did we exhaust our remedies, but it would have been futile to attempt to do anything more. 
    Hamilton went the extra mile simply to avoid going to court. 
    They couldn't make any money going to court. 
    The last thing that they wanted to do in this case... and the record is replete with references to the fact that they wanted to work with the Planning Commission and avoid the expense of litigation. 
    They can make more money by selling this property than by bringing a claim in federal court. 
    The Petitioners argue the application of the Davis case, which is a Tennessee Court of Appeals decision cited in our brief, and say that that means that there was an adequate state court remedy available. 
    First of all, our position is that under Section 1983, we can bring a claim directly in federal court. 
    Secondly, our position is that even if there is some requirement that you exhaust state judicial remedies, that... and the Justice Department brief concedes on this point that even that is predicated upon the existence of an adequate state court remedy, and in our case, there is no existence of an adequate state court remedy available. 
    The statute says on its face, and I quote... this is 29-16-123, which is the statute they rely upon... 
    "If, however, such person or company has actually taken possession of such land, occupying it for the purposes of internal improvement, then the owner can bring a lawsuit. " 
    The Davis case specifically refused to apply 29-16-123 because it said there was no allegation or evidence... and I am quoting, 
    "No allegation or evidence that the defendant government actually entered upon, took possession of or used any of the real estate of plaintiff. " 
    So the Davis case actually supports our interpretation of 29-16-123.

    Mr. G. T. Nebel 
    In Ledbetter v. Peach, the Tennessee Supreme Court in interpreting 29-16-123, found that that statute did not apply... and I am quoting again... 
    "in the absence of a physical taking or direct interference amount to a physical taking. " 
    Moreover, the issue of whether we should have gone to state court first has been raised too late. 
    In an opinion by Justice Brandeis styled Twist v. Prairie Oil &amp; Gas Company, 214 U.S. 684, this Court in a similar context found that the petitioners had no right to challenge the choice of forum at the late date of their argument to the Supreme Court. 
    As to the existence of remedy, I think I have made most of my point to this point. 
    Our position is that the Fifth Amendment is self-executing. 
    If the government takes it, they have to pay for it.

    Let me ask you one other question on this. 
    In thinking back to some of the old rate cases where a commission sets the utility rates at a low level, then they appeal to the state supreme court, and the state supreme court says no, that is a taking without due process of law, the rates are too low, they can't use their property, and they reverse and require that the new rates be put into effect, would the utilities always be able to get damages from the lower commission in those cases? 
    I think they would under your view.

    Mr. G. T. Nebel 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Our position is that plaintiffs should not be specially privileged under the Constitution. 
    Affirming the Sixth Circuit would merely bring needed constitutional discipline to this area of the law. 
    The Fifth Amendment addresses takings, not just some takings. 
    Regardless of the mechanics of a taking, whether it be by regulation or eminent domaine, the Fifth Amendment makes takings illegal, at least to the extent they are uncompensated. 
    Liberty and property as so intertwined that one cannot have meaning without the other, and under principles of fundamental fairness, we request that this Court affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit.
