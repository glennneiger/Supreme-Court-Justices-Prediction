Williams v. Vermont

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in Norman Williams and Susan Levine v. Vermont. 
    Mr. Williams, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Norman Charles Williams 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this appeal challenges discrimination between residents and non-residents under the Vermont Motor Vehicle Purchase and Use Tax. 
    We believe that discrimination violates the equal protection clause and the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution. 
    We also believe that the statute violates the commerce clause. 
    Everyone who moves to Vermont and owns a car has to pay a 4 percent tax on the value of their car when they register it in Vermont. 
    Residents in exactly the same circumstances pay no tax. 
    Let me tell you how the tax system works. 
    Nominally, everyone, every individual who first registers a car in Vermont is required to pay a 4 percent tax. 
    However, residents of Vermont who buy cars in other states are granted a credit for taxes paid to the other state. 
    Nonresidents in exactly the same circumstances are denied that credit. 
    In effect, this means that a Vermont resident who goes to Illinois and buys a car, pays an Illinois tax of 7 percent, comes back to Vermont and registers the car there, pays no tax to the State of Vermont. 
    An Illinois resident in exactly the same situation goes to exactly the same dealership on exactly the same day, pays the tax, buys the car, pays the tax of 7 percent, moves to Vermont. 
    When that person registers his car in Vermont, he pays a 4 percent tax to the State of Vermont.

    Mr. Norman Charles Williams 
    No, they don't. 
    If a Vermont resident bought a car in Illinois and stayed for only two or three weeks or bought a car in New York and stayed for only two or three weeks, in that case they would have an option. 
    They would not have to pay Illinois or New York. 
    But let's take the case of, for example, an executive who is transferred to Illinois for three months; buys a car in Illinois for his stay there. 
    He has got to pay the Illinois tax in order to drive that car in Illinois for three months. 
    Other situations might be retirees who went to Florida and stayed over the winter. 
    They would have to pay a tax to Florida. 
    When they got back to Vermont, they would get a credit for the tax paid. 
    So I don't think it's true of... if you stay for only two or three weeks, you have a choice. 
    Other than that, you have to pay to the other state.

    Mr. Norman Charles Williams 
    I think we have to assume it, because it's a motion to dismiss. 
    I think that as a matter of judicial notice, it is undoubtedly clear that there are people who go to California, college students who go to California for a year, or people that are... business executives that are transferred for three months, a year, two years; retirees that go to Florida; people that go on a long vacation. 
    There's any number of situations that one can imagine where a Vermonter would buy a car in a distant state and not register in Vermont, but register in the other state.

    --I have no problem with Illinois. 
    I think Illinois treated me fairly. 
    I would have no problem under the equal protection clause or under the privileges and immunities clause with Vermont if Vermont charged me a 4 percent tax that it also charged to all its residents. 
    My problem is with Vermont under the equal protection clause and the privileges and immunities clause because residents of Vermont don't pay Vermont anything, but I pay Vermont 4 percent.

    Mr. Norman Charles Williams 
    A resident who purchases a car in another state and pays a tax to another state, like me, pays Vermont nothing because that resident gets the credit for the taxes paid in the other state which I do not get. 
    I'd also add that in 1980, until 1980, I would have been treated the same as a Vermont resident. 
    But in that year, the Vermont legislature repealed the exemption that would have applied to me, evidently in an effort to raise some funds. 
    There's no legislative history on the repeal at all, but that's what happened.

    Mr. Norman Charles Williams 
    --The statute says... the statute plainly says that any Vermont resident who purchases a car in another state and pays a tax in another state is entitled to a credit. 
    So I think the answer to that is yes. 
    That's the way the Vermont Supreme Court has interpreted the statute, the Vermont Superior Court has interpreted the statute. 
    There is no suggestion anywhere that that isn't the case. 
    I think any time a Vermont resident pays a tax to another state he gets a credit, which isn't true when a nonresident does the same thing. 
    I think the tax violates the equal protection clause because it infringes the right to travel. 
    It sets up a barrier for people coming to Vermont. 
    It happens to be a tax on a car; it could be a tax on any other property. 
    The point is that it's a tax imposed on nonresidents that isn't imposed on residents in the same circumstances.

    Mr. Norman Charles Williams 
    Well, that would be one way to cure the equal protection claim. 
    I agree. 
    I think that in order to do that, the legislature would have to face the entire constituency of Vermont. 
    It wouldn't be able to discriminate just against nonresidents who don't have a voice in the legislature. 
    However, they could certainly do that. 
    I think that would raise commerce clause questions, which I address in part three of the brief. 
    But I think that it would take care of the discrimination. 
    I also think this tax... the discrimination violates the privileges and immunities clause under cases like Zobel or cases like Austin v. New Hampshire and Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Zobel, not the main opinion in Zobel. 
    In Austin, this Court said clearly that a state cannot impose a higher tax burden on nonresidents than it does on residents in exactly the same circumstances. 
    That is one right that is protected by the privileges and immunities clause.

    Mr. Norman Charles Williams 
    --I checked the census, and it appears to me that about 14,000 people are moving to Vermont every year. 
    I don't know exactly what percentage of those people own cars. 
    Perhaps a third, a fourth of those people own cars. 
    The Attorney General has said that the tax brings in about a million dollars a year. 
    This... what I think is the illegal part of the tax brings in about a million dollars a year to the State of Vermont. 
    But, of course, none of this is in the record because this comes up on a motion to dismiss. 
    Once the privileges and immunities clause applies, then the Court is to look at whether nonresidents constitute a peculiar source of evil. 
    In this case I suppose, do nonresidents do a disproportionate share of road damage? 
    And I think it's obvious that they don't. 
    I think that residents who don't pay any tax probably do just as much damage, if not more damage, to roads. 
    Trucks just passing through do damage; recreational vehicles, trailers, all sorts of cars do road damage... people who don't pay taxes. 
    So there's no basis under the privileges and immunities clause for charging this discriminatory tax.

    What would have happened if the dealer in Illinois had arranged to have some person drive the car to Vermont and deliver it to you there? 
    What tax would have been due?

    Mr. Norman Charles Williams 
    If I had lived in Vermont when I ordered the car? 
    I think that Illinois would not have required me to pay a tax if I ordered the car in Illinois. 
    And then I would have had to pay the 4 percent tax to Vermont. 
    I think, though, just to say it once more, people in the same situation, Vermont residents in the same situation that I was in in Illinois would pay the tax... would get a credit.

    I guess we have no way of finding out. 
    I'm curious to know just how many people would actually be in this situation of a Vermont resident who buys a car and Illinois and uses it for a couple of months in Illinois before bringing it back to Vermont. 
    I suppose just in the law of coincidences there may be some people that that happens to, but it would seem to me that it would be a fairly rare situation.

    Well, as you say it's not... I the record I suggested some examples.

    I think any Vermonter who found himself in another state for a couple of months, especially a distant state, might well decide to buy a car, to use it while he was there in that other state.

    Mr. Norman Charles Williams 
    Exactly. 
    I think that even apart from the discrimination, the tax violates the commerce clause because even if, as Justice White suggested, the discrimination was removed and everyone who bought a car in another state had to pay a 4 percent tax to Vermont which is the case in four other states right now, in that case everyone would face a substantial incentive to buy their car in Vermont for tax reasons alone. 
    For example, if I was moving to Vermont and the prices of the cars were within a couple of percentage points of each other, it would be smarter for me, more economical for me to wait until I sell my car in Illinois, move to Vermont, and buy a car. 
    That way I would pay 4 percent.

    Justice O'Connor 
    Well, but your incentive would perhaps still be to buy the car in Illinois because the Vermont tax is based on the used value rather than the sales value. 
    So what the incentive is for your commerce clause analysis, it seems to me, is just to delay the purchase a little bit until you've made the move, but it wouldn't influence where you made the purchase, I think, except perhaps to maybe slightly prefer to buy it out of state.

    I think that if I was in Illinois and I needed a car and it would be reasonable for me to buy one to move, it would be much better for me to wait. 
    If I bought it in Illinois, I would pay a 7 percent tax. 
    I would move to Vermont. 
    There might be some slight deterioration of the car that might be worth slightly less, but I would still pay 4 percent more.

    And I think that most of the members of this Court don't think that that issue was reached. 
    I think that the analysis under Henneford may have changed in the years... in the 50 years since it was decided. 
    I think that what has been decided since Henneford is that a state may charge a reasonable... for use of its own resources... in this case, roads... may charge a fairly apportioned fee or tax for that. 
    In this case, the fee isn't apportioned. 
    It is a one-time fee, a one-time tax that has very little, if anything, to do with actual use or actual damage to the roads. 
    And it's because it isn't apportioned that it calls into question the commerce clause under what I think is the modern analysis. 
    Because it isn't apportioned, it creates this incentive to change your purchasing decision based on the tax alone.

    If all 50 states... I think under the modern analysis, the analysis in Arco v. Hardesty... if all 50 states had a tax like this, a person that was moving would wait, would always wait until they were in the state of destination. 
    A person who was already in a state wouldn't buy in another state because he'd have to pay tax twice.

    Mr. Andrew M. Eschen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, in 1978 Susan Levine, one of the Appellants in this case, purchased a brand new 1979 Chrysler Horizon in New York State. 
    At the time of the purchase, she was a resident of New York. 
    Under New York law, she was obligated to pay that state's sales tax, and she paid that state sales tax. 
    If she wanted to use the car in New York, she was obligated to register the car, so she registered the car and she used the car there for over a year. 
    Then, in an act of her own free will, she decided to become a Vermont resident and she moved to Vermont and she engaged in employment in the state. 
    She's been in Vermont since 1979 and she's been using her vehicle in the state since 1979. 
    She registered her car in 1982, and at that time the State of Vermont simply asked if you are going to use your car on our highways, you should pay a fee; you should pay the same fee that we ask of any other individual who wants to use a car in the State of Vermont. 
    And the State of Vermont imposed a use tax, ad the use tax was based upon the value of the vehicle as of the time it was registered in the State of Vermont, as of the time she became a resident of the State of Vermont. 
    She had used the car for over three years. 
    The car had depreciated. 
    Accordingly, the use tax imposed by the State of Vermont was $110.

    Unlike several other... many other states... according to my research there are about 35 other states that impose an annual property tax or an annual excise tax on automobiles. 
    The only obligation in Vermont is to pay the purchase or use tax and then there's an annual $36 renewal on the registration.

    Mr. Andrew M. Eschen 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    In fact, if I may, I'd like to give to this Court the same examples that I used before the Vermont Supreme Court to explain how the tax scheme operates. 
    Using Ms. Levine as an example, she was liable to Vermont for $110 when she became a resident and registered the vehicle in the state. 
    The tax was based upon a 1979 Chrysler Horizon, registered in the state as of 1982 when she became a resident. 
    If a resident, at the same time that she registered her car in Vermont, had purchased the identical Chrysler Horizon, 1979 model, had purchased it in Vermont, he would have paid to Vermont a purchase tax of 4 percent or $110, the same amount that was requested of Ms. Levine.

    Mr. Andrew M. Eschen 
    Well, Your Honor, I admit that it is a difficulty in this case because the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court does not specifically address the first registration principle that I've discussed. 
    However, it was discussed, it was brought to the Court's attention, and the Court concluded that there was no discrimination. 
    The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the State of Vermont is empowered to administer the Act. 
    Section 8911.9 has an ambiguity in it in the form of the word "acquired". 
    In contrast to other credit provisions in section 8911, the legislature has chosen to use the word "acquired" rather than "owned" or "purchased" or "used". 
    This, we submit, created an ambiguity in the statute as to when the credit provision should be applied. 
    However, the legislature has specifically stated in section 8901 that the purpose of the tax was to raise revenue for the maintenance and improvement of the state highway system. 
    The tax is imposed on users. 
    Anybody who is going to use the state highways, who is a resident--

    Well, there's no argument from the other side that there shouldn't be a... that people who use the roads shouldn't pay. 
    It's the discrimination, the claimed discrimination. 
    Let me ask you while I've interrupted you, suppose the tax operated in the way that you would think it operated from reading the opinion of the Supreme Court or, even more specifically, the way it operated, the way your colleague on the other side states the case. 
    What if he were right in answering Justice O'Connor's question the way he did? 
    And in Justice Stevens' example, the lady, the Vermont resident, who goes to New York, works for a year, buys a car and comes back to Vermont... suppose that she would get the credit, but that a New York resident who moved up there the same day would or wouldn't.

speaker="andrew_m_eschen" startTime="2426.274" stopTime="2501.983">
    Mr. Andrew M. Eschen 
    The registration in Vermont triggers the tax liability in Vermont. 
    Prior to the time a person becomes a resident, he has no obligation to register the vehicle. 
    Once he becomes a resident, he's obligated to register the vehicle, at which point the tax is imposed. 
    In the situation where a nonresident purchases a car in his own state and then brings it to Vermont and registers it in Vermont, he will not receive a credit. 
    The credit is available to a resident of Vermont who subsequently acquires the motor vehicle and first registers it in the State of Vermont. 
    If he first registers it outside the State of Vermont and brings it back to Vermont and registers it in Vermont, he will be denied the credit. 
    The reasoning is, the purpose of the credit provision was simply to enable Vermonters to take advantage of the extensive, relatively extensive automobile markets that are located outside the State. 
    Vermont is a very small state, but at the same time we're surrounded by New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York, all of which have considerably larger and accessible automobile markets. 
    What the legislature intended to do was simply to give the Vermonter the option of exploring automobile markets in other states. 
    The credit is available only if the car is purchased in a reciprocal state.

    Mr. Andrew M. Eschen 
    --Your Honor, I believe it is a correct statement as far as it goes. 
    It doesn't except the administration, the actual administration of the tax. 
    The tax is administered by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. 
    And the problem in this case is that section 8911(9) talks about the credit being available to a resident and upon the application for registration, which brings into question, or brings into the case the other statutes which are in pari materia, the state's registration statutes and the state's residency laws. 
    And when the statutes are put together, as the Commissioner has interpreted and as it has been argued to the Vermont Supreme Court, the credit is only available if the resident first registers the car in the State of Vermont. 
    And I think the logic is plain because if the resident, if the purpose of the credit provision is simply to enable the Vermonter to make a quick trip to another state to make a purchase and to return to Vermont to use the car in Vermont, as the Court pointed out before, it's unlikely that a resident of Vermont is going to make a shopping trip in another state and then actually register the car in the state in which it is purchased.

    Mr. Andrew M. Eschen 
    --We waived it because this case, Williams, was based upon the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court in Leverson. 
    And in Leverson, which is actually the decision that's before the Court, we did submit a motion to dismiss or affirm. 
    So when I received the jurisdictional statement, I did send a letter to the Court indicating that we were waiving the motion to dismiss because, as I said, the case was decided on the basis of Leverson and we already submitted a motion to dismiss in that case. 
    The... under the examples that I said before, everybody who registers that car at the same time would be paying the same amount of tax. 
    The resident who purchased the car in a reciprocal state and first registered it in Vermont would pay $110. 
    It would be kept by the reciprocal state, but that individual has only acquired a singular privilege of driving in Vermont. 
    By not registering the car in that other state, he has acquired no privileges in that state, except perhaps the temporary privileges that may attend the intransit registration. 
    Just about all states provide that a nonresident can avoid paying the sales tax on an automobile purchase if he or she obtains an in-transit registration rather than a permanent registration. 
    And that's what the legislature was envisioning when it enacted this credit provision, to simply enable the Vermonter to make the quick trip, come back to Vermont, and register the car in Vermont. 
    In the case where the resident first registers the vehicle in the other state and then returns to Vermont and registers the car in Vermont, he is not extended a credit, and justifiably. 
    In that situation, the individual has acquired the privilege of using the vehicle in several states, in two states. 
    And it's only fair that if he is going to use... or if he's obtained this privilege, that he should pay each state. 
    The Court has long recognized that the use tax is a legitimate means of raising revenue. 
    And the State of Vermont is certainly within its authority to ask the Appellants in this case, once they become residents of the state, to pay the use tax. 
    Similarly, the states are within their authority to impose a sales tax. 
    I find it ironic that Mr. Williams is complaining that the one-time fee imposed by the State of Vermont in the amount of 4 percent of the value of a vehicle as of the time it is registered in Vermont is unfair, yet he's not complaining about the one-time fee that he had to pay to Illinois when he purchased the car there. 
    I think really what the situation presents--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2918.303" stopTime="2932.475">

    Mr. Andrew M. Eschen 
    But I submit that the decision has been made by the court, and that under Vermont law the Commissioner's interpretation has been accepted. 
    The privileges and immunities challenge, I believe, is also without merit. 
    Again, the tax was imposed only after the Appellants became residents of the State of Vermont. 
    The interesting issue in this case is simply the right to register a motor vehicle or the access to registering a motor vehicle. 
    They are in essence challenging the laws of their own state. 
    Prior to becoming residents, they did not have any obligation to pay the tax. 
    The tax was incurred only when they became residents. 
    So I would submit that there is a question of standing as to whether they could challenge it under the privileges and immunities clause. 
    But even if they could, again the interest in this case is certainly not an interest of the same caliber as the Court has recognized in other privileges and immunities cases... Hicklin... we're not dealing with a right to seek employment; we're not dealing with a fundamental right to vote. 
    This is simply the right to register an automobile. 
    And I think the case of Baldwin v. Fish and Game Commission of Montana would be dispositive of that point. 
    The commerce clause issue I submit is also with merit. 
    The Appellants contend that there is a requirement of apportionment; yet, they hardly define what they mean by apportionment. 
    To the extent that they disagree with a tax based upon the value of a vehicle, the decision of the court in Capital Greyhound Lines v. Brice is dispositive of that contention. 
    To the extent that they claim that apportionment is required to reflect prior use in the other state, I submit that the Vermont tax scheme whereby the vehicle is taxed on the value as of the time it is used in the State of Vermont, registered in the State of Vermont, would satisfy the requirement of apportionment. 
    It is a reasonable way of dealing with the situation where a vehicle has been used outside the state. 
    I would conclude, Your Honors, by saying that the statute is unclear and it was for that reason that it was submitted to the Vermont Supreme Court. 
    The Vermont Supreme Court concluded that there was no discrimination. 
    I have made representations to the Court as to how this statute and the tax provisions are administered. 
    Those are based upon my discussions with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and other officials in the department. 
    That is their representation of how it is administered. 
    I have no reason to disagree with that. 
    I can very well appreciate the Court's concern about the Vermont Supreme Court's decision in not specifically addressing the scenarios that I have addressed to the Court today, but I would nevertheless submit that the interpretation that we have advanced is an interpretation that would show that there is equality of treatment by the State of Vermont. 
    Thank you.
