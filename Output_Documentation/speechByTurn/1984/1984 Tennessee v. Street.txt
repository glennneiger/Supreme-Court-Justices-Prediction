Tennessee v. Street

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in the State of Tennessee v. Harvey Street. 
    Mr. Grunow, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="robert_a_grunow" startTime="14.402" stopTime="339.273">
    Mr. Robert A. Grunow 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This criminal case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals which reversed Defendant Street's first degree murder conviction and sentence of life imprisonment and remanded the case for a new trial. 
    The question before this Court is whether a nontestifying accomplice's confession can be constitutionally used on rebuttal to impeach the defendant's claim that his own confession was a coerced imitation of the accomplice's. 
    The facts relevant to this inquiry are as follows: 
    This prosecution arises out of the 1981 murder of a 72 year old man who was found hanged outside his burglarized home in a small mountain community in east Tennessee. 
    The defendant, a Clifford Peele, and five other young adults, were charged with murder, and defendant Street's case was severed from the others. 
    The state's proof in chief at Street's trial consisted of several confessions by the defendant and testimony of law enforcement officers concerning the scene of the crime that tended to corroborate certain details of the defendant's confession. 
    From the time of its opening argument through its case in chief, the state did not mention the existence of Peele's confession. 
    Thereafter, the defendant presented an alibi defense and took the stand. 
    In his direct testimony the defendant admitted that Peele had given a confession which had implicated the defendant in the murder. 
    The defendant also admitted that he gave a confession but maintained it was merely a coerced imitation of Peele's earlier confession. 
    With regard to this claim, the defendant maintained that prior to taking his confession, the sheriff repeatedly read him Peele's confession. 
    The defendant also claimed that when taking his confession, the sheriff interrupted him any time his account varied from Peele's and demanded that the defendant replicate Peele's version, which the defendant then did. 
    As part of its rebuttal proof, the state for the first time in this case sought to introduce Peele's confession into evidence. 
    Over objection, the state was allowed to introduce the confession for the limited, non-hearsay purpose of establishing that it was said, and with the express goal of impeaching the defendant's parroting claim with the most appropriate evidence available. 
    Limiting instructions were given on three occasions, and the record clearly indicates that the state carefully limited its use of and argument on the accomplice's confession to the impeachment purpose for which it was introduced. 
    Thereafter, the defendant was convicted of first degree murder and was given the only sentence permitted in this case under state law, life imprisonment. 
    On appeal, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction of the defendant on the ground that the introduction of Peele's confession under the circumstances of this case denied the defendant his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment. 
    The state urges this Court to reverse the decision below since the limited introduction of the accomplice's confession for the impeachment purposes on rebuttal did not violate the defendant's confrontation rights. 
    We contend that limiting instructions were adequate in this case to avoid a confrontation clause violation for four reasons which I will summarize and then address in sequence. 
    First, the manner of introduction of the questioned evidence created little if any likelihood of improper jury consideration of that evidence. 
    Second, there existed legitimate and compelling reasons justifying the state's use of such evidence in light of the defendant's parroting claim. 
    Third, no suitable alternatives existed. 
    And fourth, under the circumstances of this case, the evidence was not devastating in nature. 
    In applying the confrontation clause to the admission into evidence of nontestifying accomplice confessions, Bruton, Douglas and the Parker plurality of this Court have addressed two basic questions: first, whether the manner of introduction of such evidence creates a substantial likelihood of improper consideration of that evidence against the defendant, and second, if so, whether the resulting risk of unfair prejudice as a matter of policy or practical necessity outweighs the ability of a jury to follow limiting instructions given. 
    We suggest that both questions are answered in the negative in this case. 
    As to the first basic question, the manner of introduction created little if any likelihood of improper consideration. 
    Unlike prior cases in this are where no legitimate inferences against the defendant could be drawn from the evidence placed before the jury, in this case there was a legitimate inference that could be drawn from the introduction of Peele's statement, namely, that Peele's confession was sufficiently different from the defendant's so as to negate the defendant's parroting claim--

    Mr. Robert A. Grunow 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It is our position that because of the limited nature of the statement's introduction in this case, it was not offered to prove the truth of that statement but was rather merely entered to show what that statement was, to directly impeach on rebuttal the defendant's claim that he parroted the very terms of that other confession. 
    We believe that the Court of Criminal Appeals below misapplied this Court's doctrines as enunciated in Bruton and Douglas and the Parker plurality to find that there necessarily had to be a substantial likelihood of improper consideration. 
    It is our position that that simply did not occur in this case.

    Mr. Robert A. Grunow 
    Your Honor, the subject first came in in the defense attorney's opening remarks to the jury in which he pointed out that a co-defendant, Peele, had confessed and had implicated Street in the murder. 
    In this case, as to the substantial likelihood of improper consideration, the defendant focused the jury's attention on the existence of the accomplice's confession. 
    We submit that this is important because the jury had already been informed by the defendant that the accomplice had confessed and had implicated him in the murder, thereby avoiding the potential for any proper consideration of the confession as introduced later by the state. 
    As to the second basic question raised by this court in prior decisions, both as a policy and practical matter, any resulting risk of unfair prejudice occasioned by the introduction of such limited purpose evidence on rebuttal was eliminated through the use of limiting instructions. 
    In Bruton, this Court considered three factors in determining whether the introduction of such evidence would further rather than impede the search for truth, first, whether adequate justification exists for the use of the questioned evidence; second, whether alternatives exist in the pursuit of truth to avoid any conflict; and third, whether the devastating nature of the evidence is too great as a practical matter to be cured by a limiting instruction.

speaker="robert_a_grunow" startTime="648.846" stopTime="779.081">
    Mr. Robert A. Grunow 
    As to the first factor, there were legitimate and compelling reasons justifying the state's use of such evidence in this case. 
    In Bruton and Parker, this court dealt with judicial economy in a joint trial as a justification for the use. 
    Here, the more important justification lies in the defendant's election to place before the jury his parroting claim which called into question the very terms of his accomplice's confession. 
    Now, as a practical matter, the state was justified in using the accomplice's confession because it was the strongest and only adequate evidence to directly challenge that defendant's claim. 
    As a policy matter, after making his parroting claim, the defendant should not be allowed to invoke the confrontation clause to bar the limited non-hearsay rebuttal use of such evidence. 
    Such invocation of the confrontation clause would impede the ability of the jury to assess the credibility of the defendant's claim, thereby posing a grave risk of perversion of the truth-seeking function of the trial. 
    It would also permit the defendant to use the confrontation clause as a shield to subvert the very mission of that clause as ensuring the fairness and accuracy of the criminal claim. 
    Such a policy is consistent with past decisions of this Court. 
    In 1948 in Michelson v. United States, this Court recognized that evidence which may be too prejudicial to introduce in the state's proof in chief, even with limiting instructions, may nevertheless be used for impeachment purposes once the defendant elects to put that issue into evidence by taking the stand. 
    Now, Michelson v. United States admittedly does not raise constitutional questions. 
    However, other cases cited in our brief suggest that constitutional protections, whether afforded by prophylactic exclusionary rules or by direct application of constitutional rights, should not provide a defendant with a shield to bar the legitimate impeachment techniques in assessing the credibility of a defendant's claim that he asserts on the stand.

    Mr. Robert A. Grunow 
    I believe they would in the sense, Your Honor, that the question was whether the defendant was in fact subject to cross examination on the stand. 
    Availability was really not an issue. 
    Everyone seems to agree that he was in the jail next door, and that made no difference whether he was actually in the courtroom or the jail, the fact that he was not taking the stand seemed to be the turning point in this case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1059.067" stopTime="1072.107">
    Justice Stevens 
    May I ask a question about an alternative way of handling the problem? 
    As I understand it, the point was that Peele's confession did not have some facts in it that the defendant's confession did have, and you wanted to show therefore the defendant's could not have been parrotted.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1072.107" stopTime="1081.704">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    After reading the confession, as I understand the record, the officer was asked were these facts as in the confession you just read, and he denied as to each of those facts.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1081.704" stopTime="1095.105">
    Justice Stevens 
    Why couldn't he have been asked those questions without reading the confession, and then had the confession in the courtroom in order to verify whether or not the testimony was true? 
    Why was it necessary to read the confession and not just identify those points?
speaker="robert_a_grunow" startTime="1095.105" stopTime="1118.119">
    Mr. Robert A. Grunow 
    Your Honor, the reason why the state found it important to do more was that it was not only the omissions in Peele's statement that made the parroting claim incredible; there were numerous differences, only slight differences between similar events that both narrated that would show that it was impossible for them to have merely been the result of a parroting claim.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1118.119" stopTime="1123.472">

    Justice Stevens 
    Well, but why wouldn't the impeachment have been adequate just with the omission point? 
    It seems to me that is the most persuasive, because you had independent evidence I think at the scene that coincided with what the defendant had said and what had been omitted from Peele's confession, so that I don't know why you had to... it seems to me that is by far the more persuasive impeachment of the two.

   Argument of Joshua Ira Schwartz
speaker="joshua_ira_schwartz" startTime="1184.616" stopTime="1334.884">
    Mr. Joshua Ira Schwartz 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In view of the United States, the decision of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals represents a misapplication of the doctrine of this Court's decision in Bruton v. United States. 
    Contrary to the argument of respondent, this Court's decision in Bruton does not hold that the reception in evidence for any purpose of the inculpatory statement of a nontestifying accomplice necessarily violates the confrontation clause, nor does it hold that instructions that limit the use of such a statement are in all cases ineffective. 
    Rather, as we understand it, the Court held that in light of the inadmissibility of the hearsay statement incriminating Bruton in that case, the critical weight added to the prosecution's case by the declarant statement there and the general availability of separate trials as a device to avoid the problem that existed in Bruton, there was no sufficient justification for running the risk that the limiting instruction given in Bruton would prove an insufficient bulwark against the risk of unfair prejudice that would result if the instruction were disregarded. 
    This case differs from Bruton in numerous critical respects which we believe call for a different conclusion here and require that the judgment of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals be reversed. 
    Bruton emphasizes the inadmissibility under the traditional rules of evidence as against the Defendant Bruton of the declarant's out of court statement. 
    Here, of course, the declarant Peele's statement was admissible against respondent for a proper purpose, and there doesn't really seem to be any debate that the state had a legitimate objective here and it was one that we deem compelling. 
    That purpose, of course, was to enable the jury to assess the respondent's claim that his own statement was a coerced imitation of the declarant's, and we agree with the state's argument that the very best evidence available to the jury to assess that claim was to look at the statement itself. 
    This is partly, Justice Stevens, because of the fact that... I think it would naturally occur to a juror that the best way is to look at the two statements side by side to see what all the nuances are, and while it may have been sufficient, I might well... we as jurors might well have been persuaded by the omissions factor, a juror in assessing this claim I think would want to see the whole thing, and I think it was an important kind of evidence.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1334.884" stopTime="1348.192">
    Justice Stevens 
    But isn't the argument also available that the burden really was on the defendant to prove his parroting claim? 
    I mean, he's the one who brought it up, and I would suppose if there were merit to it, he would have been the one to put the confession in.
speaker="joshua_ira_schwartz" startTime="1348.192" stopTime="1404.540">
    Mr. Joshua Ira Schwartz 
    Well, this case has a peculiar fact in that regard. 
    The defendant did attempt to do that and failed in doing so on the grounds that the statement was hearsay. 
    At the point in the case where that occurred, it may have been premature, but the defendant did signal his own understanding that this was the most appropriate way to prove his claim by attempting to get the statement before the court. 
    So it probably does not lie terribly well in the respondent's mouth to say that this is an inappropriate way of demonstrating this. 
    The other factor which, if I can pick up further on your colloquy with the Attorney General, if the sheriff had simply denied, as he did, that these particular facts were in Peele's statement, there would of course have been the question of whether that was true. 
    Now, you said, Justice Stevens--

    Well, I am suggesting have the confession in the courtroom so that the defendant then would have had the opportunity to show he was lying.

    I'm not suggesting it would have to go to the jury. 
    If the officer says A, B, and C are in one statement and not the other, and they are both sitting here in the courtroom and nobody submits them to the jury, that testimony is pretty persuasive.

    Mr. Joshua Ira Schwartz 
    On the question which was the only question material to the state's purpose in putting the statement before the jury on rebuttal, whether the declarant had actually made the statement, the purpose and requirements of the confrontation clause were satisfied, Sheriff Papantoniou, through whose testimony the statement was put before the jury initially, was available for cross examination. 
    This Court's decision in Dutton v. Evans establishes, we believe, that there is no, in those circumstances, there is no confrontation clause problem, and we believe that that conclusion is supported not only by the opinion for the plurality of Justice Stewart, but also by Justice Harlan's concurring opinion, and therefore was endorsed by a majority of the Court in Dutton. 
    Conversely, we would emphasize, the state's purpose in laying the declarant's statement before the jury could not have been served by presenting the declarant's testimony in lieu of his statement. 
    Because of this unique situation that the live testimony wouldn't have served the state's purpose and the statement did not go to the... was not offered for the truth of its content, it would have been very peculiar to impose upon the state as respondent would have it and as the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals had it, the burden of calling the declarant as a witness simply so that respondent could cross examine him on matters outside of the scope of the state's case. 
    Indeed, if one accept's the respondent's premise, one might well ask what examination the state was required to undertake of Mr. Peele.

    --If the purpose... if the defendant's purpose was to be able to examine Mr. Peele, that purpose could have been fully satisfied. 
    The Court's decision in Ohio v. Roberts makes it clear that whether it is billed cross examination or direct examination, a person who is physically available, as Peele certainly was... his location was known to all. 
    He was conveniently located in the county jail... could have been called as a defense witness and there is no question that whether it is called direct or cross examination, he could have been examined on the topics that were of interest to the respondent. 
    It makes practical sense, we would submit, to leave this choice in this situation to the respondent because it is the respondent who wants to examine the declarant on subjects that are outside the scope of the state's case.

    Mr. Joshua Ira Schwartz 
    --No doubt the respondent would have preferred not to have that statement in, but we do not believe the law affords him the choice of saying that his... of testifying that his was a coerced imitation of Peele's confession and still not having the jury have a look at that statement. 
    If respondent believed that it would be in his interest to call the declarant as a witness, and he deemed unacceptable the risk that the court's limiting instruction would confine the jury properly, he was free to call the declarant as a witness, and he was fully able to fulfill any legitimate confrontation objective by that process. 
    Of course, as we said, the respondent was equally available to the respondent situated in the county jail. 
    If the respondent... if the declarant... if the respondent had called the declarant, there are several possibilities. 
    The declarant might have reiterated his confession, as this court's decision in Nelson v. O'Neill points out. 
    That surely would not have put the respondent in a better position. 
    It is possible that he would have disavowed the confession. 
    This would have helped the defendant in some sense, but if the defendant thought that would occur, it is not clear to us why that could not have been done. 
    It clearly could have been done as part of the defense case. 
    And finally, it is possible that the declarant would have taken the Fifth Amendment and would have been unavailable. 
    And if that were to have occurred, it would be a very extreme result and nonetheless hold that even if that had occurred, there would have been no opportunity for the state to use the statement. 
    The final point that I would like to comment on if time allows concerns the bearing of this Court's decision in Parker v. Randolph on this case. 
    The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals thought that Parker v. Randolph had no bearing because this case did not involve a joint trial. 
    In that respect we believe that the Court of Criminal Appeals got the matter precisely backwards, as is detailed in our brief.

    Mr. Lance J. Rogers 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves the question how to accommodate two valid competing interests. 
    On the one hand we have the state's interest in impeaching a testifying defendant, and on the other hand we have the defendant's interest in preserving his confrontation rights-- 
    It is our position that both parties here had an interest in the confession of Clifford Peele. 
    The state was interested in demonstrating that the two confessions were not identical, and the defense was interested in preserving Street's confrontation rights by making sure that those portions of the confession of Clifford Peele which directly accused Street of committing the crime charged, were not read to the jury. 
    Both of these purposes could have been served in this case if the state had simply redacted the portions which directly incriminated Street or abided by the original agreement--

    Then how can you redact the heart of your point?
speaker="lance_j_rogers" startTime="1932.997" stopTime="2039.255">
    Mr. Lance J. Rogers 
    --We can redact the part that accuses Joe Street of actually participating in the crime. 
    There were several differences in this case which the state deemed critical to their position, and I would like to demonstrate how. 
    They had called Sheriff Papantoniou to the stand to read Peele's confession and then engaged in an agreement with the defense to merely highlight the differences. 
    That is, in response to the questions from the prosecutor, they would highlight the differences between the two confessions without reading all of Peele's confession to the jury. 
    In pursuit of this agreement, the Court instructed the sheriff to read the confession to himself, which he did, and at this point the prosecutor approached the bench and then requested permission to read the entire text into evidence. 
    The Court reminded him of the original agreement, but the prosecutor claimed it would be more coherent if he read the entire text into evidence. 
    He then read the entire text into evidence and then proceeded to do precisely what he said he could not do, and that is have Sheriff Papantonious highlight differences between the two of them in response to questioning without mentioning any of the portions of the confession which accused Joe Street of participating in the crime. 
    There were seven critical distinctions, and on closing argument, the prosecutor again went through those seven distinctions. 
    It is our position that the confrontation clause was violated once the state went beyond what was necessary to show that the two statements were not identical and that this violation was not cured either through limiting instructions or by simply labeling it non-hearsay.

    Mr. Lance J. Rogers 
    No, I don't believe it is, Justice O'Connor. 
    In Harris and Hass and that line of cases, the sword/shield cases, we engage in a balancing test, balancing the reason for the admission against the reason for the exclusion. 
    In those cases we exclude... evidence that was reliable and trustworthy was excluded and the truth was frustrated in order to deter police misconduct, in order to get them to comply with Miranda, but there was nothing wrong with the statements themselves. 
    They were not involuntary or coerced. 
    So the balancing test favored using the evidence to enhance the truth finding function of the trial. 
    In this case, though, Peele's statement was excluded precisely because it did constitute a threat to truth determination either under a hearsay analysis or confrontation analysis. 
    Under Bruton, the in-custody confession of an accomplice is inevitably suspect, and I think that makes the distinction between this case and the sword/shield cases.

    Mr. Lance J. Rogers 
    Well, at that point in the trial the state had given every indication that they were going to call Clifford Peele on direct examination, and so as a tactical matter, there was an interest in trying to diffuse what we thought would be his potentially incriminating, indeed, devastating testimony against Joe Street, and also to introduce it for whatever relevance it would have on the parroting point. 
    At a minimum, though, our position there is no more inconsistent than that of the state because the state objected at that point to introduction of that statement. 
    It is our position that to the jury, that the impeachment value of Clifford Peele's confession was not that the two statements were not identical, but rather, that it rebutted Joe Street's alibi defense by placing him at the scene of the crime and assigning him an active role in the murder. 
    There was no physical evidence linking Joe Street to the crime, and there were no eye witnesses presented by the state. 
    Peele's confession, however, provided the state with its missing eye witness testimony free of the risk of cross examination and free of the risk of the jury viewing his demeanor. 
    We believe also that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals properly interpreted the interlocking confession doctrine by holding that it does not apply to severed trials. 
    At joint trial the state has a compelling interest in introducing the confessions of the codefendants. 
    The state is presented with a dilemma. 
    They have two or maybe even three perfectly valid confessions which they wish to introduce against the confessers, but under a rigid Bruton application, they are prohibited from introducing those confessions against the confessers. 
    Parker and the similar interlocking confession cases allows them to introduce the confessions against the confessers, but they had already accomplished that purpose in this case, and we feel that that is a distinction. 
    We also believe that this Court should decline to reverse pursuant to the doctrine of harmless error. 
    The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals concluded, after examining the record, that they could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the confrontation violation here had no effect on the verdict or that the evidence of guilt was otherwise overwhelming. 
    They could not say that the jury would have returned the same verdict without Clifford Peele's confession. 
    Other than Joe Street's own recanted confession, there was no physical evidence or eye witnesses presented by the state.

    It is our position that Peele's confession provided the state with its missing eye witness testimony and that it also provided the jury with all the requisite elements of the homicide had they chosen to believe that Joe Street's confession was involuntary. 
    Getting back to my original point, I think this really is a simple case requiring the accommodation of two valid competing interests, the state's interest in showing that the two confessions were not identical, and the defense interest in keeping out those portions of the confession which directly accuse Joe Street of committing the crime charged. 
    Both purposes could have been satisfied by either redacting the statement or abiding by the original agreement to merely have the sheriff highlight those seven differences which the state demonstrated that they could well do, and they demonstrated again in closing argument when they highlighted the seven differences again for the jury without referring to any of the portions of Clifford Peele's confession which incriminated the respondent.

    Mr. Lance J. Rogers 
    I think that there they could look to either the federal or state constitution on the issue, but when there is a confrontation problem involved, I think it is important to look at the balancing and competing interests precisely because of the reasons, when I responded to Justice O'Connor's question regarding the sword/shield cases. 
    You need that balancing, the reasons for the admission versus the reasons for the exclusion, and if they can accomplish it in this case without referring to those portions that directly accuse him of committing the crime charged, I think we should weight that on balance. 
    It is our position that the confession of Clifford Peele devastated the case for the respondent. 
    He presented an alibi defense with 13 witnesses in support of that alibi defense. 
    He took the stand and asserted that alibi defense and presented a plausible explanation for his own confession. 
    The state presented no physical evidence, presented no eye witnesses against Joe Street. 
    All they had was his own recanted confession. 
    Except for Clifford Peele, reading his confession not only was unnecessary but provided the state with its missing eye witness testimony.

    Justice Stevens 
    Is that entirely correct? 
    Isn't it true... now, maybe my recollection is wrong, but there were some things in his statement that were corroborated by physical evidence at the scene. 
    Is that wrong?

    Mr. Lance J. Rogers 
    Well, yes, I think items like that, but I meant there weren't... there were extensive tests, hair, fingerprints, things like that, and none of these were found in this case. 
    We respectfully request that this Court affirm the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.
