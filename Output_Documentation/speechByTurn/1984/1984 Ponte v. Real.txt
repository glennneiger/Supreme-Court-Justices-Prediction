    Mr. Martin E. Levin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this case presents a relatively narrow issue, and that is whether Chapter 103 of the Code of Massachsetts Regulations, Section 430.14 fails to satisfy the due process clause because it does not require a Prison Disciplinary Board to state its reasons in the record for denying an inmate's request for witnesses at his disciplinary hearing. 
    I will argue that the regulation wholly comports with due process, and that imposing the additional procedural requirement of a statement of reasons imposes unjustified burdens on the prison administration. 
    I will also address the issue of mootness that has been raised by the Respondent.

speaker="martin_e_levin" startTime="125.035" stopTime="257.482">
    Mr. Martin E. Levin 
    Correct, Your Honor. 
    The Massachusetts Department of Correction has adopted regulations governing the procedures used at prison disciplinary hearings which track, virtually word for word, this Court's holding in Wolff v. McDonnell. 
    The particular regulation at issue here, Section 430.14, provides that an inmate does have a right to call witnesses at his disciplinary hearing except where that right conflicts with the prison official's interest in seeing that the hearing does not create undue hazards within the institution or otherwise undermine correctional goals. 
    The regulation further provides that in determining whether or not to allow an inmate's request for witnesses, the board is to consider such factors as relevance, necessity, the cumulative nature of the testimony to be given, and the hazards present in a particular case. 
    The regulation does not require the board to state its reasons or provide support in the record for its decision to deny an inmate's request for witnesses. 
    Of course, in Wolff v. McDonnell and again in Baxter v. Palmigiano, this Court rejected the notion that due process requires such a statement of reasons. 
    In this case, John real who was a prisoner at the maximum security institution in Massachusetts, was charged with three violations of the Massachusetts Code of Disciplinary Offenses. 
    Those charges stem from an incident in which Mr. Real, contrary to an order of a correctional officer named John Baleyko, entered an office within the prison in which Mr. Baleyko was attempting to stop another inmate's attack on another officer. 
    At his disciplinary hearing, Mr. Real requested that John Balayko, the reporting officer, the officer who authored the disciplinary report, be called as a witness. 
    Mr. Baleyko was called and he testified t the particulars of the offenses charged. 
    John Real also requested that two inmates be called as witnesses. 
    That request was denied and no reason for the denial appears in the administrative record. 
    The Disciplinary Board found that John--

    Mr. Martin E. Levin 
    Well, Your Honor, the reviewing court did, I believe, have the administrative record which reflected what was before the Prison Disciplinary Board during the prison disciplinary proceedings. 
    It's our position that, given the guidance of wholly proper procedures under these circumstances and the discretion of the board to properly deny witnesses, based on the factors that are laid out in those regulations, and the failure of Mr. Real to state any or make any showing that the board failed to follow those procedures, that it was wholly within the discretion of the board to make that determination, and that in fact at the hearing before the judge, there was no reason why correctional authorities had to come forward at that point with their reason.

    The inquiry also has to go to, as this Court considered in Wolff, to what kinds of risks would be involved in bringing that witness into the disciplinary hearing room. 
    Second, with respect to your answer about the individual case, certainly one can hypothesize situations in which a prison inmate could make allegations and prove through evidence that there was some systematic discrimination against him or some plot on the part of prison officials to set him up, and that this was part of an ongoing plot.

    Mr. Martin E. Levin 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I don't believe Hughes v. Roe is applicable in this case or provides much guidance. 
    In Hughes, of course, an inmate had alleged that he was placed into segregation without any prior hearing whatsoever, and this Court held that that was sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. 
    Under subsequent case law, Helms v. Hewitt, decided by this case, it was made plain that under these circumstances, a liberty interest might be implicated and an inmate might be entitled to a bearing. 
    That kind of a scenario is much... the scenario where an inmate may not have a hearing where liberty interest is implicated, may not have a hearing at all, we submit is quite distinct from the situation such as this where there is no question that Mr. Real received his hearing. 
    There is no indication that the Prison Disciplinary Board failed to follow what, on their face, were fully adequate procedures, and where this Court has indeed held that the prisoner doesn't have the right to have a statement of reasons, which is exactly the right that the Supreme Judicial Court held that he did have.

    No, Your Honor. 
    We don't contest that in the individual case, in a later judicial proceeding to review the action of prison officials, that where the prisoner makes out a prima facie case that he's been denied his procedural rights, that prison officials are going to have to answer that case as they would in any other habeas corpus case or a 1983 case. 
    Our position is merely that where a prisoner simply goes into court and says I didn't get a witness, under this court's ruling in Wolff that's not enough because, especially under these circumstances in Massachusetts where the procedures which prison officials follow are exactly those procedures prescribed in Wolff, the Prison Disciplinary Board has that very discretion to say you can request the witness but we can deny it, and we don't have to tell you why. 
    So that it seems anomalous, just as a matter of pleading, to have a prisoner go into court and say, well, it did exactly what they're entitled to do under the Constitution and under their regulations, but I want to know more, I want them to answer me more; I want them to justify themselves.

    Mr. Martin E. Levin 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, to resume with my response to Justice White's question, in fact what the Supreme Judicial Court did hold in this case is that the statement of reasons to be given is to be given in the administrative record at the disciplinary hearing. 
    Now, this Court has recently stated in Olim v. Wakinekona that procedures do not exist in a vacuum. 
    They are not to be valued in and of themselves, but they exist for a purpose, and that is to protect some substantive right; in this case, it's the inmate's substantive right or substantive liberty interest in statutory good time. 
    Furthermore, this Court has noted that in fashioning its procedural prescriptions, prescriptions required by the Constitution, it is concerned that government officials be guided by adequate procedures in the generality of cases, and not with whether, when guided by such procedures, officials make a decision with which a court might later disagree. 
    In this case, the procedure prescribed by the Supreme Judicial Court does not really bear any relation to these principles. 
    The procedural requirement of a statement of reasons is primarily focused on safeguarding, if you will, another procedural requirement; that is, the requirement of the right to call witnesses, that qualified right that this Court enunciated in Wolff v. McDonnell. 
    Furthermore, and equally as important, the impetus of the Supreme Judicial Court's decision was that it wanted a record that it could review basically on a case-by-case basis to decide whether or not it agreed with what prison officials were doing. 
    Such a holding is not warranted by the principles set forth by this Court in its due process, procedural due process cases.

    Mr. Martin E. Levin 
    Well, Your Honor, I'd have to page through the opinion to find the exact spot, but I am confident that even though they noted that there was no statement of reasons given, either at the hearing or later, the ruling was that the statement of reason should come at the point of the disciplinary hearing and not be what they considered to be a post hac rationalization. 
    They relied on Hayes II. 
    I forget just now whether that was Hayes v. Thompson or Hayes v. Walker, but the case that's referred to in both our brief and the Respondent's as Hayes II. 
    And in that case, in that very case, exactly what happened was that in accordance with this Court's ruling in Wolff, a Prison Disciplinary Board denied a request for witnesses. 
    There was little or no statement of reasons in the record. 
    The case before the trial court included evidence put in by prison officials upon which the trial court determined that there was no arbitrary deprivation of the right to call witnesses. 
    But in that case, the Seventh Circuit reversed, stating that we want this statement in the record.

    Mr. Martin E. Levin 
    Yes, Your Honor, and that's exactly the portion of the opinion to which I was just referring. 
    Our reading of that holding is that the Supreme Judicial Court held these regulations unconstitutional because they did not require a statement of reasons in the administrative record. 
    Now, we have noted in our brief several reasons why we're most concerned about this new requirement imposed by the Supreme Judicial Court, and I would just like to highlight this afternoon one or two of them. 
    The most serious cases, of course, are those cases in which the calling of a witness may create hazards within the institution because the witness may be subject to reprisal, generally by the charged inmate. 
    In such cases where we have a requirement, an across-the-board requirement of a statement of reasons, the Prison Disciplinary Board is basically put into the position of trying to guess how much it can put in the record, how much must it put in the record without running the very risk that it hopes to avoid by not calling the witness in the first place.

    Mr. Martin E. Levin 
    --No, no. 
    But to the extent that a record was required and that record went to the evidence on which the Board relied and the reasons for sanctions to he given, it's my reading that that was the record that would be available to the inmate. 
    Furthmore, we run into a problem where we have an across-the-board rule, and the only time the inmate can't know is when, in fact, there's a risk of reprisal. 
    Then the only time the inmate doesn't know is exactly... will lead to exactly the same result. 
    That is, the arousal of the suspicions in the inmate's mind which can lead to the physical retaliation that is trying to be avoided. 
    And we submit that in fact this requirement leads to exactly that position that the Respondent himself has suggested at page 32 of his brief. 
    That is, it puts prison officials in the position of making a decision between forgoing an otherwise proper and necessary disciplinary action within the institution or revealing sensitive information which can lead to harm within the institution. 
    Now, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not here to play the heavy, and we're not here to say the Constitution doesn't accompany these individuals once they step into the jailhouse door. 
    But we don't believe that this Court's ruling in Wolff or in Baxter or in the recent cases of Hudson v. Palmer or Block v. Rutherford or Hewitt v. Helm contemplate that the Constitution is going to require that prison officials be put in that kind of a position.

    Mr. Martin E. Levin 
    --There are certain drawbacks to that procedure which are inherent in the procedure in general. 
    One, in dealing with these cases, we wish to stress, as Judge Friendly said in his article, some kind of hearing that we're dealing with a system of mass justice, and that prison officials in Massachusetts, for example, in 1980 had almost 7,000 disciplinary proceedings at which prisoners were entitled to the full procedural safeguards, presumably as you suggested, which would include an extended record, although that record would be confidential. 
    Now, this may not seem like much in the context of any one disciplinary proceeding, but when you add this up you're talking about man hours and you're talking about resources that come out of other areas within the prison. 
    I see that my time is growing short, and I do want to address the issue of mootness because I promised that I would, and I don't want to break my promise. 
    During the disciplinary action involved in this case, Mr. Real was in the state prison on a three t five-year sentence for possession of a sawed-off shotgun. 
    In November of 1982, the Commissioner of Correction issued a certificate of discharge from that sentence and he made the discharge effective to July 19, 1982 because of certain recalculations in good time credit. 
    From that date, from the July 19th date, Mr. Real was deemed to have begun serving a five-year from and after sentence imposed for a manslaughter offense he committed while in prison, killing another inmate. 
    Now, the Respondent has suggested that this case is now moot because Mr. Real has received the certificate of discharge from the three to five-year sentence, that is, the sentence to which the good time at issue would apply. 
    But that's clearly not the case, because if this Court were to affirm the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court, returning the 150 days good time to Mr. Real, his effective date of discharge then becomes some time in February 1982. 
    The running of his five-year from and after sentence is from that date, and Mr. Real ceases to be in Massachusetts custody in February of 1987, rather than in July of 1987. 
    Mr. Real clearly has a concrete interest in this case which presents the Court with a justiciable controversy. 
    If I might, if there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve my remaining time. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Jonathan Shapiro
speaker="jonathan_shapiro" startTime="1816.061" stopTime="1952.989">
    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I'd like to first address some of the factual issues that were raised in Petitioner's argument. 
    First of all, this is a classic case where the calling of witnesses would be, as Justice Blackmun suggested, very important to the inmate's defense. 
    What had happened in the prison on the particular day in question was that a scuffle had broken out between an inmate and a guard. 
    A number of other inmates who were in the vicinity came into the room to see what was happening, after which they were ordered to leave. 
    It was at this point that Mr. Real, while leaving, was stopped, according to his testimony at the hearing, was stopped by another officer who shook him down and delayed him from complying with the order that had been given to him. 
    The inmates which John Real requested be called in his defense were eye witnesses who would have corroborated his version of what happened, and therefore, in our view, would have given him a defense to the charge that he had disobeyed an officer and also the charges, in addition, that he had incited to riot and that he had engaged in conduct which was disruptive of the orderly running of the institution. 
    All three of these charges were made against Mr. Real, and all three of them were at issue in the disciplinary hearing. 
    And the witnesses that Mr. Real requested be called and which the record below indicates were requested because they had been present and because they would corroborate his version of what happened, were the witnesses who were denied without any explanation at any point in either the administrative or the judicial proceedings of this case. 
    We think there are two issues involved in the case.

    It is clear, we think in the record below, that the request was timely made to the Disciplinary Board, and that both in the form which the inmate was required to fill out, he sufficiently indicated the reasons for those witnesses to be present by indicating they were eye witnesses. 
    And he also, in the court proceeding which followed the filing of his petition for habeas corpus, he indicated why these witnesses were to be called in his defense. 
    In both of these proceedings, the witnesses were denied without any explanation.

    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    I think the Supreme Judicial Court did certainly find that persuasive. 
    However, as Justice Stevens has suggested, I don't think that the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court rests solely on that around. 
    We think that the court considered both of the issues; that is, whether in fact there was an arbitrary deprivation and secondly, whether due process requires that there be some support in the administrative record. 
    And on page 22 of the petition for certiorari, the Supreme Judicial Court says, in concluding its discussion of this issue: 
    "The trial judge properly concluded that the sanctions resulting from a constitutionally flawed disciplinary hearing were invalid and correctly ordered the return of Real's good time credits. " 
    Well, the trial judge concluded only that the witnesses had been denied arbitrarily, without any consideration or discussion of the statement of reason.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2291.933" stopTime="2306.142">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    --Would it have satisfied your position if the reason given was that it would expose these witnesses to reprisals either by the individual or by his friends?
speaker="jonathan_shapiro" startTime="2306.142" stopTime="2408.180">
    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    I think, unquestionably, that would provide, depending on the facts of the case, a legitimate justification for a limitation of the right to call witnesses. 
    And had the Commonwealth made such a submission, I think that it would have, and I think it's clear from the trial court's ruling that he would have accepted that. 
    The trial judge, as the record of the hearing before the trial judge indicates, was upset that the State and the prison officials had made no attempt whatsoever to justify the denial of witnesses. 
    He said all they have to do is come in here and tell us why the witnesses were denied, but they didn't do so. 
    And I think it's that conclusion by the trial judge that, in the face of a showing by the inmate that witnesses had been requested, were relevant, that a timely request had been made, and that nothing else appeared on the face of the record to justify a denial of those witnesses, at least in those circumstances the burden shifts to the prison officials to come forward and make some showing. 
    This is not to say that the prison officials would bear the burden of proof on that issue; only that they should come forward with some explanation of why the witnesses were denied, at which time the burden would then remain with the inmate to establish either that those reasons were arbitrary or not legitimate.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2408.180" stopTime="2422.600">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Would it be appropriate for the regulations to provide that in order to have that right, the inmate must tender or proffer a statement of what the witnesses, each of the witnesses would say if they were called?
speaker="jonathan_shapiro" startTime="2422.600" stopTime="2430.965">
    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    I think the regulations could properly require such a statement. 
    We think in this case, the inmate did make such a showing.

    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    That's correct. 
    And the inmate himself did not challenge the constitutionality of the regulations. 
    So we see there are two issues in the case; one, whether or not due process is violated by the arbitrary denial by the prison officials of the witnesses on the facts of this case; and the second broader issue, which is the issue as to whether due process requires that the administrative record of a disciplinary hearing contain a basis for the denial of witnesses. 
    And we think they are both separate, yet both presented. 
    The second, broader one, we think is unnecessary to be decided by this Court, because I think the case can properly decided on--

    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    And also earlier in the opinion, the portion of the opinion referred to by Justice Stevens on page 16, where the court in defining the issue presented, indicates that the question is whether federal due process requirements impose a duty on the Board to explain in any fashion at the hearing or later, why witnesses were not allowed to testify. 
    So we think both issues were properly presented, and at least implicitly properly considered. 
    However, we think that the Respondent may defend the judgment below on any ground that's properly presented by the law and the record, regardless of whether either of the courts below considered both of those issues specifically. 
    So that even if the Supreme Judicial Court's reasoning was based on the broader issue, if that rationale is not necessary for a decision of the case by this Court, which we don't think it is, it would be unnecessary for this Court to decide that issue. 
    We think that the principle of judicial restraint counsels in favor of deciding the narrower, rather than the broader issue. 
    And since the narrower issue, that is, the arbitrariness of the denial of the witnesses on the facts of this case, was properly presented, provided the basis for the decision by the trial court, that that can properly be the basis for a decision by this Court. 
    On that issue, furthermore, we think that the Commonwealth, in effect, concedes that judicial review is appropriate where the inmate has made a prima facie case. 
    Judicial review, in a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, at which point when the inmate has made that prima facie case, the prison officials would have some burden to justify the denial of witnesses. 
    In this case, we think that a prima facie case was made, and it is difficult to see what more an inmate could be required to do than to make a timely request for relevant witnesses who could testify and in this case provide a basis for a self defense claim. 
    The Petitioner's argument that there is a greater burden defies common sense, and it also would make that burden impossible to be met by the inmate. 
    It's difficult to see how the inmate could disprove the reasons that the prison officials may have for not calling a witness if the inmate can't even find out what those reasons are. 
    The Petitioner argues that somehow the inmate has a greater burden to go beyond making a showing of relevance to his or her case, and to in fact disprove any possible reasons the Commonwealth might have for not calling the witnesses.

speaker="jonathan_shapiro" startTime="2783.786" stopTime="3306.931">
    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    We think that where the Commonwealth makes a showing that that is a consideration in the case, that would be appropriate. 
    Indeed, it would be appropriate, turning for a moment to the question of requiring some statement of reason or other basis to appear in the administrative record for a similar requirement, and we have referred in our brief to the regulations of the Federal Bureau of Prisons which provides just for such a possibility. 
    And in a case where the Disciplinary Board concludes that documenting the reliability of an informant upon which it has relied in a decision would pose a threat to identifying that informant or otherwise endangering that informant, the Disciplinary Board of the chairperson of the Disciplinary Board may document those reasons, but not provide them to the inmate: that is, to keep them apart from the inmate for the very purpose of a subsequent justification in court, at which time the reasons could be examined or the statement could be examined in camera. 
    So that the only serious claim that the Commonwealth has made here that a statement of reasons would interfere with security or endanger the identify of an informant, there is a perfectly reasonable alternative which could be utilized so that those reasons would not prejudice the particular informant involved. 
    The other argument that Petitioner makes to justify the prison officials in not having to make any showing, either at the administrative hearing or otherwise, is that an inmate's right to present witnesses is not violated unless there is a pattern or practice or a discrimination by the Disciplinary Board or the prison officials which go beyond the individual case. 
    We think in Wolff v. McDonnell, this Court clearly stated that a witness has... an inmate has a right to call witnesses unless the witnesses would be irrelevant, cumulative, unnecessary, or pose a threat to institutional security in some other way. 
    The argument that somehow the inmate could be denied witnesses arbitrarily, so long as there was no overt discrimination or pattern in practice, is simply inconsistent with Wolff, and is unrelated to the reasons for according an inmate that right to call witnesses, which is to give that individual an opportunity to have a fair hearing on the charges against that particular inmate. 
    And why, in order to establish that that right has been violated, that inmate would have to show that there is some pattern in practice, escapes me, and I think finds no support whatsoever in any of the cases this Court has decided. 
    The Commonwealth's argument would also carry the principle of deference to the expert judgment of prison officials too far. 
    What the Commonwealth, in effect, is arguing is that the officials should be presumed to have made a decision to deny witnesses in accordance with applicable regulations, and that any inquiry into the basis for that refusal is unwarranted. 
    It's one thing to defer where prison officials have exercised a judgment; it's another thing to defer to the presumption that they have exercised a judgment in accordance with applicable regulations. 
    And the effect of the decisions of the court below is primarily to require that that discretion by prison officials, to which this Court has often deferred, is in fact actually exercised. 
    Without some obligation, either in the administrative hearing or in court, to justify their action, there is in fact no right to call witnesses on behalf of the inmate. 
    And there is no properly exercised discretion to which a court could defer. 
    So in many ways, the requirements of the courts below would serve the interests of both the Commonwealth and the inmate by insuring that the officials to whom discretion is accorded have, in fact, exercised it. 
    Once there is that exercise, a court could properly, as this Court has often counseled, defer to the discretion because of the expertise which may have been possessed by the officials who exercised it. 
    We do think that Hughes v. Roe is or should be dispositive of the case, because in Hughes the inmate was held to have made a prima facie showing that he was entitled to a hearing. 
    And the prison officials, as in the present case, made no response, made no showing as to any legitimate basis in administration for correctional goals for denying that hearing, and this Court said in the absence of such a showing, the inmate was entitled to relief; or at least in that case, because it involved a complaint, that the complaint should not be dismissed. 
    The same principle we think is applicable here where, as we argue, the prima facie case is made where the prison officials in court make no showing of a legitimate basis for not according that right of the inmate to call witnesses. 
    Then, that inmate should be entitled to relief. 
    With respect to the decision of the court below on the issue of whether or not due process requires that the administrative record of a disciplinary hearing have some support for the decision to deny witnesses, I'd like to emphasize first that that decision is not inconsistent with Wolff. 
    In Wolff, this Court stated that an inmate has a right to call witnesses, which may be denied if there are certain legitimate considerations involved. 
    The Court went on to say that although it would be useful for the Board to give an explanation of its reasons and make a written statement of those reasons in the record, at that time the Court deemed it unnecessary to require that. 
    The Supreme Judicial Court's decision, first of all, does not require a written statement of reason. 
    What it does require is that there be some support in the administrative record. 
    That requirement is a far more flexible requirement than a written statement of reasons. 
    That requirement can be satisfied by reviewing the record to determine whether the record itself supports a decision to deny witnesses; for example, if the request of the inmate himself or herself indicates that the witnesses would not be relevant to the proceeding. 
    For example, the charge may be such that it's clear that no witnesses could appropriately testify in the case. 
    The Board, at a later review in court, could rely upon that information which is obvious from a review of the record itself to deny.

    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    I don't think it would be coincidental. 
    I think that in, if not the majority of the cases, many cases, reviewing the record of an administrative hearing will indicate what the issues were in the case, why the witnesses were called, and why they were denied. 
    So that although there may be cases where a statement of reasons or some explanation by the Board is required, we think that there are many other cases where the record itself will, upon review, provide an adequate basis for a decision by the Board.

    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    Very often the description of the offense in the disciplinary report is more than necessary to indicate what the case is about and what the evidence is likely to be. 
    The decision of the Board in which the Board sets forth, as this Court required in Wolff, a statement of the evidence that's relied on, often gives enough information. 
    It's true that in many cases it may be coincidental. 
    In other cases it may be necessary for the Board to give a reason in order to justify the denial of witnesses, particularly in those cases where the basis upon which the Board is denying a witness, such as institutional security, is the kind of reason which is peculiarly within the knowledge of the Board.

    Mr. Jonathan Shapiro 
    I think to the extent that Wolff recognizes a right to call witnesses, that right, in order to be meaningful, it's implicit that there has to be at least a limited judicial review. 
    We suggest that a limited judicial review which is appropriate is a review for arbitrariness.
