    Mr. Wood Brown, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is the case of Herb's Welding versus Gray. 
    It is a case involving the coverage under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act to workmen on fixed platforms in inshore Louisiana waters. 
    Our position is that Congress did not provide for the coverage of this particular class of claimant, and that there is no justification for extending coverage to him and those like him. 
    The facts are stated in the Court of Appeals opinion. 
    The person was working as a welder on an oil production platform within the three-mile limit offshore Louisiana. 
    There was a gas explosion. 
    He was injured while he was welding. 
    From the record, we find that he did nothing on this work... on this platform except to weld, and he welded generally on everything, including gas lines, gradings, railings, and things like that. 
    The record establishes that he was doing some welding on a gas lift line and at one place in the record, and a gas flow line in the other. 
    That is significant because a lift line has absolutely nothing to do with transportation of the gas; a gas flow line conceivably could. 
    The question here, Your Honors, is not situs. 
    In other words, in a Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act case, the Court has considered both situs and status. 
    We concede that if this person is found to be a maritime worker, that the platform itself is a place where this particular type of work is performed, and therefore situs would exist. 
    The question in the case is status. 
    In saying that, I have to start off by saying that there is really nothing maritime in the traditional sense about this type of platform. 
    I would like first to get into the concepts and the differences between the opponents and the applicants with respect to the details in the litigation. 
    I suggest to the Court that the case here, the decision in this case is controlled by the Court's previous decision in Rodrigue versus Aetna Casualty and Surety Company. 
    The opponents take the position that Rodrigue was a jurisdictional case. 
    I suggest that it is not. 
    I suggest that at that particular point makes no difference, because in Rodrigue this Court clearly decided that platform oilfield labor was no different from labor in the oilfields on land or anywhere else. 
    In other words, the type of work that this guy was doing at the time he was hurt is no different from oilfield labor anywhere else, either offshore on the Outer Continental Shelf, on the platforms inshore, or in Wyoming.

    The State of Louisiana thinks, and I have called the Department of Natural Resources, they think that there are 20,000 workers working on inshore platforms. 
    They think there are 800 platforms offshore Louisiana, and 200 platforms offshore Texas. 
    The Department of the Interior, I called them. 
    There is no hard facts on these.

    No question about them. 
    They are covered because of the specific act of Congress which says they are covered. 
    Now, in reviewing those acts, Justice, keep in mind that there was a change in the text of the OCSLA in 1978, but if you go to the legislative history, it says that they didn't intend to change this particular doctrine or this particular application.

    Mr. Wood Brown, III 
    I don't believe that those amendments... I have read them carefully, and I don't believe those amendments have anything to do with the issues before the Court in this case. 
    Now, it did address another opinion of this Court, and we are going to... probably one of us is going to be back in front of you as to whether it is retroactive or not. 
    I don't have any opinion on that point at this point, because I haven't researched it. 
    I don't know that. 
    Returning to the Rodrigue decision, Your Honors, if you read through the opinion itself, it is manifest that the Court's decision in Rodrigue was based on what it felt Congress had intended, but it justified Congress's intention on innumerable places throughout the opinion by references to this particular type of work as not being maritime or admiralty type work. 
    And if you look specifically at the comment on Page 360 of the Court's opinion, it said that the accidents in Rodrigue and Dory, which were the two cases before the Court at that time, the Court uses the word, this is not 
    "the ordinary stuff of the admiralty. " 
    In other words, this type of work is not the type of thing that you usually think of when you think of a maritime setting. 
    Now, of course, there is no question that the Rodrigue case involved a platform three miles out, so this guy with respect to his claim under some compensation Act would have been covered under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Act because of OCSLA. 
    There is no question about that. 
    But when the Court talks about his work being nonmaritime, there is no difference between the type of work that... the wire line work that was being done in Dory and Rodrigue and the wire line work that is done inside the three mile limit. 
    So that if the work that is done... described in Rodrigue and Dory is nonmaritime because it is nonmaritime, then it is nonmaritime because it is inshore as well as offshore.

    Well, Your Honor, perhaps this is not the case, because the facts don't support it, but perhaps you are going to have to write us a postcript to Director versus Perini, because that particular thing is left over. 
    In other words, that is a matter, I think, for future litigation, whether a person who is strictly... in other words, he uses the boat strictly as a taxicab. 
    Is he covered as a result of an injury which occurs while he is using that boat as a taxicab. 
    I don't think Director versus Perini goes quite that far, although it may.

    Mr. Wood Brown, III 
    The question to be answered is whether or not this Court agrees with what the Fifth Circuit said in Pippin versus Shell, Pudrough versus American Workover, and Thornton versus Brown and Foot, all of which are cited, and that is whether or not there is any support in the jurisprudence or otherwise for the proposition that oilfield work is inherently maritime. 
    If you go back to Pippin and Budrough, you will find that that was one of the rationales of the Fifth Circuit's decision. 
    They held first that there was coverage because there was coverage pre-1972, yet there was also coverage because oil field work is inherently maritime. 
    I was counsel in the Budrough case. 
    I brought that case to this Court. 
    It was pending when the Director versus Perini was decided, and of course once this Court decided that there was coverage if there was coverage before 1972, then of course my writ got denied because it was unnecessary to consider the rest of the decision. 
    But that is before the Court this time, the question of whether or not oilfield work is inherently maritime, and I suggest to you that as previously stated in light of the Rodrigue decision, it is not so covered.

    Mr. Wood Brown, III 
    Well, the nature of the recovery is exactly the same as the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act when Mr. Gray was injured in 1972, the benefits were substantially less than the Longshoremen and Harbor Worker Act benefits. 
    I think they were like $85 a week. 
    The Louisiana Act at that point was in the process of amendment, and now the benefits are, while they are not as handsome as the benefits under the Longshoremen and Harbor Worker Act, they are close. 
    The provisions, the computation is the same. 
    The only difference is that the maximums under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Act are substantially greater than the maximums under the Louisiana Compensation Act, a difference of... I believe the last figure, the maximum under the Harbor Workers Act is a little over $350, and the maximum under the Louisiana Act is a little over $200.

    If he wins this case, the only thing currently at issue is whether or not we get some money back which we paid him in response to the BRB's decision, and his attorney would get paid, because we haven't paid the attorney's fees. 
    Those are the two things at issue in respect to Mr. Gray. 
    The larger issue is the nearly 150,000 workmen in this area that I defined before.

    No, ma'am, except that if the maritime worker is not... except that if a maritime worker is not... excuse me, an oilfield worker is not inherently maritime, then the underpinning of the Thornton case falls, too, because Thornton is the one that said... it postulated from Pippin and Budrough that an oilfield worker is maritime, and it said when you are building a platform where you are going to do this maritime work, that is maritime work. 
    So if this... if I am right in this case, and oilfield work is not maritime, then Thornton falls, too.

    Mr. Wood Brown, III 
    No, ma'am. 
    If this Court affirms what the Fifth Circuit did, then Thornton is a correct result. 
    Yes, ma'am. 
    That's right. 
    The second point that the opponents make is that there is this argument that a person should not be forced to walk in and out of coverage, and that there should not be checkered coverage. 
    I suggest to the Court that checkered coverage and walking in and out of coverage is a fact in the oilfield today. 
    It has been a fact since the oilfields started. 
    And it will be a fact regardless of what happens in this case, and that is so because these men who work on platforms and then move to a vessel, in other words, a roughneck who is working on a platform is not a seaman, he is a longshoreman and harbor worker if he is working more than three miles out. 
    If he goes out for his next seven-day hitch and gets assigned to a jackup rig five miles away, he is a seaman, and there is no question under those circumstances that he would have no right to be compensated under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act. 
    The gray area, of course, occurs when he moves back to the platform, because then if he has got a right of action and damages, he would take the position that he would still be a seaman, and the Fifth Circuit has looked with favor on that sort of contention in a number of cases. 
    But the point of the argument is that checkered coverage and walking in and out of coverage is a fact of life in the oilfield, and it always has been. 
    Congress, I suggest to the Court, has authorized or permitted that to continue when the Congress failed to pass the Tower bill, because the Tower bill would in fact have prevented that sort of thing from happening. 
    There has been a suggestion that somehow is hasn't.

    To focus the situs argument, Judge, we all know that where longshoring work is done and it is done on a wharf, on a wharf... get away from the platform business for a second... it is done on a wharf, that is a maritime situs, but not everybody on the wharf is covered by the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act because he is not doing maritime work. 
    For instance, if you put an oil well on the end of a wharf and drilled a well under it, those oilfield workers wouldn't be covered under the Harbor Workers Act simply because they were on a wharf. 
    That being so, they are not covered by this platform. 
    That is the point.

    Mr. Wood Brown, III 
    One other thing that I would like to mention. 
    There is an argument by Gray's counsel to the effect that somehow there is an extension of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. 
    I suggest to the Court that that is a meritless issue, because the Fifth Circuit had it before it and failed to reach it, and they reached coverage in this case because of their finding that the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act applied under its own force. 
    I suggest to you that you will not find any cases on point that deal with this particular issue. 
    There are, as I count them, four cases which talk about what the words "as a result of operations" mean, and all of those cases have to do with flights to and from the platform either on seaplanes or helicopters, and I think the result in those cases are correct.

    Perhaps you are referring to the status requirement that was imposed in connection with the expansion of coverage. 
    I think the Court established at least to a considerable extent in Perini that there was no intent to withdraw coverage, but that imposition of the status requirement was merely a way to limit the expansion that was... that took place under the situs requirement.

    --I would suggest not. 
    I suggest maybe the balance was struck in other parts of the statute, and that you shouldn't be concerned about striking your own balance here in that respect. 
    The question here is whether Congress in expanding the coverage meant to bring within the Act the sort of injury suffered by Mr. Gray in this case. 
    That is, an injury to an offshore oil worker, here a welder who happens to be at the time that there is injury on a fixed platform that rests in waters inside the three-mile boundary. 
    Now, Mr. Gray is the sort of worker who would have been walking in and out of coverage prior to 1972.

    Ms. Carolyn P Corwin 
    --Right, sometimes on navigable waters in the course of his employment, sometimes in these areas adjoining the waters, and I think you have in Mr. Gray a prime example of someone like that, and Mr. Brown himself has suggested that the entire offshore oil industry involves people who are walking in and out of different working situations, different locales, different sorts of structures. 
    So, I think Congress was faced in 1972 with a number of these sorts of situations, and it wanted to provide uniform coverage to solve that sort of anomaly. 
    I think here you have the sort of employee who presents precisely that anomaly. 
    Now, I think, Justice White, you asked earlier of Mr. Brown about the situation before 1972 for this particular individual. 
    Had he been injured on a fixed platform prior to 1972, it appears that he would not have been covered, because he would not have met the actual navigable waters requirement of the statute.

    Ms. Carolyn P Corwin 
    --Prior to 1972, the term maritime employment showed up only in the definition of employer, not employee, and it was an issue the courts rarely reached, because if something happened on navigable waters, it almost always turned out to be maritime in nature. 
    But I am suggesting that when you are talking about the term maritime, you don't necessarily go back to the Rodrigue case and say what did the court say about maritime there.

    Ms. Carolyn P Corwin 
    Well, I think those cases simply don't relate to what Congress was talking about in 1972 when it amended the Longshoremen's Act. 
    I think you have to look at what Congress might have had in mind at that point in terms of what it must have meant by maritime employment. 
    Now, we know that Congress was interested in solving this sort of anomaly of walking in and out of coverage in 1972. 
    The language that Congress used in amending the statute on its face is clearly broad enough to encompass someone in Mr. Gray's situation, and we suggest that even if it weren't crystal clear on the face, that the language ought to be read to cover a situation like this one in view of Congress's overarching purpose of solving this anomaly of walking in and out of coverage.

    Ms. Carolyn P Corwin 
    --Well, I suppose to some extent you can never completely solve the walking in and out of coverage problem, because coverage determinations under compensation systems by their nature are always going to have these fringe areas. 
    I think what Congress was trying to do in 1972 was to eliminate at least some of that anomaly to get rid of these rather obvious situations of the amphibious workers who in the course of their employment were regularly going back and forth. 
    I am sure that Congress knew that it couldn't precisely solve every last limit on this issue, but I think the intent was to go after this sort of anomaly to the extent they could do something practical about it. 
    Now, Justice O'Connor, you had raised the 1974 amendments, the ones that were signed by the President on Friday, I believe.

    Excuse me, the 1984 amendments. 
    They don't address this case. 
    Congress did suggest it realized that in using the term maritime employment in 1972 it had created some problems that had generated litigation. 
    It enacted some exemptions to the maritime employment definition, things it said it really didn't consider to be maritime. 
    It did not address the offshore oil industry. 
    There was a proposal to reverse the Thornton decision, the Fifth Circuit decision about fabrication on land of these offshore platforms. 
    Ultimately that was not enacted, so there is nothing in the bill.

    Ms. Carolyn P Corwin 
    Well that... that's so, although I think then you get into the question of whether they have correctly applied the substantial relationship test, and I think clearly as to the body of offshore oil workers that we're talking about in this case, there's really no question that they have properly applied that test. 
    But I don't think the '84 amendments really tell you much one way or the other about the case we have here. 
    Now this court has recognized that Congress in 1972 clearly intended to end this anomaly of walking in and out of coverage with respect to longshoremen and ship repair types, the people who are the more familiar sort of employees covered by the Act, but there were always other employees covered by the Act, including people like, of course, the construction worker in Perini, including people like Mr. Gray, who by necessity is on water part of the time as a regular part of his employment. 
    It is of necessity in the offshore oil industry because these structures are out in the middle of the ocean. 
    They are surrounded by water on four sides, and it is inevitable that in the course of performing duties, people are going to be going on and off the water. 
    We don't think there is a reason to think that Congress meant to eliminate the anomaly of walking in and out of coverage with respect to these more familiar longshoremen and ship repair people, but to leave the same sort of anomaly, the walking in and out of coverage, with respect to these other employees who have been found by the courts to be covered during part of their activity, while they were on actual navigable waters. 
    I think that is precisely the sort of thing Congress was trying to get away from in 1972. 
    Now, offshore oil workers like Mr. Gray are inherently amphibious, as I have said. 
    They are a far cry from the truck driver who comes from an inland point, who drops off his cargo in the terminal, and who goes back to the inland point. 
    Congress wanted to exclude those sorts of people when it used the status requirement, the maritime employment requirement... here we've got someone who is in a much different situation, who works constantly on or directly adjoining water virtually the whole time. 
    And I think it may be worth noting in response to Justice Powell's question about the Lousiana compensation statute, at the time Congress was considering this problem, it noted that the state compensation benefits were quite low, and I would point out that Lousiana in fact was the lowest of the examples that Congress set out in its report. 
    So if you're concerned about that sort of discrepancy, so was Congress. 
    By way of perspective, I think it is useful to take a minute to look at the pre-1972 situation of offshore oil workers. 
    Substantial categories of these workers were covered, as Justice O'Connor's questions have suggested, and I think it is worth noting that the suggestion in some of the briefs in this case, the amicus briefs, that somehow by finding coverage for Mr. Gray, the Court would be bringing a whole new industry within the Longshoremen's Act, is not so at all. 
    It is really inaccurate to say that. 
    Obviously, most directly, Congress had provided under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for coverage, so if you had an oilfield that spanned both sides of the three-mile line, the employer knew that he would be subject at least outside that three-mile boundary to the longshoremen's regime. 
    But you also had people who were inside the three-mile boundary. 
    You had the people on these movable rigs. 
    And some of these movable rigs, while they qualify as vessels, look very much like fixed rigs. 
    There are these jack up rigs that have legs that extend and retract, and they can sit right down on the seabed floor. 
    Those people, if they did not qualify as the longshoremen's scheme, and you would also have situations like that of Mr. Gray in which you had someone who was traveling between fixed platforms, and who would be covered if his injury was on actual navigable waters during that sort of travel. 
    And they would continue to be covered under the Perini haven't mentioned are those like that of Mr. Gray, who was injured while he was working on a fixed platform inside the three-mile limit. 
    He would be sort of an odd man out before 1972. 
    it probably wouldn't have been on actual navigable waters. 
    But his situation in which he was having to go back and forth on actual navigable waters and on the fixed platforms, and depending on the circumstances, possibly to a movable rig, and certainly to the Outer Continental Shelf, certainly suggests that Congress would have wanted to solve his situation. 
    Mr. Shelton of the Drilling Contractors Association testified before Congress when it was considering these amendments, and he said the same thing that Mr. Brown has said. 
    This is an area in which people are subject to job by job assignments. 
    You have workers going out to different structures. 
    The employers are confused because there is the series of compensation systems, and whether an employee is covered under one as opposed to the other may depend on what kind of structure he is on. 
    Extending coverage to a situation like this is clearly consistent with the sort of rationalization that Congress was attempting to achieve in 1972.

    Ms. Carolyn P Corwin 
    Well, since we are focusing on the status requirement here, I guess, maritime employment is the category that we have to define. 
    Now, I think the Court and Congress have recognized that that is a broader category than the enumerated occupations that follow it. 
    I think as a matter of common sense you would find this sort of employee to be maritime in the sense that these employees are always on the water or right next to the water. 
    Indeed, the whole industry has an intimate connection with the ocean, with the water, with the vessels that are used in a variety of operations. 
    So, I think, you know, if you are trying to think of what Congress might have thought when it used that term, sort of as a matter of common sense, you would think that. 
    In addition, you had people testifying before Congress about the Tower bill, and talking about marine petroleum workers and maritime extractive operations. 
    But I think if you go beyond that, you also look to the intent of Congress, and this question of the amphibious employee, and there I think the maritime employment is also in existence here.

    Well, not with respect to the statute that was finally enacted. 
    There was much talk during the hearings about the Tower bill, which was the proposal to bring all offshore oil industry workers within the statute, and that that would include the people who had qualified as seamen and who were entitled to the Jones Act remedy. 
    The people who wanted that Act characterized it in terms of needing to cut back on the Jones Act remedy to avoid the seamen member of the crew remedy. 
    The people who opposed the bill said, no, we want to retain that. 
    There wasn't that much focus on this other end of the spectrum of the--

    Ms. Carolyn P Corwin 
    --Well, I am not sure, I am not sure it was oversight, and the number 20,000 was used in the hearings, at least. 
    I think that Congress used a typical example when it was talking in the legislative history and the reports. 
    It used the example that people are familiar with of the longshoreman, who is sometimes on the boat and sometimes on the dock. 
    But I think that Congress was told in the course of these hearings by the drilling contractor representatives that a number of these offshore oil people were already covered under the Act. 
    I think it did not necessarily feel that it ought to enumerate each and every sort of employee. 
    I think we have to assume that Congress was aware that there were some other people out there other than longshoremen and ship repair people, but I don't think it is really unnatural for Congress to specifically refer to those more familiar types of employees, and to have assumed that it could sort of wrap up the others in this broader term.

    Well, I think to the extent we would rely on the legislative history, I would go back to the language in the reports in both Houses, in which Congress said, the purpose of this amendment is to provide a uniform compensation system for those employees who were covered for part of their activity under the old Act. 
    I think that in a nutshell really expresses what Congress intended then.

    He wouldn't have been covered in this particular fact circumstance when he was injured on a fixed drilling platform, but during the course of his employment there were a number of different situations in which he would be covered. 
    He would be covered when he was on the boat between fixed platforms, which he did sometimes several times a day. 
    If he were assigned to a drilling barge to do some welding on that he would clearly be covered, because he was on actual navigable waters. 
    He is covered when he is on the Outer Continental Shelf, which he was at least part of the time.

   Argument of T. Gerald Henderson
speaker="t_gerald_henderson" startTime="2968.882" stopTime="3250.516">
    Mr. T. Gerald Henderson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Robert Gray was injured, as has been noted, on a fixed gas and oil production platform located in the Bay Marshan Field, which is divided by the three-mile line separating Louisiana territorial waters from the OCS waters. 
    Gray estimated that approximately 25 percent of his work in the year preceding the accident had been conducted on the OCS, and a review of the map which was entered into evidence before the administrative proceeding indicated that the platform field is an interrelated field with gas operations covering waters that otherwise are not distinguished at all except for the line that runs through that. 
    In that regard, I think some of the figures that were given by Mr. Brown this morning, the number of workers, 20,000 workers, 60,000 nationwide, I would imagine that those aren't workers that are strictly in state waters. 
    Those are workers who work offshore. 
    And I would imagine that the overwhelming number of them are already covered under the Longshoremen's Act pursuant to the OCSLA provisions. 
    The workers also, like Gray, are moving in and out of coverage in these waters. 
    Gray could be on the OCS as easily as he could be in state territorial waters. 
    It has also been noted that Gray would have been covered had he been on the OCS through the Extension Act, that he would have been covered on transit through the oilfields, and that had he had work on a movable rig, he would have been covered. 
    But because of the combination of the injury in territorial waters and the fixed platform situs, the issue becomes a question about whether Gray is entitled to longshoremen's benefits. 
    In looking at status, it is necessary to examine the nature and purpose of Gray's activities, whether those activities have a significant connection to maritime navigation or commerce, and whether the purpose of the activities was to facilitate maritime commerce. 
    In Caputo, the Court noted that with respect to landward extension the language of the '72 amendments is broad, and suggests that the Court should take an expansive view of the extended coverage, as well as the focus on maritime connected nature and purpose of the job rather than the location also serves this particular purpose. 
    Focusing on Gray's work, the map introduced in evidence during the administrative proceedings depicts the number of platforms existing in both state and OCS waters, and Gray was responsible for welding maintenance work on all these platforms, and was required daily to travel among them in the performance of his duties. 
    On some days, he would have to travel to perhaps two or three or four platforms, and on other days he would have work duties on, for example, like the E structure of the platform where he was hurt. 
    He was on that for approximately three or four days. 
    But in any event, he would have to be transported back to the M structure, the Mike structure, where he was housed daily. 
    In addition to the regular and recurring travel by boat, Gray was required to board the structures, load and unload his equipment. 
    His work records document repair work that he did on swing ropes, which is the method by which one gets from a crew boat onto the structure. 
    He did repair work on boat bumpers, life raft launches, cranes, and decking. 
    But primarily he was responsible for maintaining and repairing and installing oil and gas lines connecting the Bay Marshan Field. 
    As noted by the court below, the maintenance of these lines is vital to the drilling and removal of gas and oil, and offshore oil and gas activity should be construed as maritime commerce because of its primary relationship with the sea. 
    It takes place on structures located in the sea. 
    It involves transportation across water. 
    And it of course poses hazards which are complicated by the maritime location. 
    Certainly Gray meets this test because his work activity is involved in each one of those requirements. 
    The test as formulated by the Fifth Circuit for land-based workers, drawing on the earlier Second Circuit case, is whether the work bore a realistically significant relationship to traditional maritime activity involving navigation and commerce on navigable waters.

    Mr. T. Gerald Henderson 
    --If he were injured on the fixed platform, that's correct, without the exception of OCSLA. 
    The Rodrigue case is not a maritime labor case, as has been argued here this morning. 
    It is no different. 
    I don't think there was any mention of labor in that particular case. 
    It was not in consideration of the kinds of maritime employment. 
    Of course, it was decided in 1969, prior to the 1972 amendments. 
    The Rodrigue case simply held that platforms were not vessels, and there was no discussion about what maritime employment was, but the argument that is brought here this morning is that because it occurred on a platform, hence it is not maritime employment, and I think what the petitioner does is the same theory that was brought before the Court by the employer in Pfeiffer versus Ford, where the employer attempted to build in another status or situs test on the issue of status, that is, whether there would be further geographical limitations in your consideration of whether an employee had status.

    I won't take the time, Judge. 
    I think that what the Court has to look at, and I think what is apparent in reading the Act and the cases which have arisen under the Act arising from... coming from this Court is that the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act deals essentially with vessel-related activity, and this is not a vessel-related case. 
    I think that takes this case out of the coverage under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act. 
    Justice White, you asked the question of whether there was any change in maritime employment in the 1972 Act. 
    The forthright answer is, no, sir, there was not. 
    They did not change that definition. 
    So the definition that this Court came down with before 1972 presumably still applies.

    Mr. Wood Brown, III 
    That's correct. 
    And counsel says that Mr. Gray was an odd man out. 
    Well, he was an odd man out before 1972, and if Congress wanted to take him out of the category of being an odd man out, Congress had the opportunity in 1972, and they had the opportunity again in 1984. 
    That doesn't really apply to this case, but there is no action by Congress in either case to take him out, and under those circumstances the failure to pass, whether it was conscious or just a refusal or somebody didn't get around to it, the failure to pass the Tower case is, I believe, significant. 
    If there is a problem with respect to this worker's coverage, Congress should correct it, I suggest, and Congress has that power, as this Court noted in Victory Carriers versus Law under Articles I and III of the Constitution to do so. 
    That is all I have.
