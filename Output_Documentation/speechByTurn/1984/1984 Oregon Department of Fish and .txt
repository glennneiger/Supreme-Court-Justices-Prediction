Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Indian Tribe
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="42.889">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next this morning in Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife against the Klamath Indian Tribe. 
    Mr. Attorney General, I think you may proceed when you are ready.
speaker="david_frohnmayer" startTime="42.889" stopTime="150.413">
    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the statement of Oregon appears before this Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    This case presents an opportunity to avoid an unwarranted conflict between important principles of Indian treaty law and the fundamental sovereign powers of states over public lands and their regulatory dominion. 
    That conflict would threaten important environmental and wildlife management policies of state and federal government. 
    The question is posed by the unambiguous language of a Congressionally ratified agreement. 
    That agreeded ceded reservation lands, and as all parties agree, diminished the physical size of the Klamath Indian Reservation. 
    In these circumstances, can tribal members nonetheless hunt and fish on the ceded land without observing state regulation which applies to all other Oregon citizens on that public land? 
    Language, authority, and logic, we believe, require a negative answer to this question. 
    The Ninth Circuit decision below ignores the act of Indian reservation diminishment, and the decision below also ignores the explicit treaty language which limits the right in question to the reservation itself. 
    We will argue today for a general rule consistent with the decisions of this Court. 
    That rule would provide that where the reservation boundaries are diminished, and where treaty rights are defined by the reservation area, those rights may only be exercised in the reduced area unless Congress specifies its intention to preserve them. 
    But on the contrary, if treaty hunting and fishing or other rights are not limited by the reservation boundaries, they remain unaffected by the diminishment unless the Congress clearly modifies and expresses its intent to reduce them.

speaker="david_frohnmayer" startTime="201.565" stopTime="233.566">
    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    I don't think so, and this anticipates an argument I would make in a moment, but I will reach it now, and that is that the language of the treaty is very careful to express that the hunting and fishing... or that the fishing rights are "within its limits", and then when it goes on in the same sentence to confer the gathering rights given to the tribe, those are also expressed as within the limits. 
    So, two different phrases within the same session which creates the rights also explicitly limit those rights to the boundaries of the reservation. 
    And if one looks to the purpose--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="233.566" stopTime="242.822">
    Justice O'Connor 
    Do you think the better reading of the treaty language then is to tie it irrevocably to the boundaries of the reservation?

speaker="david_frohnmayer" startTime="242.822" stopTime="358.937">
    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    --Yes, because it is a reservation... it is the creation of on reservation rights. 
    Now, when Congress at this time wanted to create rights which existed off an Indian reservation, it knew how to do so. 
    This Court in the classic case of Winans is a perfect example where fishing at the usual and accustomed places identifies geographic locations which may be removed from the meets and bounds of a specific reservation. 
    So, a treaty may create off-reservation rights, but these rights in the specific grant by Congress are unequivocally within the limits of the reservation, and that is part of what we think are the undisputed facts here, and let me touch them briefly. 
    In the 1864 treaty, the tribe ceded $20 million... or 20 million acres of aboriginal lands and received a reservation of some $1.9 million. 
    The language of sale of the aboriginal lands is clear. 
    The tribe ceded all their right, title, and claim. 
    And as I have mentioned in my answer to your question, Justice O'Connor, the treaty provided for exclusive fishing rights in the streams and lakes included in said reservation. 
    The gathering rights were also restricted within its limits. 
    The language was later construed by court decision to include hunting rights, but the treaty provides on its face and by no fair reading for any off-reservation rights. 
    Subsequently it was demonstrated that surveys erroneously had excluded some 621,000 acres from the tribal lands in the reservation, and other Poundary Commission proceedings and a new survey during which time the tribe was represented by independent legal counsel, it was agreed that the boundary dispute would be resolved. 
    The tribes agreed to cede to the United States those disputed 621,000 acres in exchange for approximately $533,000. 
    A 1969 Indian Claims Commission decision later awarded the Indians $4 million more for this to compensate for this transaction.

    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    In the Claims Commission, counsel for both parties agreed that they should be compensated at fair market value and at the highest and best use. 
    It was agreed by the parties in those Claims Commissions that the highest and best use was for timber and grazing, and that was the basis of the compensation. 
    The 1906 agreement which ratified the... the 1906 cession Act which ratified the bilateral agreement provided in Article 1, and this language is particularly important, that the Klamath Indians do 
    "hereby cede, surrender, grant, and convey to the United States. " 
    all their claim, right, title, and interest in and to the erroneously surveyed lands. 
    In its recitation of consideration, Article 2 of that same cession act provided that this was satisfaction 
    "in full of all claims and demands of said Klamath or other Indians arising or growing out of the erroneous survey. " 
    No express reservation was made in this 1906 Act for any residual hunting, fishing, or gathering rights on the ceded lands or indeed on any off-reservation areas. 
    The federal government immediately placed most of this land in Crater Lake National Park or in national forests. 
    The parties stipulated that the Indians continued to hunt, fish, and trap on the excluded lands without regard to state regulation, but also that they were unaware of any denial by the tribe that the state lacked this regulatory power, at least until proceedings were instituted in the instant case.

    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    The latter construction is probably correct, and of course the state was a stranger to the agreement between the United States government and the tribes. 
    The state has its regulatory authority by virtue of the joint agreement with the federal government which ordinarily asks states to manage lands and manage wildlife within the national forests in their boundaries. 
    And, of course, enforcement of game and fishing laws are a discretionary matter with the states, although we need to go somewhat beyond the record to amplify it. 
    In 1906, this was a very sparsely inhabited area in the state of Oregon.

    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    That is apparently so. 
    The stipulation speaks in terms of the parties being unaware of that extent. 
    The Ninth Circuit below affirmed the summary judgment for the tribe in its action to enjoin state regulation. 
    It found that these rights were not appurtenant to the property, and that they survived and were not inconsistent with the cession agreement. 
    We believe that the Ninth Circuit's decision has traveled on an unnecessary collision course with three massive obstacles. 
    The first of them is the stark and clear language of the 1864 treaty, which confines hunting and fishing rights to reservation boundaries. 
    The second is the unambiguous language of the cession agreement, which sold and ceded the land and thereby diminished the reservation boundaries. 
    The third analytical roadblock is the absence of any explicit regrant by Congress of a tribal right to hunt or fish on those ceded lands free of normal state regulation. 
    Let me now expand on those points. 
    The 1864 treaty provisions on hunting, fishing, and gathering rights specify the boundaries, and the operative words are "within said reservation" and "within its limits". 
    The treaty does not refer to aboriginal rights. 
    It does not refer to any off-reservation rights. 
    It does not, as some treaties of time time would have, refer to geographically undefined usual and accustomed places of fishing, such as were found in the Antoine--

    --because that was the highest and best use for the land, as agreed by counsel for both parties, the tribe and the United States. 
    That compensation was for the land area that was taken.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="854.345" stopTime="862.643">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    You were in the process of developing three points. 
    You had gone over the 1864 treaty language. 
    Now, what was the second one?
speaker="david_frohnmayer" startTime="862.643" stopTime="1008.466">
    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    Well, the language of the cession agreement, which is the language which is unambiguous. 
    When Congress wanted to preserve hunting and fishing rights in the ceded areas, it knew how to do so. 
    Page 28, Footnote 5 of our opening brief cites authority to this Court in which it was regarded at the time as the normal practice, that when the Congress of the United States wished the tribes to retain aboriginal hunting or fishing rights or earlier hunting and fishing rights within the area to be ceded, they knew how to do so and they said so, and that was something for which there was bargain and sale. 
    And so what we have is, the very silence of the cession agreement indicates that the language of it, which is precisely suited to effect a diminishment, as this Court found in De Coteau and in Footnote 22 of De Coteau where it cites additional treaties at the time. 
    The contemporaneous practice was perfectly clear to the Congress of the United States, and its intention to see that the reservation boundaries were diminished is, I think, unassailable. 
    Let me return to the question on which I had a colloquy with Justice Marshall a moment ago, because the tribe's position on compensation is anomalous. 
    Bear in mind that the fishing rights at issue here were exclusive fishing rights within the boundaries of the reservation. 
    The tribe has conceded, apparently without much argument, that it lost exclusivity of those fishing rights, and now seeks to say that because it was not compensated for what obviously is the far lesser value, if indeed there is any value at all in being subject to state regulation, that therefore that lack of compensation shows that Congress must not have intended to do what it did in the cession language, and that is to include everything in the sale. 
    We think the tribal argument is inconsistent, necessarily inconsistent by not complaining of the greater deprivation of the asserted right, and at the same time saying that the presence of the lesser deprivation without compensation therefore must mean that Congress must not have intended to include these rights because they were not included in the sale. 
    We think that when the argument is pursued, it falls of its own weight. 
    Tribes retain no beneficial interest, as this Court has found was sufficient in some cases, the Ash Sheep case, for example.

    May I just interrupt with one thought that is troubling me? 
    Your argument is that on the valuation point, omitting the hunting and fishing isn't significant because the timber and the grazing was the highest and best use for the land, and therefore an appropriate measure of use, and therefore you don't have to worry about other uses.

 May I just interrupt with one thought that is troubling me? 
 Your argument is that on the valuation point, omitting the hunting and fishing isn't significant because the timber and the grazing was the highest and best use for the land, and therefore an appropriate measure of use, and therefore you don't have to worry about other uses.

    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    And I will confess, Justice Stevens, that we are perplexed by that argument, because the question that must be posed to the tribe, it seems to me, is what kind of right is it that is being claimed if it is not a treaty right or if it is not an occupancy right? 
    The treaty gives two conceivable bases on which that right could be urged, the exclusive right to occupy the land or the fact that the treaty confers the right to fish, gather, and hunt within its limits. 
    But when both of those potential theoretical bases are destroyed by a cession agreement with respect to some part of the land, then what theoretical basis is left to assert that these are not--

speaker="david_frohnmayer" startTime="1090.182" stopTime="1236.509">
    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    --That's right. 
    In many treaties, or at least in some treaties which have reached this Court, it is clear that the treaty right to hunt and fish can not only not be within the boundaries of the reservation, but it can be on the Columbia River many miles, for example, from the Akima Tribe's reservation, and this Court has held that where those conditions exist, the treaty right is protected and is not appurtenant to the... but here, the only two bases on which we can find for the assertion of hunting and fishing right in the ceded area is either that they come from the right to occupy, which no longer exists, or from the treaty language creating the rights, which says within its limits and within said reservation. 
    But consider, if you will, this anomaly. 
    The western part of the ceded land lies squarely within the boundaries of Crater Lake National Park. 
    Congress has prohibited hunting altogether in national parks, and has required that fishing be done only with hooks, and yet by the reasoning that the tribe now urges on us, either the tribe has a right, because that was ceded land, to hunt and fish free of state regulation, or it does not, because the federal government can bar it. 
    So, not only have they started from an exclusive treaty right within the reservation, the right asserted now becomes one which is nonexclusive, nonuniform, because it apparently does not apply as against the federal government or private landowners, and can be exercised only to prohibit state regulation. 
    It is an anomalous right which is being asserted today, and one which analytically, I think, cannot be justified on the basis of the language and the law that is asserted to have created it. 
    It is for that reason that we believe that the very analysis scheme which the tribe urges today would cause this Court to unravel all tribal cession agreements since the creation of this nation unless the Congressional language in that cession agreement explicitly extinguished hunting and fishing rights on the ceded land. 
    We have yet to find a treaty that does so explicitly, and that presumably is one of the reasons which motivated this Court in the De Coteau decision to stay and to look to how unequivocal the language of bargain and sale is in the cession agreement to determine whether or not it was precisely suited to effect a diminishment. 
    In this case, we believe that it was.

    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    Yes, if this is not language of extinction of rights in and to the land, it is difficult to know what language would accomplish that objective unless it is the claim of the tribe that for everything that was of value to the tribe, there must be a specific inventory in the document of bargain and sale to give some valuation to that right or show that it was conveyed. 
    One good example of that, a right which was perhaps not important at the time except that we know that Crater Lake was a sacred place for the Klamath Tribe as it indeed is for anyone who witnesses it, but the western boundary of the claimed land was right on the rim of Crater Lake, of inestimable value now for recreational and aesthetic purposes. 
    There was no specific recitation in the cession agreement in 1906 putting a value on this land separate and apart from fair market value. 
    Is it to be said now, then, that because the cession agreement was silent with respect to particular items of valuation, that the language of bargain and sale of cession, of giving up all right, title, claim, and interest is to be regarded as ineffective as against that--

speaker="david_frohnmayer" startTime="1376.034" stopTime="1543.412">
    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    Ironically enough, the language in the 1906 agreement is almost identical to the language used in the DeCoteau Tribe agreement, which this Court found was precisely suited to effective diminishment of the boundaries of the reservation. 
    The tribe rests its argument so far as we can tell, other than on a somewhat self-contradictory theory of the origin of these rights, on Article 4 of the cession agreement. 
    We believe that they have misconstrued Article 4. 
    Article 4, by its terms, is a savings clause. 
    It grants no new rights. 
    It is typical of boilerplate language used in tribal agreements of that period. 
    In reading that clause to grant off-reservation hunting and fishing rights would by its terms be inconsistent with the treaty language that establishes those rights within the reservation. 
    Bear in mind the purpose of Article 4 is to keep the 1864 treaty and the 1906 cession consistent with each other. 
    And yet what an inconsistency that would wreak, because instead of on-reservation exclusive rights to hunt and fish and gather, their reading of Article 4 would create off-reservation, non-exclusive, and non-universal rights, because, for example, of the national parks and because they concede that they can't hunt and fish on private land, at least without the consent of the landowner. 
    The rights that Article 4 was meant to save are plain within the balance of any fair reading of the 1864 treaty. 
    That treaty gave allotments in perpetuity. 
    It gave tax exemptions to Indians. 
    It gave family inheritance rights to Indians. 
    It exempted the tribal annuity from individual debts. 
    It protected the Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin band of the Snake Indians from forfeiture of their particularly valuable land in case other tribes were put there. 
    That is what a savings clause is intended to give. 
    It doesn't confer new rights. 
    Moreover, the tribe has given us arguments which for four separate reasons we believe should fail. 
    They acknowledge diminishment but give it no legal significance. 
    They ask to rewrite the treaty by utterly ignoring in their briefs the limitations of "within said limits" and "within the reservation" language that is used in the treaty. 
    They would expand the cession act to include a new off-reservation interest, and they, we believe, misread the cases, which clearly augur in favor of the state's position. 
    The first group of their cases reserves off-reservation rights. 
    The second group of their cases are ones in which the cession agreement actually reserves rights on the ceded land, and in the third group of cases that they cite, the cession agreement doesn't diminish the reservation boundaries. 
    I would like to reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.

   Argument of Don Brantley Miller
speaker="don_brantley_miller" startTime="1551.700" stopTime="1753.299">
    Mr. Don Brantley Miller 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the rights at issue here today are basic subsistence rights that continue to this day to play an extremely important role in the day to day lives of the Klamath Tribe and its members. 
    They are treaty rights that have been exercised continuously in the ceded area since before the 1864 treaty to the present time, and they are rights that have a very direct impact on how the Indians live their lives, and affect directly their ability to provide food for themselves and their families. 
    Indeed, the parties here have stipulated that in addition to the Indians' continuous use in this area, these rights were crucial to the survival of the Klamath Indians at the time of the 1906 cession Act, and that they continue to this day to play a highly significant role in the lives of the Klamath Indians. 
    Now, no doubt because of this fundamental importance to the livelihood and existence of the Indians, Congress and this Court have traditionally been highly protective of treaty hunting and fishing rights. 
    This right to hunt and fish free of state regulation has long been regarded as more than a mere jurisdictional prerogative of the Indians. 
    Rather, it has been regarded as an important treaty right for the extinguishment of which just compensation must be paid. 
    Now, in this case and, with all due respect, contrary to Mr. Frohnmayer's assertion, we would assert that there really is no practical reason why the 1906 Act should not be construed as preserving the tribe's treaty rights. 
    Because the 1954 Klamath Termination Act preserved these same treaty rights to hunt and fish on lands that were subject to that Act, the Klamath Indians now possess a decreed right to hunt and fish free of state regulation over roughly two-thirds of their 1864 treaty reservation, an area of approximately one million acres, and those lands, like the lands at issue here today, were sold, purchased by the federal government, and placed in the national forest. 
    Now, tribal law governs its members' exercise of hunting and fishing rights on those lands. 
    The tribe has cooperative agreements with the state of Oregon, the Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
    It has a wildlife code that establishes seasons and taking limits. 
    It issues ID's to its members, and it employs a wildlife biologist and four tribal enforcement officers. 
    So, whether the tribe retained its treaty rights to hunt and fish on the additional one-third of that 1864 reservation that was ceded in 1906, and which lands are comprised of essentially similar forest lands even today, is probably not of major practical consequence to the state of Oregon, and the record in this case certainly would indicate nothing to the contrary.

    Mr. Don Brantley Miller 
    That's entirely correct, Your Honor. 
    Our assertion here is simply that the nature of the right that we assert is really... has two parts to it, or if... I mean, you can break it down into two part. 
    One is the exclusive right to enter on the land and reduce fish and game to possession. 
    The other, and, we would submit, the far more important right in this case, is the right to be free from state regulation, and those have always been considered the perhaps two important elements of Indian hunting and fishing rights. 
    It is a hybrid right. 
    It is not simply a regulatory right. 
    It is not simply a property right.

    Mr. Don Brantley Miller 
    Well, we are... I am aware of only one, which was a Blackfeet cession Act in 1891, I believe. 
    In that case, the right in the ceded lands of the tribe was retained as long... to hunt and fish in the ceded lands as long as they remained public lands, but they specifically held or specifically stated that those rights would be exercised subject to state jurisdiction. 
    So, they did break it down. 
    They recognized they would retain the right to go on as long as they were public lands, but applied state regulation. 
    So Congress knew how to apply state regulations in that area if it wanted to.

    Mr. Don Brantley Miller 
    I assume that there are as well, Your Honor, but that is really not the major bone of contention here. 
    Due to the number of dams on the Klamath River, there were a whole lot of fish back at the time of this agreement, and there aren't... I mean, there are, I suppose, some trout fishing or something, but it is not a major salmon fishery as it was before. 
    Well, Mr. Frohnmayer has, I believe, correctly pointed out that this case does present the question of whether Congress intended to abrogate treaty hunting and fishing rights in the context of a combination of factors that have not before been considered by the Court. 
    But the lower court decision here certainly doesn't represent a significant departure from the principles that have been announced in the Court's earlier treaty property rights cases and hunting and fishing rights cases.

    Mr. Don Brantley Miller 
    --In 1864, yes. 
    The treaty commissioner had initially proposed to lay out a reservation on the floor of the Klamath Basin and exclude the up slopes and valleys, and the Indians said, no, you can't do that. 
    These lands must be included because they form... provide us with a major part of our subsistence. 
    And so the government acceded, and they acceded to the Indians' request because they were aware that the Klamath Reservation was simply too high and too cold to support any meaningful agriculture, and the treaty provided for absolutely no support whatsoever of... I'm sorry. 
    It provided for some support initially in the first few years, but it provided for no long-term support of the Indians by the government. 
    So, the government's intent was to provide an area that would be... where the Indians could be self-sufficient through hunting and fishing, and the treaty specifically reserves fishing rights, so when the Indians voluntarily agreed to come on that reservation after having bargained for the inclusion of their hunting and fishing grounds, then that probably is a clear enough... I don't think there's any doubt that that is a clear enough expression of intent of the parties there to constitute an abrogation of those aboriginal rights. 
    But here we are talking about treaty rights.

    --It is a freedom from state regulation that has, because of its unique character as such an important right to the Indians, that has some of the characters of a property right. 
    In other words, it is a compensable right. 
    It is a property right within the sense of the Fifth Amendment. 
    If it is taken away, then compensation must be paid. 
    But it is not an interest in the property that is ceded. 
    This Court has recognized, and I think maybe this could answer some of the concerns in terms of whether this decision is breaking tremendous new ground or not, this Court has held that the right to hunt and fish free of state regulation may survive the language of cession where all right, title, and interest is conveyed. 
    It held that in the Winans case in 1905, and this Court's decision in the Antoine case in 1975 also held that such rights survived the all right, title, and interest cession language.

    Mr. Don Brantley Miller 
    I hate to speculate, Your Honor. 
    I would like to point out that the Court has held that such rights, particularly the treaty right to hunt and fish free of state regulation, that particular right, free of state regulation, has survived the total diminishment of reservation status, and that was this Court's holding in the 1968 Menominee decision. 
    We believe that those principles control... in those cases, control the resolution of this case.

    Aren't there two parts to Menominee? 
    In the first part they had a conveyance somewhat like this, and they said that took the hunting and fishing rights along with it, didn't they? 
    In other words, there was both a conveyance of the land, I thought, without any reference to hunting and fishing rights, which... I don't remember the exact language, but the Court said, well, that implicitly took with it the hunting and fishing rights.

    --I don't believe so, Your Honor. 
    I may be misunderstanding the question, but my understanding of the Menominee case is that at the time of termination, the termination Acts specifically provided that the reservation, all federal laws would no longer apply to the reservation. 
    Its Indian country status was totally disestablished and diminished. 
    And there was a specific provision in the termination Act that required that all laws of the states would apply to the Indians in the same manner. 
    But it said nothing about hunting and fishing rights.

    We do not believe that these rights are tied irrevocably to the land, so that they shrink along with the land. 
    These rights were defined by an area of land, as necessarily they must have been, but they were the right, a very separate right to hunt and fish over these areas, and there is no reason why they should be tied irrevocably to the tribe's right to occupy and possess those lands. 
    And indeed the numerous cessions where tribal rights have been retained is reflective of the fact that these rights are not unequivocally tied to possession of the land. 
    I think it is very important for the Court to focus on the unique purposes of this cession Act. 
    They distinguish this cession Act from virtually every other land cession Act, with the exception of the Blackfeet cession Act which I alluded to earlier, in that these lands were not opened for settlement by non-Indians, and the purpose of this Act was to honor treaty obligations in a manner entirely consistent with the treaty, and to benefit the Indians. 
    It sought to promote their self-sufficiency. 
    And when you consider what must have been the Indians' understanding at that time, here they were negotiating an agreement. 
    The government knew full well that these lands were important to them for hunting and fishing purposes. 
    They had specifically bargained for their inclusion earlier. 
    And yet the agreement said nothing whatsoever about hunting and fishing rights, but it did contain an article, Article 4, which provided that all treaty rights that were consistent with the provisions of the cession would be preserved.

    Mr. Don Brantley Miller 
    Well, we don't know, Your Honor, and the record doesn't reflect very much. 
    What it does indicate is that there are some statements by Bureau of Indian Affairs people even back in the 1880s, 15 years before the land was going... or before the Boundary Commission was even appointed to investigate, there was indication that they simply thought that the easiest way out of this mess was to just have Congress buy it, and everything seemed to proceed down that track. 
    And one of the important things to keep in mind, Your Honor, with regard to the cession agreement is that... and with regard to your inference that the Indians perhaps didn't think it was important is that this was really... the agreement that was negotiated in 1901 was really not a negotiated agreement across the board. 
    All items weren't on the table. 
    The inspector had told the Indians that he was adopting the Boundary Commission's detailed appraisal of those lands, and that the only negotiations they were going to have regarded what the Indians were going to do with the proceeds. 
    So, there were no negotiations whatsoever with regard to whether the land would be ceded or retained. 
    The tribe had nothing to do with that. 
    Or how much money they would be paid for the land. 
    That was preordained. 
    It was simply--

    Mr. Don Brantley Miller 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address first a matter that was brought up earlier regarding the question of whether the Indians were paid for the value of this right or whether it was subsumed within the fair market value and highest and best use. 
    And I would simply point to the Joint Appendix at Page 14, Stipulation Number 19, where the state has stipulated that the Commission did not take the tribe's hunting and fishing rights into consideration in making its assessment.

    Mr. Don Brantley Miller 
    Now, the state has argued that this is an anomalous, very different, almost an oddball right, that this would be the only place where it would exist. 
    The point to be made is that this is a right, the right that we assert today is a right that was subsumed within the larger rights that the Indians before possessed. 
    It is the same identical right that exists today on the other two-thirds of their treaty reservation, and it is a right that exists on numerous other national forest lands throughout the country. 
    It has been recognized time and again by various courts in the country. 
    The thing that is different about this case is not the nature of the right asserted. 
    The thing that is different is the manner in which the right was preserved, and Article 4, which we place great reliance on, means that the rights were only extinguished to the extent necessary to accomplish the purposes of the cession, and the purposes of this cession were not to open reservation lands to settlement, as was the case in virtually every other cession Act. 
    So, the retention of these rights on unfenced, unenclosed forest lands is consistent with the purposes of the cession, and the Indians surely must have understood that. 
    They knew that Article 4 was in that agreement, and they knew that those lands out there were not going to be settled, that they were unenclosed, unfenced forest lands, that there was no population pressure. 
    The exclusive nature of the right was probably unimportant to them at the time. 
    Nobody else used those lands anyway. 
    The important thing at the time was the right to be able to go out and continue to use those lands for their subsistence, and that is the way they would have understood it, we submit. 
    Now, the adoption of the approach for which we have argued would simply mean that in each Indian land cession Act you would have to examine each Act in light of its own legislative history and its surrounding circumstances, and in adopting the rule that we propose, the Court should bear in mind that there really were very few cessions and diminishments that were effectuated for purposes other than opening the lands for settlement, and that is the key to the analysis of this case. 
    This was a unique Act. 
    Its purpose was to settle a boundary dispute, honor treaty obligations. 
    Its purpose was not to benefit non-Indian settlers. 
    Now, as we have suggested in our brief, it might well be in those cases where there was a diminishment as well as a cession of title and the lands were opened for settlement, in those cases, there might well be an extinguishment of the rights. 
    The totality of those circumstances might well rise to the level of clarity that has been required by this Court for an extinguishment of the treaty rights. 
    Thank you.

    Do you have anything further, Mr. Attorney General? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of David Frohnmayer
speaker="david_frohnmayer" startTime="3361.064" stopTime="3588.453">
    Mr. David Frohnmayer 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Briefly, six points, which I believe will not require all the time that I have reserved. 
    First, I must respectfully submit that opposing counsel has done in oral argument precisely what he has done in the briefs, and that is to confuse the language of Article 4, which does not speak to purposes of the cession agreement. 
    It talks about provisions of the agreement. 
    Provisions are clear, and speak for themselves, and do not require psychoanalysis of the parties or the Congress which enacted it. 
    The second point is that we have referred in our opening argument to the anomaly created by the special situation of Crater Lake National Park, the largest part of the western cession boundaries. 
    Federal law has since time immemorial, at least since the creation of the park, prohibited hunting altogether on that piece of ceded property, and yet it is anomalous because the right asserted is the right of subsistence to hunt and fish and the allegedly onerous nature of state regulations, which simply have bad limits and season limits. 
    The federal government with respect to its share of those lands in the national park prohibits hunting altogether, and yet no mention of how this is to be reconciled with the theoretical position of the tribe has yet been offered by our opponents. 
    That leads to the point that we have heard no argument about the source of this asserted right. 
    That source can only come from one of four sources: aboriginal right, the treaty right of 1864, the 1906 cession agreement, or some other contemporaneous Act of Congress which regranted to the tribe the authority to hunt and fish as it had before on the ceded land, and in fact none of those first three sources is conceivably the source, and therefore we must look to the fourth. 
    Justice Stevens asked our worthy opponents for authority for their proposition, a point, I believe, echoed by Justice White. 
    Indeed, the authority cited is quite contrary. 
    The Blackfoot treaty which was cited as an example, as counsel explained to this Court, where the cession agreement explicitly reserved hunting and fishing rights on the ceded land until such time as they were open to the public. 
    The Winans case is a case where a treaty explicitly reserved off-reservation rights. 
    The Antoine case is a case in which the cession agreement explicitly reserved rights to hunt and fish on the ceded land, and in fact on Page 28, Footnote 5 of our brief, we cite authority to the proposition that when Congress wanted to reserve rights on ceded land, the normal practice was for the Congress of the United States to say so, and it did. 
    Justice Stevens in his colloquy with opposing counsel asked about the opposing interests of the state in the varieties of fish, game, and other wildlife management. 
    Justice Stevens, that is not in the stipulations of the parties, but in the motions to stay the District Court proceedings, the opposing views of counsel and affidavits with respect to the various practices are included in the record, and that may serve to answer your question there if that is a residual issue. 
    The point that the state raises is that the normal practice if something is other than a complete sale and cession and giving up of all rights in a cession agreement is for the Congress to have said so. 
    The Congress knew how to say so. 
    The Congressional language is clear and undeniable, and yet the tribe shrinks in horror at the notion that with respect to land which is admittedly no longer in tribal domain but in the public domain, that the same rules, the same regulation to enhance wildlife and to protect the environment should apply to tribal members as well as to all the members of the public. 
    We believe that the intention of Congress is otherwise, and that the ability of the state to regulate this land with an even hand in the interests of enhancing its wildlife resource ought to be preserved as against the theory which has no true basis in analytical consistency that we can discover. 
    Thank you very much.
