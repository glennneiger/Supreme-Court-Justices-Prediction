    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case arises under an important federal statute, ERISA, and it is safe to say that if the statute was working the way Congress intended that it should, the case would not be here today at all. 
    The Respondent Russell received all of the benefits to which he was entitled under the plan, under the statute, all of the benefits that she had claimed in March of 1980, just short of five years ago. 
    Shortly after that, this suit was filed. 
    It was filed in state court. 
    It was removed to the Federal District Court in California where the Court granted summary judgment for Petitioners, ruling that punitive damages and extracontractual compensatory damages in this case including damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress, were not available under ERISA. 
    The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that they were, and this Court granted certiorari. 
    First, with regard to punitive damages, that issue is squarely presented by this case, whether or not they are available under ERISA. 
    We contend that they are not, essentially for two reasons, that that is not what Congress said, and quite plainly, after review of the legislative history, that is not what Congress intended, and secondly, that if punitive damages were available, they would interfere with the proper functioning of the employee benefit system in the federal courts. 
    ERISA is a long, complex, comprehensive statute, but the provisions directly involved in this case are only two, and they are relatively simple. 
    Section 502 provides that a civil action is available to the Secretary of Labor and to participants, beneficiaries and fiduciaries for relief under Section 409. 
    Section 409, which deals with fiduciary breach, provides that fiduciaries who breach their duty will be personally liable to the plan to make good the losses that their breach occasioned or to restore to the plan--

    Section 409 deals with fiduciary responsibility, and it talks about personal liability of fiduciaries, but it is our position that recovery under 409 is limited to the plan as distinguished from the individuals.

    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    Some of them are defined explicitly, Justice Brennan, and others are to be inferred from the law of trusts to which Congress committed the entire statute of ERISA for its administration. 
    409, in addition to requiring that fiduciaries make good to the plan any loss occasioned by the breach, it requires that fiduciaries restore to the plan any gains that they have made from the use of plan assets.

    I believe that's correct, Your Honor, but the provision of ERISA that provides for individual rights for participants and beneficiaries is in 502, specifically 502(a)(1)(B), and that section which provides that participants and beneficiaries have the right to enforce their benefits under the plan, to determine what they are, to clarify their rights under the plan, has its comparable provision referring to equitable remedies in Section 502(a)(3). 
    And when you look at that, we would suggest that you would view that as part of the overall comprehensive statutory scheme where individual rights are provided for there in 502.

    Now, I know that this Court recognizes that this was not a one-way street, that the benefits that participants and beneficiaries receive under ERISA are very, very significant. 
    They involve the vesting and the funding and the access to the courts and all of the other provisions, review of the detailed civil and criminal sanctions that are provided, but they necessarily also involve some trade-offs and in our view, a part of those trade-offs are the state tort remedies, of which this is a classic example.

    To the extent that it does under Title VII, for example, where in actions like that the party has a right to reinstatement with or without back pay and such other equitable remedies as the Court might provide, and I think that the reason that damages, whether they are punitive damages or in this case compensatory damages for emotional distress, are at war with this is that they involve a damages or legal concept outside of the equitable remedies provision of the statute. 
    Now, to the extent that your question goes to having the fund or the plan retain any losses that were occasioned by the breach, I think that that is very specifically provided by the first two clauses of Section 409, and that is the make whole concept specifically, expressly.

    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    --Congress said it in the statute in the preemption part of ERISA, that any law relating to employee benefit plans would be preempted, and that, of course, differentiates ERISA from a number of other federal statutes which intend expressly to leave state law standing. 
    Well, I am still wondering, was there anything said in the legislative history indicating that the Congress addressed itself specifically to the rights of beneficiaries under ordinary trust law in the states? 
    No, Justice Brennan, there was not. 
    There was much in the legislative history on the point that we have been discussing just the last couple of minutes. 
    There is much in the legislative history to suggest over and over and over again that the rights established in Section 409 are the rights of the plan, not the rights of individual beneficiaries. 
    Punitive damages, as I was saying, are nowhere mentioned in the statute, and that we find particularly significant because it is plain that when Congress wants to provide for punitive damages, they know exactly how to do it. 
    In the last fifty years since enactment of the Securities and Exchange Act in 1934, and running through TEFRA in 1982, they have done that in fourteen different statutes. 
    Three of those statutes were enacted in 1974, the same year that ERISA was enacted. 
    And that I think, as this Court has recognized on other occasions, is very strong evidence that they didn't intend to include punitive damages and then absentmindedly overlook them.

    No, I don't think that it was ever any more than a rare and occasional anomaly of trust law.

    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    --I don't believe that our opponent does. 
    I would like to return again to the comprehensive legislative scheme that is ERISA, because I think that that is perhaps the most persuasive single reason for this Court holding that punitive damages are not available here. 
    As this Court said in the Northwest Air Lines case, where a statute is comprehensive... and ERISA is among the most comprehensive statutes... and where it provides for private remedies in some situations, and federal government remedies in other situations, that is very strong evidence that it didn't intend that additional remedies should be grafted on to a statute like that. 
    The review of ERISA is convincing indeed. 
    Its civil and criminal penalties and sanctions providing for imprisonment, fines in various amounts for various kinds of conduct, one would have to conclude that Congress reviewed the subject that they had under consideration exhaustively and in great detail, and unlike some other statutes which do involve filling in the details by courts, this is not that case. 
    This is a very specific, very comprehensive act directed to providing minimum standards for pensioners and benefits for those entitled to them on a nationwide basis, and the emphasis is on the delivery of those benefits rather than on state tort claims which may be associated with the subject matter of earlier cases or like this case. 
    We contend also that punitive damages, if they were available, would have an adverse impact on the functioning of the employee benefit system and in fact, the federal courts. 
    The Congress very carefully provided in the statute and by regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Labor for an appeals process in the event that a claim is denied, and that that appeals process would effectively be scrapped if the right to damages were available to those who were applying for them. 
    Who will go through the appeals process if he had a right to damages for emotional distress, pain and suffering, and particularly if he had a right to punitive damages on the outside? 
    This case is probably as good an example of that as any. 
    We have talked about the remedial aspect of the statute and how that works with the individual rights provided under Section 502 and the plan rights provided in Section 409. 
    I would be glad to respond to any questions that any Justice might have, or to reserve the remainder of my times for rebuttal.

    ERISA was enacted to protect participants from actions of the small percentage of fiduciaries who were not acting in good faith and were not providing the benefits that participants were rightfully entitled to. 
    Respondent at this time does not request the Court to imply remedies into ERISA but to interpret the language that is in ERISA right now in light of looking at the legislative history, the legislative language. 
    It is the traditional role of this Court to analyze the statute, and that's what I wish to do for you at this particular point. 
    In the purpose of ERISA, it indicates that ERISA was created to protect participants and to provide appropriate remedies, sanctions and ready access to the federal court. 
    The legislative history of both the House and the Senate is unambiguous and quite clear, and it states that the enforcement provisions were created and specifically designed to provide broad remedies for participants to redress or prevent violations of the act. 
    It then goes on and says it is the Committee's intent to provide the full range of legal and equitable remedies, and in both... available both in state and federal courts. 
    Now, at the time that this specific legislative intent created a full range of legal and equitable remedies for participants, it was quite clear that compensatory and punitive damages were part of the full range of legal remedies available to participants. 
    The Section 502... excuse me... (a)(2) language which refers over to Section 409 allows participants equitable or remedial relief as the Court deems appropriate, and this is for breaches of fiduciary duty. 
    Traditionally, breaches of fiduciary duty are a tort. 
    It is not founded in trust law, but a breach of fiduciary duty is a tort. 
    If you look at the ERISA the way it is set up, Section 502 provides for remedies against the plan. 
    Section 409 sets forth the tort remedies against the fiduciary. 
    The preemption which totally occupied the field and removed many tort remedies, intentional torts as well as breach of fiduciary duty torts, completely wiped the slate clean. 
    It would be anomalous at this particular point to so narrowly construe Section 409 as to not provide the teeth in ERISA necessary to fill that void, that preemption.

    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    I believe you are referring to the... all the amicus briefs on behalf of the Taft-Hartley plans where you have half of the fiduciaries from the employers and half from the employees. 
    You have got some checks and balances and safeguards there that themselves would immunize the fiduciaries from punitive damages. 
    It is also interesting to note that in the context where we are right now, that the administration of welfare plans under Section 405(c)(1) and (2), these fiduciaries may allocate their responsibilities and obligations for nontrust asset type decisions, and if they adequately in fact do delegate their authority, they are immune from liability, so that trustees who are sitting on the plans to make sure that the trust assets are being governed and that the policies themselves are being established properly, they will not be affected unless they are in there actually working on a day-to-day basis exhibiting discretion as to whether or not a participant should or should not receive a benefit. 
    So those obligations can be delegated to professionals who, just like insurance, and it is interesting to note that the... any participant who happens to be receiving benefits pursuant to an insurance administered plan, do have the full range of remedies in state law for their protection, compensatory damages, punitive damages. 
    The particular situation we are in right now is a self-funded, self-administered plan that if the benefits are not paid, the direct benefit accrues to the employer who is administering the plan. 
    It is a total conflict situation, and it was these types of breaches that ERISA was created to prevent. 
    And we are not talking about wholesale... wholesale poor actions by fiduciaries. 
    This is a small percentage of fiduciaries who need to be kept in line.

    In fact, when the House of Representatives committee said that they intended to provide the full range of legal and equitable remedies, the precise language that is in ERISA now was before them. 
    It was the original version of the statute that was before the committee when the committee said it is our intent to provide the full range. 
    If it is not provided under Section 409, there is no other provision in ERISA which would allow legal remedies.

    Well, why... Congress did provide for a participant or a beneficiary to have a... to be able to sue.

    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    --That is correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2112.766" stopTime="2118.103">
    Justice White 
    But it rather carefully said what he could sue for.
speaker="brad_n_baker" startTime="2118.103" stopTime="2120.971">
    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    Under Section 409 or under Section 502, or both?

    Justice White 
    502.
speaker="brad_n_baker" startTime="2121.655" stopTime="2136.581">
    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    Section 502 says against the plan you can only sue for equitable relief or benefits, and the purpose of that was because you don't want to... you do not want to jeopardize the assets of the plan which would then jeopardize all beneficiaries.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2136.581" stopTime="2143.152">
    Justice White 
    No, I know, but Congress did provide for a civil action by participants or beneficiaries.
speaker="brad_n_baker" startTime="2143.152" stopTime="2143.671">
    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    Correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2143.671" stopTime="2155.745">
    Justice White 
    And said what they could sue for. 
    This is just another argument, perhaps Congress didn't intend participants and beneficiaries to have any other kind of a cause of action.
speaker="brad_n_baker" startTime="2155.745" stopTime="2163.815">
    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    Except that under 502 they specifically say for appropriate relief, the participants or beneficiaries may sue for appropriate relief under Section 409.

    That's a--

    Do you think punitive damages falls within those words?
speaker="brad_n_baker" startTime="2180.527" stopTime="2190.466">
    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    --No, not at all. 
    Those are remedies that are available against the plan under Section 502. 
    You must refer it over to Section 409 to find out the remedies against a fiduciary.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2190.466" stopTime="2197.306">
    Justice White 
    Well, I know, but that section doesn't say anything about a participant or a beneficiary suing.
speaker="brad_n_baker" startTime="2197.305" stopTime="2220.337">
    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    I believe that if it is read in conjunction with a participant or beneficiary going to 502(a) says a participant or beneficiary may sue for appropriate relief under Section 409, you then get referred over to Section 409, and it says that the participant may receive other equitable or remedial relief--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2220.337" stopTime="2221.321">

    All right.
speaker="brad_n_baker" startTime="2221.321" stopTime="2231.293">
    Mr. Brad N. Baker

    Okay. 
    Traditionally equitable relief does not include compensatory or punitive damages, and it seems to be a consistent reading of the statute that you can only get equitable relief or your benefits from the plan, which is 502.

    409 is the only right that a beneficiary participant has to sue a fiduciary. 
    The... if in fact remedial means just equitable, as must be the Court's finding in order to determine that no compensatory or punitive damages are allowed against fiduciaries, then you have created in essence an immunization of fiduciaries. 
    They cannot be sued for compensatory or punitive damages no matter how willful or malicious their conduct is.

    --against fiduciaries receive other equitable or remedial relief. 
    There is nothing in the legislative intent or the legislative scheme that in any way indicates that they want to protect fiduciaries for willful, malicious actions against plan participants. 
    In fact, just the opposite is true, you have been set up strict standards for fiduciaries and personal liability. 
    The balancing of costs argument the Petitioners have advanced, the costs that Congress, when reading the legislative history, the costs that they were referring to were not the administration costs, the day in, day out. 
    That did not change that much when ERISA was enacted. 
    The true costs were the vesting and the accrual rates, and they wanted to make sure that when ERISA was established, it did not put such a financial burden on the employers with regards to making employees vested 100 percent on day one and have a 100 percent accrued benefit. 
    That is the cost analysis. 
    If compensatory and punitive damages are allowed under Section 409, these will not be costs that will be borne by the employer. 
    These are against the fiduciaries themselves.

    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    Once you expand beyond equitable into legal, the facts of the case will control and the standard of review will determine whether compensatory or punitive damages should be allowed against the fiduciary. 
    I do not draw a distinction of compensatory or punitive damages, if the situation warrants, as the Ninth Circuit has said, and there should be a very narrow definition that only willful misconduct or wanton disregard of participants' rights would--

    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    --Traditionally, yes. 
    However, usually it is when there is such unambiguous congressional intent to protect participants and provide the full range of legal and equitable remedies. 
    Once again, that will help interpret the word "remedial", and it is a remedial statute. 
    It is either a remedial statute that expands the rights of participants, or it is a remedial statute that restricts the right of participants. 
    All the way through the legislative history, ERISA is something that expands the rights of participants. 
    Nowhere does it state we are restricting participants' rights, or participants are forfeiting rights they already had under state law for the benefit of the common good, and the benefit of the common good in this particular situation would be the immunization of fiduciaries. 
    There is nothing in the legislative history that indicates the fiduciaries should be put in an immunized position, or that they should be a favored type of class. 
    I know of, personally know of no type of statute that as a class protects an individual group of people from willful, malicious conduct, especially when that person is supposed to be acting on behalf of participants.

    Only from the plan, that if in fact your welfare or your disability payments are chopped off for two years and you lose your house and they turn around and give you your two years worth of back disability payments, you cannot receive compensation for an erroneous act by a fiduciary that cost you your house or that might have been a spiteful action.

    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    That is correct. 
    Respondent's position is not that the administrative remedies section should be removed. 
    Petitioners' argument that the internal resolution of plans will go completely out the window if compensatory and punitive damages are awarded does not follow. 
    If in fact you must or the participants still must exhaust their administrative remedies before they can sue, if the fiduciaries reverse their position and make payments within that period of time, that is the best evidence as to good faith which would immunize them from compensatory or punitive damages. 
    The Petitioners also indicate that there is a trade-off going here, that there is... because the participants receive certain rights under ERISA, they have to give up something else. 
    There is absolutely nothing in the legislative history or any case law that has been cited that takes that position.

    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    It is more of a deterrence to others. 
    I think that we are not arguing here whether punitive damages are in society or not. 
    You discussed that in Smith v. Wade. 
    The standard for punitive damages I concede should be high. 
    I think it should be the one enumerated by the Ninth Circuit, that only for willful, malicious misconduct or for wanton disregard or indifference towards the rights of participants.

    Mr. Brad N. Baker 
    However, it is the Court's ability at this particular point to set the uniform standard for punitive damages under ERISA. 
    Nowhere does it state that state law must be followed. 
    In fact, state law will not be followed. 
    It is for federal common law to be established to fill the void created by the total preemption, and the standard that has been established by the Ninth Circuit is a willful wantonness standard.

    I do not feel that a mere reckless standard would be appropriate in this situation. 
    I think it should be a willful standard. 
    It would be anomalous at this particular point to completely wipe out all remedies that participants had under state law.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have anything further, Mr. Nolan? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of John E. Nolan, Jr.
speaker="john_e_nolan_jr" startTime="3104.713" stopTime="3195.437">
    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    I have four very brief points, Your Honor. 
    There have been a number of questions dealing with preemption and state remedies in my argument and in my opponent's, and that is referred to in our reply brief at pages 8 and 9, the rationale for it. 
    Congress essentially said that the fiduciary standard embodied in federal legislation is considered desirable because it will bring a measure of uniformity in an area where decisions under the same set of facts may vary from state to state. 
    It is evident that the operations of employee benefit plans are increasingly interstate. 
    The uniformity of decision which the act is designed to foster will help administrators, fiduciaries and participants to predict the legality of proposed actions without the necessity of reference to varying state laws, and I would suggest that that is fundamental, core to this case and to the issues that we have discussed here. 
    There have been a number of questions about making the plan whole from Justice O'Connor and Justice White and others, and there is a case that deals with that, a federal case that deals with that that I would commend to the Court. 
    It is called Froyen v. Marshall and Eisley. 
    It is a Wisconsin case decided in 1971 and found at 485 Fed. Sup. 
    629.

    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    And... Elsely, is it? 
    It says that the Court has broad discretion in awarding equitable relief to make the plan whole, and I think that responds to what happens if the fiduciary takes something and goes away, and whether you call it damages or not is an issue. 
    I think that ERISA, it would be regarded as equitable relief as distinguished from damages, but the effect of it would be to restore the plan, to make the plan whole. 
    There have been a few cases that have gone the other way on our issue, by our count, about a half a dozen, and fifteen resolve it the way we recommend to the Court. 
    The interesting thing about the six is that they all ride the same horse. 
    They all take the same line from the legislative history, the line that refers to the full range of legal and equitable relief, and which is repeated in the House and Senate reports, and they use that as the basis for the decision. 
    We would suggest that that is an insubstantial basis, particularly where the bill was amended going through, and that reference which may have been accurate when the legislative history was written, was stripped from the bill before it was enacted, and there is in the present bill no reference at all to legal relief, and we would suggest therefore no reference at all to the kind of damages relief raised by Respondents here. 
    Justice O'Connor had a question about 502(a)(3), would it give participants or beneficiaries a right against fiduciaries. 
    In our view, it would. 
    If there are any further questions, I would be glad to respond. 
    Justice White?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3310.177" stopTime="3318.683">
    Justice White 
    Is there... is the claim in this case that the beneficiary should get punitive damages?
speaker="john_e_nolan_jr" startTime="3318.683" stopTime="3326.605">
    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    The claim in this case is that the participant, I believe, should get punitive damages, yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3326.605" stopTime="3331.157">
    Justice White 
    And not... rather than the plan.
speaker="john_e_nolan_jr" startTime="3331.157" stopTime="3333.693">
    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    Rather than the plan, clearly.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3333.693" stopTime="3351.137">
    Justice White 
    What if the beneficiary sues under (3)(a)(2) for appropriate relief under Section 409? 
    I understand your position is that all recoveries under 409 go to the plan.
speaker="john_e_nolan_jr" startTime="3351.137" stopTime="3351.820">
    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    That is correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3351.820" stopTime="3367.949">
    Justice White 
    And part of his cause of action is I am suing on behalf of the plan to get relief against this fiduciary, and I want the fiduciary to pay punitive damages to the plan.
speaker="john_e_nolan_jr" startTime="3367.949" stopTime="3383.041">
    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    Well, there are two aspects to that which make it good as a hypothetical but not very good as a case. 
    The first is that if you are going to go through 409, you go through 502(a)(2), I believe, which has a specific reference to 409.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3383.041" stopTime="3383.475">
    Justice White 
    Yes.
speaker="john_e_nolan_jr" startTime="3383.475" stopTime="3392.131">
    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    The other is that 502(a)(3) is by its terms expressly limited to equitable relief.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3392.131" stopTime="3392.664">
    Justice White 
    I understand that.
speaker="john_e_nolan_jr" startTime="3392.664" stopTime="3395.266">
    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    It is in our view by the individual as to--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3395.266" stopTime="3405.974">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know that. 
    502(a)(2) permits the participant to sue for appropriate relief under 409, I think.
speaker="john_e_nolan_jr" startTime="3405.974" stopTime="3408.509">
    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr. 
    --I believe that--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3408.509" stopTime="3424.250">
    Justice White 
    That's just what it says. 
    It says a beneficiary may sue for appropriate relief under Section 409, and you say the only appropriate relief would have to be paid to the plan, and you also say that in any event, punitive damages is never appropriate relief.
speaker="john_e_nolan_jr" startTime="3424.250" stopTime="3424.769">
    Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr.
