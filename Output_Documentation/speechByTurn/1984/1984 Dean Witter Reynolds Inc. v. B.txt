    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here today, I believe, because the District Court did precisely that which this Court subsequently declared in its decision Southland versus Keating that a federal judge should not do. 
    That is, the District Court undermined the expectations of the petitioner who desired arbitration pursuant to a contract related to interstate commerce. 
    This case involves a civil suit filed in the Federal District Court by a customer against the securities broker/dealer. 
    The complaint asserts four claims under state law, all of which are subject to a valid preexisting agreement to arbitrate. 
    The customer, in addition to asserting those four state law claims, asserts one claim under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. 
    The petitioner sought arbitration of the four state law claims, but the District Court denied that arbitration, because that court in its subjective determination felt that the factual and legal issues involved in all of the claims were intertwined. 
    The Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
    In this regard, the Ninth Circuit is joined by two other circuits who have come down in effect in the same way on a similar issue. 
    On the other side of the coin, there are three circuits that have come down on the opposite side of this issue. 
    Thus, there is an even split between six circuits that have considered this issue called intertwining. 
    The question thus presented today is whether the District Court erred in denying the petitioner's motion for an order compelling arbitration of the respondent's state law claims and staying that arbitration pending judicial resolution of the respondent's claim under the federal securities laws.

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    If you are talking collateral estoppel, I do not believe so, because the mechanisms of arbitration generally are such. 
    There are no findings of fact. 
    There is no record. 
    There is really nothing that would be available to a court, state or federal, subsequently to determine whether or not there was anything decided that would really--

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    I personally would subscribe to the Dickenson theory approach, and that is one of the circuits that have decided against intertwining, and it feels that the protections afforded under the '34 Act are better served by reserving to the federal district court the right of priority to determine the federal securities law claim and thus stay the arbitration until that federal securities law claim has in fact been determined.

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    According to the complaint, the securities broker/dealer or his registered representative, its registered representative advised Dr. Byrd that if he were to sell his dental practice and invest some $160,000 into the stock market under the management of this registered representative, that the dentist would receive about $4,000 a month, I assume in perpetuity, or at least for his lifetime for annual income. 
    The complaint alleges that the registered representative altered the client information forms in certain ways. 
    It further alleges that after the account was open for a short period, that the registered representative engaged in unauthorized trading for this account, and that the registered representative started dealing in options, and in naked options. 
    The complaint further alleges that both the registered representative and the branch office manager in this particular branch assured the plaintiff that the account was okay and that everything was doing well, even though the statements in the confirms might have indicated otherwise to the doctor, and in fact when the account apparently had lost about $100,000. 
    Now, out of this common nucleus of fact, the doctor alleges violations of the California state securities laws, alleges common law fraud and deceipt, alleges breach of fiduciary duty on behalf of the broker/dealer firm, and alleges negligence, and with respect to three of those claims he is seeking punitive damages which clearly are not available under a Section 10(b) claim. 
    He lastly alleges also a Section 10(b) claim. 
    Now, the Court, as we have said, indicated that the facts and the legal issues were so intertwined that to separate those issues and to send the four claims to arbitration after first adjudicating the 10(b)(5) claim would be a waste of efficiency. 
    The problems with that decision and the intertwining theory are both legal and practical. 
    First, from a legal standpoint, the Court seems not to be listening to the music of Cone when Cone indicated that the federal court should have a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.

   Rebuttal of Eugene W. Bell

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    Again, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we had mentioned or I had mentioned just prior to the adjournment that the Ninth Circuit in similar circuit opinions had caused some legal problems. 
    I mentioned the language in the Cone case where this Court recited a healthy regard for a federal policy favoring arbitration, and likewise in the Keating case this Court stated that contracts to arbitrate are not to be avoided by allowing one party to ignore the contract and resort to the courts. 
    Now, the decisions of the Ninth, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits are in contravention of those statements, and they are frustrating the rights of parties who feel that they are entitled to arbitration pursuant to a valid contract to get that arbitration.

    Special rights under the '33 Act, but those special rights are not to be found in the 1934 Act, and this Court analyzed that proposition in the Scherk case and in my opinion came very close to providing one with a platform to say that the Wilco rationale, the Wilco holding does not apply to a claim brought as an implied private right of action under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act. 
    It is my view that it does not apply, but the Courts below primarily, and certainly the Ninth Circuit have just assumed that this Court's holding in Wilco with regard to Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act--

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    They have all assumed it, and it is out of that assumption that this intertwining policy really has grown, but even if this Court, to continue for a moment on Wilco, even if this Court were to use this opportunity, the subsidiary question to make the pronouncement that Wilco does not apply to claims brought as implied rights under the '34 Act, that wouldn't remove the intertwining argument, because that argument could then next be presented in connection with a situation where there is an express statutory right and a special right of the type that this Court determined in Wilco attaches to Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act, and someone then could bring a case that would combine a claim that is specifically, let's say, brought with regard to Section 12(2) of the '33 Act and move into that claim on the common nucleus of facts stakeoff claims that would be subject to arbitration, and the intertwining argument would then raise its ugly head again. 
    So, while we would encourage this Court to take a look at whether Wilco does apply in fact to implied rights brought under Section 10(b), we can't stop there We must also look at the intertwining, whether or not that fits with this Court's and Congress's scheme of things that it provided for in arbitration.

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't think it does, and Justice White brought up this question. 
    My personal view is that to give full force and effect to the Congressional mandate favored in arbitration is a speedy remedy, but the arbitration should proceed the more lengthy judicial resolution of the claims brought that are not subject to arbitration. 
    I think there would be great benefits to be derived from that. 
    It is subjective, but that is my personal opinion. 
    The reasoning, however, of the Court in the Dickenson case, and that is the landmark case that says intertwining is bad, the reasoning of the Court there is that if you were to allow the arbitration to go first, it might somehow interfere with the federal court's exclusive rights under the '34 Act to determine actions that are brought to it under the '34 Act. 
    I am just adopting for the purposes of our motion and what is before here, I have adopted the Dickenson rationale and approach. 
    Certainly procedurally that is what I adopted, but we do not embrace that approach. 
    I would respect your suggestion and certainly Justice White's suggestion that perhaps a more practical way of approaching it is to permit the arbitration to proceed first, and to let the--

    I don't believe so, sir, because while there are, as you correctly noted, provisions for in effect converting an arbitration award into a judgment, in view of the fact that you do not have before the Court, in the case I have seen, you do not have findings of fact from the arbitrators.

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    Well, with regard to... as you know, Justice Brennan, with regard to Section 10(b)(5) claims, or claims under the '34 Act anyway, that Act by its own language does not permit damages beyond actual damages suffered by the plaintiff. 
    That in my opinion is the reason that almost every plaintiff seeking... bringing a garden variety lawsuit these days against a security broker tries to drag in state law claims upon which he can seek punitive damages. 
    It leads to confusion of the jury. 
    It leads to multiple instructions, sometimes that apparently are--

speaker="eugene_w_bell" startTime="1135.297" stopTime="1488.287">
    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    Of course it does. 
    Particularly when you have a situation where the access to the federal court in the first place is a claim under the '34 Act that doesn't permit punitive damages, and yet in every one of these cases they are seeking punitive damages. 
    It seems to me an anomaly that should not be tolerated by the court system, and one way of doing it is giving full force and effect to the arbitration agreement. 
    This Court has declared that parties cannot avoid arbitration by resorting to court. 
    They did that in January of this year in the Keating case, and yet it is happening every day, and the courts are still permitting it. 
    I sincerely believe, and of course the State of California very frequently and most recently has again embraced arbitration of disputes between customers and their stockbrokers, and it says if there is a valid arbitration agreement, we are going to enforce it, and you must arbitrate those claims. 
    So, the plaintiff now, under the approach of the Ninth Circuit, all he has to do is take those same claims across the street to the federal court, add on a claim or an alleged claim under the '34 Act, and say I am home free, I do not have to arbitrate, and that is one of the evils, I believe, of the intertwining approach. 
    This Court further has declared in the Prima Paint case that with regard to an application under Section 3 of the Arbitration Act that the court can consider only two issues. 
    In the Southland case it specified these more precisely. 
    Only two limitations on a party's, right to arbitrate. 
    One is the arbitration clause, part of a written contract or a maritime agreement or a written contract affecting and arising out of interstate commerce, and I think it is beyond peradventure now that these margin agreements and agreements with regard to option accounts that contain arbitration clauses in many instances, not uniformly, are certainly contracts arising out of interstate commerce. 
    The only other limitation that this Court said in the Keating case would affect a party's right to arbitrate are such limitations that are provided by either law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. 
    Well, it escapes me whether it is anything in the intertwining theory that speaks of that being a ground to revoke the arbitration clause itself. 
    It is not. 
    It is more of a procedural argument. 
    These statements of Congress mandating arbitration and the statements of this Court simply leave no room for denying arbitration on the basis of some subjective and, I submit, debatable theory that the arbitration claims are intertwined. 
    In your recent Cone decision, this Court recognized that if it is necessary in order to give full force and effect to a valid arbitration clause, that you must divide the dispute and have that dispute resolved in separate forums, that that should be done, and that is precisely what the petitioner is requesting be done here, is that if in fact claims under the '34 Act or 10(b)(5) are not subject to arbitration, then we want the claims divided, and the Court recognized that as a valid principle in the Cone case. 
    The Ninth Circuit and other circuits have attempted to rationalize their holding using Wilco as a basis for the rationalization, but that rationalization fails for these reasons. 
    First, as I mentioned earlier, Wilco involved what this Court perceived to be a conflict between two Congressionally mandated statutes and ended up in its analysis saying one prevailed over the other. 
    That is quite a different story that we have here, when we have a clear Congressional mandate favoring arbitration, and for a court to say we have some theory here regarding an implied right of action that will overcome that Congressional mandate. 
    It seems that doesn't square with Wilco. 
    This Court in the Keating case made reference in a footnote to an attempt by the California Supreme Court to analogize Wilco, and this Court stated that Wilco was two federal Congressional statutes, and that it is a far different thing when you are dealing with a state's attempt to legislate a new exception to arbitration, and this Court didn't buy that, and said that the state could not legislate a new method to escape arbitration. 
    Well, if a state can't legislate it, how can a federal judge create it? 
    I will just finish with Wilco.

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    It might be. 
    But once again, that might indicate that perhaps a preferable way to go is to permit the arbitration to precede the trial of the federal securities law claim. 
    I just want to point out that the other thing which we mentioned where the Wilco analogy fails, I believe, is that the Wilco analogy did have the two Congressional statutes as opposed to an implied right, and I will just touch briefly in the time that I am going to have left here on the practical consequences of the intertwining theory. 
    It leads to forum shopping. 
    We have already discussed that, people looking around... now they look around for the right circuit, in addition to the right state or federal court. 
    It leads to uncertainties. 
    How can a lawyer advise a client for whom he has drafted an interstate commerce type contract that contains an arbitration, how can he say the courts will enforce this arbitration, because any clever lawyer trying to break it can just invent some claim perhaps which is not subject to arbitration under some decree of this court and "intertwine" it and it would... just rank uncertainty as to the enforceability of arbitration clauses. 
    The other thing that of course it would do, if you read the language of the Ninth Circuit opinion in this case, it encourages the federal district courts to use their own discretion in analyzing the facts alleged in the complaint to see if in their determination there is factual and legal intertwining. 
    It would create just a morass of additional burdens on the District Court. 
    Every time one of these cases come in, they have to take the time, analyze the complaint or the pleadings to that state to determine first if there is intertwining and then go from there. 
    I would like to reserve the balance. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Eric V. Benham
speaker="eric_v_benham" startTime="1653.224" stopTime="1755.942">
    Mr. Eric V. Benham 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, respondent in this case, Dr. Byrd, sees the issue before the Court as being whether the District Court has discretion to deny arbitration of claims which are otherwise arbitrable when those claims are factually and legally intertwined with a nonarbitrable federal securities claim. 
    This draws into question the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act and its impact on federal protective legislation. 
    Dr. Byrd starts from the premise that his claim under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is not arbitrable. 
    He did not seek arbitration of that claim in the District Court. 
    Nevertheless, the issue has been raised by the Securities Industry Association in their amicus brief. 
    In Wilco versus Swan, this Court held that arbitration of claims brought under the Securities Act of 1933 could not be impelled to be arbitrated. 
    While the Supreme Court has not held... ruled on whether '34 Act claims can be arbitrated, every Court of Appeal which has addressed the question has found that the logic of Wilco versus Swan is equally applicable to claims brought under the Securities and Exchange Act. 
    Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a rule requiring brokers to disclose that claims brought under the securities statutes are not subject to arbitration, and finding that the failure to disclose that fact is deceptive and fraudulent. 
    Consequently this case concerns only the arbitrability of the pending claims. 
    The Courts of Appeal which have addressed this issue are evenly split. 
    The Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits have held that the District Court has no discretion retain jurisdiction over pending claims.

    Mr. Eric V. Benham 
    It certainly would, Your Honor. 
    There is no question about that. 
    However, I would contend it is not before the Court, and it is not part of the motion that was made in the District Court, and that in any case if the Court does consider that issue, that it should determine that the '34 Act claims are not subject to arbitration based on the same reasoning as the Court applied in Wilco versus Swan. 
    The Circuit Courts of Appeal which have held that the District Courts do not have discretion to keep the pendent claims have done so on the basis of finding that the Arbitration Act compelled severance and separate arbitration in all circumstances without regard for the attendant conditions of that case. 
    The Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, however, have held that the District Courts have discretion to retain jurisdiction of the entire case to promote the protective purposes of federal protective legislation where the pending claims are factually and legally intertwined with the federal securities claim.

    No, Your Honor, it does not, as long as the case is tried in any court. 
    If it were actually tried in a state court for whatever reason, if under any circumstances the arbitration agreement were not enforceable, punitive damages could be obtained under the state law claims. 
    It is only in arbitration, and only in arbitration under the laws of the state of New York that punitive damages cannot be obtained.

    Mr. Eric V. Benham 
    You certainly are. 
    Despite the holding of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Dickenson versus Heinhold Securities, the Federal Arbitration Act does not expressly require a bifurcation and separate arbitration in a mixed claims case. 
    The question is whether that bifurcation is impliedly required. 
    We believe that an examination of the Congressional record behind the Arbitration Act and a balancing of the values at stake indicate that arbitration should not be compelled. 
    It was recently pointed out in Southland Corporation versus Keating that the legislative history of the Federal Arbitration Act indicates a limited Congressional purpose, to remove... impediments to the enforceability of arbitration agreements. 
    In Scherk versus Alberto Culver this Court stated that the purpose was 
    "to place arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts. " 
    and in Primo Paint Corporation versus Conklin Manufacturing Company it was to make those agreements 
    "as enforceable as other contracts but not more so. " 
    Now, in Moses H. Cone versus Mercury Construction Company and Southland Corporation versus Keating, this Court has expressed a strong... confirmed the strong federal policy favoring arbitration disputes, but a policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements does not require arbitration in all circumstances. 
    Indeed, Section 2 of the Arbitration Act provides for judicial exception. 
    Section 2 states that arbitration agreements are subject to revocation on such grounds as exist in law or equity for the revocation of any contract. 
    Since the grounds for such revocation are not specified in the Act, the judiciary may create such exceptions as are justified so long as they are not inconsistent with the Congressional purpose. 
    The intertwining doctrine is just such a judicially created exception, which is justified by three factors. 
    First, the impact of bifurcation on the federal securities claim, the additional time and expense of prosecuting two separate proceedings, and third, the adhesive nature of this arbitration agreement. 
    In Wilco versus Swan, this Court balanced two competing values, prompt and economical resolution of disputes through arbitration versus promotion of effective implementation of federal protective legislation. 
    In that case the promotion of the federal securities protective scheme was given priority. 
    This case involves the same values, but in a different context. 
    Bifurcation and separate arbitration will impact on the federal securities claim. 
    Under Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act, as I pointed out previously, the arbitration must proceed first, and in that case, as we have discussed, the collateral estoppel effect will interfere with the court's exclusive jurisdiction over the federal securities claim.

    Nevertheless, it is possible that a plaintiff may decide to forego the federal securities claim and proceed only on the state... the pending claims because of the delay and expense of resolving the entire matter. 
    Inasmuch as the federal legislation preserves the state law remedies and we consider that as part of the scheme, protective scheme that the state law remedies are preserved, to the extent that the plaintiff is put to a choice because he cannot perhaps afford the time and delay and expense of two separate proceedings, then he must make a choice, and it has an impact on the federal securities claim, albeit indirect.

    Mr. Eric V. Benham 
    That is true. 
    Dean Witter claims that in this case arbitration is a value which is entitled to priority, but severance and separate arbitration will not promote prompt and economic resolution of this dispute. 
    Rather, Dean Witter seeks arbitration in spite of it causing delay in efficiency and additional expense. 
    Petitioner cites numerous cases favoring arbitration, but arbitration has been favored because it promotes prompt and economical resolution of disputes, not because it is inherently better. 
    In Bernhardt versus Polygraphic Company of America, this Court recognized the shortcomings of arbitration, limited discovery, absence of any record or other articulation of the factual or legal conclusions, extremely limited right of review, no jury trial, no rules of evidence. 
    Despite these drawbacks, the benefits of arbitration are to be encouraged where they have been freely negotiated for by parties of equal bargaining power. 
    In both Wilco and Bernhardt this Court acknowledged the importance of the right to choose a judicial forum for the resolution of disputes. 
    That right should not be considered waived in advance without a showing that such waiver was knowing and intelligent. 
    Ultimately, the only value promoted by requiring a severance and separate arbitration in this case is arbitration itself. 
    Dean Witter relies on the sanctity of its contract as justification for compelling arbitration, but this is not a contract which is freely negotiated for by parties of equal bargaining power. 
    It is a standard form contract substantially identical in its terms to that which was before this Court more than 30 years ago in Wilco versus Swan, and which is used by the amici curiae and others throughout the securities industry in their customer agreements. 
    Dean Witter correctly points cut that the adhesive nature of a contract does not automatically make it unenforceable under California law. 
    It does, however, subject that agreement to special scrutiny, and the invalidation of provisions which are not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.

    Not directly whether it would be enforced.

    The only justifications for arbitration are that it is the agreement of the parties or that it is more efficient and economical.

    Mr. Eric V. Benham 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    As I indicated in the context of this case the justifications for arbitration are not present. 
    It would not be more economical. 
    It would not give effect to the agreement of the parties. 
    And it could adversely affect the federal securities claim. 
    Dean Witter relies on this Court's recent decisions in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital versus Mercury Construction Company and Southland Corporation versus Keating. 
    Those cases reaffirm the strong federal policy favoring arbitration, but they are readily distinguished from this case. 
    Neither involve federal protective legislation. 
    Both cases involve arbitration provisions which were prenegotiated by the parties. 
    In Southland versus Keating, the Court quoted Brayman versus Zapata Offshore Company. 
    The effect of the agreement was made at arm's length by parties experienced and sophisticated. 
    Finally, in Moses H. Cone and Southland the benefits of arbitration were available in part, in Southland because there was no bifurcation, and in Moses H. Cone because there was no bifurcation as to any particular defendant. 
    In conclusion, bifurcation and separate arbitration of the pending claims is not expressly required, and is counter to the goals of the Arbitration Act.

    --Whether there would be an adverse impact on the federal securities claim by severing the claims and sending them to arbitration. 
    Bifurcation and separate arbitration is not expressly required and is counter to the goals of the Arbitration Act. 
    It may adversely affect implementation of the federal securities laws, and it is a matter which is not freely bargained for by the parties. 
    This Court should recognize the intertwining doctrine as a valid, judicially created exception to the requirements of the Federal Arbitration Act. 
    It should approve the proper exercise of discretion by the District Judge retaining jurisdiction of the entire case, and it should affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    It is of interest to me that the attention of the argument focused quickly on punitive damages, which are, of course, not available under the federal laws. 
    Doesn't that indicate that the state issues substantially predominate in this case, and if that is the case, shouldn't we look to this Court's reasoning in United Mine Workers versus Gibbs, where this Court, in talking about the entertaining of pendent claims stated that if the state issues substantially predominate, if there would be different levels of proof, likelihood of perhaps confusion of the court or the jury, that the Court should feel free to dismiss those pendent claims rather than retainment. 
    And the argument--

    Mr. Eugene W. Bell 
    And to return to the question asked earlier about arbitration, I believe the rationale of the New York state opinion with regard to an arbitrator's power to award punitive damage would be applied in almost any state that considered it, and that is that punitive damages are not a matter of a plaintiff's right. 
    It is a way that a state has or a judicial system has of enforcing its policies and making sure that people don't have reckless disregard for those policies, and they are assessed against a person for reckless conduct. 
    They are not awarded to anybody. 
    He just happens to be the incidental beneficiary. 
    So, punitive damages aren't a matter of right, and I can see why the state would say that arbitrators aren't the people we want to feel we have empowered to award punitive damages and enforce this policy. 
    A question that was raised earlier with regard to the grounds of revoking under the Southland-Keating case, the Court recognized that in addition to whether it is a contractor involving maritime or interstate commerce, you could lock legitimately at any grounds that exist in law or in equity to revoke the contract generally. 
    And to say that the intertwining was a ground for revoking it just files in the face of the conduct, because once a court finds intertwining, he doesn't revoke the arbitration. 
    He says it can go forward, but in my discretion I will either let it go forward or I won't let it go forward. 
    He doesn't revoke the agreement and say that it is a nullity. 
    So that argument just doesn't seem to swing. 
    And lastly, with regard to the rebuttal on the question of freely bargained for contracts and the provisions in the contract, I have examined the record here. 
    There isn't one scintilla of evidence before this Court in the record that any facts were considered at any level by the District Court or beyond or even presented by Dr. Byrd that this contract was not freely negotiated, that he had any doubts about the contract, or that... I am sorry. 
    Thank you.
