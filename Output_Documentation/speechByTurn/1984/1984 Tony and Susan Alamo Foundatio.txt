Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The Court will hear arguments first this morning in the Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation v. the Secretary of Labor. 
    Mr. Gean, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="roy_r_gean_jr" startTime="23.180" stopTime="166.556">
    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the Alamo Foundation was an outgrowth of the activities of Tony and Susan Alamo in the Los Angeles area of California. 
    These two persons were street workers. 
    They went about the streets of Los Angeles and the surrounding suburbs during the '60s for the purpose of reaching those people who had become derelicts or were down-and-outers, with the gospel of Christ. 
    It was their intention to be evangelists, and in fact they were, and later they became pastors. 
    As evangelists, they met many young people who were at that stage in our nation's history when the hippies were quite active, and they had some very definite ideas about dress, codes of conduct, and general activities. 
    They had definite ideas about the attention to the laws of the United States and concern for others, which was contrary to the best interest of society and their neighbors. 
    Tony and Susan Alamo in their evangelistic activities reached many of these young people. 
    On one occasion which led to the organization of the Foundation and these people, many testified three of the people testified in regard to these matters. 
    As representatives of the entire group, these young people were contacted by the foundation and experienced the salvation that came from the gospel of Christ. 
    On one occasion, a young man who had been a dope peddler had been converted, and he was living with a group of young people, 20 or 30 of them, that were involved in the same activities. 
    He asked Tony and Susan Alamo if they would come home with him, a place that he had rented, and from which he was selling dope in the Los Angeles area to the young people and the other persons of that community who would buy from this sort of a peddler.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Mr. Gean, how many persons are affected by the holding in this case in the Court of Appeals?
speaker="roy_r_gean_jr" startTime="175.162" stopTime="191.523">
    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    Directly, Your Honor, with the Foundation, there are approximately 300 persons who are called associates. 
    I would term them, and they have been termed throughout many pages of the transcript and in the briefs, as pastors and evangelists.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="191.523" stopTime="197.277">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    How many in the whole pattern, the whole program?
speaker="roy_r_gean_jr" startTime="197.277" stopTime="208.835">
    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    Your Honor, this is a pentacostal group and it is quite common among pentacostal groups to not keep records of membership. 
    They have many churches.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="208.835" stopTime="214.572">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    I'm not speaking of members. 
    I'm speaking of employees, the people employed who are directly affected.
speaker="roy_r_gean_jr" startTime="214.572" stopTime="241.139">
    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    Those would be, Your Honor, the some 300 that are pastors and evangelists, and that is all that would be affected directly. 
    Of course, indirectly in other churches, or other religious activities throughout the United States, your decision here will have a far-reaching effect upon the activities of those people who are associated with like or similar foundations or like or similar religious churches.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="241.139" stopTime="248.543">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, in round numbers, how many people? 
    Several thousand?
speaker="roy_r_gean_jr" startTime="248.543" stopTime="287.687">
    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    I would say hundreds of thousands of people, Your Honor. 
    I would say those people that are associated with the church to which I belong, which has some 12 to 15 million in the United States. 
    Many of them are similar to my situation. 
    I think my church will be affected by your decision in this particular matter and the type of activities to which I am allowed to participate on a volunteer basis without the necessity of being required to take a wage or to have some benefit given to me because of my activities. 
    So I hope I am answering your question, Your Honor, by--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="287.687" stopTime="294.174">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    I had the impression there were a great many more people directly involved than 300.
speaker="roy_r_gean_jr" startTime="294.174" stopTime="377.309">
    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    --Well, also it swings, Your Honor, around the 300 associates who are pastors and evangelists. 
    Those people who are in training or those people who are actually involved as pastors and evangelists in churches that are affiliated with a foundation across the United States, from New York to Washington, to Miami, to Omaha, to Dallas, to Nashville, to Los Angeles, for the churches of this particular religious organization. 
    And they are manned and staffed by these pastors and evangelists who are involved in training and teaching primarily in Alma, Arkansas where there are some 37 different activities that the Secretary of Labor claims are activities of such a nature that it is demanding upon this Court that they decide that they are so commercial in nature, these activities that are performed by the pastors and evangelists, that they are so commercial in nature that they must come under the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    I hope I've answered your question, Your Honor. 
    There are many people that will be affected by this decision indirectly. 
    Those that are directly affected are some approximate 300 associates, which are termed pastors and evangelists.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="377.309" stopTime="385.665">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, are they engaged in the production of goods, or are they engaged in evangelistic missionary type of work?
speaker="roy_r_gean_jr" startTime="385.665" stopTime="437.283">
    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    Your Honor, their activities are religious. 
    The District Court found that all of their activities were religious, that these activities were religious and they were carried on for religious purposes. 
    That's what the District Court found. 
    And the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit also found the same thing. 
    Now, I think that there is a difference in their opinion. 
    There are discrepancies in the opinion of both the courts because of the fact that they allege that the activities of these people, these some 300 associates, pastors and evangelists, are solely all of their activities are solely for religious purposes. 
    And then they decide that the activities are of such a nature that they are commercial and therefore they should come within the confines of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I am not for certain about that particular case, and I don't recall all of the facts that's in that particular case. 
    I can say that in reference to, I believe, what you're pointing out there, in this particular case the Alamo Foundation does not have to pay Social Security taxes. 
    That's part of the Internal Revenue exemption. 
    And their determination in their exemption, which is a part of the Appendix, sets forth that they do not have to pay Social Security taxes, and it's so set forth in their determination that they are a religious organization, organized under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    They are exempted from the collection and the payment of Social Security taxes by virtue of that determination. 
    It so sets forth in their determination.

    Your Honor, those were the eight employees that were involved at the beginning of the Foundation's activities that were ceased prior to the time that the District Court heard this matter, and it was agreed that those parties were employees. 
    And for example, the record in bookkeeping activity, Mr. Alamo provided that there was some overtime wage that had to be paid to those people, and it amounts to approximately $14,000. 
    For example, one of the gentlemen was earning $600 a week and he worked sometimes more than 40 hours. 
    And the Secretary of Labor came and said look, you're receiving $600 a week, and at 40 hours you're getting $15 an hour, but when you work for 42 hours for that particular week, why you're entitled to the overtime pay.

    Yes, sir. 
    Now, to explain that. 
    They have 300 people that are associates. 
    There are some wives or husbands, as the case may be. 
    These people are basically pentecostal. 
    That is their doctrine pentecostal. 
    Have the charismatic approach to the gospel, they believe in the teachings of Jesus, and the commands and directions that were given to the apostles are for this particular day. 
    The healing and sign gifts, they claim, is part of their religious activity. 
    And they believe that that's the instruction. 
    And there are thousands, millions of people across the United States in the pentecostal movements that have exactly the same doctrinal teachings and understandings of the gospel.

    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    Well, I think the attitude, the desire, and the belief of the individual has a great deal of control over it. 
    I think that that's the main thrust. 
    And if these people are not paid a wage or derive some compensation in the form of a salary, then I do not believe that they're covered by the Act. 
    If what they say and, Your Honor, there were three people that testified as representative of all of these this was agreed upon, to be done in this fashion for the purpose of having a concise record and a brief record for the Court or any appellate court to which this case might be taken. 
    These three people testified as representatives. 
    At the pretrial conference before the hearing that was held in April of 1982, it was agreed by the attorney, the general counsel from or the trial counsel from Dallas, Texas that this would be agreeable with him that these three people who testified and there were Bill Levy, Ann Elmore, and Edward Mick that these three people would be representatives of all of those that would testify. 
    There were 155 affidavits given by more than half of those people that were associates of the Foundation to the Secretary of Labor's attorney. 
    And the court said now, if you find in these affidavits or in your own investigation that these people are not representative, and you want others to testify, you certainly have that right to do so. 
    There was not any of the others called. 
    These three people that testified, Your Honor, in regard to this very thing about which you're questioning me said that it would be repugnant to them to claim that what they were doing was for a wage. 
    Yes, some of them worked at various times within these various activities, or as the Secretary of Labor calls common business activities. 
    But also these three people, every one of them, testified that they worked outside the Foundation. 
    Every one of them testified to that, or that they had income upon which they could live. 
    Every one of them. 
    Ann Elmore testified that she had outside income coming to her. 
    She testified, when she was asked by the Secretary of Labor, well, suppose that you needed some assistance; what would you do for the benefits that you need to live? 
    And she said, well, we'd go out and get them. 
    Now, the Secretary of Labor interpreted that as meaning that they would go out into the Foundation and in the Foundation's activities and work and get these benefits. 
    She didn't mean that at all. 
    If you would read all of her testimony, what she was saying was, if they did not have the benefit, they would go outside the Foundation and work, which many of them did. 
    Some completely all of their time was devoted outside the Foundation, even though they were associates. 
    They worked in none of these related as the Internal Revenue declared, these are related activities under the Internal Revenue Agency of the United States.

    --I believe that's true. 
    Now, why require it? 
    Why have an exercise in futility? 
    Why make these people take the money and then give it back to the Foundation, when at the very beginning and we have three cases that we have been arguing to the District Court and to the Circuit Court of Appeals that addresses this very question, and the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals never commented on those three cases. 
    That's the Turner v. Unification, Rogers v. Schenkel, and this Court's decision in Rawlings v. Portland Terminal, where these people worked in business activities, agreed-upon were common business activities and were common businesses, and these people did not want a wage, they did not expect a wage, they so stated, and this Court in Rawlings v. Portland Terminal, said that they didn't have to receive it and they were not covered by the Act. 
    The same thing is true in the First Circuit in regard to the Turner v. Unification Church, which is almost identical to this particular case. 
    Very little difference. 
    Now, the Secretary of Labor is trying to point out that difference, but I would like to reserve that on rebuttal, if I may.

    Mr. Charles Fried 
    --They may be professional ministers. 
    The question would be in their activities in the gas stations, in the restaurants and so on, are they working as professional ministers? 
    And it is our contention, of course, that they are not. 
    As to the testimony, I must point out that in addition to the three representative present associates, there was testimony from a number of former associates, which is also in the record and which we have summarized, which of course is in many respects contradictory to the testimony of the present associates. 
    In 1961, the Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards Act for the stated purpose of extending wages and hours protection to persons working in the ordinary commercial enterprises of churches and other charities. 
    Now, this was accomplished by applying the Act to an enterprise engaged in commerce, and then defining an enterprise as 
    "related activities performed for a common business purpose. " 
    The court below found as a fact that the petitioner operated a number of ordinary businesses serving the public in competition with other businesses. 
    And it should be quite clear and I refer now to pages 9 and 10 and 38 and 39 of the Appendix to the Petitioner for Certiorari that the District Court limited the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act only to those associates who were working in these commercial businesses and only insofar as they were working in those commercial businesses.

    And Congress did in the debate indicate an assumption that nuns would not be covered when they worked in the ministry of healing the sick, but that must be on the assumption that they were in fact operating as nurses, and nurses are, of course, professionals.

    The Petitioners state, and for the first time in their reply brief cite Section 512, stating that this was determined to be unrelated business income. 
    There is nothing in the record to support that conclusion, and indeed the letter which Petitioners cite in their Appendix says specifically and I refer to page 14 of that Appendix: 
    "In this letter we are not determining whether any of your present or proposed activities are unrelated trade or business as defined in Section 513. " 
    Now, we were quite disturbed to find this reference to the Act in the reply brief for the first time, and were told by the Internal Revenue Service first that they are unable to give us any information regarding the specific tax status of the Petitioners, unless the Petitioners were willing to waive their protections under the Privacy Act; and second, that the Service has regularly taken the position on facts similar to these and I have the citation for Your Honor if you wish them that such facts would constitute the businesses unrelated business income and the services would not be considered contributed services, since they were rendered in return for board and lodging.

    Mr. Charles Fried 
    I think the question of rehabilitative services is a difficult one, and the Portland Terminal case is very important in this regard because if the employees are working for their own benefits and the Portland Terminal care spoke, if I may quote from that case, accepting the unchallenged findings here that the railroads which was the putative employer received no 
    "immediate advantage from any work done by the trainees, we hold that they are not employees within the meaning of the Act. " 
    Now, in the thrift store example, there is of course the receipt of an immediate advantage, and so the question of coverage would be posed in a way it surely was not posed in the Portland Terminal case and is not posed by candy stripers working in a hospital gift shop or museum gift shop.

    Mr. Charles Fried 
    Well, there is considerable testimony from the former associates and of particular importance is Ann Elmore who's a present associate, chosen by Petitioners as a representative associate, who said, and I quote: 
    "If you want to eat, you've got to work. " 
    That's on page 76 of the Joint Appendix. 
    And on page 78 of the Joint Appendix Ann Elmore, who is a chosen representative by the Petitioners, says: 
    "And, of course, you do expect the benefits? " 
    Question. 
    Answer: 
    "Well, the benefits are just a matter of of course, we went out and we worked for them. " 
    Now, the former associates are a good bit clearer on this point. 
    For instance, I believe that it is Judy Shapiro who says on page 218 that when she was ill or when she was prevented from working because of inclement weather, and she sent to the restaurant for food, she was admonished that that food she should have procured out of her own funds because while she was not working, she was not entitled to get these in kind benefits. 
    So there was ample testimony in the record to substantiate the court's finding that they contemplated that they would be fed, clothed, and sheltered as a result of their work at the Foundation's commercial businesses, quid pro quo.

    Well, if they were sales persons, then they would clearly be covered. 
    If they were managers of the store, the managers, bona fide managers, are excluded by the terms of the statute. 
    We also have waitresses, persons who work pumping gas, people working on labor crews for construction companies, women sewing clothing in clothing factories who could not be viewed as managers or professionals in any sense. 
    Now, petitioners do urge that the associates and we do not question work out of a sense of devotion, and that they would have volunteered their efforts even if they hadn't received these benefits. 
    And again, we don't question that because that's not truly relevant. 
    I suppose there are many people, many people in this courtroom today, who do work which they consider valuable enough and interesting enough that they would, if they could afford it, carry it on even if not compensated. 
    But that hardly constitutes any of us not employees for that reason.

    It's not without it isn't a religious activity, but it's not without its religious connotations.

    "prevent an unfair method of competition. " 
    The second distinction is the finding of the District Court here that many of these associates and I quote again from the record

    Mr. Charles Fried 
    It would in at the extremes, Your Honor, but I think it's very important to recognize in this case that though Petitioners repeat that their businesses did not run at a profit... and they say this again and again, even though that statement is unsubstantiated by anything but Mr. Alamo's testimony... they also say that the extensive non-commercial missionary work of the Foundation had as a principal source of support these commercial businesses. 
    Now, I think those two statements are simply contradictory. 
    And businesses which are able to support such extensive missionary activities could hardly be carried on on a merely casual basis. 
    Furthermore, there is testimony from Ann Wiley, for instance, to the effect that persons were assigned to their work in the businesses. 
    To be sure, Mr. Levy who testified for the Association, testified to the contrary; that he did work in the restaurant when the spirit moved him. 
    But the contradictory testimony is that that work was done pursuant to rather careful scheduling under the direct supervision of Mr. Alamo. 
    What we contend and what this Court has consistently held under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the analogous provisions of the Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act, that who is an employee does not depend on self-designation. 
    In fact, the whole history of these acts is a history of various arrangements sought to be designated cooperative, sought to be designated independent contractors, and this Court has consistently said that what controls is the economic reality. 
    And here the court found as a fact that the economic reality was one of a quid pro quo; that the persons received shelter and housing... and I quote again... 
    "as a result of their work. " 
    That finding was confirmed by the Court of Appeals and, with respect, I don't believe is a matter for review in this Court.

    We don't dispute that. 
    We consider it irrelevant. 
    There are many reasons why people work. 
    And I hope that the getting of a wage is not the only reason. 
    But that they were working only for rehabilitation is what we would dispute in the face of the District Court's finding. 
    Moreover, rehabilitation does suggest rehabilitation for something else, and these associates worked many years within the Foundation. 
    It's not as if they were rehabilitated and then went on for work elsewhere in the economy, as was the case--

speaker="charles_fried" startTime="3319.977" stopTime="3481.982">
    Mr. Charles Fried 
    We have no substantial quarrel with the rationale in the Court of Appeals, Your Honor. 
    I can think of no point where we would differ with the Court of Appeals. 
    I would like to pass, if I may, to the Petitioner's claim that the application to the associates of the Fair Labor Standards Act violates the religion clauses. 
    It's rather difficult in respect to the associates to understand precisely what the burden upon them is. 
    They claim at one point that it would prevent them from being free to contribute their labor, but of course that's not so. 
    They are free to contribute to their labor; what they are not free to do is to exchange their labor for material benefits at less than the minimum wage; nor, it should be said, is there anything akin to a vow of poverty. 
    Indeed, a number of the associates testified that they were rather proud of the prosperity of the Foundation and of the prosperity in which they shared. 
    I refer to the testimony of Mr. Mick who spoke at some length about the three bedroom house and washer and dryer that he enjoyed. 
    This was not a monastic arrangement. 
    So perhaps what we have here is some kind of an entanglement argument, but in either event, this is a case where this Court's rationale in United States v. Lee applies and applies with considerable force. 
    Here we have a compelling state interest to protect against substandard wages and to protect against "an unfair method of competition" and a purpose which could scarcely be pursued without the comprehensiveness of the statute, more so than in Lee, because it is not merely an administrative or actuarial comprehensiveness that's necessary. 
    What is necessary is to protect third parties, competing businesses, from the effect of substandard wages paid by a competitor. 
    So it's hard to see how in the holdings of this Court, from the Jacobson case through United States v. Lee, we would not see a compelling state purpose in this case which could not readily be served other than by applying the Fair Labor Standards Act to the Foundation and the associates. 
    I thank the Court for its attention.

    Mr. Roy R. Gean, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Your Honor, in my concluding remarks in this last minute, I would like to point out to the Court that this is a far-reaching matter that has been presented to this particular Court. 
    The question is whether or not the state does have a compelling interest to govern these activities and to say these activities on the part of these pastors and evangelists are such that they should be covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    It is our position that if these activities are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act and the position that everybody knows, that these people are going to take the money that they receive from the Foundation and give it back to the Foundation, what is the state's compelling interest to govern and to rule under the Fair Labor Standards Act as to the activities, the benefits, the wages, the salaries that they may receive?
