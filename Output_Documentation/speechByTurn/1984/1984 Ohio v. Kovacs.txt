    Mr. E. Dennis Muchnicki 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this matter is before the Court pursuant to a petition filed by the people of the State of Ohio, seeking a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    The people of Ohio seek reversal of the determination that a bankruptcy court may discharge the duty of a debtor to comply with the state court injunction to abate a public health hazard by cleaning up a hazardous waste... a toxic waste facility. 
    In this argument, Ohio wishes to make three basic points. 
    First, as a matter of public policy, the decision below treats the goals of the bankruptcy system as absolute values which transcend virtually every other matter of public policy, including the protection of public health and safety. 
    Secondly, as to the factual context of this case, Ohio is not before this Court seeking compensation for past harm or expenses, but rather we are attempting to prevent future harm by obtaining compliance with an injunction to abate an ongoing nuisance and health hazard.

    No, it has not, Your Honor. 
    The drums... the drums that were... the materials that were in the drums or that remain in the drums have been removed, but the most serious problem that still exists is the pollution of the ground water which is used by the City of Hamilton for its water supply. 
    And right now, as a result of the past practices on that site, the soils of the site are so thoroughly saturated with toxic wastes that they are now an ongoing source of pollution, that every day more pollution is leaching into the ground water and you have a continuing violation.

    Mr. E. Dennis Muchnicki 
    We did... yes, we did, Your Honor. 
    We argued, first of all, that the drums were there and they, in themselves, were a hazard. 
    And we were pretty sure, because of the past operational practices and stuff leaching into the soil, that there was ground water contamination, and we did point out the soil was contaminated and had to be removed. 
    Yet, in the opinion below, or in all three of the opinions, there is no discussion of that interest. 
    The sole focal point is on the interest of the debtor. 
    It treats bankruptcy, basically, as an absolute right where the bankruptcy judge basically determines the relevance of the rest of the United States Code, or in the laws of the states. 
    It's as though bankruptcy is always the supreme policy. 
    Now, the Third Circuit, in the recent Penn Terra case, recognizes that on its face, the bankruptcy code recognizes that there are other policies which at times are to prevail... one of which, specifically referenced, is protection of the environment. 
    In the automatic statutory stay provisions, Congress said we did not want to interfere with the states and their police power enforcement activities; in the removal provisions, so that you cannot remove an enforcement action to the bankruptcy court; in 28 USC 959B, there is a specific provision requiring trustees to operate in compliance with state law. 
    In the legislative history of section 105 dealing with discretionary stays, there is specific reference to the fact that any discretionary injunction must protect the legitimate interest of the state in its law enforcement. 
    Thus, in Penn Terra, they recognized that the bankruptcy code is one title of the United States Code; it does not overrule everything else. 
    Similarly, the court below did not recognize the repeated holdings of this Court which have held that there will not be a preemptive effect created... preemption of state regulation, absent clear and expressed congressional language.

    Normally, in most states, if there is a fire, for example, and a building is imposing a hazard after the fire is over, falling debris and collapsing walls, there is inherent authority in the local governments to go in and take care of it if the owners don't. 
    Now, isn't there something like that in Ohio?

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, you can hire people to do it. 
    The city council doesn't go out and tear the walls down of a partially burned building, but they hire somebody to do it if the owner doesn't do it.

    Mr. E. Dennis Muchnicki 
    The fact of the matter is, if you look at the situation, I'll give you an example of what Ohio is facing with leached toxic waste sites. 
    We have 28 sites right now on the national priority list. 
    We have 23 more that are being evaluated for placement on it. 
    We have 800 more that we are still investigating. 
    We don't have the money to clean those all up.

    Mr. E. Dennis Muchnicki 
    Well, yes, money will be required to take up the site. 
    But what we are concerned about is how Congress treated this, and what did Congress decide in terms of the definition of claim? 
    And I think when you look at that language, the claim is to find, in terms of equitable remedies, and whether we can compel the debtor to perform the injunction, the definition of claim for equitable remedy says 
    "an equitable remedy for breach of performance, if the breach gives rise from an alternative right to payment. " 
    Now, to begin with, the breach of performance is a contractual phrase. 
    It does not refer to violations of law. 
    Indeed, when you think about the difference between a contractual situation where two people voluntarily agree to do something, in this situation where the public has not agreed to have Mr. Kovacs impose his obligations on the people of Hamilton, you can see it's a whole different thing than the breach of performance we talk about in contracts. 
    Similarly, here we do not have an alternative right to payment. 
    Any payment would be made to effectuate the injunction. 
    In fact, the court below even recognizes, and Mr. Kovacs recognizes in his brief, that any payment made here is not an alternative to performance; it is to facilitate the performance. 
    So we have a completely different situation than the contract, which is the example in the legislative history. 
    And when you search through the legislative history or the language of the code, there is nothing which suggests that an injunction to evade an ongoing threat is dischargable in bankruptcy. 
    Indeed, the language is clearly to the contrary, as is the legislative history.

    --Well, Your Honor, let me give you an example of what we encountered previously in the bankruptcy court. 
    The first time we appeared... when we filed the mere motion requesting... for the hearing to determine what his current status was, and then the debtor moved for imposition of the stay, the bankruptcy judge... his first question was why he should not hold me in contempt. 
    And I didn't feel I had done anything other than ask for a hearing, an informational hearing. 
    And the bankruptcy judge made it quite clear that he construed this to be very broad, and therefore I tend to think that if I were to file a motion to hold Mr. Kovacs in contempt, that would be viewed as an attempt to compel him to pay and the bankruptcy court would find me--

    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    --Yes, Your Honor, I think you're headed in that direction. 
    The principal mistake seems to be in assuming that it makes no difference to the State or to the Federal Government in an enforcement action whether we get compliance with the injunction or whether we get money. 
    In fact, it makes a significant difference. 
    Hazardous waste sites are quite complex to clean up. 
    They require years of effort, long-term monitoring, and the important purpose that an injunction serves, that money doesn't serve, is that it keeps the responsible party present and under the supervision of the court until the cleanup is accomplished. 
    What Respondent is essentially arguing for and what the Sixth Circuit agreed with is a buyout of your obligations under the injunction which does not protect the public, because we don't know at the time of the buyout whether or not the amount that the injunction is exchanged for will be sufficient to protect the public health in the long term.

    Before these waste dumps were opened and operated, did they secure a license of some kind from the State?
speaker="kathryn_a_oberly" startTime="1372.861" stopTime="1382.934">
    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    Not in this case, Your Honor. 
    New dumps now do have to be permitted under federal law, and presumably Ohio has comparable state law. 
    But that is not the case--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1382.934" stopTime="1386.603">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Is the Ohio state law something since this event arose?
speaker="kathryn_a_oberly" startTime="1386.603" stopTime="1399.076">
    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    --Yes, Your Honor, it is. 
    But both federal and state law impose basically strict liability for leaving hazardous wastes behind, even if it was done before the new permitting requirements.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1399.076" stopTime="1408.784">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    But if ultimately there isn't any money anywhere in the private source to do this, where lies the obligation?

    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    Well, the obligation still lies with the responsible party, but then it falls to the public to pick up the tab for the responsible party is--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1417.557" stopTime="1423.211">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Because the State allowed them to do it, either by license or by leave.

    That he's made it impossible by getting a ruling from the bankruptcy court that this debt is dischargeable and therefore the receiver has no assets, whether pre-bankruptcy or post-petitioner earnings, that he can use to effectuate this cleanup.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Do you say this is a debt, or is it something else?

    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    No, Your Honor. 
    We agree with Ohio that it is not a debt that was intended to be covered by the bankruptcy code. 
    The code, we feel, was intended to deal with basically contractual and commercial obligations, and this is a classic example of something that is not contractual. 
    The public didn't contract with Mr. Kovacs. 
    There is no contract at all here. 
    There's a breach and defiance, if you will, of a state court injunctive order. 
    That is not, in our view, something the bankruptcy code was intended to address.

    I think that what's most important is that the state court that issued this injunction and the order appointing a receiver be given an opportunity to decide whether Kovacs has discharged his obligations and whether or not he's interfered with the receiver. 
    And I don't think it's appropriate to have bankruptcy judges, who have no expertise in environmental obligations, determining whether or not that state court injunction has been satisfied.

    --May I ask... assuming that we have two insolvent people here, apparently, both Kovacs and the State of Ohio. 
    Supposing both had hundreds of millions of dollars, had all the money in the world to do the work, could the injunctive obligation then be cashed in to--
speaker="kathryn_a_oberly" startTime="1742.666" stopTime="1748.204">
    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    No, Your Honor. 
    We would take the position it can't. 
    First of all, we don't have all the money in the world. 
    So that's--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1748.204" stopTime="1751.122">
    Justice Stevens 
    --No, but why couldn't Ohio do the cleanup and say pay us back?
speaker="kathryn_a_oberly" startTime="1751.122" stopTime="1761.414">
    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    --For two reasons that I gave. 
    The first is that you can't really estimate what the cost of cleanup is going to be at the time an injunction is entered, and so an injunction--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1761.414" stopTime="1763.414">
    Justice Stevens 
    But you know it by the time you do the work.
speaker="kathryn_a_oberly" startTime="1763.414" stopTime="1784.493">
    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    --No, you may not, Your Honor, because 20 years from now, you may find out that the remedial measures you took, the containment measures to clean up ground water, your monitoring of ground water, proves that the problem hasn't been solved. 
    And if you've left the Defendant buy out on day one, the State and the public are left holding the bag for any additional remedial measures that aren't covered.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1784.493" stopTime="1794.385">
    Justice Stevens 
    Do you think a person who gets, in this sort of situation, who has millions and millions of dollars, there is no way in the world he can discharge his obligation by paying the State whatever they think is necessary?
speaker="kathryn_a_oberly" startTime="1794.385" stopTime="1836.478">
    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    I think that's correct. 
    We do in federal cases sometimes settle for money at the outset, but the releases are worded in such a way that if it turns out the money we settled for is not adequate to protect the problem down the road, five years from now or ten years from now we discover the contamination has spread and it's not been sufficiently contained or removed, we have drafted a consent decree that keeps those defendants on the hook, so to speak, and does not release them for their original buy-out amount. 
    And the reason is that neither the Federal Government... we have three insolvent parties here. 
    Neither the Federal Government, nor Ohio, nor Mr. Kovacs has enough money to deal with what is an enormous problem, not just at this site, but nationwide. 
    And I would like--

 Ms. Oberly, this is sort of like ships passing in the night. 
 Wouldn't you be satisfied if the State of Ohio was free to go into a local court and say, look, your obligation under the injunction, your obligation to clean up is not a claim, and the federal court hasn't said it is. 
 You're under an order to clean up, and you're still under the order. 
 Now, get with it and work or face contempt.

    But in the new bankruptcy 1984 statute that was passed this summer... it provides that when a bankruptcy court is called upon to decide matters involving laws in addition to the bankruptcy code, that those can go directly to the district court, Federal District Court. 
    That still would not solve my problem, because I believe this belongs in state court to determine the extent of Kovacs's obligations under the injunction. 
    But if we at least get it in a court that's slightly more familiar with balancing bankruptcy against environmental obligations, then I don't think that that--

    --That's correct. 
    If I may say one other thing, the Super Fund, which is a code name for a federal statute that's been passed several years ago to provide money to clean up hazardous waste sites, has been entered into this case or injected into this case somewhat late, and no one has really properly briefed it, and I leave it up to the Court, but it may be that the Court would wish further briefing or a memo about the effect of Super Fund and federal monies. 
    Since I have not had time to address it, probably the other parties won't either.

   Argument of David A. Caldwell
speaker="david_a_caldwell" startTime="2094.279" stopTime="2220.026">
    Mr. David A. Caldwell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I think in analyzing this obligation, there is really only one point in time which is relevant, and that is on the date of bankruptcy, September 2, 1980. 
    It matters little what the nature of the obligation was a year before that. 
    The only critical thing is what obligation did the bankrupt owe on the date of bankruptcy. 
    You recall by that time, the Chem-Dyne site had been in the possession of a receiver for nearly eight months, and also in possession of all of Mr. Kovacs's then existing assets. 
    Now, this receivership was imposed in order to enforce the agreed judgment entry of July 1979. 
    Whether we call that judgment entry injunction or whatever, it's clear that it came about as a result of an agreed settlement of a disputed lawsuit. 
    The State of Ohio, with all of its expertise in July of 1979, made a value judgment that they should accept the agreement of Bill Kovacs to pay for some dead fish and to remove the waste stored on the surface of the site, period. 
    And the entry recites that that is a compromise, et cetera, et cetera. 
    And the Attorney General admits that that agreement was made in full satisfaction of the obligations of Kovacs. 
    Now, admittedly, the obligation to clean up the surface was not performed by Mr. Kovacs. 
    That's why the receiver was appointed.

    --I think it's a necessary characteristic, if you're talking about an obligation here that involves the expenditure of millions of dollars, you're talking about a human being who has a family to support, and you take everything he owns; can you imagine any State court, after the money is all gone, holding him in contempt because he doesn't quit his job in New Jersey and come back here and clean up that site? 
    I think that would be an aberration in equity jurisprudence.

    Mr. David A. Caldwell 
    --He failed to cooperate by filing bankruptcy. 
    He availed himself with the fresh start that is the very spirit of the bankruptcy laws. 
    The State has ignored the fact that throughout this... and I've never seen an answer to it... that what the State settled for here was the surface cleanup. 
    Now, they obviously found later that some of these chemicals that seeped into soil and so on, obviously what they found out was that maybe they didn't make such a good deal. 
    Well, that's all well and good, but I don't think the State of Ohio can now be heard to say you, Kovacs, have to clean up the soil underneath. 
    And the real significance of this is that everything Kovacs was obligated to do has now been performed, and the cost of that is liquidated, and there's no question that that obligation, that bill, is dischargable in bankruptcy. 
    The only difference, in effect, between now and back in September of 1980 is that now the obligation is liquidated. 
    We have a dollar figure. 
    The money has been spent. 
    And we know that claims in bankruptcy are dischargable, not based on the fact of whether they're liquidated or unliquidated.

    I think, even if you disagree, that the whole obligation of Kovacs is now performed, you're still looking at a money obligation. 
    All of it may not be liquidated as of today, but it's still something that somebody else is going to do.

    Well, since the adoption of the 1978 Code, the determination of the dischargability of bankruptcy claims has been pretty well lodged in the Federal court. 
    Now, back when I started practice, you could run through bankruptcy and then later sue on it in State court, and the State court would determine whether that claim was discharged. 
    Well, that practice--

    Now, the State and the Federal Government have indicated many times, over and over in this case, that the rulings of the court below are seriously hampering the enforcement efforts of the State and Federal Government. 
    And I say that that simply is not so. 
    You look at this case; they succeeded in putting Mr. Kovacs out of business in very short order, taking all of his assets and applying them to the cleanup. 
    Now, what would be the consequences of reversal? 
    Would it really accomplish what the State claims they're seeking, if they could garnish Mr. Kovacs's wages once a month?

    Mr. David A. Caldwell 
    Right. 
    They settled with some companies. 
    Some of them didn't settle. 
    Presumably, they'll get the cost of the rest of it from these companies. 
    Now that cost is, of course, passed on. 
    But I don't think a realistic answer to the problem is denying an individual a discharge in bankruptcy, because it isn't going to bring about the result that the State desires, the needs in this matter.

    Mr. David A. Caldwell 
    You can certainly make an argument that they are dischargable. 
    The legislative history which has been quoted in here, more in the State's brief and ours, tends to indicate that what Congress was concerned about was the dischargability of an obligation relating to future conduct. 
    Don't do this in the future.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3304.092" stopTime="3314.983">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, if what you have suggested to us... and your colleague, your friend seemed to imply the same thing... the cost of meeting this problem is going to run into millions or hundreds of millions.
speaker="david_a_caldwell" startTime="3314.983" stopTime="3315.383">
    Mr. David A. Caldwell 
    No question.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3315.383" stopTime="3323.589">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Then, isn't the question of dischargability in bankruptcy really academic, unless this man wins a billion dollar lottery or something?
speaker="david_a_caldwell" startTime="3323.589" stopTime="3389.198">
    Mr. David A. Caldwell 
    Well, you may be correct, Your Honor. 
    I know that in my experience it's much easier to avoid paying a $10 million judgment than it is a $1,000 judgment. 
    And my client is not an irresponsible person. 
    If he were, he would have moved to Australia by now. 
    He is going on... he has a background in chemical engineering. 
    He has a right to a discharge, and he's interested in protecting his right. 
    To give the State of Ohio the right to destroy his life by garnishing his wages every month or so would deny him that right. 
    That's really what we're talking about. 
    It's academic in the sense that a reversal will never give the State what it wants unless the Attorney General is somebody out of Charles Dickens. 
    It could only be a punitive thing; it couldn't achieve anything of worthwhile value in cleaning up the environment.

    Justice Stevens 
    May I ask a factual question? 
    I understood Ms. Oberly to say that he has, in fact, been discharged. 
    The discharge is already complete. 
    Is that right? 
    I thought it was-- 
    --Yes. 
    He has been granted a discharge. 
    He has been. 
    And it's a total discharge with no continuing obligation of any kind?

    Mr. E. Dennis Muchnicki 
    --Well, here is the status of the property. 
    The property... the Chem-Dyne is owned by Hierco Realty, which is a partnership; it was part of the bankruptcy. 
    The partners of Hierco Realty are Mr. Kovacs and the Chem-Dyne Corporation which is not in the bankruptcy. 
    The net effect is that neither the bankruptcy trustee nor the State court receiver could figure out who owned the property or who had it, but the bankruptcy trustee said he didn't want it.
