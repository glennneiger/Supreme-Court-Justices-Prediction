    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on the government's petition for writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit suppressing a truckload of marijuana seized from the respondents on the ground that the discovery of the marijuana was the fruit of an unduly prolonged detention.

    Well, it was a... this was a pickup truck with a camper shell.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    The case began when there was an operation to investigate suspected smuggling, marijuana smuggling in the... it was believed to be occurring either in the northernmost coastal county of South Carolina or the southernmost coastal county of North Carolina. 
    And the main actor on the law enforcement side was DEA Agent Cooke, who was patrolling the highways near the beaches where the marijuana activity was suspected to be occurring, and he saw the pickup truck with camper shell, which turned out to be driven by respondent Savage, proceeding in tandem with a Pontiac automobile, which turned out to be driven by respondent Sharpe. 
    Being suspicious of these vehicles, he followed them for some 20 miles as they proceeded south and observed certain things about them which to his mind confirmed his suspicion that they might be engaged in marijuana smuggling. 
    He determined at that point that he might like to make a stop, and he radioed for assistance, and Patrolman Thrasher of the South Carolina State Police joined this procession of vehicles as it proceeded toward Myrtle Beach, and shortly after Thrasher joined the procession, the pickup truck and the car made a turn onto a camp road, sped along that road well in excess of the speed limit. 
    The road made a loop and returned to the main highway. 
    They were followed all this time by Agent Cooke and Patrolman Thrasher. 
    They turned back on the main highway headed south. 
    At that point it was decided by Agent Cooke that they should be stopped for investigation. 
    He asked Thrasher to signal them to halt. 
    Thrasher did so. 
    When he did so, the Pontiac automobile driven by Sharpe pulled over to the side. 
    The truck driven by respondent Savage sped off in between the patrolman's car and the Pontiac down the road. 
    At this point, Patrolman Thrasher followed the truck down the road and Agent Cooke stopped with the Pontiac. 
    He asked Sharpe for identification. 
    Sharpe produced a license in the name of Raymond J. Pavlovich. 
    Cooke made some further efforts to communicate with Thrasher which were initially unsuccessful. 
    At the same time, he called for backup units from the Myrtle Beach Police to come and hold Sharpe and his passenger while he went on to see if he could locate the truck. 
    He went down the road, caught up half a mile down the road with Patrolman Thrasher and the truck, and in the meanwhile, to come back to that stopping, Thrasher had pursued the truck, stopped it half a mile down the road. 
    Savage had been ordered out of the vehicle or had been coming out of the vehicle. 
    It is not quite clear. 
    He was frisked. 
    He was then asked for license and registration. 
    He produced a bill of sale in the name also of Raymond J. Pavlovich, and at that point he was simply held by Agent Thrasher... by Officer Thrasher until Agent Cooke appeared on the scene.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I think there is clearly an outer limit, because you would have to ask yourself whether it is reasonable under the circumstances to take some other means. 
    The reason why the detention was extended in this case was quite clearly because Officer Thrasher didn't know... he was acting as agent for Cooke in making the stop. 
    He knew nothing about the investigation, what Cooke had observed, what the joint task force that was investigating the smuggling activity knew. 
    He didn't know really what questions to ask or what things to do. 
    Once Agent Cooke arrived on the scene, it was a matter of about five minutes for him to ask a couple of questions, seek and be denied consent to search the camper.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Because Sharpe and Savage were clearly together. 
    So there are two separate questions. 
    One is whether Sharpe was unlawfully detained, and my point in this connection is that what you must focus on, because what is at issue is the admissibility of the marijuana seized from the camper, is only the detention from the time the camper was stopped until the time probable cause to believe it contained marijuana developed is the relevant period of time. 
    Now, for Mr. Sharpe, he was detained longer, but in our view, that detention was not unlawful, A, because it was justified by the circumstances, certainly the last ten minutes or so of it were after probable cause had already developed, and in any event, whether a lawful or unlawful, irrelevant to the admissibility of the marijuana. 
    Sharpe could have been detained for ten hours. 
    It had nothing to do with finding the marijuana.

 Do you rely on those two circumstances merely as buttressing your showing of probable smuggling activity, or do you rely on them in part as violations of law?

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, with respect to the speeding, I rely on it only insofar as an issue which is not before the Court, which is the validity of the initial stop, which the Court of Appeals didn't pass on. 
    I think the initial stop would be justified by the speeding. 
    I do not rely on the extended detention on the basis of the speeding, because there is no evidence in the record that the speeding would have led to a custodial arrest or would ordinarily have led to an extended detention. 
    So, the extended detention we seek to justify only by the suspicion of marijuana smuggling.

    Leaving aside the question of respondents' fugitivity, I would say that it would be within the discretion of this Court either to go ahead and decide it if it chose to or to remand it. 
    For instance, in United States against Hasting, where the issue was harmless error, there was a question, A, whether the Court of Appeals was obliged to consider harmless error, and B, whether if it was obliged to consider it the error was harmless.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Part of the question is whether it was justified to detain respondent Savage for 15 or 20 minutes until Cooke conducted his investigation, and we are saying that the fact that Savage sped off down the road, almost running into Thrasher's police car, and was only apprehended a half a mile away, separate, and there are only two police officers involved in the investigation, so if they wanted to investigate both of these individuals, one had to stop with one, the other had to pursue the other. 
    And as it turned out, quite reasonably, Thrasher had the equipment, pursued the vehicle that was trying to flee, and Agent Cooke stopped with the vehicle that had pulled over. 
    Now, I think this case poses as its primary issue, stated most broadly, whether the Fourth Amendment generally prohibits the prolongation of a stop based on reasonable suspicion short of probable cause for more than a few minutes. 
    And if the Fourth Amendment does sometimes permit such extended detentions, the narrower question is whether the circumstances of this case were such as to justify the detentions here. 
    Now, in addition, because the respondents are fugitives, the Court may also deem it necessary to consider the effect that that has on the proper disposition of this case. 
    We have addressed it in our reply brief, and I would be happy to answer any questions that the Court may have.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    --Well, when you say that there is no way in the world that we can lose, it is as though we were here arguing about a constitutional question as in Milton against Wainwright, which may in the end turn out to be harmless error. 
    There may be no way in the world we can lose because an error is harmless. 
    In United States against Leon the argument was made that if you had a reasonable mistake exception to the exclusionary rule, then that would freeze the development of Fourth Amendment law, because you would always know when you had a new Fourth Amendment issue that the government in the end was going to win on the suppression motion, and yet this Court said there is nothing in the Court's jurisprudence that makes it inappropriate to first consider the merits, and then if it is necessary and appropriate to do so, turn to the question of remedy. 
    No question that we have a full adversarial presentation. 
    I expect Mr. Kadish to be every bit as vigorous today as if he were here representing Sharpe and Savage--

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Bail has been forfeited. 
    A bench warrant has been issued for their arrest. 
    There are also other charges at least against Sharpe in other jurisdictions from which he is also a fugitive. 
    But it seems to me that the one point that is clear, and we analogize this in our brief to the situation in Walder and Havens, because this is a claim for suppression of evidence under the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule. 
    This is not a claim that these defendants are innocent, which might cause a different set of concerns. 
    So that if you view it as a matter of exclusionary rule policy, you must ask yourself the question whether these defendants are entitled to a favorable judgment reversing their conviction on the grounds of an illegal search or seizure when they are not willing to submit to an unfavorable judgment should the Court render one.

    No, when we petitioned, they were not fugitives, and when the Court granted this petition we were still unaware, and I am not sure whether Savage was a fugitive. 
    It was only after the Court granted the petition that Savage was declared a fugitive, and it was only in August, after we filed our opening brief in August of this year, that we learned that both respondents were fugitives.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    There will certainly be other cases. 
    This is an important and recurring issue. 
    It is the nature of the beast that there will be other cases. 
    Now, I think the main burden of our argument on the merits here is that both from the standpoint of Fourth Amendment policy and from the standpoint of this Court's precedence, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that there is some strict and brief time limit on detentions based on suspicion short of probable cause. 
    This kind of issue can arise in various circumstances, and I would like to just give a couple of examples for the Court to have in mind. 
    For instance, a car may be stopped on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that it is stolen, and it may take five or ten or fifteen minutes to run a computer check on the license plate or registration that is produced in order to determine whether or not it is stolen, and in those circumstances law enforcement officers would have substantial reasons for wanting to detain the individual in the automobile long enough to conduct such a check. 
    That doesn't mean if it took an hour or two hours that they would be justified in doing it.

    --I suggest that the Court has adopted the formula of Professor LaFave in his treatise, which has been endorsed quite clearly in the opinion of the Court in Michigan against Summers, and essentially I would sum it up by saying that in determining whether a detention is reasonable, the inquiry should focus on the purpose of extending the detention, that is, the specific course of action that the police tend to pursue during the period, whether these actions are likely to produce confirmation of their suspicions within a relatively short period, and I am not willing to give a precise number to that. 
    The Court should consider such factors as the gravity of the offense under investigation, the risk that the suspect would avoid apprehension if he is released, the substantiality of the officer's suspicion, the degree of inconvenience caused to the suspect by the detention, and the intrusion of circumstances beyond the officer's control, and this is quite relevant to this case, that caused the prolongation of the detention, and, of course, considerations relating to the officer's personal safety.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    No, well, perhaps not, but I would like to suggest that even under your views that in this case the government's position ought to prevail, and let me explain that. 
    You did join the decision of the Court in United States against Cortez, where there was... the issue was whether there was reasonable suspicion. 
    The Court all agreed that there was. 
    The car was pulled over, and within a matter of a couple of minutes, there was consent to a search, which produced the illegal aliens who were hidden in the back of the vehicle. 
    Now, in this case, if you look at what happened from the time Officer Cooke arrived at the pickup until he acquired probable cause, there was a question and answer period, a request for consent to search. 
    All of this took somewhere around five minutes. 
    Savage had claimed that the vehicle was empty, and that he was on the way to get the shock absorbers fixed. 
    Cooke then conducted what we might call a non-search inspection of the vehicle. 
    He stepped on the bumper to see whether it was empty, as had been suggested, or fully loaded, as he thought he had observed in pursuing it. 
    And he put his nose up to the vehicle, took a strong breath, and smelled marijuana. 
    Now, all of this would be, I think, within the confines of what you would agree would be a permissible Terry stop, a very concise, directed inquiry of short duration. 
    The only reason in this case that that didn't happen right away is because of the conduct of the suspects in one of them separating himself from the other and proceeding down the road. 
    Now, it seems to me that at least in those circumstances the government ought to be permitted to conduct that narrow investigation, and the delay here of ten or fifteen minutes in Agent Cooke getting to the scene so that he could conduct that brief investigation should not be counted in the balance against the government. 
    This should be held to be within the scope of a permissible stop even under the view that only the narrowest kind of intrusion is justified.

    The question is whether there is reasonable suspicion to justify the stop, and I have no difficulty in saying that he could call for help.

   Argument of Mark J. Kadish
speaker="mark_j_kadish" startTime="1893.897" stopTime="2146.891">
    Mr. Mark J. Kadish 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, it is hard for me to refrain from calling Sharpe and Savage my clients since they were. 
    I was trial counsel, so if I slip, please forgive me. 
    There are certain facts which Mr. Frey has mentioned which I think need some clarification. 
    One is that at the time of the actual stop of the Sharpe vehicle, that was done by Cooke. 
    That is on Page 17 of the record. 
    He waved Sharpe over. 
    Then, over the radio, Thrasher said to Cooke, I'll take the camper. 
    He then moves forward. 
    There is no evidence in the record that he sped forward. 
    The record is that the camper and the state trooper vehicle almost hit accidentally. 
    That is what the record actually says. 
    And he put on his blue light, and apparently about a half a mile down the road, which isn't very far, they both succeeded in pulling over to the... on the south side of the road. 
    Now, you have both vehicles stopped. 
    Cooke gets out of the car, and he goes over to Sharpe, and he says, give me your license, and Sharpe gives him a license that says Pavlovich on it, but at that time Cooke doesn't know who the man is. 
    So he thinks he is Pavlovich. 
    He then immediately calls for Myrtle Beach Police backup. 
    They arrive. 
    In the meantime, there is no colloquy between Sharpe and Cooke. 
    He doesn't ask him a single question in the stop. 
    He doesn't say, what are you doing? 
    Are you in tandem with the camper? 
    Is there dope in the camper? 
    What are you doing out here at 6:30 in the morning? 
    Even more than that, Cooke follows them for 20 miles to this point from the beach area in North Carolina, and during the entire time Cooke doesn't attempt to raise any DEA people on the radio, even though there is an entire DEA task force operating in the area, to answer Justice Blackmun's question about that. 
    Now, what we have is that the vehicles arrive in Myrtle Beach on the outskirts and Cooke says, uh-oh, I am going to lose them in town. 
    I've got to do something now. 
    I am really not sure what is happening. 
    He pulls them over, asks no questions, calls the Myrtle Beach backup, they get them and put them in the back of a police car, marked police car, two armed officers, and they sit there for 40 minutes. 
    He takes Sharpe's license, puts it in his pocket, puts the other passenger of the car, who was never prosecuted, in the back of the police car, leaves them both there under armed guard, never having asked a question, goes up the road and sees Savage. 
    In the meantime, Savage has asked Thrasher twice to leave, right in the record, admitted by Thrasher. 
    He says, what do you want me for? 
    Here is my driver's license, here is my bill of sale, which by the way happened to be in the name of Pavlovich. 
    He says, and I want to go. 
    Thrasher says, you can't go, I'm holding you for Cooke. 
    However, if I really want to get you, I can hold you for that speeding. 
    Clearly, the record factually suggests that speeding was a pretext. 
    At any event, Cooke comes up and Savage says, I want to leave, give me my license back. 
    In the meantime, Thrasher has put Savage's license in his pocket. 
    Cooke says, you can't leave. 
    Then, and only then, Cooke looks at the registration and sees the name Pavlovich, and the bells go off, because he now connects the two vehicles. 
    Until that point, there wasn't even a connection that they were traveling in some kind of a concerted action except for the fact that they were just driving one behind the other, and because they had gone through the campground together.

    Mr. Mark J. Kadish 
    That did suggest, I agree, Justice Marshall, that did suggest that they were together, but not that they were involved in criminal activity together, only that they were together. 
    Once he had seen the name Pavlovich on the registration of the camper and on the driver's license of Sharpe, that drew the people definitely together. 
    Now, at this point, Sharpe, who has not been advised of anything, has not been advised of his rights, has not been advised of why he was stopped, has not been advised why he has been put in a police car with two armed officers watching over him, he is just sitting there with his passenger. 
    Forty minutes goes by. 
    Then the officer goes over and does the test that Mr. Frey has mentioned. 
    He steps on the bumper. 
    It feels like it is heavy. 
    He looks at the windows. 
    He sees he can't look inside, and he goes to the truck and opens the door himself, pulls out the keys from the ignition, opens the camper lock, and there are burlap bags. 
    No marijuana, mind you, but burlap bags which look like marijuana that he has seen in other cases. 
    He then says, you are under arrest. 
    It is our theory, as set forth in our brief amicus curiae that this case is closest to Dunaway in the scheme of cases that this Court has adjudicated in recent years. 
    It is closer to Dunaway and different than most of the others. 
    For example, this case is atypical to the airport cases. 
    It is not like Mendenhall, Reid, Royer, Place, or Rodriguez, for a whole bunch of reasons that are obvious.

    Mr. Mark J. Kadish 
    If you look at the record, and you look at that on a map, which I believe is actually in the record, you see that there wasn't any weaving or erratic type of turn. 
    It was a simple turn through the campground. 
    I believe they actually stopped at a stop sign, both vehicles, and then when they came out to the other side of the campground, they turned back on the main highway. 
    It wasn't necessarily, I think, viewed as erratic or evasive, and the record doesn't reflect that, and the Fourth Circuit didn't quite view it that way.

    Mr. Mark J. Kadish 
    I think I would have to concede the aggregate of the observations or what the officer should look at. 
    I don't think, however, that necessarily coming from this area of North Carolina which the record reflects is a heavy camping vacation area, that an overloaded camper with covered windows is necessarily the signs of a vehicle transporting drugs. 
    I mean, you have to go some to reach that conclusion, and that is what the Circuit Court felt, but I would agree that certainly all of the circumstances need to be looked at before you can--

    --I am not as much debating here the articulable suspicion, although I think it is extremely weak. 
    I think it is extremely weak compared to other cases, but the circuit has assumed that, at least for the purposes of their opinion. 
    What I was focusing on just a minute ago, if the Court permits me to get back to it, is that in the airport searches, you just have an area unto itself. 
    In the original Terry trilogy of Terry, Adams, and Brignoni-Ponce, followed later by Brown versus Illinois and Collander versus Rawson, you have these situation of the patdown, the frisk, the Brignoni-Ponce momentary stop of an automobile, like Cortez, these are clearly the purest Terry type of cases. 
    Then you have the automobile cases, the other automobile cases like Mimms and Delaware versus Crowse, which are traffic cases, clearly related to either the random traffic stop in Crowse, and Mimms, the legitimate traffic stop followed by come out of the car, patdown, but clearly brief Terry situations. 
    Now, none of these cases that I am talking about except for the airport cases are cases where detentions have lasted more than a few minutes, none of them.

    Mr. Mark J. Kadish 
    I am not sure exactly what the time was in that case. 
    I don't know in Michigan versus Long. 
    I know that the time was extended somewhat in the airport cases. 
    For example, in Place, I believe we had a 90-minute detention of the luggage. 
    That was the outside limit that I think the Court has gone. 
    This case... and of course the distinction I would make there is, we are dealing there with things, luggage. 
    Here we are dealing with persons. 
    There we are dealing with expectations of privacy which are to some extent in an airport minimized. 
    Everybody subjects themselves to searches in airports. 
    We all know that. 
    But on a highway, in your own car, that is not necessarily the case, although in the automobile cases of this Court there is perhaps a little wider breadth to what an individual subjects himself to. 
    But by and large, we then go to Cortez, the Chevron shoe case, which is a quick case, and Brignoni-Ponce, as I said, which is a quick case. 
    There is an aberration kind of in that Van Leuwen case, which is the 29-hour coin, counterfeit coin case, which involves the postal authorities and really doesn't bear any analogy to what we have here. 
    I think... and in Michigan versus Summers, Justice Stevens, I believe, as I read the case, tied the ruling there more to the... and the lengthy detention to the execution of a warrant in the man's home and gave reasons that to me made a lot of sense to justify the lengthy detention there being tied to warrant under the protection of a neutral and detached magistrate. 
    What do we have here? 
    Here we just seem to have a Dunaway. 
    These two men are taken to the side of the roadway. 
    Neither of them is informed what the whole thing is about. 
    When Savage is taken out by Thrasher, he just simply arrests him. 
    He takes him, he puts him up against the van, spread-eagled, at gunpoint. 
    Mr. Frey didn't mention that. 
    At gunpoint. 
    Takes his license away, his registration away, and keeps it, and holds him there. 
    He holsters the gun at that point when he sees he is unarmed. 
    That is an arrest. 
    That is not a Terry stop.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Do you think, Mr. Kadish, that they were in any doubt about why they were being stopped? 
    You seem to suggest that that left them in some kind of predicament.
speaker="mark_j_kadish" startTime="2655.701" stopTime="2706.180">
    Mr. Mark J. Kadish 
    No, they, I am sure, knew why they were stopped, but as I read it the Terry cases and the progeny are talking about the objective view of the officer... not of the officer, the objective view that a reasonable officer would have under the situation, not the accused, so that I believe that that is the test of the Court, and I believe that would be the answer to your question. 
    So that what I am concerned about is that if Savage is apparently under arrest at gunpoint and says, you cannot leave, that Mr. Justice Brennan found out in answer to his questions before, then you have Sharpe, who is clearly under arrest. 
    What better indicia do you have of arrest than being put--

 You use the term "under arrest" or "at gunpoint" as if those were somehow inconsistent with a Terry stop. 
 My understanding of a Terry stop is that it differs from an arrest in its duration and its purpose, but I would think that the custody which a person is in under a Terry stop is just as complete as in an arrest.

    Mr. Mark J. Kadish 
    Well, except that... except that these people here... I should have used the term "de facto arrest", because I think that is the progression that you see in Dunaway versus New York. 
    When Sharpe and Savage are held as I have described it to you, which I think is a candid statement of what the record says, at that point Cooke in effect arrested them before he smelled the marijuana. 
    They were clearly in a de facto arrest situation, but the level--

    You can go to a level first of a seizure, a momentary seizure. 
    Then you can go to the level where the man is held at gunpoint and cannot move, or locked in... or put in the back of a police car where he cannot leave.

    Mr. Mark J. Kadish 
    That's right, per se inconsistent. 
    And that it is an indicia that a probable cause standard has arisen, has been injected by the officers into the case, and that at that point they had no probable cause. 
    The government concedes, the government concedes in this case that the probable cause did not occur until the olfactory actions of Cooke with the marijuana. 
    Therefore, my position is, following the Dunaway analogy, that a probable cause situation clearly developed with Sharpe and clearly developed with Savage as I have described. 
    Alternatively, the degree of the intrusion reached a level which is inconsistent with Terry if you look at the case as a non-Dunaway but a Terry case. 
    The intrusion had reached a level where it became so offensive to both Sharpe and Savage that they had their Fourth Amendments rights interfered with.

I think I have that right... show that the Court itself has not fully determined in which direction the airport cases are finally going to go. 
    I think that perhaps those cases are going to end up as a special area in and of themselves, because... and I say that because of the number... there are one, two, three, four, five cases that have been considered by the Court since 1980 dealing with airport searches.

    I do feel, although I didn't sound like a non-adversary probably... it is in my blood... but I do feel that for the Court to decide the issue before it, which I view as very, very critical issues, in the context of a case involving the fugitivity of my clients, is somewhat of a disadvantage to them for the reasons that Justice Marshall and Justice Stevens have stated. 
    It is not that I don't feel that--

    The equities are not with me in that argument, and I know that. 
    Put on the other hand, if the Court is going to make constitutional law in the critical area of the Fourth Amendment, particularly as argued by Mr. Frey, which if his argument is adopted by the Court will lead to a somewhat major expansion of the Terry doctrine.

   Rebuttal of Andrew L. Frey
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3254.586" stopTime="3331.307">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I just wanted to make a couple of points. 
    Mr. Kadish said that my argument would lead to a major expansion of Terry doctrine, so I wanted to remind the Court of what it said in Michigan against Summers. 
    It said that Terry is not 
    "an almost unique exception to a hard and fast standard of probable cause. " 
    "Rather, the key principle of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, balancing of competing interests. " 
    It said that if the purpose underlying a Terry stop, investigating possible criminal activity, is to be served, the police must under certain circumstances be able to detain the individual for longer than the brief time period involved in Terry and Adams. 
    It endorsed Professor LaFave's summary of the governing principles that the permissibility of extending a Terry stop should turn on 
    "whether the police are diligently pursuing a means of investigation which is likely to resolve the matter one way or another very soon, and whether it is rather essential to the investigation that the suspect's presence be continued during that interval. " 
    And in Place, while the Court struck down a 90-minute detention, I think the clear inference was that it had taken 20 or 30 minutes to expose the luggage to a drug detecting dog--

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, because the approach requires looking at the need to extend the detention, and it recognizes, as I think Dunaway, which was a totally different cases, recognizes, that there is an outer limit on the permissible length of time that you could detain somebody. 
    But I cannot believe that we step back from it and look at this case, you are a DEA agent, you suspect there is a truckload of marijuana going down the highway, you want to try to find out whether you can confirm your suspicions instead of letting over a ton of marijuana go off into the distribution chain. 
    Is it really so unreasonable to do what the officers did in this case? 
    Does the Constitution of the United States say that these rather modest measures can't be taken for the purpose of a very important societal interest such as the detention of this kind of crime? 
    I just find it difficult to believe, and I just wanted to say to Justice Brennan that the not free to leave point, if he were free to leave, there would not be a seizure regulated by the Fourth Amendment. 
    This case is about the difference, where the line is between a seizure that is permissible on reasonable suspicion and a seizure that requires probable cause. 
    Both of those are similarly characterized by the suspect not being free to leave, and therefore the fact that he says I would like to leave and the officers say no seems to me quite immaterial to the issue.
