United States v. National Bank of Commerce

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in United States against National Bank of Commerce. 
    Mr. Lauber, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="albert_g_lauber" startTime="11.974" stopTime="124.611">
    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question here involves the power of the Internal Revenue Service to levy on a joint bank account where only one of the co-depositors is indebted to the IRS for unpaid taxes. 
    The delinquent taxpayer here is one Roy Reeves, who owes the IRS about $800. 
    Roy has a checking account and a savings account at the Respondent bank, titled jointly in his name and the name of Ruby and Neva Reeves, who we understand to be Roy's mother and wife. 
    These bank accounts are typical of joint bank accounts in most jurisdictions. 
    That is, each depositor is entitled to withdraw any amount up to the full outstanding balance from the account, without notice to his co-depositors. 
    The bank likewise is required to honor any withdrawal request that Roy might make, again up to the full outstanding balance, absent written instructions from the other depositors not to pay. 
    Arkansas law also provides that the bank's payment to any one depositor immunizes it from claims by the other depositors to the money thus paid out. 
    In short, as the Court of Appeals correctly stated, at the time the bank received the notice of levy Roy could have withdrawn any amount he wished from these joint accounts and used it to pay his federal tax bill, and his co-depositors would have had no lawful claim against the bank.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Well, they might have a complaint against him, and as I will explain shortly, they would have a very similar claim against the IRS. 
    But that in our view does not negate the fact that Roy had a right to property that the IRS could levy on. 
    Our position is simply that whatever Roy could do with respect to the account unilaterally, the IRS can do by virtue of its levy power. 
    And that we think follows from the well-established proposition that--

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Well, if the understanding between them was that he had free access to that money, yes, we say the IRS could levy upon it. 
    But she could then come into court in a wrongful levy action and contend that he misappropriated her funds, but that would be a question as to ultimate ownership. 
    Here the right to property we're levying upon is the right to withdraw the money.

    If she publicly acknowledged that he had the right, the same right that she had of access, would that affect your response?

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    As this Court noted in the Rodgers case a few terms ago, the Revenue Code does not require the IRS to notify potential third party claimants of a levy on the taxpayer's property, and in fact the IRS does not notify them because it typically can't know who they are. 
    And the lower courts have held there's no constitutional duty of the IRS to notify such people. 
    But nevertheless, in real life they would find out. 
    First of all, state law, state banking law or state banking regulations might well require the bank to notify depositors, co-depositors, of a levy on the account. 
    Even absent a requirement of state law, most banks I would think in following customary business good practice would notify co-depositors.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    --By statute. 
    That was the provision Congress made for determining these ownership claims. 
    Let me point out the similarity of that remedy to what they would have if Roy himself had just withdrawn the money. 
    Say Roy wrote a check for the whole balance in the account, as he was entitled to do, and he used it to pay for his groceries or his gambling debts or his tax bill. 
    Had he done that, Ruby and Neva would have had to file a claim in state court for return of the money, contending that Roy wrongfully spent money that was theirs. 
    But the Revenue Code gives them an identical remedy in the levy context, except that it runs not against Roy, but against the IRS, which steps into Roy's shoes. 
    They can file a claim with the IRS or go to court to get the money back. 
    So they're no worse off at all. 
    They simply have a different defendant in their action for return of the funds in question.

    Well, this Court has said as much. 
    The Court has said time and time again that the need for swift collection of the federal revenues means that property rights must yield provisionally to governmental need. 
    And the point is, the IRS must levy on the property, get the funds secured and the revenues protected, and then people can fight out about who really owns it. 
    But in the meantime, the Government has the funds in hand so that they cannot be depleted by the taxpayer or his fellow depositors.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    I believe the practice is for the bank to pay over the money to the IRS, and what the IRS does with it, frankly, I'm not sure. 
    But it would be incumbent on the third party claimant to file a claim first with the IRS to get the money back. 
    And they can simply issue it. 
    They don't have to go and get an appropriation. 
    They can just issue the money back. 
    If they find the levy was wrongful, i.e., not on the taxpayer's property, they can simply refund that or credit it to the third party claimant.

    --I think you'd probably have... it's our position that you can. 
    You may have to fight it out under state law whether you violate some understanding with your co-depositor, but you certainly have a claim to do that. 
    You have a right to withdraw the money. 
    No one can stop you from withdrawing that money from the account and spending it, and all the co-depositors have left is a claim against you to show that that was improper, that it was their property, not your property.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Exactly right. 
    And state law provides that once the bank pays the withdrawer, here Roy, they are immune from claims by the other depositors to the funds paid out accordingly. 
    And therefore, the bank's most logical course of action is to pay out in response to the levy and simply have its duties at an end, and then the third party claimants can fight out in a wrongful levy action or a claim for credit as to who ultimately owns the property. 
    But the point is, because Roy had the right to withdraw the money from the account and pay it to the IRS as the Court of Appeals found, we have a right to levy on the money and require the bank to pay us directly, rather than paying Roy.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Of the Revenue Code, which provides a wrongful levy action in district court for a third party who contends that the Government has seized property of his for another's taxes. 
    Section 6343(b) provides the administrative relief. 
    What Justice Stevens asked me was whether I could give him cases where people had actually invoked this remedy in court and succeeded. 
    The only case I'm aware of, because as I said it hasn't come up a great deal because people didn't litigate about this until the decision below, is a district court case called Douglas v. United States. 
    We cite it in our brief. 
    That was a situation where the mother, a mother and her son had a joint bank account and the IRS levied on the account to satisfy the son's liability, and the mother brought a wrongful levy action, I think some three years later, and her case was dismissed because she failed to comply with the statute of limitations on a wrongful levy action. 
    And so she did not succeed, but she could very well have had she brought her suit in a timely fashion as Congress provided.

    Well, a levy I guess could be wrongful for other reasons than that it was made on property other than the taxpayer's property. 
    The tax assessment could be invalid, the underlying assessment could be invalid, and there could be other defenses like that. 
    But among the ways you can prove a levy is wrongful is to show that it is not on the taxpayer's property. 
    And in a joint account it's a zero sum game; it's either his property or your property.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    --Well, the way we interpret those words... maybe it would be useful to go back to this Court's decision in United States v. Bess, where that involved a levy on the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy. 
    And the Court clearly held that the right to compel payment of a sum to one is a right to property, and therefore, because the insured during his life could have compelled the insurance company to pay him the cash surrender value, we could levy on that. 
    Now, I should point out that in that situation other people could very well be prejudiced, because if we levied on the cash surrender value and got all the cash out the policy would be at an end. 
    The beneficiaries of the life insurance policy would get no proceeds if that person thereafter died. 
    So the fact that there may be other third parties who have a claim to the money... there it was an inchoate or contingent claim--

 It would be perfectly logical to reach the result you're asking if the only remedy the third party claimant had was a remedy against the taxpayer himself for someone misusing it. 
 But when you conceive that there's a remedy against the Government for wrongful levy, that's where it seems to get sort of circular.

    It's just the point at which you have a full-blown hearing about who owns what, and what Congress has determined is that the levy secures the property and that there's a post-seizure hearing initiated by the third party claimant to flush out all the state law issues about who the ultimate owner is.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    But our position is that Arkansas law doesn't govern whether what Roy had is a right to property within the meaning of the relevant Revenue Code provisions. 
    And those words appear in the federal statute, and our position is, under this Court's decision in Bess and other cases, the right to compel a bank to pay you money is a right to property that we can levy on. 
    And if other people have claims, they can come in later and they'll fight it out.

    Mr. Terry F. Wynne 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    The issue is slightly different from that which the Government has posed to the Court. 
    The issue is whether the National Bank of Commerce is personally liable to the IRS for refusing to honor the notice of levy served upon it. 
    And to determine whether NBC is personally liable or not we have to do a two-step review. 
    The National Bank of Commerce would have to honor a levy if it were in possession of property or rights to district court belonging to Mr. Reeves.

    Mr. Terry F. Wynne 
    But only from payments made to co-depositors. 
    If it honors withdrawal requests of any depositors, it is protected from liability to co-depositors. 
    But the IRS is not a co-depositor on this account, and in that sense the National Bank of Commerce has no assurance from any state authority that it would not be exposed to that liability. 
    So we do a twofold inquiry to determine if National Bank of Commerce can be personally liable. 
    First we determine whether it's in possession of property or rights to property belonging to Mr. Reeves, and we look to state law to determine that. 
    And the answer to that first inquiry is, no, we're not in possession of any such property or rights to property.

    I don't... of course, I can't speak for the negotiable instruments laws that might be applicable to the check itself, but that is a potential conversion of those funds, and conceivably then the co-depositors could pursue their remedy against both the taxpayer and the IRS. 
    Beyond the question of whether Mr. Reeves owns property or has a right to property, to impose personal liability we've got to determine the value of that property. 
    So even if you accept the Government's argument that this right to withdraw, better called a power to withdraw because it's not necessarily a right if it's the co-depositor's own money, but if he does have a power to make withdrawals which would be honored by the bank, what's that worth? 
    What's its value? 
    That's got to be determined to impose liability on the National Bank of Commerce. 
    The first place to look to answer the first question I posed is, of course, the state law, and we look at first the--

    They would have the rights to conversion and their ownership rights under Arkansas law, but they would not have any action against the bank because the statute authorizes the bank to make the payments and protects the bank if it does. 
    Now, that of course is clearly... that approach to the analysis of the joint account was clearly set forth by the Arkansas Supreme Court in Black versus Black, where it determined that these joint account statutes were passed for the bank's protection and did not create any title or any ownership. 
    So the simple fact that Mr. Reeves is named on this joint account under Arkansas law creates in him no property right.

    Mr. Terry F. Wynne 
    I think it's exclusive of the question of whether the joint statute, joint account statute, created any title or ownership, as it specifically excludes title or ownership. 
    But it is not exclusive of anything beyond that particular exclusion. 
    Black v. Black specifically addressed the question of whether money in a joint account... the fact that money was in a joint account determined any ownership interests, that one fact alone. 
    And in Black v. Black the supreme court said it does not. 
    You have to look beyond the face of the account to determine the agreement of the parties, where the deposits came from, and those sorts of facts. 
    And that was also recognized by the district court and the Eighth Circuit in its opinion. 
    Those are the only things we do know at this point, is that Roy Reeves is named along with Ruby and Neva on two joint accounts, a savings account and a checking account. 
    We know that under Arkansas law NBC would be required to honor withdrawal requests made by him. 
    We don't know anything more. 
    That was the analysis that the Eighth Circuit used in looking at whether there was a state-created property right which is required by the decisions of this Court, and the Eighth Circuit correctly concluded that there has been no establishment of any state property right. 
    The Government has failed to provide us enough evidence or information to determine whether there exists any property or right to property, and that's their burden. 
    The Eighth Circuit then correctly found itself to be in accord with Stock Yards Bank, which was a very similar situation dealing with savings bonds instead of a joint bank account. 
    But in Stock Yards Bank the savings bonds were held in joint names of husband and wife, and the federal regulations applicable to them said that invests no title, that you have to look to the agreement of the parties. 
    It's identical to Arkansas law in that concept. 
    And in Stock Yards Bank the Sixth Circuit found that the simple fact of joint title did not determine any property interests or rights to property. 
    So we have two circuits in accord at this point. 
    As the Eighth Circuit noted, its decision is not going to be in conflict with any other circuits, and it specifically reviewed decisions of the Second, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits, which the Government, by the way, submits are in conflict. 
    But the Second Circuit case of U.S. versus Sterling National was an offset case. 
    The bank claimed not to be required to honor the levy because it had a right of offset or set-off against the account deposits. 
    There was no question as to the ownership of the deposit itself. 
    The tax debtor owned all of the deposits. 
    Similarly, in the Fifth Circuit--

    Mr. Terry F. Wynne 
    That's correct. 
    Now, the only pertinent cases that I've been able to review or that the Government has produced in similar situations where the Government or IRS was attempting to levy on joint accounts, the Government either accepted or was required to bear a burden of showing more than the joint account title. 
    And the cases specifically cited by the Government are U.S. versus Equitable Trust, District Court of Maryland... the Government produced the agreement of the parties and produced deposit records, produced testimony of witnesses to establish the ownership of the money in the joint accounts. 
    And this is what we say is the Government's burden in this case. 
    It's got to demonstrate whose money is in this bank before we're required to honor this levy. 
    It's a burden that we can't accept, nor can we carry, because we have no way of knowing.

    But as noted in the Stock Yards Bank case and as noted in this Court's decision in Rodgers, the levy procedure is just not very well adapted to determining property interests, and our case is a perfect example of that.

    But that convenience doesn't tell us ownership, and it therefore doesn't tell us what's subject to levy and it doesn't tell us what National Bank of Commerce should have given them, if anything.

    Mr. Terry F. Wynne 
    I do. 
    The IRS, while it may stand in the shoes of a tax debtor, is not the tax debtor. 
    And for purposes of Arkansas law we are only insulated from any liability if we honor the request of a depositor. 
    We don't think that we would be insulated from a levy payment to the IRS. 
    More importantly, let me focus again on this case, which is a personal liability action, as opposed to a levy, as far as a levy enforcement procedure. 
    The burden again is proof that we were in possession of property or rights to property belonging to the tax debtor, and there's absolutely no proof of that.

    But your point, I gather, is that Arkansas bank law obligates the bank to honor any check drawn by a depositor on the account, but there's no obligation under Arkansas law to pay anything out on the basis of an administrative levy to the IRS because it's not a depositor on the account.
