    We will hear arguments next in Jean against the Commissioner of Immigration. 
    Mr. Kurzban, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this is a case about invidious discrimination in enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States against black Haitian refugees who were seeking political asylum in the United States. 
    For over ten years, immigration enforcement officials in south Florida have applied the law with an unequal hand and an evil eye, as this Court said in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, against Haitians seeking political asylum as is their right under the statutes and treaties of the United States. 
    Although it has occurred in a variety of contexts, this case raises the issue with respect to detention and parole and discrimination in that detention and parole. 
    In the spring of 1981, approximately 1,700 Haitians came to the United States fleeing the politically repressive conditions and the persecution of their homeland in Haiti. 
    Unlike refugees such as Nicaraguan refugees, such as Cuban refugees, who entered south Florida at the same time, under the same circumstances, and indeed, unlike other excludable aliens who entered the United States at the same time, Haitians and Haitians alone were incarcerated.

    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    --Well, again, I honestly think it is unclear. 
    I think they remanded it back to determine whether or not it was discrimination with respect to the 400 people, but they paid lip service to that discrimination because they did it under a standard which in effect is a narrow standard, appropriate in other contexts such as the substantive review of a decision, as Justice Blackmun found in Kleindienst versus Mandel, of the Attorney General. 
    But it is not clear what the ultimate outcome of that review would be, and in addition they gave no relief to the 1,700 class members who have been released and at the same time they lifted the injunction that prevented the government from reincarcerating those 1,700. 
    So those 1,700 petitioners that are still part of this class are subject to being incarcerated again, and we have no reason to believe, based on the continuing pattern and practice of discrimination, that Haitians who have suffered in south Florida based on that continuing pattern, that these Haitians will not be redetained in a discriminatory manner.

    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    --Well, Your Honor, I think in some circumstances that is correct, but not in this circumstance, for several reasons. 
    First, the remand standard offers no relief for the 1,700 petitioners, as I said. 
    Secondly, with respect to the grounds on which the Court of Appeals remanded the case, they remanded it under a facially legitimate and bona fide standard. 
    That standard is not sufficient to protect against race and nationality discrimination, because that standard, while appropriate in the context of such cases as Fiallo versus Bell and in Kleindienst versus Mandel, where the Court paid great deference to the decisions of Congress and the Attorney General, is inappropriate where Congress has spoken, where the President and the Attorney General have spoken, and where low-level officials have discriminated anyway.

    Here, on the facts of this record, where Congress required a facially neutral statute and had on under 1182(d)(5), where the President and the Attorney General both made it clear that it should be an even-handed policy, where Congress has specifically only given the authority to the President under 1182(f) and under 1185 to make distinctions under classes of aliens, on the facts of this case I think that immigration officials do not have the right to make that distinction based on nationality.

 The first is perhaps the abstract one, can Congress pass a statute that discriminates in the administration of the immigration laws on the basis of national origin, but I thought from your answer perhaps it is the second one raised here, where Congress and the President have taken the position that there will not be discrimination on the basis of national origin. 
 Then you don't get to the constitutional issue because the low-level people are bound either by the administrative regulations or by the statute.

    --I do not know that that follows, Your Honor, because on the record in this case, they remanded it back on a standard that masks discrimination. 
    The standard here is not an arbitrary and capricious standard. 
    The standard here is facially legitimate and bona fide. 
    Moreover, when the en banc court of the Elevent Circuit has made it clear that the United States Constitution is irrelevant, they said no constitutional review is irrelevant to race and nationality discrimination. 
    I think that the moral force of stating that the Constitution applies in this circumstance is important.

    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    That's correct, Your Honor, but there is a very live controversy here, with the 1,700 people who have been released and for whom the injunction has now been lifted by the en banc court's decision, who are subjected to being redetained, and in Footnote 10 of the government's brief, they indicate that they may very well redetain them. 
    And this Court has also recognized that the mere cessation of illegal conduct, which we believe, by the way, has not occurred here... we believe the government is continuing to discriminate, as they have for ten years. 
    But the mere cessation of that conduct, they are getting up here today and saying, we will not redetain these people based on national origin, based on the history of the Service's discriminatory actions, is not enough to moot this case out.

    That is the problem. 
    This is not just an isolated case. 
    In 1980, for example, the District Court in another case called Haitian Refugee Center versus Civiletti found that the Immigration Service violated the statutes that allow people to claim political asylum in the United States, and violated it with respect to 4,000 Haitians seeking political asylum in our country. 
    That was in 1980, and in 1981, we had the very same conduct we have here. 
    The effect of the Eleventh Circuit's en banc court decision is to say that the United States Constitution is irrelevant to protect against invidious race and nationality discrimination.

speaker="ira_jay_kurzban" startTime="869.485" stopTime="1314.365">
    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    I think given the history of discrimination here, given that continuing pattern and practice of discrimination, that it is necessary for this Court to issue a declaration making it clear that under the Constitution no race and nationality discrimination is permissible. 
    The record in this case indicates an overwhelming pattern of race and nationality discrimination. 
    That race and nationality discrimination has been wholly unregarded by the government on the record of this case except for mere protestations of innocence. 
    The statistical evidence demonstrated a stark pattern of race and national origin discrimination wholly unrebutted by the government, but statistics alone were not at issue here. 
    Petitioners presented documentary evidence, testimonial evidence, all of it going to the question of both race and national origin, and all of it unrebutted by the government. 
    The government's arguments in this case are largely arguments that are not in response to the issues presented on the facts of this record. 
    The government suggests that finding the Constitution applicable will affect the sovereign power to control our borders. 
    We are not seeking from this Court any determination about any substantive review of any individual parole decision. 
    What we are seeking merely is the equal enforcement of the statutes as Congress and the President have promulgated. 
    If tomorrow the Congress were to pass a statute that said no one shall be paroled, that is not the case before this Court. 
    However, here, beginning in 1954, Congress passed a statute that said you made parole. 
    That statute, from 1954 to 1981, was enforced in a way that allowed people to be paroled if they were not likely to abscond or were not a security risk. 
    In 1981, when the policy changed after 27 years, that policy was applied in a discriminatory manner to Haitians and Haitians alone. 
    The government contends here that both the Congress and the President have broad powers under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
    We are not contesting that here today. 
    This is a situation where Congress, the President, and indeed even the Attorney General made it clear that the statute, 1182(d)(5), should be enforced in a facially neutral way. 
    The government has argued that due process does not augment the statutory rights to admission. 
    This is not an admissions case. 
    This is a case, as Congress has made it perfectly clear in 1182(d)(5) that separates out something we call parole from admissions. 
    Parole is a temporary release until a final determination is made about admissions. 
    The government contends that nationality discrimination can be drawn in the formulation of policy. 
    This is not a question about policy. 
    This is a question about enforcement, and even the language that the government quotes from Galvan versus Press when Justice Frankfurter said, 
    "We are not writing on a clean slate but 100 years of history. " 
    even there Justice Frankfurter made it perfectly clear that when it comes to the enforcement of the immigration statutes, due process applies. 
    The United States Congress in 1965 made it perfectly clear that they would abolish all nationality istinctions in the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
    In 1980, they reaffirmed that principle with respect to refugees, and in 1967 we agreed and became signatories to the United Nations Convention and Protocol with respect to the status of refugees which in Article 3 has a non-discrimination provision. 
    The government contends here that judicial review under the Constitution will somehow affect its powers, but this Court, Justice Powell in Fiallo versus Bell made it very clear in Footnote 5 that even in the question of Congress's power to act on matters of admission, even on those questions, it will be subjected to a constitutional standard. 
    Finally, the government contends that Shaughnessy versus Mezei controls this case. 
    In Shaughnessy versus Mezei, the question of admission was really the question at issue in that case. 
    To release Mezei was the equivalent of granting him the admission that the Attorney General had already determined that he could not get. 
    In Mezei the Attorney General had made a decision. 
    He had decided in that case that the alien was excludable on national security grounds and on the facts of that case to allow him them to assert a procedural due process right to be released would have the effect of reversing the determination that he was an excludable alien. 
    Shaughnessy versus Mezei was also determined before this Court made its determination in Bolling versus Sharpe. 
    It was determined before the Fifth Amendment was found to be a source of equal protection. 
    Equal protection was never raised in any case. 
    Finally, I note, as Justice O'Connor implicitly, I think, noted in Landon versus Plasencia, that the scope of Mezei is in some doubt, and I think it is in some doubt because in reality on the facts of Mezei, Mezei was really a returning resident to the United States. 
    He had lived in the United States for many years, and he was returning. 
    This Court in Landon versus Plasencia said that even though an alien will be treated as an excludable alien who is a returning resident, he is still entitled to due process protections. 
    We submit to the Court that the issue at stake here is the same issue of equal protection and equal justice under law that this Court has recognized in a variety of contexts, and particularly in Truax v. Corrigan, where this Court said that the whole system of our law is based on the fundamental and general principle of the equal applicability of the law. 
    That is what this case is about. 
    Your Honor, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

   Argument of Rex E. Lee
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="1321.871" stopTime="1471.381">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I assume that it goes without saying that there is no warrant to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this case. 
    It is very clear from the record in this case that simply governmental discrimination was urged both before the panel and also before the en banc court, and it was only the shift that was made really before this Court and that came out during the oral argument before the Eleventh Circuit that Mr. Kurzban is now emphasizing the difference between the statutory remedy and the constitutional remedy. 
    In any event, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has clearly stated the law with respect to the authority of the Attorney General and the Congress to parole pending the determination whether to admit or to exclude, and the petitioners should not by their own change of position be permitted to achieve a vacation of that correct determination of the law. 
    Let me say that we strongly disagree with the assertions that the government has not contested the allegations of national origin and racial discrimination. 
    It did. 
    There was a six-week trial on that issue, and the District Court made a finding that there was no discrimination, but the real point for present purposes is that those allegations of national origin distinctions are irrelevant. 
    The reason is, and the whole case comes down to the fact that the same rules that this Court has pronounced over a period of more than a century applicable to the decision whether to admit or to exclude are also both from considerations of the practical necessities of the parole decision and also by the square holding of this Court in Mezei, which has not been overruled, required to be judged by the same standards. 
    What I propose to do is to develop first those rules that pertain to the entry decision, whether the alien is to be admitted or excluded, and then to develop our argument that the same rules apply to parole.

    I would simply point out in fairness that this case may different, because not only have the petitioners switched positions in midstream, but also, as I read it, the Ashwander approach is a discretionary approach that says that we are not going to reach constitutional issues unless we have to reach them, but it is not... it may be in this particular instance that the Court might conclude, given the review of that District Court opinion, that the likelihood that that court is going to change its view is so remote that this Court should simply proceed immediately to affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

    It may have been on an assumption, Justice Stevens, that these 400 people to whom Mr. Kurzban referred, who have got to be post-Judge Spellman's entry arrivals, are part of the class. 
    Now, Judge Spellman has indicated in a footnote that that may not be the case, but it may be that the Court of Appeals assumed that they were part of the class, and therefore evidence could be introduced as to them.

    They may have... I say they may have assumed that they are part of a class. 
    On the other hand, it may be that there is some other evidence other than the statistical evidence which had already been presented that the Court of Appeals anticipated might be introduced. 
    In any event, the Court of Appeals' approach is an analytically sound one. 
    The question as to what additional evidence might come in is something that can be determined once the case gets back to District Court.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    No, it is not clear that they are. 
    They arrived after the lawsuit... after the judgment was entered. 
    Starting with the Chinese exclusion case just about a century ago, this Court has consistently reasserted the distinction between the authority of the political branches over, on the one hand, aliens who have actually entered the country, even though the entry might have been illegal, and persons like petitioners who at least in a legal sense have not yet penetrated our borders. 
    The constitutional power of Congress and the Attorney General over aliens who have entered is very large. 
    Over those who have not, it is a power that simply knows no counterpart in any other corner of our constitutional jurisprudence. 
    As the Court said a couple of terms ago in Landon versus Plasencia, an alien seeking admission to our shores has no constitutional rights regarding his application. 
    That does not mean that he is not a person under the constitution. 
    Nor does it mean that he has no constitutional protections. 
    It simply means that the limited package of rights which he enjoys does not include rights with respect to the substantive decision whether it will be admitted or excluded. 
    It is a principle that is bottomed not only on Congress's constitutional power over immigration and naturalization, but also on the responsibility of the political branches over foreign affairs and national security. 
    The power to control entry is an inherent attribute of sovereignty for this or any other country. 
    This nation has always been one of the most generous in admitting foreigners into our midst. 
    Would that we could do more.

    What your question really goes to, Justice Stevens, is whether certiorari ought to have been granted in this case in the first place. 
    We opposed it. 
    However, there has, in fairness to the Court, there has been nothing that has happened prior to the time that you disagreed with me on the circuit and as a consequence, since the case is here, since there hasn't been anything that has happened since the grant of certiorari, and since this very issue is one that divided a panel and the en banc circuit, and since it is a question of very large importance to the administration of the immigration and nationalization laws, we would like to have the answer.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Now, the real question, the real question then is whether this established right to exclude or to admit also applies to the parole stage. 
    The answer to that question is yes for two reasons. 
    The first one is that the rationale underlying the admission rule also requires that parole, which in practical effect really is admission, be treated the same as exclusion. 
    And second, this Court has squarely held that they are to be treated the same.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    As I read this Court's decisions, Justice O'Connor, the answer to that question is yes. 
    What Landon versus Plasencia said, and what I think the cases hold, is that the exclusion of their constitutional rights relates to the decision whether to admit or not to admit, and of course the question here is, does that also extend to parole. 
    Prior to 1954, parole was rarely granted. 
    Ellis Island functioned principally as a holding point pending admission or exclusion. 
    But in 1954, we tried a new approach. 
    The facility Ellis Island was closed. 
    Parole was freely granted. 
    And for more than two decades no serious problems resulted. 
    By the late 1970's, however aliens had begun to arrive in South Florida in such unprecedented and unmanageable numbers, including some 125,000 Cubans who arrived in the port of Mariel in the spring of 1980, that it was apparent to our national leaders that something had to be done.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --Well, the report was, but the appointment of the Commission, the appointment of the Commission occurred in 1980, and the report was issued in 1981. 
    That report concluded two things. 
    One was that there was an immigration crisis that existed in the country, and the second was that there were two reasons for it. 
    One, the arrival of increasing numbers of aliens lacking required entry visas, and the post-1954 policy of routine paroles prior to admissions hearings. 
    The succeeding Administration continued the attempts to deal with this crisis, and a key element of the policy that it adopted, a policy which was recommended by the President's cabinet level task force, approved by the President and announced by the Attorney General, called for more restrictive use of parole, and increased use of detention. 
    In every meaningful respect, parole and entry are parts of the same whole, namely, the power of this nation to decide who will be permitted entry. 
    There are good reasons for mainly this or any other nation to exclude some people, national security reasons, health and safety reasons, disease control, citizen employment, and others. 
    Those same reasons also apply to parole, because what is at issue in both contexts is exactly the same, whether aliens will be admitted into our national community without first making the necessary showing that they are entitled to enter. 
    The differences between parole and admission are differences of degree. 
    Parole may be for a short time and it may be for a long time, but during the interim, the same risks are at work that lead government to exclude until eligibility is established. 
    So long as the inflow is modest, those risks may be bearable, but when that reaches the crisis point, and when two successive administrations conclude that one of the reasons for the crisis is too loose standards being applied at the parole stage, then surely the Constitution does not prohibit the Congress and the Attorney General from preventing entry to those who have not proven their entitlement to enter. 
    This is not to say that the government's constitutional power over parole depends on the existence of a crisis. 
    It is simply that our experience of recent years shows the wisdom of this Court's holding in Mezei that parole is a part of the admission exclusion holding. 
    The reason that Shaughnessy versus United States ex. rel. Mezei controls this case, and the reason that all of the petitioners' attempts to distinguish it are irrelevant are tied to the holding of that case that the decision whether to parole or not to parole is a part of the exclusion-admission total package, and therefore governed by the same judicial standard. 
    I submit that Mezei also shows the firmness and the universality of that rule, because if there were ever to be an exception, a case whose peculiar facts would have justified treating the parole decision as something separate from the admission decision, would surely have been Mr. Mezei's case, because unlike the petitioners here, there was literally no other place in the world where he could go. 
    The petitioners stress the similarities between the parolee and the excludable alien, and the differences between the parole and the alien subject to deportation. 
    They also rely on the holding in Leng May Ma v. Barber that a paroled alien did not lose her excludable status, and we agree. 
    Parole is like exclusion. 
    Our point is that it ought to be treated like exclusion, as it is under Mezei. 
    The petitioners' point, of course, is that since the parole is still excludable once paroled, the government does not give up a lot by extending parole, but that argument is multiply flawed. 
    First, the judgments concerning just how much the government gives up are judgments to be made by Congress and by the Attorney General. 
    Second, this Court in Mezei squarely resolved the issue against the petitioners, and that holding is dispositive. 
    And finally, the petitioners are simply wrong as a matter of fact. 
    There are good reasons not to parole pending admission, and the petitioners' position is at odds with the findings and conclusions of two Presidential commissions in this respect. 
    The petitioners' efforts to distinguish Mezei are discussed in our brief. 
    It was not called into question at all by Plasencia. 
    In Plasencia, there was no issue of either exclusion or parole. 
    Rather, the holding was simply that it was an exclusion hearing to which Ms. Plasencia was entitled. 
    I would like to discuss just one of the petitioners' bases for alleged distinction of the Mezei case, and that is that in Mr. Kurzban's words, this is a case about illegal discrimination, that this case is different because there is an allegation of national origin discrimination which in other contexts bring into play heightened judicial scrutiny. 
    The problem with that argument is that it comes about 13 years and three rounds too late, because that same argument that reliance by the excluded alien on constitutional positions which in other contexts entitle their beneficiaries to heightened scrutiny was attempted 13 years ago in Mandel, five years later in Fiallo, and rejected both times. 
    In Mandel it was First Amendment interests which were at stake, and in Fiallo classifications based on legitimacy, both of which are entitled to heightened scrutiny. 
    Indeed, if anything, those were stronger cases against the government, because in both of those the argument in favor of the excluded alien also rested in substantial part, as Justice Marshall pointed out in his separate opinion in Fiallo, on the rights of citizens. 
    In Mandel, it was the acknowledged right of American citizens to receive, to hear Professor Mandel's thoughts and words. 
    And in Fiallo, it was the rights of American citizens who were the kinfolk of the excluded aliens. 
    Nevertheless, the argument was rejected both times, and in Fiallo the Court was quite explicit as to the reason. 
    The Court reasoned as follows, quoting from Justice Frankfurter's separate opinion in Harisiades: 
    "The conditions of entry for every alien, the particular classes of aliens that shall be denied entry altogether. " 
    and then several others, 
    "have been recognized as matters solely for the responsibility of the Congress and wholly outside the power of this Court to control. " 
    Those judgments described by Fiallo, the conditions of entry for every alien, and the particular classes of aliens that shall be denied entry altogether are the precise issues, the precise judgments at issue in Mandel, again in Fiallo, and again in this case.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --Of course, and an alien once admitted can also have that admission revoked, and can be deported, but the point is, and I am merely faithfully reporting the decisions of this Court as I read them, the point is that the crucial distinction as announced by this Court in Landon versus Plasencia is rights pertaining to his admission, because the question is, is he to be held, so to speak, on the boat, and not permitted to enter until such time as we make a judgment whether he really fits the category of persons who are entitled to enter, and that is what makes the difference between the exclusion cases and the deportation cases. 
    And with regard to those matters, exclusion and parole are part of the same package, both legally and also as a matter of practical operational fact. 
    Finally, the issue in this case really comes down to Congress's constitutional authority. 
    What Congress has done is to establish a constitutional rule that... or, excuse me, is to establish a statutory command that aliens are to be excluded, period, and then it gives to the Attorney General the discretion to determine in his discretion whether in certain instances parole or temporary admission should be granted. 
    Accordingly, the issue is not whether the petitioners are right or we are right concerning the likely risk of admitting aliens prior to the time that their entry decision is made. 
    Rather, the question is whether Congress has the constitutional authority to make exclusion the general rule and then give the Attorney General the discretion to make some exceptions. 
    Given this Court's precedents, I submit that is simply not a closed question. 
    As Justice Frankfurter sad in Galvan v. Press, and this Court has repeated frequently, we are dealing here not with merely a page of history, but a whole volume, and that volume of history clearly puts parole into the same package with admission exclusion. 
    That is exactly what this Court held in Mezei. 
    If there were ever to be an exception, it would have been in Mezei, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.

   Rebuttal of Ira Jay Kurzban
speaker="ira_jay_kurzban" startTime="2920.115" stopTime="3215.200">
    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Lee has said that in his view parole and exclusion are legally the same thing. 
    I would remind him that his brief says just the opposite. 
    His brief says that parole is not a legal admission into the United States. 
    Indeed, that is exactly what Congress has said under 1182(d)(5). 
    They are separate, and they are separate for very good reasons. 
    A temporary release of somebody from parole as it was established between 1954 and 1981 was for a series of reasons mostly beneficial to the government in terms of cost, but also, as this Court said in Leng May Ma, showing the enlightenment of our society in temporarily paroling people pending a determination of their admission. 
    Parole does not grant an admission, and indeed it is really under the government's control, sole control as to how fast they bring an alien to a hearing after he has been paroled. 
    It is up to the government to decide whether or not, after paroling somebody for two days, whether or not they wish to give them an exclusion hearing, or two months, or two years, but they are not the same. 
    Mr. Lee cites Mandel and Fiallo. 
    I would remind him that even where Congress has stated and even where Congress has made a determination as to admission, it was reviewed under a constitutional standards. 
    Mandel implicated clearly the question of admission and a narrow window of discretion by the Attorney General after Congress had spoken clearly on an exclusion. 
    Fiallo involved an Act of Congress, and even there it was reviewed by the Constitution. 
    The government would attempt here to extend Mezei to cover the issue of discrimination. 
    Just last week, this Court in United States versus Waite, in an analogous situation, said, even though questions of parole... I am sorry. 
    Even though questions of whether or not to prosecute are reviewable only under the most narrow standard, and may in fact be wholly committed to agency discretion, even those questions when confronted by a claim of discrimination such as race discrimination, that the standard is different. 
    That is what we have here. 
    This is not a case where you would apply a very narrow standard because it implicates admission. 
    Here the standard, because it is a question of race discrimination, as this Court found just last week in United States versus Waite, it would be a different standard, and in Waite Justice Powell said that equal protection under the Fifth Amendment, that our approach, the approach of this Court, of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is precisely the same as equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    I would like to go back a minute on the question of remand, because I think there is some confusion here. 
    The class in this case consists of 1,700 petitioners who have been released and 400 petitioners who are presently in detention. 
    The standard on remand by the en banc court gives no relief whatsoever to the 1,700 petitioners who have been released. 
    To the 400 petitioners who are presently in detention, it provides an impermissibly narrow standard in the context of race and nationality discrimination. 
    It applies a standard of facially legitimate and bona fide. 
    While appropriate in the context of Fiallo versus Bell or in the context of Kleidienst where the Attorney General was acting just as in Waite, it is inappropriate in the context of race and nationality discrimination. 
    We seek injunctive relief and we seek declaratory relief because this case arises not in a vacuum, Your Honor, but under a situation of a continuing pattern and practice of discrimination. 
    This is not an isolated case. 
    The record in this case demonstrated through the testimony of two former general counsels of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, through the testimony of immigration lawyers, through the government's own documents, that this pattern and practice of discrimination has continued for a period of ten years.

    Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban 
    --Lip service to the question of race and nationality discrimination, because while making a broad holding on the constitutional grounds, then gave a very narrow standard of review, the facially legitimate and bona fide standard, and under that standard mere protestation of innocence, for example, may be enough. 
    This Court has said when it comes to the facially legitimate and bona fide standard that we will not look behind the exercise of discretion. 
    Just from a practical point of how we would prove a discrimination case on remand, from a very practical point, we cannot look behind that exercise of discretion. 
    If immigration officials on remand were to say, well, we did this because we did not discriminate, or we did this because we believed that there was some deterrent, under the standard enunciated in Kleindienst versus Mandel, which are appropriate when the Attorney General may act or appropriate when Congress may pass a law, would prevent us here from actually going back and proving in a record through discovery that discrimination still exists.
