Hayes v. Florida
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="12.141">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in Hayes against Florida. 
    Mr. Raiden, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="12.141" stopTime="88.106">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In 1980 in the city of Punta Gorda, Florida, there were a series of burglaries and rapes. 
    The primary clue as to the identity of the perpetrator available to the investigating officers were fingerprints. 
    In the particular case for which the petitioner was convicted, these fingerprints were found on the bedroom doorknob of the victim. 
    The petitioner was one of a number of suspects which the police desired to obtain the petitioner's fingerprints in order to compare them with the latents found in the victim's home. 
    They did not have probable cause. 
    At least that was argued in the trial court, and the appellate court, the Florida appellate court agreed there was no probable cause. 
    There was no prior judicial authorization for obtaining the prints, and the court of appeals found and agreed with the petitioner's argument that there was no consent to accompanying the officers to give the prints. 
    However, the police officers went to the petitioner's house, made it very clear that he had no choice but to go with them--

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Excuse me.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="88.772" stopTime="89.289">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --Yes, sir.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="89.289" stopTime="91.641">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It's agreed that there was no probable cause?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="91.641" stopTime="95.843">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    It was argued by the defense that the state--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="95.843" stopTime="98.462">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It wasn't agreed to.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="98.462" stopTime="100.914">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --The court agreed with the petitioner.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="100.914" stopTime="101.580">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The court did.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="101.580" stopTime="178.747">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    Yes, sir, Your Honor. 
    They obtained the prints at the police station after seizing Mr. Hayes at his home and taking him to the station and obtaining the prints. 
    Upon comparing them with the prints found in the victim's home, they uncovered a match, and he was then arrested and charged. 
    He moved in the trial court of Charlotte County, Florida to suppress the fingerprint evidence. 
    His primary case authority was Davis v. Mississippi, along with a couple Florida cases that had followed Davis. 
    And the court denied the motion to suppress without stating any particular reason. 
    The state had argued probable cause and/or consent. 
    It went to the appellate court, and again, the state argued probable cause and/or consent. 
    The district court of appeal in Florida found that there was no probable cause. 
    They further found that there was no consent. 
    However, despite the holding in Davis v. Mississippi, they affirmed the trial court's decision not to suppress the prints, and in so doing they found justification in Terry v. Ohio.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="178.747" stopTime="204.814">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Mr. Raiden, there's some suggestion in either the briefs or somewhere in this record that since they could have taken the fingerprints on his front porch or in his living room, it made no difference that they were taken later in the police station. 
    Would you be here if they had taken the fingerprints in his living room?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="204.814" stopTime="207.497">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    I think that I would be, Your Honor, because--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="207.497" stopTime="209.199">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    There's no difference, in your view.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="209.199" stopTime="212.218">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --Well--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="212.218" stopTime="221.340">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    There's no difference. 
    If they took it without his consent, as you argue, then it wouldn't make any difference whether they took it in his living room or at the police station.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="221.340" stopTime="258.513">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --I'd maintain that it is still a search, it is still a seizure. 
    I recognize that one of the distinctions between Terry and say Dunaway or Foyer is the movement of the person; and there does appear to be that difference. 
    But they had already set up the fingerprinting process at the police station, and we do have an instance of movement in this case. 
    But in answer to your question, I... I find no constitutional difference in the fact that they possibly could have taken the prints at his house. 
    They still did not have probable cause to conduct this search and seizure, and they did not have judicial authorization, and they did not have consent.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="258.513" stopTime="264.500">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    In other words, they would have had to get a warrant in order to take the first steps.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="264.500" stopTime="321.754">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    I find in Davis v. Mississippi that although the... what happened here, the district court said this is the question left open by Davis, in the opinion of, I believe, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the court could conceive of situations wherein fingerprints might be taken without necessarily having probable cause to do so. 
    However, further down in that opinion I believe Mr. Justice Brennan then said that it would not... it would not seem to admit of any exception to the warrant requirement. 
    In the wake of Davis, a number of states passed statutes wherein under very circumscribed circumstances, the police could go to a magistrate and get what... I called it a mini-warrant in the brief... but some type of judicial authorization to go and take prints. 
    And it's... there's a--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="321.754" stopTime="326.558">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But aren't those statutes for the most part based on no more than reasonable suspicion?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="326.558" stopTime="329.442">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --That's correct. 
    They do not require probable cause.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="329.442" stopTime="332.627">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You think there's some problem with those statutes; is that your position?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="332.627" stopTime="371.502">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    I think arguably there is a problem. 
    I cited in the brief a Nebraska case where the Nebraska court reviewed all the various statutes that had been passed in the wake of Davis. 
    And they found that in light of more recent cases such as Dunaway v. New York and Royer v. Florida that whatever might have been suggested in the Davis opinion, that it could be done without probable cause it probably no longer is constitutionally valid, and that probable cause would be required any time you wanted to move someone, detain someone for that length of time.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="371.502" stopTime="385.243">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you think that it is valid within the Terry stop rationale to take a photograph of someone on the street when you make a voluntary stop and use that in evidence?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="385.243" stopTime="388.278">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    Well--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="388.278" stopTime="392.916">
    Justice O'Connor 
    Does that violate any right of privacy, in your view?

    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --I'm not sure that I would say it did, Your Honor. 
    I--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="396.367" stopTime="404.389">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Why is a fingerprint any different than your face? 
    It's just a different form of identification like your physiognomy generally.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="404.389" stopTime="422.101">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --To take a fingerprint requires a little more of the participation of the individual than does submitting to a photograph. 
    For instance, a police officer conducting surveillance perhaps could be tailing someone on a public street and using a telephoto lens could take that person's picture.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="422.101" stopTime="436.027">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I'm talking about a Terry stop. 
    Within a Terry stop the Court has allowed a pat-down search of the person, which perhaps is more intrusive than taking a photograph or a fingerprint.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="436.027" stopTime="440.729">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    It's probably more intrusive than a photograph.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="440.729" stopTime="447.133">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Why is it more intrusive... do you think it's more intrusive than taking a fingerprint?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="447.133" stopTime="455.489">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    I'm not sure that I would agree with that, because you have to place your hands on the person and actually hold the person to take a fingerprint. 
    The way--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="455.489" stopTime="458.941">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And you have to place your hands on a person to do a pat-down search, I suppose.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="458.941" stopTime="484.091">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --Yes. 
    Both of those involve actual physical contact with the person, whereas photography doesn't. 
    Incidentally, what I had urged vis-a-vis Terry in these cases is that Terry, involves a sort of search, it's not an evidentiary search. 
    They're not looking for evidence of a crime. 
    But it's designed instead for the protection of the officer, and the pat-down--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="484.091" stopTime="488.460">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Have we also held that it's valid to ascertain identity?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="488.460" stopTime="489.762">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    That's--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="489.762" stopTime="495.316">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And isn't the taking of fingerprint a form of identification inquiry?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="495.316" stopTime="513.861">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --When they say in Terry that you may ask identity, I'm not sure the purpose of inquiring into identity is evidentiary in nature. 
    The fingerprint, while it is a means of identification, it is a means of identification evidence.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="513.861" stopTime="534.255">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Place and Royer both certainly involve something more than protection of the officer. 
    They were looking for contraband in both cases. 
    So I think perhaps Terry on its facts is protection of the officer, but Terry has been held to support a stop where you're looking for evidence.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="534.255" stopTime="553.068">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    What I detect in Place and Royer, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is an element of exigency, although I don't find that specific word in the opinions, because of the fact that these people come and go in airports. 
    And if you don't find out what you're looking for right now, it's gone forever. 
    But--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="553.068" stopTime="569.578">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the decision announced by this Court yesterday in Hensley permitted a Terry-type stop just for identification purposes based on a flyer. 
    Now, if fingerprinting on the scene were used for identification, how does that differ?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="569.578" stopTime="578.701">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --As I understood the opinion that you announced yesterday, first of all, there had already been an arrest warrant for the individual; is that correct?
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="578.701" stopTime="580.903">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    That is not correct.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="580.902" stopTime="602.799">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    That is not correct. 
    He was... the reason they wanted to find his identification is to find out if he was the person wanted. 
    I was mistaken, and I thought it involved the existence of an arrest warrant in another jurisdiction. 
    I apologize. 
    I must have misunderstood the opinion. 
    The question again was?
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="602.799" stopTime="618.094">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, why, if it's valid to make that kind of a stop to check on identification, would it be invalid to go ahead and print someone at the scene of the Terry-type stop?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="618.094" stopTime="636.805">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    I guess it might depend on why you wanted the prints, although I'm not comfortable with saying that now that I've just said it. 
    I sense a confusion as to the purpose of the printing. 
    Printing someone simply to find out who they are--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="636.805" stopTime="689.440">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Of course, in this case the individual was taken to the station, and you don't have the typical Terry-type on the scene stop. 
    Let me ask you, if I may, suppose we agree with you that taking the individual to the station was not valid with the Terry stop rationale. 
    As I understand it, the victim made a later in court identification of the defendant in this case. 
    Now, even if you're correct that taking the defendant to the station was invalid, on retrial do you think that the state can get another set of prints and introduce fingerprint evidence again on retrial to convict this person?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="689.440" stopTime="707.235">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --They've certainly urged, at least at this level, that reversal would be, as Mr. Justice Stewart said in Davis, a useless gesture. 
    I'm not prepared to agree or even to disagree other than to say I don't think that is to be resolved at this level.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="707.235" stopTime="718.459">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but I think that it's important to explore a bit. 
    Is there probable cause now to obtain a warrant to take this person's fingerprints?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="718.459" stopTime="741.373">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    I'm faced with a record where some things were not done the way I would like to have done them, and one thing that disturbs me about this record is there was no move to suppress the identification by the victim. 
    I'm not saying it was suppressible. 
    I don't think we can determine that on the face of our record. 
    Yes, she did identify--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="741.373" stopTime="750.145">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, faced with this record, is there now probable cause to get the... Mr. Hayes' fingerprints?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="750.145" stopTime="764.422">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --If a court... and I submit most properly it should be the trial court... found that Mrs. Hollander's in court identification was constitutionally permissible, then there probably is probable cause now, yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="764.422" stopTime="772.344">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And if that's the case, what possible use is there in ordering a new trial just to consider the exact same evidence?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="772.344" stopTime="785.569">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    Because I'm not prepared to state at this point that her identification is constitutionally permissible. 
    It may not be. 
    I don't think we can determine that on the record we have, because no effort was made in the trial court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="785.568" stopTime="794.857">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But why should you have a second shot at that issue, just because on a purely unrelated matter there may have been a violation of the Fourth Amendment in taking the fingerprint?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="794.857" stopTime="831.413">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    Ordinarily, Your Honor, there may not be. 
    I may not deserve a second shot. 
    But this... the inevitable discovery argument that the state makes is being made for the first time at this Court. 
    We did not have the benefit, either at the appellate level... I was not trial counsel... or at the trial level of the Nix v. Williams decision. 
    In the light of the fact that a very significant U.S. Supreme Court decision exists now that we were not aware of, I think perhaps we should be allowed to litigate that. 
    In other words--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="831.413" stopTime="833.246">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    To mean to relitigate Nix against Williams?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="833.246" stopTime="839.817">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --No, sir. 
    I'm sorry. 
    To relitigate the identification issue, the admissibility--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="839.817" stopTime="842.535">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, what possible... what possible flaw could there be in the identification--
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="842.535" stopTime="843.554">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --I don't--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="843.554" stopTime="849.375">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    --if in open court she identified him as the attacker?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="849.375" stopTime="874.490">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --Well, if that's the first time that she's ever seen him, that is arguably a suggestive procedure. 
    I'm not saying that Hayes would prevail on the identification issue. 
    It's just that I don't think we have a sufficient record, and that issue was never raised, so we don't have a judicial determination whether or not her identification was permissible. 
    If the court determined that it was, then Hayes--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="874.490" stopTime="879.560">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Was no objection made to her in court identification?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="879.560" stopTime="1081.407">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --Here's what happened in that regard. 
    When you get to the cross examination by the trial counsel at about page 398 of the trial record, he asked this lady, 
    "What you're saying, then, is that nobody knew until this exact moment that you were going to come in here and identify this person; is that correct. " 
    and she said, "Yes". 
    Apparently, there were no efforts for her to make an in person identification of Hayes up until that moment. 
    Once had completed his cross examination, he made a motion to strike the testimony. 
    I don't think that helps in the determination we're talking about for two reasons. 
    Number one, under Florida rules of criminal procedure, any type of motion to suppress made after the trial begins is discretionary. 
    There's no absolute requirement that the judge hear it at all. 
    But number two, and perhaps more important, as I understand Mr. Bader's motion to strike, it was directed wholly toward credibility and not legal admissibility. 
    So I don't think we can infer from that that Judge Adams, who was the trial judge, ever made a specific finding that Mrs. Hollander's identification was legally valid and admissible. 
    Getting back to the question that was left open by Davis v. Mississippi, as I noted, after Davis there were a number of states that passed statutes permitting fingerprinting and similar identification-oriented investigations. 
    Some of them could be done at the police station, and I suppose, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, it could be done, if you had all of your equipment and everything that was necessary, you probably could go to the person's house and do it. 
    Two distinctions I want to make there. 
    Number one, the fact remains in this case that the defendant was moved, and what I sense from some of the frustration that I detect in trying to resolve the Royer case was the end conclusion was that it doesn't necessarily matter that they could have detained Royer undue a sort of Terry stop. 
    Nevertheless, they didn't do it that way. 
    What they did to Royer was to move him, and that brings... that presents problems. 
    And if he's moved, he's detained for an unreasonable length of time, that it's too bad. 
    It could possibly have been done in a legal manner. 
    It wasn't done in a legal manner. 
    A point I wanted to make about these statutes is that regardless of the exact procedure specified, I in the brief quoted from the Colorado statute which is quite rigorous in its requirements. 
    When you have only a reasonable suspicion, you may still get an authorization to take prints or whatever. 
    Very rigorous requirements have to be followed. 
    But the point that I want to hammer home is it's always done with prior judicial authorization, and that was... that never came into play in this case.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, my trouble is that the purpose of getting fingerprints is singular: it's to identify, right?

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is it for any other purpose than identification?

    Because, if I can step back about two steps to a question you asked, yes, fingerprints are directed toward identification, but you may want to identify people for more than one reason. 
    When I went to take the Florida bar exam, I had to be fingerprinted so that they could make sure that I was the Michael Raiden who had signed up to take the bar exam, that I didn't send somebody to take it in my stead. 
    In Joe Hayes they don't want the fingerprints just so they can say yes, this is the right Hayes. 
    They want to identify Joe Hayes in this context so that they can convict him of a crime.

 If you argue that he could not take his fingerprints right there on the spot, surely you would argue he could not search him for his driver's license.

    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    I don't believe he could search him. 
    I think he can ask for and ask who you are, and part of the reason he can ask who he is may be for future reference. 
    If the person looks suspicious, the officer, under Terry, has a right to detain him if there's some reason to suspect there's criminal activity afoot. 
    And he can ask him who he is, and I would assume would make a report of that perhaps. 
    But unless he can connect this person to a specific crime, he can't go much beyond that. 
    Now, perhaps later on the officer might be patrolling that same area, and maybe he would find a broken window in a business. 
    Well, then he's got this person's name for reference. 
    He may be able to go back and--

    The other answer to your question was the distance between Mr. Hayes' residence and the Punta Gorda police station, whether it's not in the record, was one mile. 
    I think in this case and what has bothered me and both Mr. Raiden with the case has been the dry record of the motion to suppress hearing. 
    And you read that and the appendix, and you keep wondering why the police went to Mr. Hayes' home, what was their reason in going there, why did they think that he was the rapist. 
    Everything is very disjointed in that. 
    I have a finding of the Second District court of appeal that I stand here in front of you today that there was no probable cause. 
    Well, let's look at the reasonable suspicion. 
    And I would ask the Court and invite the Court to look at that reasonable suspicion in concert with the trial testimony joined with the testimony at the motion to suppress hearing. 
    Now, what did the police have? 
    We have the Punta Gorda police investigating three rapes, and we have the rape of Velora Davis, a woman aged 82. 
    You can get that at the sentencing hearing at R-741 where her case was null prossed. 
    And the second rape of Helen Smith, aged 60. 
    The case against Mr. Hayes where Mrs. Smith was a victim was also null prossed at Record 741. 
    Police had interviewed these victims, and they had gotten a composite photograph... not a photograph but a composite representation of what he looked like, a composite portrait, and they had gotten a composite from Julienne Hollander and another composite from... it was either Ms. Davis or Ms. Smith. 
    The record is not clear on that in the trial. 
    And this composite had been published in the local newspaper. 
    Now, what is alluded to in the motion to suppress hearing? 
    You have one question, and that's at the Joint Appendix page 11 by Mr. Bader where he's cross examining Detective Shoup, and he said, 
    "Did any informant tell you they knew of their personal knowledge that he had perpetrated any of the alleged crimes? " 
    And Detective Shoup answers, "Not myself". 
    Remember, there are two investigators, two detectives, Shoup and Gandy. 
    At the trial, and that's Record--

    And at that point in time, because he did get such an lengthy sentence, the state attorney null prosses the cases against Mr. Hayes with Ms. Davis and Ms. Smith, and Judge Adams says on the record, he says he doesn't want these ladies to go through the humiliating, degrading experience that Ms. Hollander had to go through in her trial.

    That's at Record 751. 
    I would proffer to the Court that the State of Florida does have those fingerprints.

    Mr. William I. Munsey, Jr. 
    Correct. 
    We have a detention, investigative detentions must be temporary and last no longer than necessary to effect the purpose of the stop. 
    The purpose of this stop was to take Mr. Hayes' fingerprints. 
    The State of Florida did everything reasonable. 
    We had Officer Cardell of the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office on standby at the police department ready to roll those prints. 
    Now, where the Government has been in trouble was the... the case of United States v. Place, and that's where luggage was seized and 90 minutes elapsed. 
    And it was alluded to that perhaps the Government should have had some dogs ready to sniff. 
    Well, that's not a problem in this case. 
    We have someone competent, willing, ready and able to compare those fingerprints, and they were compared. 
    The purpose of his detention was to take his fingerprints.

    Mr. William I. Munsey, Jr. 
    The greater intrusion would be the transportation. 
    The fingerprints... the taking of the fingerprints you aren't asking questions, you're not probing into their life. 
    There is a bit of a chill in transporting someone. 
    Although, on balance, in defending the... the... the detention and transporting of Mr. Hayes, on the other side of that, I don't know how I would feel if on my front porch of my home if a policeman is there, and my neighbors are looking, and I'm being fingerprinted on my front porch, or whether it is not a bit more acceptable to go with plainclothes policemen.

    Well, that's where her identification came from. 
    That's the source of her... of her identification was the rape itself.

    Did they have enough to arrest him without the fingerprinting and bring him into court?

   Rebuttal of Michael E. Raiden
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="2698.008" stopTime="2741.770">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Justice O'Connor, I think your question is a good one, and I wonder if it shouldn't remain unanswered at this point... Does the victim's I.D. have an independent source? 
    I don't think we can determine that. 
    Justice Marshall, the way I understand what happened in this case, back to one of your questions, he was charged with three rapes. 
    The investigation was concurrent. 
    He was informed against jointly, and I think the same evidence goes to all three. 
    So that he was never convicted independently. 
    He was never arrested three times. 
    I think he was arrested once for all three. 
    That's--

    Was the null prossing after this case?

    The--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2753.192" stopTime="2760.315">
    Justice Marshall 
    The argument that the Government made was that they had probable cause to think it was him because he had been null processed.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="2760.315" stopTime="2762.683">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --That's not my understanding of what happened.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2762.683" stopTime="2782.228">
    Justice Marshall 
    I understood the Government's argument to be that these other asserted attacks were known to the police at the time they went to his house, and that that furnished an additional basis for a probable cause arrest at that time.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2782.228" stopTime="2784.013">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But that's not what he said.

    I don't think that's what he said either. 
    They were investigating--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2787.632" stopTime="2793.469">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, that's the way I understood his argument. 
    Otherwise, there would have been no point in talking about these null prossed cases.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="2793.469" stopTime="2801.475">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    --I'm not sure there is any point in talking about them. 
    They were being investigated all at the same time, and they didn't proceed with them.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2801.475" stopTime="2810.830">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I thought the point was that three different people had versions of what he looked like, and together they were able to arrange a composite drawing that gave them their probable cause.
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="2810.830" stopTime="2901.340">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    That leads to my last point. 
    This Court said in Beck v. Ohio that a trial judge cannot make an adequate probable cause determination if they're not apprised of what the officers are going on. 
    Now, they said at one point in the suppression hearing that, as I understood them to say, the picture didn't look particularly like Joe Hayes, for one. 
    For the second part, they didn't bring those pictures in so that the judge could look at them and decide. 
    And I don't see how the pictures help the State's argument when the trial judge never got to look at them. 
    In other words, conceivably they may have had probable cause, but if they did... and I don't think they did... but if they did, they didn't prove it. 
    The last point I wanted to make regarded inevitable discovery. 
    My position would be that is a trial court determination, and I base that on Nix. 
    The case first came to this Court in Brewer v. Williams. 
    The Court reversed on the basis of the invalid confession and hinted that perhaps inevitable discovery might get the body back into evidence. 
    At that time there was a second suppression hearing. 
    Isn't it Iowa, isn't that the state? 
    Then... then argued inevitable discovery at the trial, and so when it came back to this Court, we had a record whereupon this Court could make a determination if the inevitable discovery rule did apply in those facts. 
    And such is not the case with Hayes v. Florida.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2901.340" stopTime="2917.184">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But if your friend is right on his theory that there was probable cause at the time they went to the man's home, then the inevitable discovery claim evaporates from the case, is that not right?
speaker="michael_e_raiden" startTime="2917.184" stopTime="2920.986">
    Mr. Michael E. Raiden 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    That's correct.
