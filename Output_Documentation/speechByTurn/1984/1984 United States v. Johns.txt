    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    The question presented concerns the authority of police officers to open bales of marijuana wrapped in plastic bags and found in a vehicle. 
    Specifically, the question is whether the lapse of time that occurred from the discovery of the packages to the time when core samples were taken from those packages, eliminated the officer's prior authority to open the packages without a warrant on the basis of probable cause. 
    The facts may be briefly stated as follows: at approximately 1:30 a.m. on August 4, 1981, Customs officers received a report of suspicious activity at a drag strip outside Tucson, Arizona. 
    A car leaving the site was intercepted and its occupants were identified as Respondents Johns and Hearron. 
    Pursuant to an ongoing investigation, Customs officials already had prior information linking Johns with Respondents Leon and Duarge in an international drug smuggling operation. 
    Accordingly, a Customs officer then commenced surveillance at Leon's and Duarte's residences, which led him to follow their two pickup trucks as they headed east on Interstate Highway 10 in Arizona. 
    Other officers were contacted, and ground and air surveillance was maintained on the trucks which drove about 100 miles east to a remote airstrip near Bowie, Arizona. 
    Shortly after the trucks arrived, the first of two small planes landed. 
    The agents on the ground were situated too far away to see what transpired there, but they were told by their colleagues in the air that one of the trucks approached the plane. 
    The first plane then departed, and a second plane landed and subsequently departed. 
    The officers then approached the trucks to investigate. 
    When they got close to them, they smelled marijuana and saw approximately 40 square packages wrapped in plastic, exposed in the back of the trucks. 
    Five of the Respondents were arrested at the scene, and the trucks and the packages were transported back to a DEA warehouse in Tucson. 
    Sometime thereafter, three days later, according to the opinion of the Court of Appeals, core samples were taken from some of the bales and sent to the laboratory for analysis. 
    This analysis confirmed that they were in fact marijuana. 
    No search warrant was obtained. 
    The District Court suppressed the contraband, finding that it was the fruit of a warrantless search that was prohibited by the then controlling Supreme Court authority in Robbins v. California. 
    The government appealed, relying primarily on footnote 13 in Arkansas v. Sanders and contending that the telltale odor and the nature of the packaging of these bales made the contents sufficiently obvious that no warrant was required. 
    While the case was pending on appeal, this Court decided United States v. Ross, and the parties submitted supplemental memoranda to address the significance of that decision. 
    The government claimed that ross was dispositive. 
    Respondents made two arguments. 
    First, they claimed that Ross should not be applied retroactively, and second, they contended that Ross did not apply in this case because the probable cause focused on the packages themselves, not on the trucks. 
    The Court of Appeals rejected both of these arguments. 
    However, it found for Respondents on a ground not briefed by the parties. 
    The Court ruled that a warrant was required to open the packages after the three-day delay, even though one would not have been required had the search been conducted immediately at the scene or immediately at the station house. 
    The Court denied the government's petition for rehearing and the government petition for certiorari. 
    Respondents make two arguments in this Court. 
    First, they renew their claim that was rejected by the Court of Appeals. 
    They claim that Ross does not apply here because the probable cause focused on the packages. 
    Rather, they contend that this case is analogous to United States v. Chadwick and therefore that the police always needed a warrant to open the packages, even if they had been searched immediately at the scene of the seizure at the airstrip. 
    This contention is somewhat factbound. 
    It was rejected by the Court of Appeals and is addressed in detail in our reply brief, and I do not plan to dwell on it at length in this Court. 
    Let me just say briefly that the agents' observations here plainly gave them probable cause to search the trucks. 
    They were not close enough to see anything specific that happened when the airplanes landed. 
    What they did know was that persons involved, known to be involved in a drug smuggling operation had driven two trucks and met two airplanes at an airstrip and apparently had received something from the airplanes. 
    They had good reason to believe that contraband had been transferred to the trucks. 
    They did not see any packages. 
    They did not even know of the existence of any specific kind of packages until they approached the trucks. 
    When they did approach the trucks and saw the packages wrapped in plastic, naturally their attention focused on those packages. 
    But that does not alter the fact that their suspicion from the beginning was focused on the trucks themselves, not on the packages. 
    This case in respect is exactly like Ross and completely unlike Chadwick and Arkansas v. Sanders, cases in which the police had suspicion that was focused on particular packages or containers in those cases, and the relationship... excuse me, they had a suspicion even before the packages were ever placed in a vehicle, and the fact that they were later placed in a vehicle before the seizure was quite coincidental to the nature of the suspicion. 
    I would also say that applying Ross in this case leads to the only sensible result here, that it would be quite unreasonable to have required the police to get a warrant at the scene when they... in order to take core samples or to open these bales that were reeking of marijuana at the time. 
    If there are no questions on that point, I will turn to Respondents' second contention, which is the focus of our petition. 
    That is, assuming that Ross applies here and that the police could have searched the bales at the scene without a warrant, Respondents argue that the police nonetheless needed a warrant when they opened the packages at the station a few days later. 
    This argument that this delay alone created a warrant requirement is completely foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court.

    The government has... we have no, no reason to believe that it was sooner than one day, certainly. 
    It does not appear that it was done immediately upon return to the station. 
    The other thing that is peculiar about this case is that this isn't... the search that we are talking about is not... was not really... its purpose was not an evidentiary search in the way that usually comes up in these cases. 
    The police were pretty sure what they had. 
    They were smelling marijuana. 
    They had 40 bales there. 
    They were packages like marijuana is always packaged.

    We think that the decisions of this Court compel a conclusion.

    I mean, the government did petition for a hearing on this issue, and the Court of Appeals just did not seem concerned about exactly how long the delay was on it.

 Well, I would think part of your answer to Justice Stevens' question would depend on whether you concede that there was an outer limit to the time in which the government was permitted to open these under the Fourth Amendment. 
 You have intimated that perhaps there were other considerations of some sort that might prevent the government from opening the parcel a year later. 
 Are those Fourth Amendment considerations?

    --No, but as far as the question of whether there was an outer limit on how long it could have taken to search, I think that is something that does depend on the nature of what they had. 
    If there was a locked briefcase, I think it would be unreasonable not to search it for a month, just hold it for a month without turning it over. 
    But in this case I am not sure it would be. 
    But given the way the Court of Appeals decided the case, I mean, we had this decision on the books.

speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="857.194" stopTime="1029.445">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, that's our view, but I think the Respondents' view and the Court of Appeals' view is that as soon as you get past the time when they could have gotten a warrant, the length of time doesn't matter, and a much shorter time is good enough to grant a suppression motion in this case. 
    That is the legal principle we have a problem with, and that is why we are petitioning here. 
    So from the perspective of the decision below, I don't think it matters at that point. 
    In our view, the contention that the delay here by itself created a warrant requirement is foreclosed by the prior decisions of this court. 
    The Respondents did not dispute here at all that the police could have searched the trucks themselves even three days later. 
    That principle is established by a long line of positions here, beginning with Chambers v. Maroney, continuing through Texas v. White and Michigan v. Thomas, and in fact, last term, in Florida v. Meyers, all nine Justices of this Court characterized that proposition as well settled. 
    What Respondents do argue here is that at some point during the time that the packages were at the stationhouse, a point that they define somewhat imprecisely as the time limit became practicable to get a warrant, the packages themselves became analytically distinct from the trucks on which they were found, and they could at that point no longer be searched without a warrant. 
    This argument is completely contrary to Ross on two separate points. 
    First, the basis for the decision in Ross is that the authority to conduct an automobile search extends to the entire automobile, including its contents, which includes the packages found inside. 
    That is to say, the search of a package found in an automobile is part of the automobile search itself. 
    It is not distinct at all. 
    Just as the justification for the automobile search, that is to say, probable cause, continues to authorize a warrantless search of the vehicle after it has been impounded at the station, so does that justification authorize the search of a package at that time as part of that vehicle search. 
    Second, Ross clearly confirms that the validity of a warrantless automobile search does not depend on any special exigency. 
    Indeed, if it did, the packages and the trucks in this case probably could not have been searched without a warrant even at the scene since the Respondents had been arrested and the trucks had been secured. 
    Certainly if Respondents were correct on this point, the trucks and the packages could not have been searched once they had been taken to DEA headquarters, even if that search had been conducted quite promptly there. 
    These Courts' case from Chambers through Florida v. Meyers, however, make it clear that the trucks in fact could have been searched at the stationhouse, even after some time had elapsed. 
    Thus, Respondents' contention--

 They have probable cause to believe that the packages in them are marijuana and they just let the trucks sit for a month, and then they finally get around to having to prepare for trial, so they want better proof, so they seize the... they open the packages and test them?

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    The trucks were forfeitable, too, sure. 
    I think that is clear from the Court's decisions. 
    The Court has said that even though the exigency has been removed at the stationhouse, the search is still allowed to be performed without a warrant, and at that point I don't think it matters whether it is eight hours or a day or even a month, at least as far as those principles go. 
    But the contention that the exigency here, the question of exigency, when it became practical to get a warrant, is sharply at odds with Ross. 
    This case, as recognized in Ross and discussed in other automobile search cases in this Court, involves a recognized exception to the warrant requirement, an exception that is distinct from the exigent circumstances doctrine. 
    When probable cause exists to search an automobile and its contents seized on the highway, the practicability of obtaining a warrant at some time after the seizure is not a relevant consideration. 
    Now, putting aside for the moment the dispositive precedent on this point, there is still no reason, no common sense reason why the delay should have any effect on the ability to conduct a warrantless search. 
    As the Court explained in Ross, the scope of an automobile search is precisely the same as the scope of a search that could be authorized by a magistrate through a search warrant. 
    Reading from page 823 of Ross, the Court said the scope of a warrantless search based on probable cause is no narrower and no broader than the scope of a search authorized by a warrant supported by probable cause. 
    Only the prior approval of the magistrate is waived. 
    The search otherwise is as the magistrate could authorize.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    This is Ross at page 823. 
    If the officers had obtained a search warrant for the trucks at the time that they seized them, there surely is no contention that the trucks and the packages could not have been searched later at the stationhouse, even three days later. 
    There is no reason why there should be a different result here. 
    Certainly policy considerations lend no support to the Court of Appeals' holding. 
    The decision below does not advance any privacy interest of the individual at all. 
    The privacy intrusion to him is the same whether the packages are searched immediately or whether they are searched three days later. 
    There is no expectation of privacy of the individual that is intruded by the warrantless search here. 
    It cannot seriously be contended that the delay itself created an expectation of privacy in the package that did not exist previously and that could not be invaded without obtaining a search warrant from a magistrate. 
    Under Ross, the placement of a package in an automobile sufficiently reduces his expectation of privacy that it may be searched on the basis of probable cause without a warrant. 
    That expectation of privacy cannot magically reappear with the passage of some indefinite period of time while the package at all times remains in the custody of the police. 
    The practical effect of the rule imposed by the Court of Appeals is simply to induce the police to make an immediate search. 
    That does not help the individual's privacy interest at all, but it does put an unnecessary strain on law enforcement resources with some potential cost to their other responsibilities. 
    Finally, the Court of Appeals' rule completely eviscerates this Court's effort in Ross to establish a bright line to guide officers in conducting automobile searches. 
    Each case, under the Court of Appeals holding, where the search was not made at the scene, would result in litigation over when it became practicable to get a warrant, or alternatively, whether the delay was justified by "pressing law enforcement duties", a phrase like that used by Respondents.

    There could be a line drawn there. 
    That's the line that the Court refused to draw in Chambers v. Maroney and the line of cases thereafter. 
    There really isn't any reason why the packages should be treated differently than the car. 
    The Court could have held in Chambers that the search had to be conducted at the scene, and once the car is taken to the stationhouse a warrant was required. 
    It decided for good reasons there that there was no point in having such a rule.

    At some... at that point the police would have an obligation to conduct the search in some expeditious manner.

speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1482.200" stopTime="1621.783">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I can't conceive of anything in the facts of this case where the Defendants would be prejudiced at all by... I mean, as a practical matter, the police are not going to keep these things around indefinitely. 
    They have an interest in getting things moving. 
    But I don't see what reason they would have to complain about it, even if the search had taken longer. 
    It could have been longer. 
    It seems to me that there is simply no reason to inject uncertainty into what is at least at this point a fairly well settled area of the law. 
    There is no problem here that requires correction. 
    There is no interest here that requires a special rule to protect Fourth Amendment rights. 
    The police have no incentive unnecessarily to delay opening the packages that are found in an automobile when they want to search them on the basis of probable cause. 
    Even acting without any fear at all at the invocation of the exclusionary rule, the police's desire to advance the course of its investigation suggests that officers will search such packages as soon as practicable. 
    Therefore, there is no need to create a rule to prevent officers from delaying. 
    Secondly, to the extent there is any delay... and that is really illustrated in this case... it a does not really prejudice the owners of the packages in the absence of some other set of facts like the locked briefcase that we have been discussing. 
    I think it is important to emphasize here that even though the question in this case is whether the police needed to get a warrant or not, this is not really like the normal warrant case where there is a concern of protecting the individual's privacy. 
    Normally in a case where the court imposes a warrant requirement, the reason is to interpose the magistrate in between so that the police's own determination of probable cause is not a justification for search. 
    Therefore, in a case where the police turn out to be wrong, there is a real privacy intrusion in that something is searched for no reason. 
    But that is not the case here because even if the Court of Appeals is affirmed, the police are still entitled to conduct a warrantless search here. 
    It does not protect against the danger that the police are going to misapprehend the nature of probable cause. 
    The only thing that is gained by applying the Court of Appeals' rationale is that the police will be prevented from delaying, and as I said before, that delay does not hurt the Defendants, and there is no incentive for the police to do it anyway. 
    I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I think that there is a fundamental disagreement between counsel on the various sides as to what the issue in this case is. 
    The government argues that the issue in this case is whether the government had probable cause to search the automobile at the scene. 
    We disagree with that.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    No, sir, we do not. 
    Our position before the Court of Appeals and before this Court is that the record is devoid of any indication that there was ever an automobile search in this case. 
    The focus of the police officers was solely and exclusively on the packages from the moment that they arrived on the scene until the time that the core samples were taken later. 
    There is not a scintilla of evidence before this Court that the police officers were ever concerned with the types of vehicles as vehicles.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    I take issue with your conclusion, respectfully, that the Court of Appeals found that fact against us. 
    If you go back to the District Court opinion, the District Court opinion found as a matter of fact that the police officers from some thirty feet saw a group of packages, that as they approached the packages, they knew that those were the types of packages that commonly were used to put marijuana in, they smelled marijuana coming from the packages. 
    They had been... there had been other officers on the scene about an hour earlier who had looked in those vehicles, had smelled no marijuana, had seen no packages. 
    The officers concluded, and the testimony is unequivocal on this point, that the officers believed that the marijuana was only in the packages. 
    In fact, the government at the District Court level argued that there was no search because they knew that the marijuana was in the packages. 
    The District Court found as a matter of fact that when they got to the vehicles, they "viewed the packages" that were--

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    According to the evidence, what happened was the vehicles went down to an airstrip in Bowie, Arizona. 
    They were spotted and surveilled by police officers all the way from Tucson. 
    When they got--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1809.474" stopTime="1821.052">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Then you don't agree with the government's version of the facts, that they came in this isolated airstrip at night and the packages were taken off the small airplane and put onto the truck. 
    Do you agree with that?

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    --We agree with part of that. 
    It was during the daylight hours, and what happened was the police were given a tip by a confidential informant in Tucson, which is approximately 100 miles from this site, and in fact, they had continuous surveillance if these two vehicles from the time that they left Tucson, Arizona earlier that morning until they got to the landing site and met with the airplanes.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    Yes, Your Honor, yes, Your Honor. 
    Our point is that what Ross says... and I think we need to look at the language of this Court in Ross... that if you are in the midst of an automobile search and you need to search packages to complete the automobile search, then it is justifiable to search the packages without a warrant. 
    Here is clearly what Justice Stevens said in the opinion in Ross. 
    then a legitimate search is under way... and we are talking about an automobile search... nice distinctions between glove compartments, upholstered seats, trunks and wrapped packages must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient completion of the task at hand, and the whole grounding of Ross, of this Court's opinion in Ross, is that if you are in the midst of an automobile search, it would defeat law enforcement purposes to say, well, you can search certain portions of the automobile but not all of it. 
    The situation is radically different, as it was in Chadwick and Sanders, if the focus is on not the vehicle as a whole but rather, on a particular item which happens to be reposed in an automobile.

    Well, you must agree, I would think, that frequently we do not consider a principle laid down as confined to the precise facts in which... in the case in which they were laid down. 
    The Ross opinion announced a general principle, did it not, that deviated somewhat from prior holdings?

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    No, sir. 
    I think the type of vehicle is important here only for one reason, and that is that the packages of marijuana were in a separate portion from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. 
    If in fact the police officers had really been concerned with the vehicles in question, certainly they would have searched the whole vehicles. 
    They didn't do that. 
    In fact, there is not a scintilla of evidence in the record that they even went into the passenger compartments where the people were located to search that at all. 
    The facts of this case are that the police officers, according to the District Court, from 30 feet away saw the packages, smelled the marijuana, knew in their own minds exactly where it was, got up to the vehicles, said take the vehicles to the stationhouse. 
    They took the vehicles to the stationhouse, unloaded the packages--

    --Well, I think that the thing that is wrong with that government is that the reason for the exclusionary rule is as a prophylactic effect, to prevent the police from engaging in illegal behavior, and the fact that it might not help in this cast doesn't mean that the exclusionary rule wouldn't help in cases where we don't know what is in the packages.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    Well, it is not the lapse of time that damages us, it is the fact that since this investigation was always an investigation of packages, people have a high expectation of privacy in packages, and this Court has frequently said, way back to the Jackson case where in the mail people had an expectation of privacy in packages, that people's expectation of packages is high.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2219.313" stopTime="2233.755">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, privacy expectations in the mail or in interstate commerce are quite different from being... from packages unloaded from a small airplane at an isolated airstrip under the circumstances shown here.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    Well, I disagree with Your Honor to the extent that I think this Court has consistently found that regardless of the nature or type of package or the situation with packages, people have a high expectation of privacy with respect to packages.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    If the police are in the pursuit of an automobile search, then dispute a person's high expectation of privacy in the package, this Court has allowed the search, not because the expectation of privacy is lessened, but because of the fact that the police are engaged in an automobile search, the completion of which is dependent on being able to search everything in the automobile.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    What this Court said in Ross was if you are in the middle of an automobile search and all of a sudden you come across a package, you can't search the package, it frustrates the auto search. 
    But there is no auto search in this case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2285.927" stopTime="2290.299">

    We didn't focus in on that issue to the extent that we have here before this court, obviously because at the time we thought Robbins was controlling.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    No, sir. 
    It is the reason for the search, just as in a search incident to an arrest case. 
    This Court has held that if you search an automobile incident to somebody's arrest, since the reason for that search is to allow the protection of the police officer, we say it is okay, but if you then search that same automobile, not because it is for the protection of the police officer incident to arrest, but later at the stationhouse, even though you could have done a search incident to arrest, we don't allow it.

    --Yes, sir. 
    You say in the course of a legitimate warrantless search of an automobile, police are entitled to open containers. 
    There is no automobile search going on here. 
    Our position on that issue is very simple. 
    The focus of this investigation, just as the focus of the police investigation in Chadwick and in Sanders, was reposed entirely on these containers. 
    In fact, the government's argument before the District Court and the Court of Appeals was that their interest was so focused on the containers that there was no search because the marijuana was in plain view.

 I suppose it is the subjective motivation of the police: are you going to search the whole truck or are you just going to seize the bale?

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    Well, I respectfully disagree with you, Justice Stevens, for this reason. 
    In Sanders the facts clearly established that there was other luggage of the Defendant's that was in that vehicle. 
    Now, that luggage could have been searched to find evidence of the crime, and yet it wasn't whether there was probable cause to search further that was important to this Court, it was whether or not in fact the focus of the inquiry was on the other things or whether it was exclusively on the green suitcase. 
    He came out with a whole bunch of luggage.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    Yes, sir. 
    That I think is wrong, because the whole reason to relax the rule for a package search when a package is in a vehicle is to allow police to complete their task of searching the vehicle. 
    If they are not involved in a vehicle search, why then should the rule be relaxed to allow a package search without a warrant? 
    The facts in this case indicate that the police officers arrived there some five to ten minutes after the packages had been loaded onto the trucks, that in fact, what happened was the packages were taken out of the airplanes and were then loaded into the vehicles. 
    Let's suppose that the police officers in this case had arrived five to ten minutes earlier, and when they got there the packages which happened to be sitting in the back of the pickup trucks had been sitting on the ground instead. 
    At that point I think it would be clear that the government would not be able to argue that just because they had probable cause to search the automobiles they therefore could open the packages without a warrant. 
    And I suggest to the Court that it shouldn't make a difference that they get there five minutes later and that the bales and boxes of marijuana happened to be sitting in the back end of a camper truck.

speaker="william_g_walker" startTime="3116.223" stopTime="3167.456">
    Mr. William G. Walker 
    My argument, if the Court please, is based on the plain reading of Ross which says that if you are in the process of an auto search you can do it, but just the justification to do an automobile search doesn't do it for you. 
    I think it is analogous in a sense to the pretext arrest area, where if somebody is going 100 miles an hour and a police officer stops the vehicle because he is going 100 miles an hour, and then you smell marijuana or you see marijuana in plain view, that arrest is okay. 
    But if somebody is going 100 miles an hour and you stop them not for that reason but because you suspect them of being a drug dealer, and then you see marijuana in plain view, that is a pretext arrest, and it is no good. 
    In that situation the difference is not in what the police are allowed to do, because clearly in both cases they would be allowed to stop the driver. 
    It is rather in what they were doing.

    Mr. William G. Walker 
    --The difference is that we have historically allowed automobile searches not only in situations where there are exigencies, but even days later, because historically people have a lesser expectation of privacy in their automobiles. 
    They don't, however, have a lesser expectation of privacy in their packages, and once... if you do an automobile search three days later, then in order to complete the automobile search and because we allow searches of automobiles, we would then allow the search of the packages. 
    But if the packages are taken out of the automobile and stored in a place that is separate and apart from the automobile, and there is no evidence in the record that there has ever been an automobile search, then in what realistic sense can you say that the opening of these packages is an automobile search?

    I would like to answer a question that Justice Stevens posed of government's counsel. 
    You asked who would the burden of proof be on with respect to the time period. 
    And I would suggest that it would clearly be on the government, for this reason. 
    We generally go by the standard that you must have a warrant in all cases unless we find an exception, and the exception must be proven by the government. 
    The government bears the burden of proving each essential element of an exception, and if the government wants to prove that an exception was reasonable in this case, the government then has the responsibility of proving that the time period--

    --Soon thereafter I think is consistent with this Court's dictate in Robbins where you yourself said soon thereafter, and I think what the Court found, the Court of Appeals found is there was nothing in the record to justify that it was soon thereafter, and the government has the burden of proving it is soon thereafter.

    I would agree with that, and for that reason I think this is a bad case for this Court to decide on certiorari, but if you are going to decide it, then I think what you have to do is to say the burden of proof is no the government to prove the exception, the exception as enunciated in Ross clearly says it has got to be soon thereafter, and there is no proof in this record that it was soon thereafter.

   Rebuttal of Alan I. Horowitz
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="3427.958" stopTime="3481.925">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Let me just make a brief point about this question of whether the trucks were searched. 
    We agree with Justice Stevens that the crucial issue here is the probable cause to search the trucks, not the subjective motivation of the officers. 
    But as a matter of fact here, I think the trucks were searched. 
    It is just that these bales were sitting open in the back of the trucks. 
    So it didn't have to be very extensive search. 
    They came up to search the trucks, and right away they saw the packages there. 
    It is exactly the same case as Ross. 
    There is no reason to think in Ross that the police ripped the car apart after they found the paper bag. 
    Once they found the package, they thought they found what they were looking for, and they didn't continue the search there. 
    I think it is irrelevant whether the trucks were searched later at the station, but there is no evidence... we don't really know from the record whether they were or they weren't. 
    The only evidence that I found, actually, very obliquely suggests that they were in fact searched. 
    That is at page 11 of the November 10 transcript.

    Do we know whether this truck was forfeited after the event or not?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="3485.526" stopTime="3502.075">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I assume that it was, but I don't know. 
    And finally, if the Court is disposed to accept this argument that Ross does not apply here at all, we would suggest that a warrantless search was nevertheless permissible under the theory of Footnote 13 of Sanders. 
    Thank you.
