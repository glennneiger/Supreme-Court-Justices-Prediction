    Ms. Kathleen Managhan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is an appeal from a decision of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. 
    The issue before you today is whether the exclusionary rule should be applied to exclude the admission of evidence at an administrative hearing, in this case a liquor license revocation hearing, which evidence has already been excluded from use at criminal trial. 
    The lower court, the Rhode Island Supreme Court, answered this question affirmatively. 
    The evidence excluded in this case, stolen property, clothing, was found on the premises of the Attic Lounge, a licensed Tiverton, Rhode Island liquor-serving establishment. 
    On March 11, 1977, the Tiverton police entered the Attic Lounge pursuant to a search warrant which had been obtained by them after receiving a tip from a neighboring police department that they would find stolen property on the property of the Attic Lounge. 
    They entered the lounge, they found the stolen property. 
    However, later that warrant was held defective by a Rhode Island Superior Court judge, and therefore the search warrant was quashed.

    Ms. Kathleen Managhan 
    It is my understanding the grounds for the quashing of the warrant were that the police did not knock prior to entering the premises of the Attic Lounge, and also apparently the trial court judge believed that the affidavit which accompanied and caused the warrant to issue did not show probable, sufficient probable cause.

    Ms. Kathleen Managhan 
    --Yes, Mrs. Justice O'Connor. 
    Under Rhode Island law, because this was a licensed liquor-serving establishment, there is a particular Rhode Island statute... I believe it is cited in the appendix to my brief... which allows police officers and other municipal officials at any time to enter the premises of a licensed liquor-serving establishment in order to see whether they are carrying out their operations within the parameters of the law, and for other reasons. 
    This was in fact acknowledged by the Rhode Island Supreme Court in its decision. 
    In this case, however, in this case the Tiverton police did in fact seek a warrant. 
    Obviously their chief thought was in order to obtain stolen property, they did go into the premises of the bar, found the stolen property, but the warrant was quashed. 
    This, of course, meant that the criminal charges which the State of Rhode Island had initially brought against the manager of the bar and against the bartender, had to be dropped. 
    However, the Tiverton Town Council, which functions as a local licensing authority for bars within its jurisdiction, had also started procedures, liquor license revocation procedures, against the owner of the Attic Lounge. 
    They had begun these procedures pursuant to a Rhode Island statute, another Rhode Island statute which I believe appears in the appendix to my petition, which allows a municipality to revoke a liquor license where it can be shown that any state law was violated on the premises of that licensed establishment.

    Ms. Kathleen Managhan 
    No, no, that is not my understanding. 
    There was no identity between the council members and the bar principals. 
    March 28, 1977, the town council sitting as license commissioners held a hearing, heard testimony from the local police about their obtaining of the warrant, their searching the premises of the bar, finding the stolen clothing, on the basis of that presentation, revoked the license of the bar. 
    The bar owners appealed. 
    Initially they appealed, as it provided by Rhode Island statutory law, to the Liquor License Administrator, Mr. Pastore, who reversed the town council on other grounds, not exclusionary rule grounds. 
    The town then appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court which, for the first time, raised the issue of whether the exclusionary rule should have been applied to an administrative hearing, and held that in fact the Liquor License Administrator, for the wrong reasons, but nevertheless, was correct in vacating the revoking of the license. 
    The town therefore appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. 
    The Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's holding that evidence of stolen property obtained pursuant to an invalid warrant and suppressed already for criminal purposes, should not have been admissible at a liquor license hearing. 
    This did this I believe on three bases. 
    They indicated very clearly in their decision an unwillingness to dilute the deterrent effects of the exclusionary rule on police misconduct by allowing illegally obtained evidence to be admitted at such an administrative hearing. 
    They also did it by analogizing this administrative hearing, liquor license revocation hearing, to a so-called quasi-criminal hearing. 
    They called it quasi-criminal in character and therefore said that just as the exclusionary rule is applied to criminal hearings, so should it be applied to quasi-criminal hearings such as this. 
    And they finally found an insufficient societal interest in the control of liquor-serving establishments to justify a different finding from the one that they had made. 
    We believe that the Rhode Island Supreme Court should be reversed on each of these grounds: first, on the ground of deterrence. 
    I believe that this court in Janis has commented on the uncertainty as to whether the exclusionary rule in fact deters police from improper searches and seizures. 
    It was suggested I believe in that decision that where there has already been criminal exclusion of suppressed evidence, that that is enough, that that is a sufficient sharp medicine, if you will, strong medicine, enacted against a local police, that that is enough to just... enough exclusion in that case. 
    I would argue that exclusion has already occurred here. 
    The evidence that was obtained by the Tiverton police has already been excluded from a criminal proceeding. 
    Therefore, there has been a sufficient penalty enforced against the Tiverton police to justify the deterrent purposes of that rule. 
    Moreover, this exclusion occurred at a criminal hearing which I would argue that criminal hearing, that criminal charge was the Tiverton police's zone of primary interest. 
    I would admit that under the standards that were brought forth by this Court in Janis, that this probably qualifies as an intrasovereign situation on its bare facts. 
    I would, however, argue that despite this being an intrasovereign situation, so to speak, that despite their probable employment status, the chief zone of primary interest for these Tiverton police officers entering the bar on that March evening was a criminal offense and not a licensing offense. 
    And I believe this is--

    No, it would have been a judge who would have issued that warrant. 
    I would argue that this, that this particular criminal hearing and not the licensing hearing was the zone of primary interest for the police officers involved for various reasons. 
    They acted on a tip. 
    They acted on a tip that there was stolen property at the lounge. 
    Based on that tip they obtained a warrant. 
    They obtained a warrant that specifically indicated that they were searching for stolen property. 
    They also, in effect, under Rhode Island law, and under Rhode Island criminal procedures, were basically acting as agents of the state, not the city which employed them, in investigating the possible commission of a felony. 
    In Rhode Island, it is the State Attorney General's office and not the municipalities that actually prosecute felony offenses. 
    Therefore, I would argue that the Tiverton police entering the lounge that evening were basically acting as state agents, not as agents of the town which employed them. 
    They were interested in the possible commission of a felony, not in the possible commission of a licensing offense.

    Ms. Kathleen Managhan 
    I stand corrected, Your Honor. 
    It was not a point that was ever dwelled upon by the lower court. 
    That is entirely possible. 
    Tiverton is a small town. 
    You have... several of you have brought up the existence of this particular Rhode Island statute which enables local police officers, where they are interested in learning of licensing offenses, to actually enter the premises of a bar in order to determine whether those licensing offenses have in fact occurred. 
    I bring that to your attention to indicate what to me seems to be a very clear indication that for the Tiverton police officers entering the Attic Lounge, license... licensing offenses were not what were on their mind. 
    If they were interested in determining licensing offenses, or if that was further down the line for them, they would in fact have not even bothered to have obtained a warrant. 
    They would have simply entered the bar, and they could have checked around to see if there were any licensing offenses, and the statute does not provide any limitation to where they may look, so presumably they could have looked over the entire premises, and as the Rhode Island Supreme Court itself admits, if in fact being on the premises pursuant to that statute they had seen property which they knew from other information to have been stolen, they could have acted appropriately. 
    They didn't do this. 
    They got a warrant. 
    And I think what this indicates, it indicates two things. 
    It first of all supports my argument which I am once again basing upon this Court's concern in Janis, with primary zone of interest, that this... these police officers' primary zone of interest was felony investigation and not license investigation. 
    If it had been license investigation, why would they have bothered to have gone to the trouble of getting the warrant? 
    In fact, they did. 
    I think this very clearly indicates that it was the felony investigation that was chiefly on their minds. 
    It brings up another issue, however, the existence of this statute, as to what deterrent effect there would be if in this case the evidence that was obtained by the unlawful warrant was in fact excluded. 
    Where you have a statute such as this, there really is very little deterrence effect at all. 
    All it will really do is discourage Rhode Island police officers henceforth from ever obtaining a warrant where there is any other basis pursuant to which they can go on licensed premises in order to take a look around. 
    In this case it certainly is not going to encourage police officers to obtain a warrant. 
    It will have exactly the opposite effect. 
    They will not want to take a chance that the warrant will be quashed, that the evidence will be considered excluded for any purposes, and they will therefore simply enter the bar under the statutory basis and will... and see what they can see. 
    And presumably, if they see something that indicates a felony violation, they could present it to the Attorney General's office for prosecution of that felony violation, and there would be no constitutional issue because they were appropriately on the premises pursuant to the statute. 
    So I think if in fact this Court were to determine that the excluded evidence could not be used at the liquor license revocation hearing because of the quashed warrant, this would have, if anything, the opposite of a deterrent effect on police officers because it would discourage them from using the more protective constitutional means of obtaining a warrant. 
    Instead they would always proceed under the statute. 
    The Rhode Island Supreme Court also indicated its belief that this liquor license revocation hearing was in fact a quasi criminal hearing, although we attempted to--

    Ms. Kathleen Managhan 
    That is correct. 
    The Rhode Island Supreme Court called this particular procedure a quasi-criminal proceeding because the object of the proceeding, the liquor license revocation proceeding, was to penalize for a legal offense. 
    This Court I believe in Lopez-Mendoza designated a very similar, similar proceeding as a civil proceeding, and I believe there are great analogies between the deportation hearings and the liquor license revocation hearing that is before you. 
    For instance, in this case, the Tiverton Town Council was reviewing admittedly bad past behavior of the bar in order to determine whether it should continue to be entitled to hold a liquor license issued by the town. 
    Similarly, in Lopez-Mendoza, this Court was faced with the factual circumstances of whether an alien should be allowed to continue to remain in this country because of how he had happened to enter this country, whether he had come in properly or not. 
    In both of these cases an administrative tribunal was reviewing behavior which could be the subject of separate criminal action, but the review was not in fact criminal in type. 
    Also, another similarity between what is before you and Lopez-Mendoza, it was the informality of the proceeding. 
    The Tiverton Town Council was the tribunal which was hearing evidence, excluded evidence, in order to determine whether there should be a license revocation. 
    Certainly some rules of evidence probably pertain, but you are basically dealing with a lay, a lay board making a determination as to revocation or nonrevocation. 
    Another point which should be mentioned is that tribunals such as Tiverton in Rhode Island do not need to be shown that a conviction was obtained for this offense against Rhode Island laws in order for them to revoke a license. 
    In other words, they can be presented with evidence that in fact Rhode Island laws were violated on the premises of a bar. 
    But they don't actually have to be shown evidence that a conviction was obtained.

    Ms. Kathleen Managhan 
    That is correct, and he was told that that in fact was not the case, that a conviction is not necessary. 
    To me this indicates an indication that there is a lesser standard of evidentiary concern in order to determine whether a licensed liquor establishment ought to have their license revoked. 
    It is true that a board such as the Town of Tiverton, in making this kind of determination, may in fact penalize. 
    However, I would argue that an immigration court also penalizes in the deportation hearing if they in fact decide that an alien's behavior justifies their being deported. 
    I do not think that this penal, possible penal aspect of a civil hearing such as before you is something that should be, as it was with the Rhode Island Supreme Court, a center for a decision as to whether the exclusionary rule should be applied to such a tribunal. 
    In fact, the Rhode Island Supreme Court admits excluded evidence in certain kinds of criminal hearings, as do a number of courts. 
    The Rhode Island Supreme Court in its decision referred to probation revocation hearings and bail revocation hearings as criminal proceedings where, although a penalty might be the ultimate result, that in fact the exclusionary rule would not apply to these subsequent but nevertheless criminal proceedings. 
    Many civil administrative hearings have penal elements. 
    This type of hearing may in fact be held to have some kind of penal element to it. 
    However, I believe that this Court has made very clear in Janis and in Lopez-Mendoza that the label on a hearing is not nearly as important as the effect of applying the exclusionary rule to that hearing will have on law enforcement practices in the area and on the... and what the social impact will be of such an application. 
    I would pass to what that social impact would be. 
    I believe you have before you in the regulation of the sale of liquor an excellent example of a traditional and appropriate area of great governmental concern. 
    And I think that the statutes that we have discussed in Rhode Island show that there is a clearly public policy for close control of licensed liquor-serving establishments. 
    In fact, a license to serve liquor is a privilege which is granted by a governmental authority in Rhode Island, by a municipal authority, contingent, and is held contingent upon the proper operation of those premises. 
    The public need for that control is clearly shown by the statutes that we have discussed, for instance, the ability to enter upon the premises at any time without a warrant simply to determine appropriate operation, upon the fact that a license may be revoked for any proof of the fact that a state law or other municipal law has been broken on those premises, even if there has been no conviction for the same.

    Ms. Kathleen Managhan 
    There are other cases to the contrary. 
    There are the cases that the Rhode Island Supreme Court relied on in its decision. 
    The Finn's case is probably the most well known example in New York, and I believe there are other decisions in Pennsylvania. 
    Those cases particularly deal with the issue of liquor license revocation. 
    I think if you look at the larger issue of whether the exclusionary rule ought to be applied to civil hearings in general, you will find a very mixed treatment of this particular issue, and I believe I gave as an example the treatment that the State of California has given to the application of the exclusionary rule to civil hearings. 
    One of their best cases was... best known cases was the Emslie case in which they basically at the beginning of the case discussed what for them is a very tight adherence to the exclusionary rule even in some other so-called civil proceedings, and then proceed to not apply it in a proceeding which dealt with disbarment of an attorney. 
    So while I would admit that there are in fact some very strong cases against me on the limited issue of the application of the exclusionary rule to liquor license revocation proceedings, I think if you take the larger look at civil application of the exclusionary rule to a variety of such hearings, you will find that in fact it seems as though the jurisdictions and also the federal courts are pretty evenly split.

    Your Honor, there is some, as my adversary has pointed out, there is some diversion in the lower courts as to whether or not the exclusionary rule does apply in this type of proceeding. 
    It would be some clarification. 
    My own personal feeling, I wouldn't have a problem with that. 
    I believe that in that event, the Rhode Island Supreme Court case would stand, and the Plymouth Sedan case would still stand and be law, and those are the cases basically that I am relying upon for my position.

    Mr. John H. Hines, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, I do not. 
    Basically the position that I have taken is twofold, Your Honors. 
    The first is whether or not the exclusionary rule applies. 
    And I have taken the position that it does, and I am in agreement with the Rhode Island Supreme Court based upon the Plymouth Sedan case, that the nature of a license revocation is quasi-criminal in nature in that it is intended to penalize the licensee for a past transgression or commission of unlawful conduct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2623.558" stopTime="2630.648">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Well, wouldn't that mean that virtually all license revocations would fall under that category?
speaker="john_h_hines_jr" startTime="2630.648" stopTime="2758.780">
    Mr. John H. Hines, Jr. 
    Yes, it would, Your Honor, and it would I think for this reason. 
    Things in the law for the most part remain static, but they do change, and one of the things that has changed with a license, an alcoholic beverage license, at one time it was a naked privilege. 
    Rhode Island Supreme Court has now recognized that it has the nature of a property right, and it really have value in the sense that without it someone in that business of a restaurant or lounge is not going to make any money, so that it is seriously a penalty for someone to have a lounge business or restaurant business and not to have accompanying it an alcoholic beverage license in today's world. 
    As a result, to lose it, to have it revoked is indeed a penalty, and as Justice O'Connor pointed out, the Rhode Island statutes provide that if a revocation occurs under the statute which Tiverton acted under, the licensee is prohibited also from having an alcoholic beverage license in that state for a period of five years time. 
    I believe that that is penal in nature, taking into account the loss of a valuable item of property and the fact that for five years you are prohibited from being in that particular business. 
    And I think, the most prominent discussion of what is quasi-criminal was in the recent case of Lopez-Mendoza, where it was acknowledged the case, although purely civil in nature, there was some discussion about what constitutes a quasi-criminal situation. 
    And I believe that this case falls right into that category, and it is analogous to the situation of forfeiture in the Plymouth Sedan case where a property right is forfeited, action of forfeiture is taken against it, a revocation is forfeiture, and it has a quasi-criminal nature. 
    This was also pointed out by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, that they can go against an individual in this kind of case under two different avenues, but they are basically co-extensive is the word I believe they used.

    Mr. John H. Hines, Jr. 
    My answer is yes, for this reason. 
    I think there are two questions that need to be asked in this case. 
    One is does it apply? 
    And I believe it does. 
    If you have gone so far in Lopez-Mendoza, which is purely civil, as indicated, and applied the rule, then it applies in this case. 
    Then you go to the balancing test, and in Lopez-Mendoza, I am in basic agreement with the end result of the balancing test. 
    I believe, though, that applying the balancing test in this case, we don't come out with the same result as Lopez-Mendoza. 
    So I think there are two separate questions: application of the rule itself, and if it does apply, then you enter into the balancing situation. 
    But I--

    Mr. John H. Hines, Jr. 
    --I don't believe so. 
    I believe that with One Plymouth Sedan, and going back to Boyd, and One Plymouth Sedan, and even Janis, in this situation of an intrasovereign situation, that it does apply, and especially after you have already said in Lopez-Mendoza, which is purely civil, that it does. 
    I don't even know that I need to say that this is necessarily quasi-criminal. 
    But I am, because I am relying upon the Plymouth Sedan. 
    I think it is not putting the cart before the horse. 
    I think that the way these decisions in this Court have come down, it is a necessary process to first determine does it apply. 
    Now, you may determine it doesn't apply for the reason that this is a civil situation and not a criminal situation, but I think we must get to the balancing process as well.

    Mr. John H. Hines, Jr. 
    --Absolutely. 
    As a point of interest, perhaps only interest, I was not involved in the Superior Court level of this or the Supreme Court in Rhode Island State. 
    The case, when certiorari was granted, or the petition was requested, went to the Rhode Island Attorney General's department. 
    As I understand it, they weren't pleased with necessarily the Rhode Island Supreme Court decision and didn't want to take the time to act to sustain it. 
    That's when I got the call. 
    And I am here as a result of that.

    Mr. John H. Hines, Jr. 
    I'm not so sure about that, Your Honor. 
    Well, I would like now to get then to the balancing test, and I did want to point out that because of the quasi-criminal nature of the case, that I do believe that the rule applies. 
    But the balancing test, as I pointed out to Justice O'Connor... I am not sure she agrees with me necessarily, but is the next application that we must undertake to determine if the costs and the benefits warrant its application. 
    I have pointed out and I have made particularly contrast to Lopez-Mendoza which I think went to great lengths at presenting and weighing the various factors that go into a situation of cost and benefit, and as far as the benefit is concerned, the significant benefit I have is we are faced with a situation that is opposite of Janis that we have an intrasovereign situation. 
    The same police officer that went upon the premises with the warrant is the same police officer that would testify, and probably did testify, with respect to the liquor control situation. 
    They both, the officer is interested in both situations, and I maintain that under the case law, that it is sufficiently derivative, the two actions of criminal in the courts and of the administrative hearing before the liquor board, that the rule should apply. 
    And I believe that this was determined to some degree in Janis. 
    I would also like to point out that in deterrence, one of the things that I have experienced in doing the research on this was that deterrence generally is used in a singular sense as against the offending officer, as it were. 
    On the other hand, when we are looking at the costs, we look at them in a pluralistic view as to the cost to society, and I would like to maintain and submit to the Court that I am in agreement with Mr. Justice Brennan when he stated in Leon that the deterrence should be pluralistic in the sense that what we are seeking in deterrence is institutional compliance, and I think that sometimes in making the weighing, balancing situation, the scales are somewhat thrown out of function when we don't stop to look at the institutional compliance that we are looking for, and we focus rather on the singular activity of an officer. 
    And so that in determining the situation of cost, I don't believe that, as was argued by my opponent, that we can simply look at the sphere of influence of the officer himself. 
    I think we have to look beyond that in a pluralistic sense, and I think that would counteract the pluralistic viewpoint we take when we determine what it will cost to implement the rule.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Doesn't the... considering the point that Justice Rehnquist raised with you, I am increasingly puzzled. 
    Isn't it in the interest of the state, which under the 21st Amendment is given broad powers for the control of liquor, to facilitate everything possible to keep the industry clean and upright?
speaker="john_h_hines_jr" startTime="3300.730" stopTime="3302.498">
    Mr. John H. Hines, Jr. 
    The answer to that question is yes, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3302.498" stopTime="3311.538">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    And isn't that a lot easier if you can march into a liquor establishment without a warrant and see if they are complying with the law?
speaker="john_h_hines_jr" startTime="3311.538" stopTime="3497.610">
    Mr. John H. Hines, Jr. 
    That is correct, and there is such a statute. 
    The only difficulty with that statute, Your Honor, as I read it to you, its focus is basically upon compliance with liquor matters and not with other aspects of the law. 
    But we do have that broad statute. 
    Now, I wanted to in my conclusion, Your Honor, make reference to the fact that presently the exclusionary rule is considered a judicially created remedial device, and it is restricted to use where its objections... objectives, rather, are best served. 
    And despite this attitude, I think we also have to look at it in the framework of Mr. Justice Black in his concurring opinion in Plymouth Sedan where he also states that we must be mindful on the principle that constitutional provisions for the security of personal property should be also liberally construed. 
    So although we have a situation where I can understand the Court's feeling that we have a remedial situation with the judicially created exclusionary rule, but on the other hand, we must take into account the fact that we do have a Fourth Amendment situation which is fundamental, and much recognition should be given to it as well. 
    And under those circumstances, a weigh... even with the balancing of the costs and benefits, as I have outlined in my brief, I think the objective of deterring Fourth Amendment violations requires the result of the Rhode Island Supreme Court to be affirmed. 
    And I say this and would point out that the Rhode Island Supreme Court also recognized, a Chief Justice Burger pointed out to me, that under the 21st Amendment there is a strong police power permitting very vigorous regulation of liquor matters. 
    That is working, and it has worked despite the fact of the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule, and it has worked because of the framework of decisional law that has resulted from that 21st Amendment. 
    The Rhode Island Supreme Court noted that because that point was brought up by my adversary now in that case, and they recognized and pointed out, the Rhode Island Supreme Court, that there were other measures and alternatives which adequately served that purpose, and more importantly, the interest in doing that, regulating the liquor control, was not as significant as giving recognition to Fourth Amendment rights. 
    And I believe that the Rhode Island Supreme Court properly applied the rule, properly entered a weighing and balancing situation as to both cost and benefit, and rendered a proper decision which I request be affirmed. 
    Thank you.
