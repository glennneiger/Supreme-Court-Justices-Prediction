    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in United States against Hensley. 
    Ms. Oberly, I think you may proceed when you're ready.

    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Respondent in this case was convicted of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the theory that the guns found in Respondent's car were the fruits of an illegal arrest. 
    The court's ruling was based on two grounds: 
    First, the court held that investigatory stops, commonly known as Terry stops, may only be made when the police reasonably suspect that a crime is ongoing at the moment of the investigatory stop. 
    Because that was not the case here... Respondent was stopped in connection with a robbery that had been committed two weeks earlier... the court concluded that this could not be a valid investigatory stop case. 
    The court then treated the case as an arrest case and concluded that the officers who made what we consider the stop, what the court considered an arrest, lacked probable cause for an arrest because the facts they were relying on were a wanted flyer issued by a neighboring police department saying that Respondent was wanted in connection with an armed robbery that had been committed in the neighboring jurisdiction. 
    In our view, the Court of Appeals' analysis was fundamentally flawed by its initial ruling on the scope of investigatory stops. 
    We actually find it somewhat hard to believe that the court meant what it said, because there is no decision of this Court that limits investigatory stops to ongoing crimes, and in fact the Court has repeatedly said, as have most of the other circuits, that a police officer having reasonable suspicion may stop when he suspects that a crime is being committed, is about to be committed, or has been committed in the past.

    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    But it would depend somewhat on the circumstances. 
    I don't think, for example, that police departments routinely issue wanted flyers for people who are suspected of having committed misdemeanors. 
    So that I don't think it would arise in the case of a misdemeanor. 
    But I don't think that there's any... in terms of law enforcement interests, the interest is clearly greater in apprehending suspected felons. 
    But there is still an interest on the law enforcement side in apprehending anyone suspected of committing a crime, whether it's a misdemeanor or a felony. 
    And so on one side you have the law enforcement interest in apprehending people suspected of committing crimes, and on the other hand, on the other side of the Terry balance as developed in subsequent cases, you have the intrusion on the individual being stopped. 
    And so long as the intrusion is sufficiently limited, as it was in this case... this was the most limited intrusion imaginable, the stop in this case... then I think that the law enforcement interest in apprehending people suspected of crimes would not dissipate simply because it was a misdemeanor. 
    But that is, I would stress, not our case here. 
    This is an armed robbery committed by someone who all police departments believed was armed and dangerous, who had a long criminal record, who was known to the police of both departments, and this was a very serious offense.

    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The testimony in this case was that this type of flyer is as common as a flyer that actually expressly indicates an arrest warrant has been issued; and that the Kentucky officers who made the stop found in their experience that this type of flyer generally was followed by an arrest warrant; and that one of the officers recalled having been told that a warrant would be forthcoming in this case. 
    All that testimony is in the joint appendix from the suppression hearings.

    Not necessarily, Your Honor, because the flyer was issued six days before the Covington, Kentucky, police department came upon Respondent. 
    And at that point I think it still would have been reasonable for the Kentucky police to assume... or to at least wonder whether in that intervening six days the Ohio investigation had further progressed, so that there might either have been a warrant or additional information to supply probable cause for arrest, or some changes--

    He radioed to his despatcher and said: I just spotted Tommy Hensley and he took off; could you check and see if there's a warrant on him? 
    At that point another officer, who was in his cruiser, overheard this radio communication between the first officer and the despatcher, and the second officer injected himself into the radio communication and he said: I think there is a warrant on this fellow from Cincinnati. 
    Then we switched... the radio communication switches to the despatcher trying to get information out of Cincinnati records about whether there is or is not an outstanding arrest warrant on this Respondent. 
    At the same time that that radio communication is going on, the officers are following Respondent to where they think he's going to go. 
    So that at the time they, the officers, converge on where the Respondent is and stop him and pull his car over, the inquiry, which is quite brief and can always be quite brief, about whether there was an outstanding arrest warrant was practically completed.

    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    Yes, Your Honor, that would be critical. 
    In our view where the Court of Appeals went wrong here was in focusing on the information that the Covington officers knew. 
    What's relevant is what the St. Bernard officers knew. 
    The district court here found that the St. Bernard officers had enough information... had enough probable cause to arrest the Respondent. 
    This Court doesn't have to reach that issue. 
    All the Court has to conclude is that the St. Bernard officers had reasonable suspicion to justify a Terry stop of Respondent if they had encountered him first. 
    If they had, then what the Covington officers are doing is basically acting as the agents of the St. Bernard officers.

    Under this Court's ruling in Whiteley versus Warden, that would be the result, unless... and we don't contend it's present in this case, but the exception would be if the Covington officers had somehow prior to the stop developed their own information to justify a stop. 
    But since they were making the stop here solely in reliance on the St. Bernard flyer, the validity of that stop turns back to the validity of the issuance of the flyer.

    Yes. 
    The first officer ordered them out of the car and asked them to put their hands on the roof of the car, for his own, the officer's own, protection and then waited for his backup units to arrive. 
    When the first backup unit arrived, the officer in that car immediately spotted part of the gun in plain view in the car, and at that point the warrant flyer completely drops out of the case and the basis for everything that happened after that point is the Covington officer's own independent observation of the gun in plain view in the car. 
    To sum up, it's our position on the two points in the Court's analysis that: Terry stops simply can't rationally be limited to ongoing crimes; and second, that this Court's holding in Whiteley versus Warden makes it quite clear that officers of one department are entitled to rely on information supplied by officers of a second department, so long as the first department has the requisite reasonable suspicion or probable cause, as the case may be, to justify the action that's taken.

 And as I remember it, the magistrate indicated that one of the officers said there had been no violation, no speeding in violation of law that he observed before stopping him; is that right?

    That's correct. 
    And they never testified or attempted to justify the stop based on their own observation of a violation of law.

    With one car at this point, who seeks the vehicle take off... I can't tell you how fast that was because the record doesn't say.

    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    Not given what they knew about these suspects, not at all. 
    I just again would like to say that your proposed course of action is reasonable, but that does not make what the Covington officers did here unreasonable or unconstitutional in the Fourth Amendment sense. 
    What they did seemed to be the most prudent course of action to take at the time they were confronted with the situation where they had to make a swift decision. 
    That entire set of circumstances forms the basis for this Court's Terry cases and post-Terry cases, that we're not going to second guess officers on the beat who make a reasonable decision and say, well, you could have done it in another manner and therefore what you did was wrong. 
    I don't find anything wrong whatsoever with the way the officers proceeded in this case, even if there are multiple alternative methods that they could have employed. 
    And finally, I would just like to emphasize that this rule of the Court of Appeals that would prohibit one department from relying on a flyer issued by another department basically is a windfall for criminals who are able to get out of the first jurisdiction-- 
    Once they've escaped the first jurisdiction, no other department can stop them. 
    And there's nothing in this Court's jurisprudence and nothing cited by the Court of Appeals that would suggest that criminals who are that fortunate to rapidly escape the jurisdiction in which they committed their crime should never thereafter be able to be apprehended again simply because they've moved into someone else's area.

    And we're in the middle ground, where they needed a very brief period of time to find out whether there was a warrant. 
    Again, that's a classic Adams versus Williams situation, the language in Adams, maintaining the status quo to find out more information, something that would have immediately resolved the matter one way or another with minimal intrusion on the defendant's privacy interest.

    The warrant argument addresses a wholly different set of facts which we don't have in this case. 
    I mean, it could arise frequently in the context of these interdepartmental cooperation cases. 
    But in our particular case all that's needed is that department A have reasonable suspicion, that reasonable suspicion is imputed to department B and department B can likewise make an investigatory stop. 
    And here they took the most reasonable action possible, which was immediately find out whether there was a basis for escalating their action. 
    I'll save the remainder of my time.

   Argument of Edward G. Drennen, II
speaker="edward_g_drennen_ii" startTime="1653.996" stopTime="1777.549">
    Mr. Edward G. Drennen, II 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court: 
    This case, as it gets further along, tends to get more and more blown out of proportion. 
    The case that we originally dealt with at the district court level and the reason that the state court transcript is before you and was before the district judge was to demonstrate, in response to one of your questions, what did the officer mean by "take off". 
    If you read Officer Eger's testimony on page 40 of the joint appendix, his testimony was at that point in time he said hello to Mr. Hensley, told him he was obstructing traffic, and told him to move along. 
    And he then got on the radio and made an inquiry as to a flyer. 
    Now, it should be noted that then other officers began their conversations concerning this, and the despatcher said there is no flyer. 
    So you have to again look back at their testimony, and their testimony was that they didn't recall whether it had been two months that they had heard it, two weeks that they had heard it, or the day before. 
    It becomes even more prevalent when you notice that the despatcher hooked into the watch commander and the watch commander said: There's no warrant, there's no flyer. 
    They checked into Cincinnati: no flyer, no warrant. 
    The situation becomes even more blown out of proportion. 
    They talk as if only Officer Coke stopped the individual. 
    There were four cruisers that stopped in moments. 
    Mr. Hensley's whereabouts was known. 
    They gave two locations over the radio. 
    One was his home, the other one was his sister's home. 
    He didn't even illegally park when he was pulled over. 
    They say limited intrusion--

    Guns drawn, four cruisers, get your hands on the hood, slide all the way to the rear of the car, place your hands on the rear bumper or the rear hood of your vehicle, wait for the other cruisers to show up, then get you up on the sidewalk. 
    This didn't take a few moments.

    I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, if you read the transcript, the transcript was that's how long it took the officers to get there, not necessarily how long it took all of this to transpire. 
    All the cruisers began to converge on Mr. Hensley, who had not committed any type of offense. 
    They were relying solely on a flyer which didn't say we want to question him, Covington police question him.

    Mr. Edward G. Drennen, II 
    --It also said pick him up and hold him. 
    And Mr.... excuse me... Officer Coke's testimony in the original hearing was he was going to be held for investigation. 
    He didn't say he was going to let him go. 
    Page 15 of your joint appendix. 
    It said he was going to be held for investigation. 
    This idea of, well, I was only going to stop him momentarily, came up later, once it had been shifted from the state system to the federal system. 
    The situation you have to look at, what did the officer in Cincinnati, being St. Bernard, which has been intermingled... St. Bernard is a suburb of Cincinnati... what was his request? 
    His request was to have the man arrested. 
    That was his testimony. 
    He wanted the man arrested so he could come over and talk to him. 
    Now, how long is a reasonable period of time? 
    There was no warrant issued for five months. 
    The man was never charged. 
    He was never actually indicted for this alleged robbery that took place in St. Bernard. 
    As we see it, there's no question. 
    This was not an investigatory stop. 
    It was an arrest. 
    The purpose was to arrest him, to detain him, take him back to the station until St. Bernard could come down and talk to him. 
    The reason the warrant was issued in May was because that's when the officers from St. Bernard finally decided to come down and talk to him.

 Well, Mr. Drennen, I think the Court of Appeals took a little bit different view of these facts than you're now stating. 
 At least their opinion recites the officers' testimony that they only wanted to determine if there was a warrant and that Officer Coke testified he intended to release Hensley.

    Mr. Edward G. Drennen, II 
    That was the testimony that Officer Coke elicited before the district judge. 
    But the testimony was also, as appears in the transcript and was submitted to the district judge and was argued to the Court of Appeals, was that was not what happened.

    Mr. Edward G. Drennen, II 
    That is right, and our position is that, though their wording is somewhat inconsistent with the actual findings as I would see them, their finding is correct. 
    The officers had elicited an illegal act by the Covington police department. 
    There were no specific, there were no articulable facts upon which to base their finding. 
    Mr. Hensley had done nothing wrong. 
    If you take the step and see what the flyer initiated, the flyer, as it was testified to, was based on an affidavit of an individual that it's bantered back and forth whether she was or was not actually involved. 
    It was our position at the district court, it was our position in the Court of Appeals, it's our position here, that woman was not involved; she was just relating what someone had told her. 
    The St. Bernard police relied on that information, relied on an affidavit which doesn't even mention my client's name. 
    It never did. 
    It relates to a man named Tommy. 
    Now, I think the difficulty is, if you're going to have flyers issued and when the officer says in his own testimony, I did not personally believe I had probable cause to get a warrant, if there's a judge involved then I think it can be made proper. 
    But when the police determine for themselves what is going to be probable cause solely for the purposes of investigation and solely for the purposes of arrest, then you're getting a situation that is tantamount to causing the police to have unbridled power to pick up anyone they so choose. 
    In this particular case, you've got a situation where, if the officer from St. Bernard had taken the information he had to a magistrate or a district judge and requested a warrant and that warrant was issued, then I don't think we would be here because I wouldn't have really any argument to try and second guess what was submitted and what is or is not probable cause to the judge. 
    But when the district court makes that determination, after the defendant's been arrested, after everything's been complete, he looks back and says, well, I disagree with the officer in St. Bernard, I think there was probable cause, I don't think he can do that. 
    This is closing the gate after the barn door... the horse has gotten out of the barn. 
    What we have is a situation that, if you're going to balance the tests, then the officers' in Covington sole knowledge is that what they receive from St. Bernard. 
    It was a flyer, a flyer which requested an illegal act, because it didn't ask them to question him; it asked them to hold him. 
    It didn't ask them to do--

    Mr. Edward G. Drennen, II 
    --I believe if a warrant had been issued for the man's arrest, the Covington police have no option but to arrest that person based upon that warrant. 
    But that was not what they did here. 
    They didn't go get a warrant. 
    They simply decided for themselves, and that's what the officer testified to: I don't think I had probable cause to get a warrant, so I issued a probable cause flyer. 
    But the probable cause flyer requested the man to be arrested. 
    It also elicited information that the man was armed and dangerous, which could have resulted in the death of the individual. 
    The situation that you have to relate is the proverbial balancing test: the individual's limited intrusion against the balancing of the enforcement of the law. 
    The difficulty is, what the Government is asking you to do is saying that an individual may be stopped, whether it's concerning investigating his activity at that moment, ongoing criminal investigation of a situation where they receive within moments or within an hour or so of a crime having been committed a description of a vehicle and a description of an individual and they stop the person based upon that. 
    This is weeks after an alleged robbery took place, based upon in effect hearsay information, they are asking that the man be stopped and arrested. 
    I do not think that's what Terry warrants. 
    I do not think that they can permit that type of conduct, because what it is in effect doing is permitting the officers to stop and harass any person that they know to be a criminal, simply because they want to stop him. 
    They do whatever they want. 
    You know, what we've got here is a situation that Mr. Hensley, having done nothing wrong, was solely being stopped to be questioned about some activity two to three weeks before. 
    The evidence that was elicited at trial and through the testimony and through the transcripts was that the officers knew: number one, there was no flyer within their department any longer; second, that there was no warrant within their department. 
    Now, does that cause an officer on the street to presume therefore there is no warrant? 
    Well, the Government's position: We need further information.

    Mr. Edward G. Drennen, II 
    --No, no. 
    What I see, Justice Marshall, is that the officers attempted to verify when they called in to the despatcher, and when they called the despatcher there was no verification there available to them as to a flyer or a warrant. 
    Now, after they stopped Mr. Hensley, of course, they then went on to try and verify the existence of a flyer and the existence of a warrant. 
    They did it at both times. 
    It depends on whether you mean did they communicate with St. Bernard prior to the stop. 
    No, they did not. 
    They did not communicate until after, did they ever communicate with St. Bernard to find out, did you ever issue a warrant. 
    They were communicating back and forth to their department and their department said there is no flyer, there is no warrant.

    Mr. Drennen, can I ask you a question if I'm not interrupting your answer? 
    Supposing we change the facts just a little bit here and say that the Covington department knew there was no probable cause, knew there was no warrant, knew that the other department merely wanted to question the man on reasonable suspicion. 
    And they stopped... they saw the defendant and they stopped him in motion on the streets and just pulled him over to the side, got out of the car, went up to the window and said to him: I would like you to know you're under suspicion over in Cincinnati or the other town and they would like you to stop in and talk to them; you may want to exonerate yourself, or something like that. 
    And during such a conversation they saw through the window the guns. 
    Would that be unconstitutional?

    Mr. Edward G. Drennen, II 
    --No. 
    Your situation is one of, number one, that an officer in his normal course of business runs across many things. 
    If the officer is just simply following up information... he sees the individual, he is simply saying, look, someone wants to talk to you... I don't see that as necessarily an abusive act on his part. 
    But when the officer's intent was to arrest, when they were relying solely upon a flyer which requested an illegal act... and let's take the situation as presented. 
    If in that same set of circumstances the officer observes the weapon, we then have to look, what put that officer in that place, whether it was a warrant issued by a judge or a flyer issued by another department. 
    Now, if it's a flyer issued by another department, then again he is acting upon what another department has requested him to do. 
    If you then go back after the stop, they find the gun, he did nothing more than ask the man or tell the man something, it's then found out that the basis for him being there was improper, then his basis for being there is no longer good.

    Mr. Edward G. Drennen, II 
    --Yes, I do, because I don't think the officer can pick and choose what he wants to be insulated against. 
    The officer in Covington is acting solely upon the information he receives, nothing else. 
    He can't say, I'm only going to accept this portion which I think is valid and this portion which is invalid, because what you're then asking the police officers on the street to do is tantamount to make them lawyers, make them all go to law school, make them all become judges. 
    I don't think that's proper. 
    And when an officer in another department places himself as a judge and requests an illegal act to be performed, the officer who performs it, even though he is doing it solely in totally good conscience, he is not insulated from that act. 
    And therefore what put him in the place, put him on the street, put him at the car of Mr. Hensley is no good and whatever he finds incidental to it is no good. 
    Thank you very much.

   Rebuttal of Kathryn A. Oberly

    Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly 
    Briefly, Your Honor, the case seems in the last hour to have gotten somewhat confused by a lot of different factual situations, and I would just like to reiterate our two main points, which I don't think depend on all the hypotheticals. 
    One is Terry stops are not and cannot be limited to ongoing crimes. 
    It simply makes no sense to say that criminals are home free once they get away with their crime and they're not immediately detected, and we would strongly urge that that aspect of the Court of Appeals' ruling be reversed. 
    The second point is that it has long been recognized this Court and the Courts of Appeals that police departments must and are able to cooperate with each other; that it is not necessary that they cross-examine each other about the basis of the first department's knowledge. 
    And in this case there was no reason that the Covington officers had to know precisely what the St. Bernard officers had to know. 
    Yet that is exactly what the Court of Appeals required in this case. 
    They said the stop... the arrest was defective because the Covington officers did not have the personal knowledge that the St. Bernard officers had. 
    In our view that personal knowledge is not required. 
    Thank you.
