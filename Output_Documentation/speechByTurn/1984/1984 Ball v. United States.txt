    Ms. Widener, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="jo_s_widener" startTime="56.918" stopTime="267.608">
    Ms. Jo S. Widener 
    May it please the Court, I am here this morning on behalf of Truman Lewis Ball to ask the Court to vacate one of his convictions and one of his sentences under the cases of United States against Batchelder and Blockburger against the United States. 
    This is a direct appeal from two convictions suffered by Mr. Ball, one for 922, receipt by a convicted felon of a firearm, and 1202, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. 
    The government proved three incidences of possession in this case, all of which occurred at or about the same time. 
    The first was when Truman Ball reached into a bag of beer and came out with that gun. 
    The second was when he had the gun in Clarence Music's yard and waved it at him. 
    The third was when they arrested him, when the police officers arrested him at Gary Music's house and saw the gun in his back pocket. 
    There are a few other critical facts to this case as well. 
    Mr. Ball is now in prison, where he has been for the last 15 months. 
    He is serving a three-year sentence on the 922 receipt. 
    At the same time, he is on probation for the 1202 conviction. 
    He has two years' probation, and he is fully subject to the conditions of that probation at the time that he is in prison now serving those three years. 
    This is under the case of Burns against the United States, which is a case we have not cited in our brief. 
    The citation to it is 287 US 216. 
    Any time between now and the next nine months, if Mr. Ball should get into any sort of confrontation there in the prison or any trouble at all, if he should infringe upon any prison regulation at all, he is subject to having his probation revoked. 
    At whatever time he has that probation revoked, he is then subject to having an extra two years imposed upon him, two years that he will have to serve. 
    That, of course, will be concurrent with the sentence that he is now serving, but it will still mean to him that after he has served his three years on the 922 offense, he will yet have one more year or at least up to one more year, somewhere between three months and one year, of a sentence to serve because of the 1202 concurrent sentence that is now imposed upon him. 
    In other words, he is worse off today because he has a probation to serve than he would be if he simply had two years to serve on that sentence and it was running concurrently, because if he had two years to serve, it would be over in two years. 
    However, now we have no certainty that it will be over in two years, and we have no certainty for the next nine months. 
    We say that this is not an adverse collateral consequence of this concurrent sentence. 
    We say that this is a direct, immediate consequent to Mr. Ball that he is suffering under today, and therefore this case ought to be reviewed.

speaker="jo_s_widener" startTime="311.997" stopTime="446.168">
    Ms. Jo S. Widener 
    Yes, Your Honor, they were exactly the same as we are making hare. 
    The only difference is, we left out the two words "and convictions", and the reason we did that was because under the Burton case we suffered some great danger that we would not be heard at all, as Burton had not been heard on his direct appeal. 
    Nevertheless our arguments here are exactly the same. 
    We are still arguing Blockburger and we are still arguing Batchelder, which we argued in the Court of Appeals. 
    The Batchelder case we did not argue specifically in the Court of Appeals, but this was because we were faced with the Burton construction of the Batchelder case. 
    Burton had already decided what Batchelder meant for the Fourth Circuit, so we were locked into that. 
    The facts here are indistinguishable from the case of Batchelder. 
    There a convincted felon bought a gun from an ATF agent while Mr. Batchelder was tending bar in Bellview, Illinois. 
    When he... and the Court said in Batchelder that when Mr. Batchelder reached across that bar and took that gun from the ATF agent, at that moment he was guilty of both. 
    He was guilty of 922, receipt, and he was guilty of 1202 just by that single act. 
    Here we have the exact same facts. 
    When Mr. Ball reached into that bag of beer, he was guilty of both receipt and possession by that act, and Batchelder said that Congress had intended in passing these two statutes to have two independent statutes each fully enforceable on their own terms, and Batchelder also confirmed that this very conduct violated both statutes. 
    When a single act violates two statutes, as we have in this case, we look to... the courts always look to the case of Blockburger against the United States to determine whether there is one offense or whether there are two offenses. 
    The first question to ask under the Blockburger analysis is, did Congress intend to cumulatively punish for this offense?

speaker="jo_s_widener" startTime="467.079" stopTime="626.894">
    Ms. Jo S. Widener 
    Yes, Your Honor, I think that is true. 
    Blockburger is a statutory construction, but there are some... there is sort of a procedure to go through under Blockburger. 
    The first is to look at the statute, as I understand it, the statute and the legislative history, to see what can be gleaned there, and if there is no clear intent indicated either in the legislative history or in the statute itself, then one resorts to the test of Blockburger to determine what Congress's intent was in passing those two statutes. 
    So, yes, you are correct, as I understand it, that it is a statutory construction problem. 
    The Circuits... the Courts of Appeals that have considered this question, all except the Tenth Circuit say that there is... there was no cumulative punishment intended by Congress when they passed these two statutes. 
    When I say all of those Circuits that have considered it, that means the Third, the Fifth, the Seventh, the Ninth, the D.C. Circuit, and the Fourth Circuit. 
    These Circuits base their analysis, all except the Third, which is underneath a case which the government conceded, but the other Circuits all base their analysis on the Batchelder case, where the Court in Batchelder had said that the government could prosecute on either. 
    The Circuits then interpreted this to mean that the government could not prosecute all the way to judgment, to conviction, to sentence on both of those statutes at the same time. 
    These same Circuits say when the government has not chosen either one or the other but has chosen instead to proceed on both statutes, that the remedy there is to vacate one conviction and one sentence. 
    This is all except the Fourth Circuit, of course. 
    The Fourth Circuit says that the remedy is to make the sentences run concurrently. 
    But even if the Circuits' reasoning is wrong under Batchelder, still looking to the statutes themselves and to the Congressional history, there is no explicit clear statement in any of that indicating that Congress intended to cumulatively punish under these statutes, and the most recent case of Missouri against Hunter teaches us what kind of language should be there if, or we should look for to determine that intent, language such as "in addition to". 
    There is no such language in either of these statutes.

    Your Honor, I could find no specific holding as to that effect. 
    Nevertheless, when I looked back through the cases, it seemed to me that in all cases except for the line of cases under Prince, that the remedy when there is a double jeopardy question has been to reverse the judgment or to vacate the conviction. 
    Always the entire judgment was considered, and not just the vacating of the sentence, as the Fourth Circuit has done here.

    I think that under the cases of Sylburn against Ohio and Street and that line of cases in which the Court looked to whether or not there were adverse legal consequences of convictions, I believe the Court has said that these consequences do exist, and in this case, this man is a man who is not well educated. 
    He is not someone who can defend himself from these convictions and from the effect that they are going to have on his life. 
    They will affect him in his employment situation. 
    They will affect him every time he is put on the witness stand. 
    He in a further prosecution... it is unrealistic to suggest that he, pitted against a well educated and well trained prosecutor, could possibly convince a jury that these two... that he should not have two convictions here, that he should only have one conviction. 
    Nor could he convince a sentencing judge in the future that he should not have two convictions here, he should simply have one, because the very fact of those two convictions existing on that paper seem to indicate to a judge that he is guilty of both.

    Well, Your Honor, I would, I guess, fall back on the argument that since Congress has not told us specifically what to do in this situation, it has not told us when this conduct violates those two statutes, whether we should convict or sentence under both. 
    We do know, however, that it has not authorized two convictions for either of these statutes. 
    The only punishment that it has authorized here is a conviction and punishment under either of those statutes. 
    I do not believe that without a clear statement that more than one statute is violated or what to do in the case when more than one statute is violated, that you could impose an extra punishment on him which in this case his conviction would be an extra punishment.

    At Page 5 of their brief they make a statement which is directly contrary to the one you have just told us, and I would like to see which is correct. 
    The government says here, the additional conviction will not increase the defendant's prison term, and will not impose any other adverse consequence upon him.

    Ms. Jo S. Widener 
    --Well, certainly under these facts it is true in this particular case. 
    Of course, if a man had a death sentence and a concurrent sentence, that would not be true. 
    Then it may not be a rule that should be implied. 
    The D.C. Circuit has an interesting way of applying the concurrent sentence rule. 
    They determine that if, in order to promote judicial economy and not to have to consider a sentence, they look at the two interests involved. 
    Since there is no interest that the government actually has to protect, and the government here has conceded that in their brief, that they really have no fundamental objection to this rule that we are talking about right now. 
    Since the government has no interest to protect, and since the possible adverse legal consequences to the defendant are very real to him, the D.C. Circuit, without review, vacates these sentences and convictions on the theory that they could be reimposed at some later time if it was shown, for example, that the first sentence was reversed on appeal. 
    Of course, if the first sentence was reversed on appeal, and they look at the second sentence here, there would be nothing to prevent the prosecutor from reprosecuting under that first sentence at that point.

    --Of course, in most situations that is not going to arise, however, because the court under the concurrent sentence doctrine determines one sentence is valid before they determine not to look at the other sentence, so the chance of having the first sentence that has already been determined to be valid reversed is very minimal. 
    And that is why I would take issue with the D.C.'s policy there, because if there was ever any time to have to reimpose that second sentence that they vacated, of course, that could be done by retrial, but it is a very slim possibility.

    Mr. Andrew J. Pincus 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to first briefly discuss our waiver argument with reference to the colloquy that Justice Rehnquist had with my opponent.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Would you raise your voice a little, Mr. Pincus?
speaker="andrew_j_pincus" startTime="1393.678" stopTime="1436.067">
    Mr. Andrew J. Pincus 
    I am sorry. 
    I would like to first briefly discuss the waiver argument with reference to the colloquy that Justice Rehnquist had with my opponent. 
    In the Court of Appeals there was no request that one of the convictions be vacated. 
    The only reference to the convictions was that there was an appeal from the convictions, but this relief was not requested, and there was no discussion of the possibility of adverse consequences as a result of the additional conviction and the other issues that are before this Court. 
    Therefore, we believe that the waiver argument is valid, and that it provides grounds for the Court to dispose of the case without reaching the merits.

    Mr. Andrew J. Pincus 
    --But we think that the District Court couldn't order that longer sentence under the Court of Appeals mandate, that the clear import of the Court of Appeals decision was that the petitioner not serve more than three years in prison, and that any result vis-a-vis the suspended sentence that had that effect would be improper. 
    And we would in fact support a Rule 35 motion to alter the second sentence to make it a committed sentence to avoid that slim possibility.

    Your Honor, as we say in our brief, the government's interest is not very great with respect to the convictions in this case. 
    The government's concern is that a decision by this Court, for example, that a conviction that carries no adverse consequences constitutes punishment could adversely... could conflict with the justification for the concurrent sentence doctrine.

    Mr. Andrew J. Pincus 
    Well, Your Honor, our problem is, we wouldn't object if the district judge in this case had, after the jury returned its verdict, vacated one of the convictions subject to the condition that if the unvacated conviction was ever overturned, the first conviction would be reinstated. 
    Our problem is that a decision by this Court holding that the vacation of the conviction was required would conflict under the double jeopardy clause, for example, would conflict with the rationale of the concurrent sentence doctrine, because it would rest on the notion that the mere fact of a conviction without any adverse consequences was sufficient prejudice or sufficient punishment to require elimination.

    --Batchelder teaches that there are two separate statutes that can be independently applied, and we think that if that was Congress's intent, that would indicate the two convictions would be appropriate.

    Your Honor, that portion of Batchelder speaks to the argument that was raised is that case that the government could not choose to elect between the two statutes because of the different penalty provisions, and this Court rejected that argument and said the government was free to choose. 
    We don't think that Batchelder says that the government was required to choose.

 But I don't understand how you square that with your saying what really is at issue here is preserving the concurrent sentence doctrine, which I gather hasn't been applied since 1965 by this Court anyway. 
 That is what we are fighting about. 
 If we vacate one sentence, you are not preserving your concurrent sentence doctrine, and you, I think, said that is perfectly satisfactory to the government. 
 Yes, but you would agree to that, I take it, on the assumption that you are carrying out the intent of Congress.

    Mr. Andrew J. Pincus 
    Because in order for that clause to provide a remedy, there has to be some... even if there is a deviation from what Congress intended, there still would have to be some kind of a multiple punishment in order for a petitioner, for the petitioner in this case to rely on a clause as supplying some kind of an affirmative remedy. 
    I just want to reiterate our argument based on the concurrent sentence doctrine, because we believe that really the principle underlying that doctrine supports our position in this case, because the doctrine really as it is now applied by the Courts of Appeals is based on the notion that a conviction with no adverse consequences will not prejudice a defendant, and therefore the conviction can be affirmed even though it is unreviewed. 
    If petitioner is punished in some way by the second conviction, then it conflicts with this notion that there is no prejudice, and therefore could undermine the concurrent sentence doctrine, which we believe is a useful tool used by the Courts of Appeals to avoid reaching issues that don't really have to be decided. 
    Unless the Court has any further questions, we urge that the judgment be affirmed.

   Rebuttal of Jo S. Widener
speaker="jo_s_widener" startTime="2606.951" stopTime="2664.320">
    Ms. Jo S. Widener 
    Just a few things, Your Honor. 
    We believe that the concurrent sentence doctrine has no application here at all. 
    Blockburger says that for a single offense there should be a single sentence. 
    A concurrent sentence is an improper remedy to impose. 
    Therefore, this case really has no effect on the concurrent sentence doctrine at all, because this is an improper remedy under Blockburger. 
    The government has conceded that there is a single offense here. 
    They conceded in the case of United States against Taylor that there should only be single sentence imposed here. 
    In United States against Martin in the Seventh Circuit, they conceded that their should only be a single conviction. 
    We would ask the Court thus to vacate petitioner's sentence and conviction.
