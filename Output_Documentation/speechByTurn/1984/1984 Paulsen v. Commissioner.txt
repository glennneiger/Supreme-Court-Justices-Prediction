    Mr. William R. Nicholas 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue for decision here today is whether the owner of a share account in a federal mutual savings and loan associations chartered by the federal government has a proprietary interest in that association. 
    And the issue arises because of the merger of Commerce Savings and Loan Association, which was a guaranteed stock-type savings and loan association organized under the laws of the State of Washington. 
    It merged with and into Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was a federal stock... nonstock-type mutual savings and loan association which was owned exclusively by the share account owners in the association. 
    In the transaction, which qualified as a merger under state law, the assets and liabilities of Commerce were transferred to and merged with the assets and liabilities of Citizens Federal. 
    Citizens Federal was the surviving corporation in the merger, and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, Commerce went out of existence. 
    However, Citizens continued on carrying on the business... that of loaning money... that it had done prior to the merger, and also carried on the business that had been carried on by Commerce prior to the merger. 
    The shareholders of Commerce, including the Paulsens, who are the petitioners in this case, exchanged their stock in Commerce for share accounts in the mutual savings and loan association. 
    The mutual association has only one form of equity, and that is the share memberships in its association, and that is what was transferred to the Paulsens in this case. 
    And they were represented by passbook and certificate accounts in Citizens Federal. 
    Thus, after the merger, the business of the two associations were carried on by one organization, and the owners of the two associations prior to the merger were the same owners of the merged association at the completion of the transaction. 
    The two associations and the petitioners in this case treated the merger as a tax-free reorganization under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    Therefore, no gain was recognized by Commerce on the transfer of its assets to Citizens Federal and no gain was recognized by the Paulsens on the transfer of their guaranteed stock in Commerce in exchange for the share accounts in Citizens Federal. 
    The reorganization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code defer the recognition of gain on the transaction that qualifies as a reorganization. 
    Thus, until such time as Citizens Federal sold the assets which it acquired in the merger, it would not have any gain on the transaction, and until such time as the Paulsens liquidated their investment in Citizens Federal, they would not recognize any gain on the transaction.

    Mr. William R. Nicholas 
    Yes. 
    I don't think so, Your Honor, because the withdrawal of the savings account or what are termed savings account causes a loss of the rights that are conferred upon the Paulsens by the mutual savings and loan association; so that at the time they withdraw, then they lose the right to share in any further profits of the savings and loan association, and they lose the right to vote and the right to share in any proceeds upon the termination or liquidation of the mutual association. 
    The respondent asserted a deficiency against the petitioners, claiming that there was no reorganization, and therefore that gain had to be recognized by the Paulsens on the difference between their basis in the shares of the guarantee stock association which they exchanged for the passbook accounts in Citizens Federal. 
    The case was taken to the tax court, and the tax court agreed with the petitioners and held that the merger of Commerce into Citizens was a reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, and any gain that the Paulsens might have recognized would be deferred.

    Mr. William R. Nicholas 
    --It was the decision of a single judge, Your Honor. 
    Judge Featherstone made the decision. 
    The transaction the tax court analyzed met the statutory requirements set forth in the Code, and under the applicable provisions, a merger is included within the definition of a reorganization under Section 368. 
    And turning to Section 7701 of the Code, which provides the general definitions for applications throughout the Code, the following terms are included. 
    Corporation includes association. 
    Stock includes shares in an association. 
    And shareholder includes members in association. 
    Thus, Commerce transferred property to Citizens Federal, a mutual associations which under the terms of the Internal Revenue Code is a corporation; and therefore, no gain was recognized under Section 361 of the Code. 
    Likewise, the petitioners exchanged stock in Commerce for passbook accounts in Citizens Federal, but under the definitions in the Code, those passbook accounts are shares and included in stock, and therefore would meet the requirements of the Code.

speaker="william_r_nicholas" startTime="421.024" stopTime="992.262">
    Mr. William R. Nicholas 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In connection with the reorganization, the petitioners, the Paulsens, in this case transferred their stock in Commerce for share accounts in the Citizens. 
    Under Section 7701, those share accounts are treated as stock, and therefore, there was an exchange of stock for stock, and no gain is recognized under Section 354 of the Code. 
    However, in addition to the statutory language, it was necessary to meet certain judicially imposed requirements in order for there to be a reorganization, and those judicially imposed requirements make sure that the spirit of the law is carried out as well as the letter. 
    One of those tests is the continuity of proprietary interest test which distinguishes between pure sales of assets and those where the seller has a continuing proprietary interest in the transferee. 
    Thus, the owners of the acquired entity, Commerce, must have a continuing proprietary interest in the reorganized enterprise which is Citizens Federal. 
    It is this test that the petition... that the respondent in this case claims that the petitioners did not meet. 
    This Court, in a series of landmark decisions nearly 50 years ago, defined what satisfies the continuity of proprietary interest test, and these cases are still used by the financial community today in determining when a reorganization exists. 
    In Letulle v. Scofield there was a transfer of assets for cash and notes, and the Court held that did not satisfy the continuity of interest test, because the only relationship the person transferring the assets to the continuing corporation had was that of a debtor. 
    Likewise, in Pinellas Ice &amp; Cold Storage Company, there was a transfer of assets for cash and serial bonds which were secured by the assets which were transferred. 
    This Court there held that there was not a sufficient equity interest in the transferee corporation because there still was only a debtor-creditor relationship. 
    However, in Minnesota Tea v. Helvering, the receipt of voting trust certificates by this Court was held to satisfy the proprietary interest, and thus, a reorganization was allowed. 
    In the Minnesota Tea case, the respondent argued that the petitioner in that case had given up common stock and only received back voting certificates, and therefore, there wasn't a good reorganization. 
    But the Court pointed out that the statute does not require a transferor to receive back the same equity interest that it gave up, as long as it has an equity interest in the continuing operation. 
    And likewise, on the same day this Court in John A. Nelson Company v. Helvering held that where a petitioner had transferred common... petitioner who had common stock and ended up with preferred stock which was nonvoting, redeemable, that there was a sufficient continuity of proprietary interest in the corporation which went on that there was a reorganization. 
    Thus, it is clear from these tests that an equity interest satisfies the continuity of interest test, and it must not be necessarily the same interest, equity interest which was give up as that received. 
    Debt, however, will not satisfy the test. 
    Therefore, the question comes down to the point of whether the interest received by the Paulsens in this case was an equity interest in the continuing corporation which was a Citizens... which was Citizens Federal, which was a federal mutual savings and loan association. 
    If the continuity of interest test is not met, the reorganization fails, and it is not tax-free either at the corporate level or at the shareholder level. 
    The tax court examined the nature of the interest received in this case by the petitioners and held that the petitioners had received an equity interest, not debt, that satisfied the continuity of interest test. 
    The tax court, in holding there was a reorganization, recognized the congressional intent to broadly apply the reorganization sections to encourage combinations of corporations. 
    Looking at the Senate Finance Committee report accompanying the 1954 Act, it shows that the Senate had rejected a narrow definition of the term 7701 of the Code which provides the general definition. 
    It also looked back to the original Income Act of 1921 and there found that Congress sought to encourage combinations in reorganizations by allowing shareholders to receive interest in the ongoing corporation which had a readily realizable market value. 
    But so long as the transferring shareholder kept his money invested in that ongoing corporation and did not withdraw it, there was a valid reorganization. 
    The position of the respondent in this case is contrary both to the reorganization provisions and certainly to the protection and encouragement of savings and loan associations which Congress has sought to encourage over the years. 
    By changing his position in 1969, the respondent has discriminated against mutual savings and loan association by not allowing them to be a party to a reorganization where a stock savings and loan association is merged into a mutual savings and loan association. 
    If reorganizations like this are not allowed, it has a harmful effect on the savings and loan industry, and, for instance, in this case if the reorganization is taxable at the corporate level and at the shareholder level, it takes away those funds which have been invested by the shareholders in a mutual savings and loan association and withdraws them from the market which makes available to homeowners mortgage loans. 
    The Ninth Circuit below reversed the tax court and found that the interest received by the Paulsens in this case constituted debt rather than a proprietary interest. 
    In doing so, that Ninth Circuit departed from an unbroken line of cases that had previously examined the issue. 
    The court of claims in Capital Savings and Loan Association held that such an interest was an equity proprietary interest. 
    The Sixth Circuit in the West Side Federal also held that such an interest was a proprietary interest. 
    And in Everett v. the United States, the Tenth Circuit found not only was it proprietary interest, but it constituted voting stock under the more narrow definition as that term is used in the so-called C reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. 
    The tax court, of course, in Paulsen had reached the same result, and also in the subsequent case of Owens had found that there was a valid reorganization. 
    Also, two district courts have held that there had been a reorganization on the same facts... district courts in Wyoming and in the Northern District of Ohio. 
    Also, the Ninth Circuit in the decision below ignored the cases decided by this Court which had examined the legal characteristics and the rights and obligations of a shareholder in a mutual saving and loan association. 
    And lastly, the Ninth Circuit misapplied the continuity of proprietary interest test set forth by this test in Minnesota Tea and John A. Nelson when it sought to compare the equity interest which the Paulsens received with the equity interest which they exchanged for their interest in Citizens Federal. 
    This Court is certainly no stranger to the legal character of share accounts in a mutual savings and loan association. 
    In 1967 in Tcherepnin v. Knight, the issue was whether the owner of withdrawable share accounts in a savings and loan association could bring an action under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, a so-called 10(b)(5) action. 
    There, the court of appeals, like the Ninth Circuit and this Court, had found that the relationships of the owner of the share accounts was more like a debtor-creditor relationship than that of a stockholder. 
    This Court, however, reversed that holding and said that forms should be disregarded in substance... for substance, and emphasis should be placed on economic reality. 
    It noted that in a mutual savings and loan association, the petitioners, the investors in the association were engaged in a common enterprise: that of lending money. 
    And they relied on the skill and efforts of the management for return on their investment: for it there are no earnings and profits in the savings and loan association, there can be no dividends paid. 
    The Court found in reaching that... in making its determination that the following factors were present, and these factors are present in this case. 
    The share accounts carry with them a right to vote. 
    The shares represented all of the equity of the association. 
    The right to withdraw as a shareholder was subject to certain conditions, and the application to withdraw did not automatically make the withdrawing shareholder a creditor of the association.

    Mr. William R. Nicholas 
    Well, I don't think there is basis in cash, Your Honor, and... and I think that what a passbook account holder has is an interest in that savings and loan association. 
    It is not the equivalent of cash, and you can't take it out and buy a television set with it. 
    He has invested his money in that mutual association, and if he wants to get out, he has to go down and withdraw from that association and give up rights connected with... it is not a debtor-creditor relationship such as with a bank.

    Mr. William R. Nicholas 
    Well, I think that perhaps in certain circumstances that does exist, and there is a much litigated case, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board v. Elliot which involved a Long Peach savings and loan association, and when it was going to liquidate and there was a substantial surplus, there was a sudden influx of large depositors. 
    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board felt that the board of directors of the company was not stepping in fast enough. 
    It came in and prohibited those large depositors from sharing in the proceeds upon the liquidation, although it actually subsequently changed to a... a merger with a guaranteed stock type association. 
    But they were not allowed... the Federal Home Loan Bank Board cut off as a certain date the right to share in that... in the residual assets of the association when it was subsequently merged into a stock-type association to prevent, in effect, insider training, which is what happened in the Elliot case. 
    Thus, in... in Tcherepnin, even without the guidance of a definition in the Securities and Exchange Act such as there is in the Internal Revenue Code that the shares do represent stock, this Court held that the share account holder could bring an action under 10(b)(5) and that such shares were stock. 
    The respondent seeks to characterize, and the Ninth Circuit unfortunately agreed, that the petitioners' relationship to Citizens is that of a depositor in a bank. 
    However, as recently as 1982 this Court rejected by that analogy in Marine Bank v. Weaver, and in that case a depositor in a bank sought protection under Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and cited as precedent Tcherepnin. 
    In that case this Court pointed out that Tcherepnin was a different situation. 
    There, there was a mutual savings and loan association, and the share accounts carried with it the right to dividends based on profit, voting rights, and it was a stock situation, not a debtor-creditor relationship such as with a bank. 
    Other courts have also looked at the relationship of a stock or a share account holder in a savings and loan association. 
    In Wisconsin Bankers, decided by the D.C. circuit in 1961, an action was brought by an association of bankers who claimed that savings and loan associations were competing unfairly with banks because they allowed the share account holders to deposit money on what were called savings accounts. 
    However, the court said that they were more concerned with the legal realities and not the appearances, and even though these were called savings accounts, they were really share accounts since the represented the capital of the association, and therefore, they were not violating or competing illegally with the banks. 
    The Ninth Circuit in its opinion below did not discuss one of these cases. 
    However... and dismissed in its decision the right to vote as having no value. 
    It, directly contrary to the decisions and the discussion relating to the cases in Tcherepnin, it said that the dividend payments were precisely like interest and not distinguishable, and that the right to share proportionally in the residual value of the association had no value. 
    We believe that these points are all... the Ninth Circuit was mistaken on each one of those points. 
    The Ninth Circuit also misapplied the continuity of interest test in the decision below.

    Mr. William R. Nicholas 
    Well, it has a value, Your Honor. 
    I think in Midwest Savings, a case that was cited which involved the merger of two mutual savings and loan associations, in order to equalize the value a 4 percent bonus dividend was declared by one of the associations just prior to the merger. 
    In the Federal Home Loan Bank Board case versus Elliot there was a residual value which was recognized where the insiders tried to come in and claim a portion of that value. 
    Russell, in his volume on savings and loan associations, talks about there being numerous liquidations of savings and loan associations at or above par during the thirty-year period. 
    In Revenue Ruling 69649 cited in the brief, the respondent in that case... it was the merger of a federal mutual savings and loan association into a stock-type savings and loan association... and in that ruling the share account holders in the mutual received face value accounts in the stock-type association and then received guarantee stock for the residual value for the undistributed profits and the reserves. 
    So there is a value there. 
    The share account holders own that value and share proportionally in it if there is a merger or liquidation. 
    The Ninth Circuit, we believe, also misapplied the continuity of interest test in its decision below when it looked to the change in the proprietary interest received by the Paulsens in the reorganization to determine whether the test was met. 
    In its opinion the court stated that there was little doubt that the passbook accounts are equity, since they represent the entire capital structure of the association. 
    However, after making that observation, the court went on to say, 
    "The critical question, however, is whether the position of the shareholder in the reorganized entity has really changed. " 
    "Has his risk increased or decreased? " 
    "Is his investment more or less liquid? " 
    "This, we suggest, is not the test. " 
    "The only inquiry is whether a proprietary interest was received, not what kind of a proprietary interest was received. " 
    As noted by this Court in Minnesota Tea and John A. Nelson, the relationship to the assets can change, but so long as there is a proprietary relationship with the ongoing corporation, there is a proprietary interest which meets the test. 
    The respondent, we believe, is also making the same incorrect comparison if you examine his published revenue rulings. 
    In Revenue Ruling 69-3, which involved the merger of two mutual savings and loan associations, the respondent ruled that it was a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A). 
    This is the same interest that the petitioners received in this case. 
    If that ruling is right, how can this be stock for one purpose and not for another? 
    In other words, the position of the respondent right now is that if there is a mutual... a merger of a mutual association into a mutual association, it is tax free; but if there is a merger of a stock association, such as in this case, into a mutual and the shareholders of the stock association exchange their stock for the only equity the mutual association can give the share accounts, it is not tax free. 
    We think this is inconsistent and wrong. 
    Thus, the only question to be decided is whether the petitioners continued as owners of the reorganized enterprise. 
    Since passbook accounts by the Court's own concession are equity, we think this question has to be answered in the affirmative. 
    I'd like to reserve any remaining time, Your Honor.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    What happened here is that petitioners sold their stock for the equivalent cash. 
    We think they should be required to pay tax on their gain just as anybody else would have to do. 
    It might be helpful to begin with an analogy. 
    Imagine a wise investor who buys stock in a corporation like IBM when it's still a new company. 
    The company prospers, and the investor finds over time that his stock has quadrupled in value. 
    At that time our wise investor might well decide that he had a great deal of wealth tied up in that relatively risky equity investment, that what has gone up might well come down, and that it would be prudent to take his profits and convert that relatively risky equity investment into a safer and more liquid form. 
    Now, if our investor chose to do that by selling his stock on the open market for cash, he'd have to pay tax on his gain. 
    And the result would be the same if instead of selling his stock for cash, he sold it for short-term notes or bonds issued by any individual or by a corporation. 
    That's basically what happened here. 
    Petitioners bought stock in Commerce when it was a very new savings and loan company. 
    The company prospered. 
    By 1976, petitioners found that their stock, which they had paid $50,000 for, was now worth about $200,000. 
    They may have thought this was a good time to sell their stock. 
    Interest rates had been declining for about two years at this period... at this period. 
    Savings and loans were doing very well. 
    Now, if petitioners chose to sell their stock for cash or for promissory notes to an individual or a corporation, they would have had to pay tax on their gain; and it would make no difference if they chose as a mechanism for selling their stock a statutory merger. 
    For example, if Commerce had merged into an ordinary corporation and petitioners gave up their stock and got back corporate bonds or promissory notes, they'd have to pay a tax on their gain. 
    If Commerce had merged into a commercial bank and petitioners gave up their stock and got back bank deposits, or savings accounts or CDs, they'd have to pay tax on their gain. 
    And if Commerce had merged into a stock savings and loan association, and petitioners gave up their stock and got back not stock, which would have been a relatively risky investment, but savings accounts, they would have had to pay tax on their gain. 
    The only question here, therefore, is whether the result should be different merely because the vehicle petitioners chose to cash out their investment was a merger not with a bank or with a stock savings and loan, but with a mutual savings and loan whose savings accounts happened to carry with them certain proprietary features like the right to vote. 
    We submit such a difference in outcome is unjustifiable because those proprietary interests simply have no value. 
    We think the entire case boils down to one simple proposition. 
    It's clear that if petitioners had sold their stock for bank deposits, it would have had to pay tax. 
    There's no reason why the result should be different, that they should be able to avoid paying tax because they sold their stock for bank deposits plus something else where that something else has no economic value.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    --I don't think that's true, Justice O'Connor, because this interest here on its face is not stock; it's a savings account. 
    And I think it's not we but petitioners who are trying to recharacterize this as something other than it is. 
    And the normal case of preferred stock would never be recharacterized... typically would not be recharacterized as that unless it were a very, very shaky corporation. 
    And I don't think this position we're taking here is inconsistent, because the point of the continuity of proprietary interest test is to find out if the shareholder has cashed out or continued his equity investment. 
    Here, these people clearly cashed out their investment.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    --Right. 
    But if they wanted to merge with that company, they could have converted Citizens from a mutual into a stock organization. 
    The IRS has ruled that that conversion would be tax free. 
    Following the conversion, Commerce could have merged into Citizens on a stock-for-stock exchange, and that would have been tax free. 
    Now, the only down side to that would be that petitioners would have had to take back stock rather than savings account, and could therefore not have cashed out their equity investment. 
    But that down side is a down side the Revenue Code imposes when people sell their stock for cash. 
    So the Commissioner here is not obstructing mergers. 
    And relevant to the petitioners' concerns about the health of the S&amp;L industry, I should make the point what the effect of this cashing out process is on the balance sheet of the corporation and therefore on its financial health. 
    When petitioners owned stock in Commerce, their stock investment was reflected on the balance sheet as a large retained earning shareholder's equity account. 
    That account functioned as a reserve or cushion that protected the organization and the deposits against the risk of loss. 
    As a result of the merger, petitioners gave up their equity interest and got back garden variety savings accounts. 
    Now, the effect of that was to convert what used to be a cushion, a shareholder's equity, into a short-term debt obligation of the organization; and therefore, the effect of this by cashing these people out was, relatively speaking, to diminish rather than enhance the well-being of the society. 
    And the point is--

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    --Well, let me address it more directly then, because that is the key question in the case. 
    I think one reason the courts of appeals have occasionally had trouble seeing the common sense truth of our position is that the mutual savings account are kind of a freak of nature in modern American society, because they are... you have one piece of paper that has the dichotomous qualities of debt and equity at the same time. 
    And it might be helpful if we could imagine splitting up that one piece of paper into two discrete instruments; that is, imagine here that petitioners gave up their stock in Commerce and got back two pieces of paper. 
    The first piece of paper, let's say, would be a corporate IOU. 
    I owe you $200,000 payable on demand, plus interest. 
    That would be a garden variety bank deposit. 
    They also got back a second piece of paper which we might call a membership certificate in Citizens that said you're hereby a member, and you can vote and so forth. 
    The question is is that second piece of paper worth anything; would anybody pay you any money for that second piece of paper? 
    I think the answer is clearly no.

    Let me ask you another question. 
    What about the problem of being fair to taxpayers generally? 
    I realize the reputation of the Internal Revenue Service is very technical and not necessarily always fair, and I would understand that. 
    But here you have a case where since 1971 if a lawyer were advised or asked to advise a client, he would find that cases uniformly have taken a position contrary to the one you take here today. 
    I realize the Commissioner has never acquiesced in it, but what do people do when they wish to consider a measure, counsel tells them that five courts, including... well, the tax court would make six... have said that they may do so on a tax-free basis?

    We were on the public record in 1969 as ruling that a stock into a mutual merger where the old shareholders are cashed out does not qualify for tax-free treatment. 
    That ruling antedated all the court of appeals cases, and we kept litigating it in court after court; and now we finally won one, and that's why we're in this court, and you're the Supreme Court. 
    And the fact that people may have relied on lower court opinions in the face of our obvious resistance doesn't set up any estoppel of alliance interest they can rely on. 
    They knew there was a risk that the Commissioner would always contend that this merger was not a tax-free reorganization.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    --Well, as I understand it, the Commissioner had not taken any public ruling position on the question before 1969. 
    There was an in-house position which may have been reflected in some private letter rulings to the... to support the petitioners' position. 
    But what happened in 1968 is that the Commissioner received a huge barrage of requests for private letter rulings as to the tax results of this kind of merger. 
    People wanted him to bless one of these mergers in advance. 
    The reason for that, I think, is that between October of 1966 and August of '68 the value of savings and loan stocks as reflected in Standard 8 Poor's S&amp;L index quintupled in value. 
    So you had an awful lot of shareholders in stock S&amp;Ls with a huge unrealized gain on their stock. 
    They wanted to merge and cash out their investment. 
    The Commissioner got this huge influx of requests for private rulings, and the rulings branch of the IRS realized that the Commissioner had not looked at this area for a long period of time. 
    During the interim, up until '69, as we note in our brief, there'd been a long series of congressional amendments to the both banking and regulatory and tax treatment of S&amp;Ls. 
    They were tax exempt until 1951, and Congress gradually began an incremental process changing the way they were treated. 
    At the same time, their economic function changed. 
    They became less and less like true mutual organizations and more and more like banks. 
    That's reflected in the legislative treatment. 
    So what happened was the Commissioner got this huge bunch of ruling requests and decided it was a good time to review the area authoritatively in light of all the changes that had occurred on the congressional front, and he did so and issued the three rulings in question. 
    And I think that this is simply a reasoned response to changes in the economy and in the way Congress treated these organizations. 
    They are really not like... like true mutual organizations. 
    They're like banks that pay rate of return like banks pay interest, and they're just fungible with other financial institutions.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Well, the court of appeals... I guess it wasn't really a finding of fact; it was a characterization... said that the proprietary interest had no value; and they relied on a number of... of reasons for that. 
    And it's clear if one looks at what those interests are that they don't have a great deal of value. 
    I mean the right to vote in a savings and loan has no value on its face, and in practice, most S&amp;L account holders sign away their right to vote when they open their account by executing a proxy to management in favor of management to vote their votes on behalf of them. 
    I doubt if there's anybody in this room who's ever voted in a savings and loan association. 
    It's just not the kind of thing people would pay money for. 
    And the right to share in the liquidation proceeds again was extremely contingent and speculative, because you would have to get Federal Home Loan Bank Board approval for a liquidation, and they've never approved liquidation of a solvent S&amp;L. 
    So if you kind of break the rights down on a piece-by-piece basis, it's clear that no one would pay any money for those interests; and that fact is reflected in the... in the merger agreement.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Well, Justice Rehnquist, I think all these arguments are simply directed to show that the interest these people got beyond the interest of account holders as proprietors was not substantial. 
    Whether it was zero or one-tenth of one percent or two percent, it was not substantial. 
    And this Court set out the relevant test in Minnesota Tea where it said that the shareholders of the old enterprise must get a proprietary ownership interest that represents a substantial part of the value of the thing transferred. 
    The thing transferred here was the Commerce stock. 
    The value of the thing transferred was $12 per share.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    --I don't think... no, as I understand it, there usually isn't any linkage between stock ownership and depositor status in a stock S&amp;L. 
    In fact, usually the two groups of people are totally separate. 
    And I think normally it would be possible if you had a stock-for-stock deal and got stock back, you could keep your deposit and sell your stock or vice-versa. 
    There'd be no automatic linkage between the two. 
    I'd like to make one final kind of argument that... directed to petitioners' contention that their concern is with the health of the savings and loan industry. 
    They point out that the S&amp;L industry is currently in a depressed situation, that Congress has often voiced the intention to help them out, and that the Commissioner should not be able to come along and throw a big tax monkey wrench into the deal and prevent an otherwise desirable S&amp;L merger. 
    I'd like to point out first of all that the Commissioner has publicly ruled that the vast majority of S&amp;L mergers can be done tax free; that is, mutual to mutual, mutual to stock, and stock into stock. 
    Furthermore, Commerce here, had they wanted to merge tax free, could have had Citizens convert to a stock form of organization, which would have been tax free, and then do a stock-for-stock transaction. 
    That would have been bad for petitioners, because they would have had to get back stock rather than cash and therefore pay tax in order to avoid paying tax.

 No, but it would... would prevent the stock from having an independent value from the accounts. 
 It'd be a prorata interest in the business that was exactly proportionate to the prorata interest in total deposits, which is what you've got now.

    I think the... if that were true beforehand, that you couldn't sell your stock unless you also withdrew your money from the institution, you could simply withdraw your money and sell your stock.

    Mr. William R. Nicholas 
    Thank you. 
    I would just like to point out in closing that the test of the proprietary interest received should not be how risky it is. 
    It is whether it is a proprietary interest that should control. 
    And once one gets down... started down the line of whether there is a risk, then how do you take into account preferred stock, how do you value the equity interest, how can you separate the equity interests from the other interests that one has? 
    I think it's a dangerous way to go, and I... I would urge this Court that if we are going to depart from the line of cases that have held what the rights and obligations are of a share account owner in a savings and loan association, it is something that should be addressed to Congress.
