    Mr. Samuel A. Alito 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns a 1981 amendment to the Food Stamp Act that slightly reduces benefits for households with earned income. 
    In order to implement this change in the law, it was not necessary for a state to gather any new information about any recipient or to make any new factual determinations. 
    Instead, the state merely had to make a small mathematical change in the formula used for computing benefits. 
    Before the amendment, 20 percent of earned income was disregarded in calculating benefits, and after the amendment 18 percent of earned income was disregarded. 
    Both of the lower courts below in this case held that the due process clause prohibited Massachusetts from implementing this simple mathematical change without providing advanced notice to all affected recipients explaining to them exactly how their new benefit amounts had been calculated.

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito 
    The Court of Appeals also found that the statute was violated, but it did so only because it believed that Congress would not have required the provision of a constitutionally defective form of notice. 
    It did not devote any independent analysis to the language of the statute or to the legislative history, and so we believe that the statutory issue is before this Court, and is fairly subsumed by the constitutional question that was raised in the state's petition.

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito 
    I assume they would adhere to their decision based on their erroneous view of what the due process clause requires, and in the brief time that is allotted to me this afternoon, I want to argue that in the situation involved in this case, advance notice is not constitutionally necessary. 
    Counsel for Massachusetts will then assume for the sake of argument that some form of notice is necessary, and will argue that the notice furnished in this case satisfied statutory and regulatory requirements. 
    Let me make clear at the outset exactly what our submission is. 
    We acknowledge that the due process clause requires notice and a hearing when a state terminates or reduces benefits based on a factual determination about the recipient. 
    That is the situation in Goldberg versus Kelly. 
    But we don't think the same rule applies here, where there is no new factual determination, where the only thing that had to occur was a new computation using data that was already in the file and already in use. 
    Why is this so? 
    First of all, I think it is quite clear that the due process clause does not restrict Congress's authority to change the level of food stamp benefits. 
    A food stamp recipient has a property interest in receiving the level of benefits specified by law at any particular time. 
    The recipient doesn't have a property interest in getting any greater benefits, and the recipient doesn't have a vested interest in getting future benefits. 
    So, if Congress amends the law and reduces benefits, as it did in 1981, it does not deprive the recipient of property. 
    It merely redefines the recipient's property interest. 
    Now, since the plaintiffs in this case, who were food stamp recipients, had no vested interest in continuing to receive benefits at the pre-1981 level, one may well ask on what theory they claimed that implementation of the 1981 reduction deprived them of property and triggered the due process clause. 
    And their theory, as I understand it, is as follows. 
    First, they correctly note that they have a property interest in getting the right amount of benefits. 
    Then they say this interest is threatened when the law is changed, because the risk of administrative accident in calculating benefits increases at this time of confusion, and therefore they say we are entitled to advance notice explaining to us how our new benefit level was calculated so that we can double check the state's computation. 
    Now, the first thing that is wrong with this theory in our view is the premise that a great risk of administrative error occurs when a simple mathematical change like that enacted in 1981 is implemented. 
    This premise is devoid of empirical support, and it is intuitively incorrect. 
    This is a simple mathematical operation, and it does not give rise to a great risk of error, but assuming that it is correct for the sake of argument, let me briefly explore some of the implications of this theory. 
    First of all, for all the talk about reductions in food stamp benefits, it turns out that it doesn't matter under this theory that benefits were reduced in 1981. 
    All that matters is that the law was changed, and therefore plaintiffs claimed the risk of error increased, so the theory would logically apply just as well if Congress had increased benefits in 1981 or if it had simply made some other alteration in the formula for computing benefits. 
    Second, it is clear that this theory extends far beyond food stamps, and let me give just two examples. 
    A state decides to increase the salaries of its employees to reflect an increase in the cost of living. 
    State employees have a property interest in getting the salaries specified by law. 
    A Change in the pay scale is a mass change in the law, so according to the plaintiffs that increases the risk of administrative error. 
    So under their theory state employees are entitled to advanced notice as a constitutional requirement explaining how their new salaries were calculated. 
    Another example. 
    Tax rates have been charged several times in recent years. 
    This has affected the amount withheld from wages. 
    Wage earners have a property interest in their wages. 
    Charging the tax rates is a mass change in the law, so under the plaintiff's theory, wage earners were entitled to advanced notice specifying how their new wage levels were calculated. 
    And I think plaintiffs' theory goes further still, because what really triggers, what directly triggers the due process clause under that theory is not the change in the law but the increase in the risk of administrative error. 
    So what if the risk increases for some other reason? 
    The state gets a new computer program, gets a new computer. 
    There is a fire at the computer center. 
    Logically the theory should apply there as well, but then I am not even sure why an increase in the risk of error should matter. 
    What if the normal, everyday error rate in a non-computerized state is higher than even the increased error rate in a state like Massachusetts when it implements a change in the law? 
    Is the non-computerized state then under some kind of perpetual duty to give out notice every time it issues a check? 
    All of this, of course, is absurd. 
    The due process clause requires notice and a hearing when there is a real and imminent threat to a property or liberty interest. 
    Now, there is such a threat in the Goldberg versus Kelly situation. 
    The state makes a factual finding about the individual and concludes that the individual is ineligible for benefits, but there is no such threat here. 
    The only threat is the statistical chance that an accident is going to happen, but for all of us there is always the chance that the government is going to accidentally deprive us of life, liberty, or property. 
    The elevator in this building may crash, but that does not mean that we all have a due process right to advance notice and a hearing on the issue of elevator maintenance. 
    Respondents... the plaintiffs in this case have the last word on this constitutional question in their reply brief, and it seems to me that they ended up by conceding virtually everything that I have just said. 
    On Page 11 of their reply brief, they write, 
    "By definition, accidental deprivations of property by the government cannot be predicted, and therefore advanced notice of them is not possible, much less required. " 
    "This reality, however, does not lead to the conclusion that no notice is due when the government intends to deprive one of property and will predictably make mistakes in doing so. " 
    But here, neither Massachusetts nor the federal government intended to deprive anybody of property. 
    What they intended to do was to see that every recipient got exactly the level of benefits voted by Congress in 1981, no more and no less. 
    The plaintiffs in this case are worried only about accidental deprivation of property, but in the case of such accidental occurrences, advanced notice in a hearing is not necessary. 
    Post-deprivation proceedings are fully sufficient, as this Court held in Parrott versus Taylor.

speaker="samuel_a_alito" startTime="601.510" stopTime="657.116">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito 
    The Congress is not depriving. 
    They flip back and forth in their argument between different definitions of what their property interest is. 
    But it is quite clear, and I believe they conceded it in their opening brief, that they have no property interest in continuing to receive benefits at the 1981 level. 
    Congress is free to change the level of benefits at any time, as this Court held in United States Railroad Board versus Fritz, and in Fleming versus Nestor, the Court went so far as to say that under the Social Security system, where people do make payments, there is no vested right to future payments, to future benefits-- 
    So, it must follow that under the food stamp program recipients do not have a vested right in continuing to receive benefits at any particular level. 
    The only thing they are worried about here is an accidental deprivation of property, and as to that they don't have a constitutional right to advanced notice or a hearing.

    Ms. Ellen L. Janos 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, my argument is promised on the assumption that the Constitution requires some form of notice, and our argument is essentially that the notice that the Department of Public Welfare sent out in December, 1981, in fact met and exceeded the constitutional requirement of due process.

    Only insofar as Massachusetts exceeded those regulatory requirements and we allowed, if someone appealed, we continued their benefits, if they appealed for any reason. 
    The regulation is a little bit more restrictive, but in this case if anyone filed an appeal from this notice, their benefits were continued pending that appeal and pending the final decision.

    Ms. Ellen L. Janos 
    In December, 1981, the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare mailed a notice to 16,000 food stamp recipients that were affected by the change in federal law. 
    The lower courts found this notice unconstitutional because of its vocabulary, because of its print size, because of its ink quality, and because it did not contain individualized financial information for each particular household. 
    The courts used this notice to set forth unworkable and burdensome standards to govern future notices of legislative change which are not rooted in the due process clause. 
    First, the notice was accurate, and it conveyed the information about the change in federal law in a correct manner and in a manner that was in accordance with the Secretary's regulatory requirements. 
    Secondly, the notice used language that is commonly on food stamp forms and notices, and most important, language that was understood by the three class representatives in this particular case. 
    Third, there was no finding that any particular recipient did not ultimately receive all the benefits to which they were entitled.

    Finally, even if... if someone had a question or wanted to challenge the application of this legislative action to their particular case, the procedural safeguards that were afforded to all of the people that received this notice were extensive. 
    Page 2 of the notice, which is at Page 5 of your joint appendix, is entitled "Important Notice, Read Carefully". 
    It explains that the federal law had lowered the earned income deduction from 20 percent to 18 percent. 
    It explained the effect of the law on the household's benefits. 
    It then explained in detail the simple procedure by which an appeal could be claimed. 
    Although the class representatives understood the language of this notice, the District Court applied a mechanical reading test, a formula to this notice to see whether it met the requirements of the due process clause. 
    That reading--

    Ms. Ellen L. Janos 
    The critical part of the notice, Your Honor, was identical to the first notice. 
    Page 2 was virtually identical to the November notice except for the fact that it now had a specific date on it. 
    The first page of that notice was an attempt to explain why they were in fact receiving a second notice on the effect of the temporary restraining order. 
    in addition to everyday food stamp words, the other kinds of words that contributed to the unconstitutionality of this notice were such words as "recent", "within", "enclosed". 
    The list of those words appear in your appendix, and we submit that they have no application to the determination of whether a notice informs someone of a pending action. 
    the due process clause does not incorporate a statistical reading test. 
    It merely requires that a notice be reasonably designed to convey the required information. 
    The logical extent of this rule, of course, would require states to match the reading abilities of the intended readers of a particular notice with the notice itself. 
    it imposes burdensome and unworkable requirements on states, and most importantly, those are decisions for state administrators to make, for Congress to make. 
    They are not decisions that are to be made by federal courts, and they are not decisions that are related to the construction of the due process clause. 
    the District Court found a second basis for holding this notice unconstitutional. 
    The District Court found that there was a risk of erroneous deprivation inherent in this notice. 
    As Mr. Alito pointed out, the risk of error in the implementation of this across-the-board statutory reduction was minimal. 
    It was a simple recalculation using existing factual data. 
    There were no disputed factual issues that came into play in the implementation of this particular change. 
    And more importantly, if someone believed that the legislative action should not be applied to them, they were afforded extensive procedural safeguards. 
    The notice stated that they could call their local welfare office if they had any questions. 
    All they had to do was send back into the department a slip of paper that accompanied the notice, and thereby claiming an appeal. 
    As I stated, if they sent in that slip of paper, their benefits were restored pending the appeal. 
    The appeal was an evidentiary hearing. 
    The appeal was subject to judicial review. 
    So that the procedural safeguards went far beyond the regulatory requirements for one, and certainly went far beyond the constitutional requirements.

    Ms. Ellen L. Janos 
    I don't believe we have, Your Honor, and I don't know. 
    Sometimes it is... the administrative difficulties of trying to collect $5 outweigh the need to get that. 
    The rule announced below is essentially this. 
    When announcing a change in the law, a recipient must be able to determine on the face of the notice whether there has been a calculation error. 
    As Mr. Alito pointed out, this rule is not restricted to the food stamp program. 
    It is not even restricted to public assistance programs generally, but could be applied wherever the government takes any action where the property interest is implicated. 
    There is... the due process clause simply requires that someone be on notice that something is happening to them, and not be given their entire case file so that they can check the computations and calculations of the state agency. 
    I just want to turn for a moment, Your Honor, to the... and just to back up for a minute on the risk of error, as I stated earlier, and as the Court of Appeals recognized, there was no showing that anyone ultimately received less benefits than they were entitled to.

    And that is available to everybody. 
    They can call. 
    They don't even have to go in, or certainly they can go in and examine it themselves, before a hearing, or if they want to make a decision as to whether a hearing is even necessary. 
    In the food stamp program, people are recertified periodically, and at the recertification it is equivalent to a new application. 
    For some households it is three months. 
    For some households it is six months. 
    And for a very few, it is a year. 
    And at that recertification period, they sit down with a face-to-face interview with the social worker, and they go through their entire case file, so it is not as if they don't have contact or are not used to having contact with particular workers.

    Mr. Steven A. Hitov 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are three major points that the plaintiffs would like to make in their presentation today. 
    The first is that the Food Stamp Act does indeed require the type of individual notice of reduction or termination in benefits ordered below, and that is for two reasons. 
    The first reason is so that families who are about to experience a correct reduction in their benefits can plan for that. 
    That has always been the structure of the food stamp program as expressed in the Secretary's own regulations. 
    The second reason for this informative notice is so that families who are about to be incorrectly reduced, or who believe from what they have been told that they are about to be incorrectly reduced, can challenge that reduction and prevent those benefits from being reduced while they are going through a hearing on that issue.

    So our second point in the overall presentation is its prospective injunctive relief, Number One, was quite conservative, and Number Two, was entirely justified. 
    As to the contents of future notices, each of the families in this lawsuit received a notice of reduction or termination of their grants based upon the specific facts of their case. 
    That was the type of notice that was sent here, and the District Court merely ordered the defendant, the Department of Public Welfare, in the future to issue notices of reduction or termination that comported with the language of the statute itself as that language was determined by the First Circuit.

    That is correct, Your Honor, and since that point, without a stay of the First Circuit's mandate, the Department of Public Welfare has issued another notice under exactly the same circumstances which did not comply with that mandate, but I will get to that also in the main body of my argument. 
    Second, as to the form of future notices, when the Court examines the record, you will notice that no form has been dictated. 
    What the District Court did was tell the Department of Public Welfare to develop some mechanism to ensure that future notices would be understandable to the people that they were sent to. 
    Finally, the third aspect of the relief afforded by the District Court was the return of the benefits withheld in violation of Section 2020(e)(10) of the Act, and the plaintiffs will demonstrate that the return of these benefits is in fact mandated by another section of the Act, 7 USC Section 2023 (b), not only as a matter of statutory construction, but also for sound policy reasons as well.

    No, Your Honor, sound policy reasons that derive directly from the statute. 
    Justice Stevens, if I might now return to your question as to the language of the statute, if you would bear with me for just one second, I would like to present to the Court what the notice did say, what it didn't say that the lower courts found it should have said, and then discuss where they derived that... from where they derived that conclusion. 
    Despite the fact that 16,500 families in this case each suffered a reduction or a termination... they weren't told which in advance... based upon the individual facts of their case unique to each one of those families, the department sent them not an individual notice but a general notice which, if one were able to fight through the language of the notice, and if one were able to read it, and as I will discuss later, at least three people who testified, including an expert witness, had to use a magnifying glass to do so--

    Mr. Steven A. Hitov 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Actually, that was not the issue here. 
    The two facts subset, the two facts at issue for each of the families in this case, and which were unique to each of those families in this case, first... there were two determinations made here by the Department of Public Welfare. 
    The first was that each of the families receiving this notice... as Ms. Janos pointed out, it was less than 10 percent of the general population. 
    Each of the families receiving the notice had earned income. 
    That in fact was often incorrect. 
    One of the named plaintiffs didn't have earned income and yet received this notice, and was told that she would either be reduced or terminated. 
    The second determination that was made was that assuming a person had earned income, how much earned income, because if the amount of that earned income was incorrect, the department was working with the wrong figure, not only the resulting grant would be incorrect, but the amount of the reduction as a result of this change would be incorrect. 
    In other words, if there were an underlying data base error, the amount would have been magnified for those people for whom the department had an incorrect amount.

    They weren't proposing to send them more money. 
    They were proposing to take money away from them.

    Mr. Steven A. Hitov 
    There, Your Honor, again, only as long... the difference in time would be the difference in time that it take a printer to print it and the time it takes a person to write it, like it used to be done before. 
    We have progressed to computers. 
    Because, and this is the critical issue, something is happening here to these people's grants. 
    These were not, hopefully, and I believe in this case they weren't, random reductions in people's grants where they pick out every fourth person and said, we are going to reduce your grant. 
    They reduced people's grants pursuant to figures that they had worked with. 
    Somebody made those calculations, and the notice was to tell them about it. 
    If the calculations were made, the person couldn't have been paid their food stamps. 
    So what we are talking about here, and this is not counsel's opinion, this is in the record and unrefuted by the department, this is what an expert in the administration of welfare programs testified, that this... the time involved here is the time it takes to write what you are doing anyhow, and in Massachusetts that, of course, was miniscule. 
    The computer expert said, if there is enough room on the paper, we can do it.

    A month, Your Honor, and I should point out that we are talking about a 2 percent reduction in the earned income disregard, which I suspect Your Honors have already discovered is not the easiest concept to apply to the actual outcome of the food stamp grant. 
    What this meant in terms of reductions, if the Court looks at Joint Appendix Page 44, where a sample page from the department's computer printout is listed, the average grant reduction is just about 5 percent, it is 4.78 percent, as I recall, in a family's grant.

    But there were, of course, reductions of all sizes and the average for that page comes out to 4.78 percent, so the average family on that page lost 5 percent of their benefits. 
    When one takes it in terms of percentages and thinks perhaps of our salaries or what have you, it is a more substantial loss. 
    It is not how many dollars you are losing, it is what percentage of what you have, of course.

    Mr. Steven A. Hitov 
    No, in our briefs, we specifically said that we believe that was a mistake, that they were presented... of course, as counsel, we presented them with both, because we couldn't be certain that they would agree on the statutory interpretation. 
    They unfortunately looked at the constitutional issue first and then the statutory. 
    My suspicion, without attempting to defend them, but my guess as to why that happened is that there was a full blown trial in this case in the District Court that drew in all these constitutional issues. 
    And so the court, I think, just went along with that without stopping to say, wait a minute, if we are deciding this on a statutory ground, there is no reason to have done that.

    Mr. Steven A. Hitov 
    Word for word on the statute, Your Honor. 
    The statute says that whenever a person receives an individual notice of agency action reducing or terminating benefits is--

    Justice Stevens

    Justice Stevens 
    Such a hearing, but the hearing then takes you back to the first clause, which is, a state plan of operation shall provide for the granting of a fair hearing and a prompt determination to any household aggrieved by the action of the state agency, right?

    They could have done that because they ran out of money, which I am just taking as a hypothetical, because it ran out of money, because Congress told them to, because they had a misperception of the facts in a person's case, because somebody reported some information that either was or wasn't true.

    Mr. Steven A. Hitov 
    --It explicitly assumes. 
    This is not an implicit assumption. 
    It explicitly assumes notice, and it explicitly assumes individual notice. 
    Now, individual notice can mean two things. 
    The parties... I think this is one of the few things the parties seem to agree on here, is that can either mean send the same piece of paper to each house, or it can mean send a notice that is specific to that household to that house. 
    And we would suggest that only the second is consistent with the statute and the Secretary's own interpretation. 
    The Secretary for years has had two types of notices listed in his regulations, three types actually, but two that are relevant here. 
    One is called a general notice, and that is exactly what was sent out here. 
    It is a notice, it is the same notice, the same piece of paper, and it is sent to each individual household.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2750.792" stopTime="2764.550">
    Justice Stevens 
    Yes, but it seems to me if you say after receiving individual notice of agency action, and so forth and so on, that that implies that there must be notice because there is a hearing, and it also implies there must be a hearing for every one of these cases, if you read it literally.
speaker="steven_a_hitov" startTime="2764.550" stopTime="2769.545">
    Mr. Steven A. Hitov 
    I don't believe so, Your Honor, because it starts with, for any household that timely requests it. 
    That is exactly Congress's--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2769.545" stopTime="2773.226">
    Justice Stevens 
    But timely requests a hearing after receiving individual notice.
speaker="steven_a_hitov" startTime="2773.226" stopTime="2775.399">
    Mr. Steven A. Hitov 
    --Right, so that presupposes individual notice--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2775.399" stopTime="2782.294">
    Justice Stevens 
    It is after he requests such a fair hearing, which takes you back to the first, which would make the hearing requirement apply to every family. 
    Well, anyway, I--
speaker="steven_a_hitov" startTime="2782.294" stopTime="2897.698">
    Mr. Steven A. Hitov 
    --I am sorry. 
    No, Your Honor, I do believe this is important, because it is the crux of the statute. 
    The hearing is a requirement in every case if a recipient asks for it. 
    That is the first clause. 
    That does not trigger the continuation of benefits, which is the second clause. 
    The second clause says that after receiving... if a person requests a hearing, after receiving individual notice of reduction or termination, that person shall continue to participate and receive benefits at the level prior to the notice. 
    So Your Honor is entirely correct that the purpose of this individual notice is in fact tied to the hearing that a person is going to request. 
    It could not have been Congress's intent to require a notice, tie it to the potential request for a hearing, and as both the First Circuit and the District Court found, expect that notice to be such that people had to guess whether or not to ask for that hearing. 
    Congress said specifically in the statute, continue to pay benefits if they ask for a hearing. 
    It is neither sound fiscal management, and it is not a rational interpretation of the statute to say we just intend to pay benefits at random to people when they guess whether or not a proposed action might or might not hurt them. 
    That could not have been Congress's intent. 
    They exactly did require individual notice for that purpose. 
    That is entirely consistent with the overall scheme of the foodstamp program, which, as all the parties agree also, primarily uses households as the source of information. 
    They are the ones who tell the department, here are my individual circumstances. 
    The department then calculates their grant for a given certification period. 
    Those same households under the statute are used as the primary source of error detection, because the one thing they know for certain, or believe they know for certain, is the individual facts of their cases.

    --That's correct, Your Honor, but then if you move to the last clause of Section 2020(e)(10), it lists a specific exception. 
    It says, however, a state agency may act immediately to reduce or terminate a household's benefits and may provide notice of its action to the household as late as the date on which the action becomes effective in those circumstances where they are acting on a direct statement from the recipient. 
    That is the final clause, and that is exactly what the First Circuit determined in this case.
