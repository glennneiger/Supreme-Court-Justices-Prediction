    Mr. Bruce James Ennis, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the question is whether the Federal Government's need to obtain information about candidates seeking appointment to federal office, together with the right of a citizen to provide that information in a petition addressed only to appropriate federal officials, requires the same immunity from common law libel actions this Court has already afforded both citizens and governmental officials in a broad range of other circumstances in which providing only qualified immunity would unduly impair the effective functioning of government. 
    In each of those other circumstances, the fact that immunity would protect not only truthful and useful communications, but also, on occasion, knowingly false and defamatory communications, has been considered a necessary cost of government. 
    As Justice Harlan wrote for the Court in Barr v. Matteo, affording executive officials immunity from libel actions alleging knowing falsity, 
    "It has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation. "

    No, Your Honor, I do not. 
    I believe that Barr v. Matteo and other decisions of this Court affording immunity to governmental officials is not based on any specific clause of the Constitution. 
    None was referred to. 
    But I do believe they were constitutional decisions in the sense that the Court felt that the very constitutional structure of our government required such immunity.

    Your Honor, there is not a word about the Constitution in Barr v. Matteo, but the Court nevertheless thought, even though there was no constitutional right of a governmental official at issue, that the effective functioning of the government itself was sufficient to require the rule of immunity. 
    In this case, we have not only that same governmental interest, but in addition the interest of the citizen critic expressly grounded in the petition clause of the First Amendment.

    Mr. Bruce James Ennis, Jr. 
    It would be tried under North Carolina libel law as that law is modified and governed by the federal Constitution and also by the needs of the Federal Government to receive information. 
    For example, the Court has also ruled, not relying on any specific constitutional provision, that citizens have a right to provide information about criminal offenses to government; they have a right to testify before legislative and judicial bodies; and they have a right to provide petitions to the judicial branch of government, and they would be absolutely immune from libel actions in each of those circumstances. 
    We seek no more in this case. 
    In our view, there are two separate but in this case coinciding interests which require immunity. 
    The first is the interest of the Federal Government in effective functioning and the second is the interest of the citizen critic in providing the information the government needs to function effectively.

    Mr. Bruce James Ennis, Jr. 
    Because both governmental officials and citizens would be deterred from providing truthful and useful information to the government if they knew that merely upon an allegation that their communications were knowingly false, they would be required to spend literally thousands of dollars in unrecoverable defense costs to defend the truth of their statements. 
    That would silence both governmental officials and citizen critics from providing the information government needs.

    That is correct, Your Honor, and it raises a very important distinction. 
    Witnesses who testify in judicial proceedings are not immune from perjury prosecutions, but they are immune from common law libel actions. 
    We are not seeking immunity from every possible sanction. 
    For example, the Federal Government has already made it a crime to provide false information to the government, whether it's defamatory of a third party or not. 
    We are not seeking immunity from that kind of prosecution or from other sanctions.

    --I believe they are constitutional in the sense, Your Honor, that they derive from the very structure of a republican form of government. 
    They are like the slaughterhouse cases, like In Re Quarles, like all of the foundation cases on which our Constitution and jurisprudence is based. 
    The Court in every one of those cases said that that kind of immunity, in the circumstances of that case, was necessary in order to ensure the effective functioning of government. 
    That's the literal language used in those cases. 
    I see no distinction here. 
    The government was actively considering an important governmental decision... whether to appoint Respondent to the office of United States Attorney, the chief law enforcement office in the Middle District of North Carolina. 
    That was obviously an important decision. 
    It required nomination by the President and the advice and consent of the Senate. 
    This was not some low level margin decision. 
    In order to make a responsible and effective decision on that candidacy, the government needed to obtain relevant information. 
    The letters that my client sent to the President are, on their face, highly relevant to the qualifications of Respondent for that office.

    It's a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which includes the answer as well as the complaint. 
    Nevertheless, I would assume for purposes of this case that even if what my client wrote is knowingly false, it should be absolutely protected because it is the right of the Federal Government to decide for itself how to separate the false from the true. 
    The Federal Government certainly has mechanisms for doing that. 
    This letter was in fact addressed, one copy, to William Webster, the Director of the FBI who has statutory authority to investigate candidates for appointment to this very federal office.

    Mr. Ennis, isn't there a basic difference in the justification for immunity and libel or defamation actions for witnesses in judicial proceedings, simply because they're subject to cross-examination to get at the truth?

    Mr. Bruce James Ennis, Jr. 
    --Well, Vogel applies not just in criminal cases, nor does... but the rule I'm talking about is a petition to Federal Government. 
    The fourth point I'd like to make on that secrecy argument is that the Respondent, I think disingenuously suggests in his answering brief, that he did not have an ample opportunity to respond. 
    In fact, he did. 
    The record in this case is clear, as the deposition of Congressman Johnston makes clear, that the Respondent promptly received copies of both letters from Congressman Johnston, his friend, and Senator Helms, his friend and sponsor, and that on January 19th and February 27th he in fact wrote to Congressman Johnston with enclosures, providing a detailed response to every one of petitioner's allegations. 
    So he did in fact have an ample opportunity to respond, and that's in the record of this case. 
    This was not a secret, however. 
    A secret requires an agreement by both parties to the communications to keep it confidential between themselves. 
    My client did not demand or request that the government keep his petition secret. 
    To the contrary, he offered to testify publicly, where he would have been subject to cross-examination and penalties for perjury; nor did he expect secrecy. 
    He is alleged to have sent copies of his letters to Senator Helms and Congressman Johnston, both of whom were friends and sponsors of the Respondent.

    Mr. Bruce James Ennis, Jr. 
    No, I do not think it would, Your Honor, because the petitioner would still be subject to penalties for providing false information to the government. 
    On the contrary, though, I think that a rule granting petitioner's immunity from common law libel actions would tend to encourage citizens to provide truthful and useful information to the government because they would no longer have to fear spending $20, $4O, $60, $80,000 in unrecoverable defense costs if their communication was simply alleged to be knowingly false. 
    Let me respond to one point that has not yet come up, but is... since the Respondent really says virtually nothing at all about our historical argument that was known to the framers and nothing at all about our functional analysis argument, Respondent talks only about the petitions being secret and misdirected. 
    The argument about misdirected is that petitioner's first letter was misdirected because he sent it to Congressman-Elect Johnston and to President-Elect Reagan before they had been sworn in. 
    But as the record makes clear, in November of '80 the Respondent had applied for the position to Congressman-Elect Johnson and to Senator Helms requesting their assistance in obtaining the appointment. 
    If it was appropriate for the Respondent to seek the assistance of Congressman-Elect Johnston in obtaining the appointment, it was no less appropriate for the petitioner to write to the same Congressman-Elect Johnson to oppose the appointment. 
    It was widely reported in the press that there was a transition team in place, chaired by Ed Meese, that was then actively considering nominations. 
    In fact, the Respondent alleges that he was an active candidate, and that the President would be making appointments as soon after he was sworn in as possible. 
    There is no more appropriate occasion for a citizen to communicate with the Federal Government concerning a candidate for Federal office than when the decisionmaking process is actively underway. 
    Let me conclude... and then I'd like to reserve a few minutes for rebuttal... by simply reminding the Court, as I'm sure it's aware, that the deterrent effect we are talking about here is an extraordinarily severe deterrent effect. 
    In fact, the Respondent concedes at page 18 of his brief that the potential cost of defending a libel action is great, to use the Respondent's words. 
    And the relative cost for an ordinary citizen who does not have libel defense insurance is even greater than the cost for a media defendant, such as the New York Times. 
    Let me pose a hypothetical. 
    If North Carolina tomorrow enacted a statute imposing a $20,000 tax on all petitions to the Federal Government, can anyone doubt that that would silence all petitions to the Federal Government by everyone but the most wealthy or foolhardy citizen? 
    But the $20,000 tax, though it's not paid to the State of North Carolina, is the same in this case under the common law rule. 
    The petitioner must pay that $20,000 to his defense lawyers and to court reporters, not to the State of North Carolina directly, but the cost to him is the same and the deterrent effect on him is the same. 
    If this Court does not grant absolute immunity, I think it is clear that the message that will go out to the citizens of this country is that they are no longer free to criticize candidates or to criticize wrongdoing by public officials, and that if they do so, they do so at enormous economic cost to themselves.

   Argument of William A. Eagles
speaker="william_a_eagles" startTime="1881.645" stopTime="1963.647">
    Mr. William A. Eagles 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, over 20 years ago this Court decided New York Times v. Sullivan. 
    In that case the Court set out the protection the Constitution makes available to citizens who criticize public officials. 
    The citizens in question in New York Times were not petitioning the government. 
    They were, however, petitioning the holders of the absolute sovereignty in this country; they were petitioning their fellow citizens. 
    New York Times, addressing the free speech and press clauses, recognized that actual malice must be shown to be the basis of any recovery from a libel action for criticizing a federal official or government official. 
    Now Mr. McDonald comes before this Court and seeks absolute immunity for letters alleged to have contained knowing, malicious defamatory falsehoods. 
    New York Times standard would not protect such intentional lies. 
    Yet, Mr. McDonald really offers only arguments that were addressed, weighed, balanced, and decided in New York Times.

    Chief Justice Burger 
    Has anyone ever succeeded in getting a recovery from The New York Times since Sullivan that you're aware of? 
    If you don't know, it's--
speaker="william_a_eagles" startTime="1976.555" stopTime="2348.815">
    Mr. William A. Eagles 
    I don't know offhand, Your Honor. 
    We are here denying that malicious lies are afforded a protection under the petition clause; that the same malicious lies would be denied by the free speech and press clauses. 
    Yesterday, this Court affirmed the position that's inescapable under the unified analysis of the speech and petition clauses received by this Court already, stating that while the petition and speech clauses are separate they are related and generally subject to the same analysis. 
    Application of that same analysis is all that we ask, that malicious lies whispered in the ear of a government official receive no greater protection than malicious lies printed in The New York Times. 
    Counsel for the petitioner has indicated that he does not seek protection from every possible sanction that might result from information contained in the petition. 
    They do, however, seek protection, absolute immunity from the only sanction available to Mr. Smith. 
    Mr. Smith is not afforded his day in court that would result from a petition to the judicial branch. 
    The only opportunity that David Smith will ever have to prove the truth or falsity of allegations made against him is in a libel action. 
    He's properly alleged the falsity, he's prepared to proceed under the standard providing, we would say, ample and we believe the Court has already said ample protection of The New York Times standard. 
    The opportunity to respond that counsel for petitioner discussed existed to some extent under the facts of the case before the Court. 
    It did not, however, exist in a forum that resolution of the conflicting positions and facts presented would ever be reached. 
    Presumably, had Mr. Smith in fact been appointed, that resolution would have occurred in the minds of the public. 
    But in the absence of his appointment, for whatever reason, the malicious lies are left and he... and Mr. Smith has no opportunity to address them. 
    The petitioner's argument, it seems to us, asks this Court to address the question of the petition clause as if there had been no development of constitutional libel law since the drafting of the first amendment. 
    He appears to present a blank slate, or a blank slate for the last 200 years, to the Court. 
    But we would submit that this case not only deals with the petition clause, but also the balancing between the effect of immunities granted under the petition clause and the protections granted under the speech clause, because it is as citizens see those protections that they will decide where discussion of matters of public interest will take place. 
    The First Amendment fundamentally supports the proposition of public, vigorous, wide-open debate of issues important to the public. 
    This Court has said that many times, and as recently as Monday of this week. 
    It is our position that providing one who would use malicious lies for political gain with an absolute immunity would not only encourage the false information flowing to the Federal Government, but would encourage the discussion of it to be moved out of any guarantee of rebuttal by those not only who were defamed by it, but by those who disagree with it. 
    The discussion of the matters of public interest would be moved into the secrets of private letters and whispered petitions to government officials, carefully chosen so that they are the person most... best in a position to do the most harm to the man who's being defamed. 
    That approach to the questions presented by the petitioner's argument, we believe necessarily draws one back to the protections provided by New York Times and the fundamental precepts of the Constitution supporting and encouraging open... wide-open, robust debate of public issues. 
    We would submit, further, that while the petitioner discusses in his brief at some length the chilling effect of a potential large libel verdict, that since New York Times there has not been a single libel verdict for more than a half million dollars or as much as a half million dollars affirmed by an appellate court.

    Mr. William A. Eagles 
    In Alamass County, North Carolina it would indeed, sir. 
    I point that out, Your Honor... he talks about the unreasonable inflation of libel verdicts, and that inflation... before New York Time, John Henry Faulk was awarded over half a million dollars, and there hasn't been an award that large since. 
    So the inflation aspect of it simply doesn't appear from the record of those verdicts which have been affirmed by appellate courts. 
    He discusses the cost of litigation. 
    The cost of litigation is great. 
    And it in fact is something that I guess we all should consider every time we get in an automobile or have an invitee come on our premises. 
    If we live in the world, we risk the cost of litigation. 
    And if we tell malicious lies defaming people, we ought to risk that cost and we ought to risk the threat of large libel verdicts, and we ought to be chilled from malicious lies disrupting the decisionmaking process of the Federal Government. 
    And in New York Times, the chilling prospect was considered, it was weighed, and it was determined that under the speech clause and the press clause, that question was adequately addressed by the malicious falsehood standard: knowingly false, reckless disregard of the truth or falsity thereof. 
    People should be chilled when they're about to tell lies about people that will, on their face, do those people harm and they are intended to do harm by the focus to the recipient that the speaker chooses.

    As I understand it, Your Honor, that's correct. 
    The potential for a public figure question rests in the trial court, I suppose, because we have, for the purposes of the motion from which this appeal was taken, that question was yielded. 
    It has not been yielded for the litigation generally, but except for that question that's exactly the standard. 
    It's a standard that would be required under... by New York Times, and it's a standard that existed in North Carolina for just this type of... in Ponder v. Cobb, there was a letter to a state official complaining of local election officials.

    Mr. William A. Eagles 
    Well, I believe so, Your Honor. 
    If people who acted in good faith and on reasonable grounds, the older cases discuss bona fide and probable cause, use that kind of language, then a common law privilege did exist and should, and chilling would take place in the absence of it. 
    Another point in terms of the cost of litigation that is made by the petitioner in his brief is the comparison between the availability of counsel and the cost of counsel between libel plaintiffs and defendants, pointing out that a contingent fee arrangement is often available to libel plaintiffs. 
    I would disagree. 
    I would think it is seldom available to libel plaintiffs. 
    I would point out to the Court that the use of contingent fee arrangements is one of the strongest deterrents to litigation with no substantial basis because in that situation, a lawyer who is making a decision on the merits of potential cases as presented to him or to her and deciding... before the case is ever filed, there is a tremendous weeding out process that takes place. 
    And that is a protection against frivolous litigation that is substantial and grows out of the same sorts of concerns about costs of litigation that the counsel for petitioner raises.

    Mr. William A. Eagles 
    Yes, Your Honor, I think it is in fact a valuable... can potentially be a valuable service for someone to make government officials aware of information of which they cannot themselves be certain. 
    Mr. McDonald, however, did not couch his defamation in those sorts of terms. 
    Rather, he presented them as true and he, as the briefs point out and it's clear from the letters, cites page and verse, name, address, telephone numbers of people that the federal official was told could substantiate these things. 
    And those people are the very witnesses that we intend to call at trial, are the people through whom we intend to prove the falsity and the maliciousness. 
    But the fact of presenting those names and addresses wins this air that's repeated by citation to those in petitioner's brief of credibility that is very difficult to overcome in a process like this one, where any number of candidates for an office exist, any number of whom have good appropriate qualifications, and as to one of whom this mess is presented, this series of allegations, this possible problem. 
    And the effect of that is potentially devastating to a candidate who would be considered equally among others, and could do away with any possibility or any perceived need for checking the reliability and the truth or falsity by the federal official who had available to him other qualified reasonable candidates to choose among. 
    The potential of the FBI doing an investigation that counsel for petitioner discussed clearly existed, except that there is no way to know if the FBI chose to or not, and even if it had, the allegations of that process would not necessarily result in Mr. Smith having an opportunity to present his side of the story. 
    In fact, that argument, it seems to me, raises the government's investigatory process to a... it puts it on a higher plane than the truth-seeking processes of the courts in which Mr. Smith seeks to have this question determined, to have the fact of the falsity of the information and the malicious nature of its presentation proven.

    Mr. William A. Eagles 
    Oh, yes. 
    They knew about it before any action was brought on Mr. Smith's behalf. 
    And that raises another question. 
    And one of the... the Webb case to which counsel for petitioner made some comment... in that case, the court of West Virginia determined that the petition clause provided an absolute immunity and made that available to the defendant, even though he published a newsletter with the same information and spread it generally in the community. 
    And that is... that would enable someone under that decision to avoid any possible defamation action or discussion of public issues and criticism of public figures, public officials, by simply including whatever he put in the paper or to the public generally, including it also in a petition to the government. 
    And that would be, we believe, a remarkable way around the longstanding libel laws of all the states and the decision of New York Times and this Court's view of what New York Times stands for. 
    We believe that an individual's right to protection of his own good name reflects no more than the basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every human being, and that that concept is at the root of any decent system of ordered liberty. 
    This Court has so said in Gertz, and we believe that if the interest, if that interest is important, it is no less important because it was left to the protection of the state and that it's necessary to make those people who choose to lie maliciously about people and defame them, to be held to answer for their words. 
    And if there are no further questions from the Court, we would urge on that basis for the Court to affirm. 
    Thank you very much.

   Rebuttal of Bruce James Ennis, Jr.

    Mr. Bruce James Ennis, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The respondent raised the point about public debate. 
    First, there is no allegation in the complaint that my client, the petitioner, distributed copies of this letter to any member of the public, only to federal officials. 
    There was a very good reason why he did not distribute his letter to the public and give an opportunity for public debate. 
    He was seeking to exercise his right to petition the Federal Government concerning a decision that was about to be made by the Federal Government, and there was no arguable basis to believe that the public would be able to redress that particular grievance. 
    Second, by limiting his petition to officials of the Federal Government, he obviously limited any damage to the reputational interest that the candidate might have in his local home community. 
    And while I'm on that point, let me simply state that this Court's decisions in Gertz and Monitor and Hutchinson make clear that although reputation is an important interest, the reputational interest of a candidate for office is greatly diminished because candidates invite scrutiny of their qualifications and reputation. 
    Second, Justice O'Connor asked whether or not a rule of good faith or qualified immunity would be important and might not be sufficient. 
    Let me simply refer to the position taken by the United States in Webg v. Fury which is quoted at page 40 of our brief, in which the United States said: 
    "To allow a plaintiff to simply plead bad faith would create a chilling effect on the exercise of the right to petition. " 
    The United States continued that the right to petition would 
    "lose any real meaning because private citizens will be deterred by the threat of litigation from exercising that right which would deprive the Federal Government of the information it needs to govern. " 
    Let me conclude by simply stating once again that we are not seeking absolute immunity from every possible sanction for every communication that could conceivably be deemed a petition. 
    We only seek immunity from common law libel actions and only in the three circumstances of this case. 
    First, the petition was from a citizen to appropriate officials of the Federal Government; second, the petition was relevant to the qualifications of a candidate actively seeking appointment to federal office; and third, the petition was made on an appropriate occasion while the federal decision concerning appointment was still pending. 
    Thank you very much.
