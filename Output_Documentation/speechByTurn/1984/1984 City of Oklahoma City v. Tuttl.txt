City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in the City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle. 
    Mr. Bailey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="burk_bailey" startTime="13.386" stopTime="365.118">
    Mr. Burk Bailey 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, on the night of October 4, 1980, an Oklahoma City police officer named Julian Rotramel shot and killed a man named William Tuttle. 
    The shooting occurred outside a bar in Oklahoma City called the "We'll Do Club". 
    The bar was located in what Plaintiff's expert called an interstitial city area, what he described as a rough part of town. 
    The events leading up to the shooting are unusual. 
    The evidence was that Mr. Tuttle was a frequent patron of the bar, and that day he had been in and out of it several different times, He was said to be despondent over a quarrel he had had with his wife, and his despondency had caused him on a previous occasion following a quarrel with his wife to slash his wrist in the bar. 
    He was... he called the Oklahoma City Police Department and reported an armed robbery in progress and described to the dispatcher the armed robber as himself. 
    He said, 
    "He's a white male. " 
    "He's about 37 years old. " 
    "He has glasses, brown hair. " 
    and such as that. 
    The dispatcher put out an all-points bulletin to all officers, and there were two officers patrolling separately in the general vicinity of the bar. 
    One of them was Julian Rotramel, a rookie police officer who had been out of the Oklahoma City Police Academy about ten months following an 18-week training exercise at the Oklahoma City Police Academy. 
    He was 22 years old at the time. 
    Another officer patrolling in the general vicinity was a veteran police officer named Lennox. 
    Rotramel arrived on the scene almost within one minute after he received the call. 
    He was within eight or nine blocks of the club. 
    What happened after he went into the club is in sharp dispute in the testimony. 
    Rotramel's testimony was that he walked into the darkened bar... it was a so-called "blind" building, concrete blocks, with a single door that operated on a trap spring that closed behind you... and found the person later found to be Tuttle; in any event, the person who matched the description of the robber at the bar, and that Tuttle walked toward him as if to leave through the door behind him. 
    Rotramel said that he put his hand on his shirt or arm or chest, and anyway he held him, and that Tuttle said something that's in dispute. 
    Why can't I leave, or something like that. 
    And Rotramel replies, 
    "I've got a call. " 
    "Stay put. " 
    It's Rotramel's testimony that Tuttle tried twice to reach for his boot, and that he straightened him up. 
    The two bartenders, female bartenders in the bar, testified they saw Tuttle make no such action to retrieve anything from his boot. 
    Rotramel lighted his flashlight, it was dark in there, and signaled to the bartender to come toward him. 
    His testimony was he asked if there was a robbery in progress, and that she uttered only one word, "robbery", and it doesn't indicate whether it was with a question mark like "robbery"? 
    or whether it was "robbery". 
    It's not clear in the record. 
    In any event, it does seem to be clear that Tuttle then broke loose from the officer's grasp and in the words of the Plaintiff's witnesses, darted through the door and that Rotramel spun around and went through the door after him, in pursuit. 
    And whether the door slammed shut or was propped open by the officer's foot is also disputed. 
    In any event, at some point in whirling after him, the officer drew his service revolver. 
    Outside the bar, there was no witness other than Rotramel. 
    He said that he saw Tuttle down in a crouched position with his hand going for his boot. 
    He saw no weapon. 
    He said he had hollered "halt" when the man went out, and "halt" when he saw him crouched with his hand in his boot, and that Tuttle looked over his shoulder at him and started to come up, and he fired. 
    It was Plaintiff's version that because of the exit wound on Tuttle, it could not have happened the way Rotramel said it happened, because the bullet exited higher than it entered in the back. 
    So he must have been in a bent-over position. 
    So, in any event, he didn't come straight up. 
    He was still in a crouched position.

    Mr. Burk Bailey 
    Both, Your Honor. 
    We take the position that under no circumstance was the evidence sufficient to go to the jury because there was no proof of any official policy or customs promulgated by the City of Oklahoma City under the Monell standard, and that the court's instruction on a single incident deemed sufficient to let the tryers of fact infer an official policy to deprive someone of their constitutional rights was--

    --The objection was made, Your Honor, not by... I was not at the trial, but the objection was made in chambers, I am advised, and then following... off the record... and then following the giving of the instructions, the trial judge summoned the counsel to the bench, at which point there is an objection in the record by the City Attorney, the Assistant City Attorney trying the case, which is ambiguous. 
    He says, 
    "We object to that City liability instruction that contains a single instant language. " 
    Plaintiff in their brief take the position that that is an insufficient objection and doesn't comport with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that says it must be specific. 
    But I am advised the trial judge well knew what the objection was. 
    That had been aired in considerable detail in chambers, and that it was just to preserve the record at the... on the record, as it were, following the giving of the instructions.

    We take the position there was no other evidence on the issue of policy or custom. 
    There was evidence from the Plaintiff's expert that the training this officer received was grossly inadequate to deal with an armed robbery situation. 
    The case was tried on that basis, as I see it, Your Honor. 
    The Plaintiff's case was predicated on a contention that the State... that the City was grossly negligent in the training that it gave Officer Rotramel, and that that constituted a deliberate indifference to the rights of the citizens of Oklahoma City.

    Well, that is our position, Your Honor, that that in and of itself is no showing of an official policy. 
    To state, it seems to me, that the City of Oklahoma City has an official policy of inadequately training its officers is preposterous. 
    And there was no proof of any pattern or tradition of misbehavior or any other evidence whatever of any aberrant police behavior. 
    There was... this record is barren of that.

    --I'm not even sure if I would say that, but that is evidence that certainly would point in that direction, that there would be some misbehavior on the part of the police, not necessarily shootings. 
    I don't really mean it has to rise to that level of seriousness, but some showing of an insensitivity to constitutional rights that the City Council would be able to infer that the City's training was not adequate. 
    I would suggest, Your Honor, that it's a difficult proposition, logically, to say that the City can be held to any negligence standard for training its police officers. 
    But I don't need to say that in this case because there's no proof of any other instance, other than this single event, this single incident.

    Mr. Burk Bailey 
    I don't think it is enough, Your Honor. 
    I don't think so, because just recently, about two months ago, since our briefs closed, there's a Fourth Circuit opinion that I think speaks to Your Honor's point. 
    There, an automobile accident victim sued the City of Newport News, saying that the City had grossly, negligently trained its police officers in knowing how to give medical treatment to an automobile victim, and that she had been injured, her spine was injured as a result of them putting her in a cab instead of in an ambulance. 
    And if you... there's no logical stopping point, we would submit, if you can predicate municipal liability solely on a contention that they negligently trained an officer or a fireman or a meter reader. 
    There is... it opens up Section 1983 to simple tort actions.

    I've thought about that, Your Honor, and frankly I doubt that there is a constitutional duty on the part of a city to train police officers at all. 
    I expect that there are hundreds of municipalities that hire police officers with no training at all. 
    And indeed, in the Languirand case in the Fifth Circuit, recently decided, the officer who shot the suspected prowler had no training whatsoever.

    Mr. Burk Bailey 
    I think that's what it was offered for, Your Honor. 
    It was offered to show he was negligently trained. 
    He went to the Oklahoma City Police Academy, which the former Oklahoma City Police Chief testified was rated by the FBI as the third best in the nation, for 18 weeks, 700 hours of training. 
    The Plaintiff, through Dr. Kirkham, a criminologist from Florida, testified that he had studied the curriculum and that it did not contain more than 24 minutes of time devoted to the response to an armed robbery call, and that that was grossly deficient. 
    That was his testimony. 
    The testimony from the police side was different from that. 
    It was that the training was extremely sophisticated and thorough and complete. 
    The problem I see with that, Your Honor, is that the curriculum was extensive. 
    Part of it is established by the state law of Oklahoma, what a police officer must study. 
    It would be difficult, I would think for the Court to fashion a test as to what curriculum needs to be taught in every city police department in the country. 
    There vast differences of opinion about that, I think, among knowledgeable professionals.

    If that were the policy, shoot to kill, as you suggest, or shoot on mere suspicion, it seems to me that policy just wouldn't pass constitutional muster. 
    That policy would not. 
    Here, the policy of the City of Oklahoma City on the use of firearms was, by Plaintiff's own expert witness, ideal. 
    And the position taken in the trial court by Plaintiff was that Rotramel departed from City policy which said an officer can use his weapon only in defense of life when the suspect is armed or threatening great bodily harm, and he must always use the utmost discretion with due respect for the sanctity of human life, that sort of thing.

    --I'm not... the jury found in favor of the officer, Your Honor, as you will recall. 
    They found in favor of the officer and against the Plaintiff on the Plaintiff's suit against the officer, presumably on the good faith qualified immunity that exists for the benefit of City employees, but we don't know that for sure, and against the City. 
    And that has been the pattern, Your Honor, in these cases that are cited... some are not cited. 
    In very recent cases, there's an awful lot of litigation in this area going on. 
    But the juries return verdicts in favor of the officers and against the municipality.

    Mr. Burk Bailey 
    I think the situation was this. 
    Your Honor has asked me what happened. 
    As I was beginning to state a moment ago to Justice Stevens' question, I doubt that if they had given this officer five years of training on responding to armed robbery, it would have had a thing in the world to do with this incident. 
    You've got an armed robbery call in a rough area, in a dark bar. 
    The person matches the description of the robber precisely. 
    He makes... he darts out; it's dark. 
    I think the officer said, 
    "It wasn't a question of apprehending him; I thought my life was in danger. " 
    "I thought I was doing what I had to do to save myself. " 
    And I suspect that training really didn't have anything to do with that; that he was acting... you've got a very edgy officer going into that situation. 
    It was the Plaintiff's case at trial that the officer should not have gone in that bar alone; that he should have waited for a back up. 
    But they are always worried about hostage situations. 
    We had a horrible situation in Oklahoma City. 
    Well, my time is up, Your Honor, and I'll complete that.

    It's on page 44 of the Appendix, where the court says this: 
    "Absent more evidence of supervisory indifference, such as acquiescence in a prior matter of conduct, official policy such as to impose liability on the City of Oklahoma city under the Federal Civil Rights Act, cannot ordinarily be inferred from a single incident of illegality such as the first excessive use of force to stop a suspect; but a single, unusually excessive use of force may be sufficiently out of the ordinary to warrant an inference that it was attributable to inadequate training or supervision amounting to deliberate indifference or gross negligence on the part of the officials in charge.

   Argument of Carl Hughes
speaker="carl_hughes" startTime="1576.816" stopTime="1718.978">
    Mr. Carl Hughes 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is an appeal from the jury verdict rendered in the Western District of Oklahoma, as affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    The issue before this Court is not whether the City of Oklahoma City should have to pay damages to the estate of William Adam Tuttle; the overall question of liability depends on a number of issues which are simply not before this Court. 
    First, liability depends in large part upon resolution of factual issues which were resolved by the jury in the case and are subject to limited review, due to the provisions of the Seventh Amendment. 
    Second, most of the legal issues were addressed in instructions given by the Court which were simply either unobjected to or objected to in such a way as to be insufficient under Rule 51. 
    And, third, any other issues, other issues that have been discussed here this morning simply aren't raised by the cert petition. 
    In this case, the policy, the case was submitted to the jury in the court's instructions on three separate theories; one, that the shooting itself was justified under the policies of the City of Oklahoma City. 
    As I was interested in Mr. Bailey's concession that if they'd a shoot to kill, shoot on suspicion policy, that that would have been... would not have passed constitutional muster and would have been a basis for liability, and that's precisely what the evidence showed at the trial. 
    The chief of police testified, and it was a matter of evidence, it was a matter of factual issue that was resolved against the City, that the officer was entitled to shoot on the basis of suspicion, if he had any suspicion that his life was in danger. 
    Very briefly, the facts, as opposed to being in a light most favorable to the City, in a light most favorable to Mr. Tuttle, who prevailed in the trial court, showed that Mr. Rotramel did go into the bar and was advised... was not a dark bar, but it was a well-lit bar... that he was advised upon entering the bar, he asked about an armed robbery, the bartender, another bartender advised him that there was no armed robbery in progress.

    How it was portrayed to you or to some judge is not as important as how the jury viewed him.

    Well, of course, that's, in my view, the purpose of Rule 51. 
    You know, we have to object to the instructions, object to the problems, and properly preserve the error, and it's simply not properly preserved. 
    I mean the only objection to the instructions that's in the record, and I take issue with the statements about matters that occurred outside the record, the only instruction that's in... the only objection that's in the instruction is quoted in full at footnote 62 at page 45 of our brief. 
    We make a second objection, Your Honor, particularly to the one, the Oklahoma City language, the language in the light of the City of Oklahoma City, which is the single occurrence language. 
    That is simply the only matter that was objected to in the trial court and preserved for review, and I don't think that preserves anything.

    Yes. 
    Especially in... in any event, yes. 
    And the issue is even narrower. 
    The issue is what is presented by the cert question, and the issue comes down to, as I see it, whether or not... whether we have to prove the one free bite theory; whether a single incident, taken together with training, an independent proof of a policy is sufficient.

    Mr. Hughes, it seemed to me that basically the theory proceeded on by the Plaintiffs below was that an isolated incident, plus evidence of the training that was given police officers, was enough to establish the liability here. 
    And what that argument boils down to, as far as I can understand it, is that other procedures in terms of training a police officer would have reduced the likelihood that Officer Rotramel would have used excessive force.

    I don't know. 
    In any event, the theory presented to the Court at this time by the City is that Rotramel departed by City policy. 
    The theory presented in the trial court was that Rotramel's actions were in complete compliance with City policy. 
    They have changed their theory as they proceeded through the appellate level. 
    The long and short of it is, the matter was properly instructed on in our view, the evidence was submitted to the jury, the jury resolved the factual issues against the City of Oklahoma City, properly so. 
    There is just nothing before the Court at the present time to properly preserve for resolution.
