Winston v. Lee
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="13.060">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in Winston against Lee. 
    Mr. Garrett, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Stacy F. Garrett, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1982, Rudolph Lee attempted to rob a supermarket, and for his efforts received a bullet in his shoulder. 
    The only witness to that shooting was the victim, who returned fire and put the bullet in Mr. Lee's shoulder. 
    The Commonwealth of Virginia is seeking to recover that bullet from Mr. Lee's shoulder as corroborative evidence in his prosecution for attempted robbery and for the shooting of the store owner who shot Mr. Lee. 
    In my petition for certiorari, I asked the Court to establish for the first time a standard by which all courts, particularly our Court, can have to determine when and when not surgery can be mandated upon a defendant in a criminal case to recover from his body evidence that would be used in the prosecution of that person for a crime which it is alleged that he committed.

    Mr. Stacy F. Garrett, III 
    Yes, sir, I do. 
    Historically in Virginia, in Richmond in particular, one on one situations where the only eye witness is the victim, juries have been very, very reluctant to convict if it only gets one man's word against the other. 
    In this case it is more complicated because Lee claims that shortly after or at the same time the alleged robbery took place, he himself was the victim of a robbery some eight to ten blocks away, and claims that is how he received the bullet wound when the people robbed him.

    I recently had a case where there were three witnesses in a situation like that, and the jury came back and found the defendant not guilty, claiming that particular reason.

    Mr. Stacy F. Garrett, III 
    Somewhat. 
    Yes, ma'am. 
    If the bullet were located next to his heart, or in some cases if it were in his spine or in a joint where the removal would cause a possibility for that joint not to be used any more, or could cause some real serious harm to the defendant, I don't think the state should be entitled to have the bullet. 
    But when you have the situation here, the bullet is right under his collarbone, and his doctor, Dr. Mendez-Picon, and the anesthesiologist, Dr. Boyan, have both palpated the bullet, and can feel it right from the surface. 
    There has been a hang-up in some of the cases between major surgery and minor surgery. 
    I think it can be simplified. 
    In the words of Dr. Mendez-Picon, this is a simple operation.

    He has performed many of these, and his hospital has never lost... where this is going to go, has never lost a single patient for this type of surgery. 
    Minor surgery done with general anesthesia is now the common trend. 
    It is done because it is quicker, it is easier for the surgeon, it is less painful for the person undergoing the surgery. 
    As Dr. Boyan says, they go in at 10:00 o'clock in the morning, and they are out by 3:00.

    It could be taken out with a very light anesthesia.

    --That is an artful term, ma'am, and it is hard to say. 
    What one person says is minor... I think if the medical people say it is minor. 
    To a school teacher, going in and having your oil changed might be a major operation, but for a mechanic it is simple. 
    It is a very minor thing, but for her it is not, or him, if the school teacher is a man. 
    It makes no difference.

    I claim I came from an attempted robbery. 
    The Commonwealth claims that he came from... or I tried to rob somebody else. 
    Does he get to keep that at no risk to himself because the doctors say that keeping the bullet in him right now will have no effect on him, you know, life-threatening one way or the other. 
    On the other hand, the balance must be considered what right do the citizens of the country have, or Richmond, to have evidence to be used in a criminal trial?

    --I am not sure the record contains much. 
    I think it is my experience as a prosecutor that it is very probative. 
    Here we have, in this case the lab has bullets taken from Mr. Watkinson's gun that can be compared against the bullet. 
    I have checked with the ballistician about it, and they are ready, if the bullet is taken out from Mr. Lee, to compare it. 
    It is something... it is more important for the jury to put their hands on. 
    Instead of saying on the one hand, here is Mr. Watkinson, this man tried to rob me, and over here we have Mr. Lee, who says, I didn't try to rob you, or if he stands mute, one man's word against another, we have something the jury can put their hands on. 
    It is like a fingerprint. 
    We can show, yes, this is the man who robbed you. 
    Or, most importantly, perhaps, perhaps that bullet didn't come from Rudolph Lee's gun... or Mr. Watkinson's gun, and if that is the case, then for two years now a robber, somebody who did shoot him, has been running around free, because we have been trying to get the wrong person.

    I don't think it would probably be in perfect condition. 
    They tell us that when a bullet comes into the body like that, like sand into an oyster shell, it forms a protective coating around it, and the ex-rays show that the bullet, which is not fragmented, has got dents slightly in the nose of it, but otherwise it is intact. 
    The bullet has not disintegrated.

    He has never testified, and his counsel has never said, my client doesn't want the surgery because, for whatever reason. 
    The Crowder case is the only one that has reached the Circuit Court level other than this case, and in that case, which this Court refused to grant certiorari in, said that the extent of the surgical intrusion and the extent of the risk to defendant is the extent of reasonableness that we have to decide. 
    Intrusion in this case is approximately one inch below the surface in an operation that is characterized by the doctor as simple. 
    The anesthesiologist said, as soon as he is asleep and under, the operation would be over with, and he will be ready to go back to his jail cell or wherever they are keeping him.

   Argument of Joseph Ryland Winston
speaker="joseph_ryland_winston" startTime="1237.722" stopTime="1259.437">
    Mr. Joseph Ryland Winston 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I noted Justice White had asked the question, what if there is a general anesthesia to be used in this case. 
    That is, of course, a matter that there is no question about because we have a stipulation on that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1259.437" stopTime="1264.730">
    Justice White 
    I knew that that is what was proposed, a general anesthetic.
speaker="joseph_ryland_winston" startTime="1264.730" stopTime="1371.989">
    Mr. Joseph Ryland Winston 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I just didn't want there to be any question about that. 
    In regard to the risks, Mr. Garrett has suggested this morning that the Medical College of Virginia has never lost a patient in a minor procedure of this sort. 
    I don't believe that that assertion is supported by the record. 
    If my recollection is correct, there are some mortality statistics quoted on a study done at the Medical College of Virginia, and the mortality statistic was greater than zero, and that means that somebody has died. 
    So I don't believe that that assertion would be supported by the record. 
    I believe that the test that is being urged on the Court by the petitioners is simply a major-minor surgery distinction. 
    I think at Page 12 of the petitioners' brief petitioners flat out state, if the medical personnel characterize the surgery as minor, no constitutional violation; if the medical personnel characterize the surgery as major, then constitutional violation. 
    And even if the reasonableness test as opposed to the per se test is the proper test for the Court to adopt, I don't think the Court can adopt that position of having the Court simply delegate to a witness the ultimate question before it, and particularly a question of constitutional magnitude. 
    Any reasonableness test, I think, is a balance. 
    I think that there has first got to be a need, and secondly, the inquiry has to go to the invasion of the privacy or the affront to the dignity of the individual and the risk.

    Mr. Joseph Ryland Winston 
    I think that would create a great deal of confusion, because what we have here, the petitioners are urging this major-minor surgery distinction on the Court, but in this case it is not so clear, major-minor surgery. 
    There is a difference of medical opinion. 
    Dr. Mendez-Picon has come up with this kind of an intermediate category which is called minor surgery but under a general anesthetic. 
    I think in just looking at my attorney's textbook or attorney's dictionary, medical dictionary, I think under the definition of minor... major surgery... excuse me... one of the factors that they... one of the indicia that they point to in determining whether it is major or minor or how to characterize it is the presence of inhalation anesthesia, which will, of course, be present should the procedure go forward in this case.

    But the California Appellate Court has held that... they denied surgery. 
    The defendant's attempt to get into the complaining witness body to recover the bullets, they denied, but in so doing they held that the Fourth Amendment rights of witnesses and the Fourth Amendment rights of defendants were the same.

    Ohio Bureau of Employment Services against Fidori, that was a case involving a state agency action. 
    The state agency was the defendant in a class action suit in the District Court. 
    They raised Younger abstention, even though it was a state agency case and not a criminal case. 
    The District judge decided against them. 
    The case was appealed to this Court. 
    They invoked the jurisdiction of this Court and did not raise the Younger question, and the holding here, which I believe was unanimous, was that the rationale of comity does not apply when they have submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the Court. 
    They had the chance to challenge the order, and did not challenge it.

    It is difficult to tell whether they raised the question or not, because they never filed any pleadings.

    Ruled against them on the Younger question. 
    Then they took it to the Fourth Circuit, did not present Younger, and then they brought it here and have not presented Younger. 
    But in addition there are other reasons why Younger I don't believe is applicable, why I think the District Court was correct in its ruling. 
    Now, I have heard something here this morning for the first time, and that is that they have made the replicate firings from Mr. Watkinson's gun, in other words, they have shot it and looked at it, and now they know that it has grooves on it that can be compared. 
    All I can say is that there is nothing in the record to that effect. 
    They had the firearms identification expert testify in the state court. 
    No evidence to that effect was brought forward at that time, and this is the first I have heard of it.

    Mr. Joseph Ryland Winston 
    Well, that's in the evidence in this case. 
    I asked the firearms identification expert, can you tell right now whether it is identifiable or not? 
    No. 
    And then whether you have the bullet to make the comparison with, the replicate firing from Mr. Watkinson's gun, that is only half the story, because then you go back to the questioned specimen. 
    Now, that questioned specimen could have been damaged on its entry into the body, and in fact Dr. Mendez-Picon did testify, printed at Page 34 of the Joint Appendix, that it was damaged in hitting the collarbone. 
    It retained its cylindrical state, but it was damaged somewhat. 
    It was bent. 
    So, there has been some damage to the bullet that we know about in its entry. 
    And then the firearms identification expert testified that the length, the deterioration to the bullet from the bodily fluids is positively correlated with the passage of time. 
    He could not testify as to any particular rate at which that deterioration would occur, but there is a positive correlation, and furthermore, since he knew the gun was a.32 caliber revolver, he says, well, that pretty much limits you to a lead bullet, and that is apparently the softest substance out of which bullets are made, and I think his wording was that they deteriorate much faster. 
    And so, I think it is entirely speculative as to whether or not there is going to be any possibility to identify that bullet after two and a half years, and if the bullet after two and a half years, and if the bullet comes cut and it is not identifiable, they have nothing more than what they have now, and they can show... they bring in the doctor and show that he was treated for a gunshot wound, and bring in the doctor and say, here's the ex-ray, this little white spot is the bullet, and do that whether or not they are allowed to comment upon the refusal to allow the surgery.

    Was there any cross examination about what his medical history on surgery had been up to that time?
speaker="joseph_ryland_winston" startTime="2606.280" stopTime="2633.437">
    Mr. Joseph Ryland Winston 
    The only thing in the record, I believe, is that for reasons I don't know he has had two previous anesthesias without untoward consequences. 
    But again, moving over from the need aspect to the invasion of the privacy, the affront to dignity, and the risks involved--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2633.437" stopTime="2643.325">
    Chief Justice Burger 
    Do you think the invasion of privacy is fundamentally different from what it was in Schmerber, extracting blood?
speaker="joseph_ryland_winston" startTime="2643.325" stopTime="2792.211">
    Mr. Joseph Ryland Winston 
    --It is the same in kind, but much greater in magnitude. 
    I mean, in Schmerber, we are talking about a penetration that is something along the order of the tip of this pen, and now we are talking about, if Dr. Mendez-Picon's opinion is correct, we are talking about an incision five centimeters long and three centimeters deep, a many, many, many times greater intrusion. 
    And, of course, I don't think any physician-patient relationship is ordinarily necessary in the withdrawal of blood. 
    In other words, I think for Schmerber, one thing Schmerber required in the blood case was appropriate personnel. 
    I think appropriate personnel in blood withdrawal is a technician or a nurse. 
    For the type of surgery that was originally contemplated in this case, that is, when it was part of that class of case, that I have styled the "just beneath the skin cases", where it is in the fatty tissue, and they make a small incision under local anesthesia and just basically pop it out, for that kind of... I think the reading of the cases shows that for that kind of operation, you don't even need... you don't need to go to the hospital. 
    You just go to the doctor's office, and the doctor doesn't even have to be a surgeon. 
    But in this case, not only does he have to go to the hospital, he has to have a surgeon, and not only does he have to have a surgeon, but he has to have the separate doctor who is the anesthesiologist. 
    And I think that the invasion of privacy and affront to dignity, I don't see how it could be any greater than when the doctor is actually going to be breathing for the man. 
    At 135 in the appendix, Dr. Royan says, 
    "If you get to be anesthetized, then you don't breath so deep. " 
    "You see, in order to bring you to normal breathing, I will just squeeze the bag a little bit. " 
    "That expands your chest. " 
    "Otherwise, if I am not there, you know, you give anesthesia, you just walk off, you know, then the doctor has to be there to take care of the patient when he is under anesthesia. " 
    Question: 
    "What would happen if he weren't exchanging with sufficient frequency and there is nobody there? " 
    "Well, then, eventually he will die. "

    He was in jail in lieu of $30,000 bond. 
    I filed a supplemental brief Monday to inform the Court that his incarceration status had changed. 
    He had a previously suspended imposition of sentence on another felony charge from 1977 or '79, and the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond issued an order to show cause why that suspension should not be revoked, alleging as the sole ground the offenses for which he is awaiting trial and to which the surgery in this case relates, and they had the hearing. 
    Mr. Watkinson testified. 
    Sentence was... suspension was revoked, and now he is doing a ten-year term in the Virginia Penitentiary.

    Mr. Stacy F. Garrett, III 
    Just briefly, Your Honor. 
    I want to make sure that everyone understands that the Commonwealth's position is not that the bullet is strictly cumulative. 
    It is the most reliable evidence that we have. 
    We have... an argument can be made by Mr. Lee that the identification at the time after the shooting in the emergency room was of a man who had just been shot, and can we rely on that? 
    But if we have the bullet, that is the most reliable evidence that exists that is going to show whether or not Mr. Lee is guilty of the crime with which he is charged.

    Justice Marshall indicated sometimes that you can't tell from the bullet whether or not the lens and grooves are there until after you get it. 
    It is the same situation in Schmerber. 
    They take the vial of blood, and it is broken before it gets to the laboratory. 
    The argument can be made that that is a waste. 
    It is not the same.

    --I don't think you could, sir, because the time, the passage of time, the evidence of intoxication was dissipated, and the alcohol wouldn't be in the blood, especially if it were a day or so afterwards. 
    The Fourth Amendment doesn't preclude all searches, only those that are unreasonable. 
    I think the Commonwealth has shown through the evidence that it is reasonable in this case to subject Mr. Lee to the surgery, and I would ask this Court to allow me to do that.
