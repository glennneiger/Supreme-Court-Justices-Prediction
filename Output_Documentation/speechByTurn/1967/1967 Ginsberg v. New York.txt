Ginsberg v. New York
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="15.242">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 47, Sam Ginsberg, Appellant, versus New York. 
    Mr. Redfield.
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="15.242" stopTime="137.898">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court of the State of New York which affirmed a conviction of the appellant for having violated Section 484-h of the Penal Law of the State of New York. 
    Since the Highest Court of the State of New York, the Court of Appeals did not take this case for review, the Appellate Term as the Court in which -- it was a final court in which a judgment could be had. 
    And this judgment raises several important and noble questions. 
    And the first one is, was there on its face and in its operation, is Section 484-h of the Penal Law repugnant to the constitution, the amendment -- First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment because it acts as a restraint upon expression. 
    The second question is, is the statute vague and overbroad by its terms and its standards if it has meaningful standards? 
    And third, is this publication or before publications involved within the scope of the statute in other words, was the Act validly applied to this particular plaint -- appellant. 
    I should say at the outset Your Honors --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="137.898" stopTime="145.211">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Whether it was in this -- within the scope of the statute just that question isolate it is a matter of state law, isn't it?
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="145.211" stopTime="153.912">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Well, I mean constitutionally. 
    In other words of these -- is this particular magazine for example --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="153.912" stopTime="157.311">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Within the scope of the statute that's a matter of state law, New York law.
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="157.311" stopTime="168.687">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Was in the scope but as applied, as the statute has been applied and construed with respect to this particular publication can you condemn this appellant.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="168.687" stopTime="177.522">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, does the constitution permits you to do what the state did with respect to that publication regardless of what the statute says, that's our question as to --
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="177.522" stopTime="504.992">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Yes, that's in it. 
    I should say at the outset Your Honors that if this weren't a criminal conviction and I had a choice in the matter I would have not -- confining the issue solely to the first question because I think the issue was right. 
    And not only is it right but I think it is imperative that a decision be reached on that point even if the appellant can be victorious on any of the other points. 
    I think Your Honors, should at this time undertake the task of putting – address this question which has caused so many uncertainties and so much debate. 
    And the question comes down to this, whether the power of the state maybe exercised to punish a person who sells certain publications enumerated in the statute to persons based on the age of the reader or the purchaser. 
    And I say too that the basic question -- that basic question falls unto two categories. 
    The first, as a matter of principle, is it repugnant to the constitution and secondly, that by its operation in effect as a pragmatic question, does it intimidate the vendor and publisher of books to the point where it become censorship? 
    In other words, the second question to be clear is similar to the question that was raised and decided in Smith against California. 
    Smith against California you recall was a purely practical decision because the Court found that under the circumstances of the operation of the statute intimidation resulted was its consequent censorship. 
    Now, the court below and -- meaning the Appellate Term in writing for affirmance wrote nothing and the Court of Appeals also stated nothing but I suspect from the argument that went on that it's determination came about because of the case of the Bookcase against Broderick which was decided about a year ago in the Court of Appeals of the State of New York in which I brought to this Court. 
    The Bookcase decision rested on a dictum in the Jacobellis case and also rested on the dissenting language in People against Bookcase in which case, a prior law had been rendered unconstitutional by the Highest Court of New York. 
    So at this point, I cannot give you the ultimate construction of the statute as rendered in this case but can only refer you to what was said in Bookcase against Broderick. 
    My appellant who received the suspended sentence is not a flamboyant vendor nor a self-seeking or say like charging along in the rights of free speech. 
    He is just the poor, simple, humble owner of a candy store or stationary store or a newspaper (Inaudible) that sort of a place that is so common throughout this country. 
    He has this little store which of size 70 by -- seven by 30 feet in the little village of Bellmore, Long Island, New York. 
    And he works from morning to late at night with his wife to eat out in existence. 
    And it's so much though, that he had to shut the store for about three days during the pendency of the trial under this case. 
    And as I said, he sells almost everything that that type of a store sells and as part of it, he carries about 200 titles of magazines. 
    He has no choice in these titles, they are sent to him automatically by the jobbers.

    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    That's in the record but not as a tie-in and not -- is not developed to that extent but it is developed to the extent what -- which we properly know in the field and that is that he doesn't order these magazines, they just come to him from the distributor. 
    Now, the charge against him was on October 18th, 1965 he sold two magazines, one called Mr. Annual and the other is Sarah this thing and if Your Honors recall just a few months ago as I can recall, you had this particular title before you in the case of Gent versus Arkansas which I argued here.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What's the title?
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="575.010" stopTime="657.527">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Sarah is in the name of the magazine. 
    It's not the same issue as involved in Gent but it's of similar publication, it's a girly type of magazine that in nearly date we used to call them Police Gazette Magazines. 
    And now they call it “Girly” and then there was another charge against him. 
    Then on October 26, 1965, he sold magazine called “Man to Man” an escapade to a similar type of magazines. 
    And it should be observed, why -- of course he sold them to this boy of 16 years of age. 
    It should be observed that the charge here is only that these pictures contain nudes and I should -- that the magazines contained pictures that were nudes and that these were harmful to minors. 
    That's all the charge is and I emphasize it because you will see in a few minutes that the judge made findings which extended beyond that charge.

    No, I'm not asking to review it but you could only take on the findings upon which he was charged, Cole against Arkansas situation, he was only charged with a certain crime. 
    It can only be found under that charge.

    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    At the time of the trial, the defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute on its face and he was overruled and was convicted, the Appellate Terms they said before affirmed and the Court of Appeals refused to review.

    I think there are more important issues in this case.

    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    No, I'm not waiving it. 
    Since as I've said before he was convicted of a crime, I can't waive it. 
    I'd rely upon it as the last straw. 
    The judge after the trial made the following finding that the boy was 16 years of age and that the defendant knew or had reason to know that he was under 17 years of age and all the magazines in question contained pictures of nudes. 
    And then he made a charge -- finding that the magazine Escapade and Mr. Annual contain variable descriptions and narrative accounts of sexual excitement and sexual conduct, so you see, there alone, it goes beyond the charge.

speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="984.401" stopTime="1253.586">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    I remember that but I haven't -- you know I should men -- it should be pointed out too that this statute is directed at those who sell the magazines for a monetary consideration. 
    In other words, if it were given away, the person couldn't be guilty of the crime but if he got money for it, it made a big difference. 
    And the reason I emphasize this is so that you could see that there is something wrong with the statute right off because if the purpose of the statute is to restrict the promiscuous circulation of this type of magazine to those under 17 they certainly haven't attained that even in the text because it can be distributed to those who will not pay a monetary consideration. 
    In other words, if one of Tom Sawyer's crowd came along and offered a bookseller an apple, that would be alright? 
    But if he got ten cents for it, he can go to jail for a year. 
    Now, of course we all would like to have the best of literature for the children and I would say also for adults and perhaps if I were an emperor, I would say there are certain 25 books that everybody can't -- may read and that would be it but since I'm not an emperor and I do not care to tell anybody what they may read, I have serious doubt as to whether or not there was great wisdom in this law. 
    And also point out the fact that several of the amicus in this case as well as the Columbia law review had found some solace in the recent Gold case in which children's right to read should be considered and protected because children wished to be free of the orthodoxy of adults. 
    But -- and this relates too to the observation made earlier today that children do not have freedom of speech as much as adult. 
    Therefore, they're not protected by the constitution. 
    I seriously doubt if the basis for the protection of the constitution rest on the freedom of choice of children that is that the assumption made by Mr. Justice Stewart that because adults have a greater freedom of choice therefore the children have to be protected. 
    Well, I'm not so sure that adults have that free to choice. 
    My opinion, people are great imitators, adult also sheep like everybody else and the tendency is to follow the leader. 
    I think the gist of the First Amendment is not that there is a freedom of choice in the (Inaudible) as there is a freedom of expression and the speaker was a writer or the publisher, that's what we're protecting. 
    There's nothing in the constitution that speaks of the audience.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well then where does that lead you in this case then the police power of the state can operate within reasonable limits but without any special reference to the First Amendment. 
    I'm trying to understand you --
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="1340.891" stopTime="1349.522">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Well, here -- what my protection is here is the protection of the vendor which is the same as the First Amendment speech.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1349.522" stopTime="1372.317">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What you're saying then is that the protective interest, your submission is that the constitution protects not the child's right to read but the vendor's right to sell and the author's derivative right to turn out this store?
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="1372.317" stopTime="1373.485">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Yes. 
    Well --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And so you relinquish any argument based upon the right of children or of adults for that not to read?
speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="1382.779" stopTime="1510.761">
    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Right. 
    Well, I meant that in this respect, I said that there were others who went further than I did in this case, the amicus and the (Inaudible) law review who say that the Gold case protects the right of the reader or the child in this case but I wasn't pressing that issue, I on other hand was protecting the right of the vendor or the expresser of any idea. 
    So, I'd say this that the burden of proof as we know are the restraint on speech is of really a very heavy one and the burden is that of the state who would like to -- who would restrain this right. 
    But in anticipation -- in other words, I could say let's wait in here from the state and see what they have to say on their side. 
    But in anticipation of that, I would like to raise these questions, where is this authority derived? 
    The constitution says, there shall be no abridgement to speech and then Roth, you said, “Well, so far as obscenity is concerned there has been a history although some have debated that history to respect you Justice Brennan”. 
    And the -- so the question comes up, “Where in the constitution can you justify a restraint based upon the age of the reader?” 
    And I for myself cannot find such authority.

    I argued in my brief that these objectives are not attained because the younger children could get them from elders, they can always find them around. 
    Secondly, what is even worst in order to prosecute anybody you'd have to do what you did in this case and that is involved the youngsters in the criminal court. 
    The youngster in this case was acted as a decoy in the case that was specially framed for the purposes of enforcing this law. 
    And of all the most remarkable things that I know of that an amicus brief in this case in opposition to my position the citizens with decent literature took the very same position that this law cannot be enforced and its worst than if there were no such law because the debasement of the child is a factor that is worst than the literature that they could read.

    The defendant did violate the provisions of the said Section 484-h subdivision 2(b) of the Penal Law and that the defendant knowingly -- did knowingly sell to a minor a magazine which and taken as a whole is harmful to minors and I submit Your Honors that this applies to the written as well as to the pictorial part of the magazine. 
    I believe that the major issue on this appeal is whether a state may consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment enact the law founded upon the variable obscenity concept prohibiting the commercial distribution to children under 17 years of age of materials obscene as to such children although not necessarily obscene as to adults. 
    And whether the statute in question Section 484-h of the Penal Law of the State of New York is a valid children's obscenity law whether its phraseology is sufficiently definite.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Out of the clear blue?
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="1887.208" stopTime="2035.601">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    Well, the legislature found it in its wisdom that the obscenity statute in reference to 484-h should apply to those under 17 and perhaps for different reasons in the State of Texas found that it should apply to those under 16 for the reason that -- the states have considerate 21 to be the age for qualified voting rather than 15, 16, 17 or 18. 
    I have no definite reason to give you as to why the state legislature saw fit to limit its exercise over children to the age of 17 rather than 16 or to 18 or to 19 or to any other age for that matter. 
    And if I may continue, the question is whether or not the statute's phraseology is sufficiently definite to satisfy the minimum requirements of due process as they relate to obscenity and whether its scienter clause is objectionable or exerting an undue restraint on commercial distribution to adults of materials within the prohibition of 484-h. 
    484-h, a violation of which was punishable as a misdemeanor is a children's obscenity law validly based on the variable obscenity concept approved by this Court in Mishkin against New York. 
    It was characterized as a children's obscenity law by New York's Highest Court, the Court of Appeals in the Bookcase Incorporated against Broderick case and this Court of course held in Mishkin that it will accept such a characterization. 
    I submit that the Court of Appeals characterization is correct since the statute's definition of harmful to minors includes the elements of this Court's definition of obscenity that is predominant, appeal to prurient interest, patent, offensiveness and absence of social importance with slight adjustments of wording necessary to relate and confined its prohibiting reach to children.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I've just looked at these magazines. 
    I think you'd agree limiting this now to the pictures for the moment that magazines precisely like this in the context of obscenity determinations of distribution to adults have been held by this Court in number of cases now to be not obscene.
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="2063.264" stopTime="2064.411">

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So, you got to say that although in their distribution to adults they are not obscene. 
    Nevertheless, we should fashion a principle that in their distribution to children under 17 they are obscene, is that it?
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="2081.246" stopTime="2121.169">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    Even though it does not -- it is not obscene as to adults and adults in this particular statute are not bound by the rigid concepts established by the statute. 
    The Court of Appeals decided in the Broderick case rightly it is submitted that children were a recipient group within the Mishkin doctrine because they are the group to whom the objectionable material is directed or from whom it's quarantined. 
    The Court may judicially notice I submit that these materials including girly magazines are directed to children.

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2251.258" stopTime="2251.640">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright.
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="2251.640" stopTime="2580.255">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    There's no question about that. 
    Now, I think that the Mishkin case holds that it will accept the characterization as placed upon the statute by the Court of Appeals. 
    And I have already mentioned the basis of the Court of Appeals characterization. 
    In the Mishkin and Ginzburg cases, I think that very frankly that the Court has noticed the prurient interest of these so-called girly magazines. 
    And in Mishkin, no psychiatric testimony or the light was presented to show that the material in question appealed to the prurient interest of pseudo masochist. 
    However, 484-h could've exercised its regulatory effect constitutionally even if it were not an obscenity law and thus the question of whether the state's proof in this case satisfy the obscenity criteria of 484-h is not a federal question eligible for decision by this Court. 
    Since the people's proof shows beyond a reasonable doubt sailed with the requisite scienter of nude photo magazine, nude photo magazines to a 16-year-old boy. 
    It has proved all that need to be proved to justify criminal punishment on constitutional grounds where the attribute of sovereignty on which the prosecution and statute is founded is the state's power as parens patriae for the benefit of children. 
    Since 484-h is an obscenity law, I don't believe the appellant can raise the First Amendment objections through it since under this Court's holding in the Roth against the United States case, obscenity is not protected -- is not protected expression. 
    The scienter provision knowingly is not invalid on its face because it will not restrict by indirect effect the flow of protected material to adults within the rationale of Smith against California. 
    This is so because most adults are patently over the age limit set out in 484-h under 17 years of age. 
    Thus dealers will not withhold sale to adults and will not fail to make a sale where the adult is a customer. 
    Moreover, the law provides for the defensive honest mistake as to age. 
    It follows that the deal who has made inquiry as to age and receive reassurance will rot -- will rely on the honest mistake provision and will not hesitate to sell to an adult at all even if the dealer has not examined the working question. 
    In the few situations where age is in doubt, the buyer to whom allegedly the dealer might be hesitant to sell in the absence of an honest mistake provision as to age will usually not be an adult but instead will be a youngster. 
    Indeed, most youngsters in this marginal age group are so young that they have been included in 4 -- that they could've have been included in 484-h's prohibition without giving constitutional offense. 
    Thus, indirect restriction on distribution to them does not raise federal questions since they could be denied access by direct prohibition, it's constitutionally indifferent whether the state has instead contrived this accepts -- acceptable denial of access by indirect means. 
    There is nothing constitutionally objectionable in placing the burden of judgment on the book dealer and to require him to determine if the material sold by him comes within the prohibited class. 
    In Mishkin, this Court approved the New York statute namely Section 118 -- 44 of Penal Law the old Section 1141, excuse me, which it viewed as placing the same burden of judgment on book dealers as on publishers. 
    Appellants claimed in this regard a vagueness argument in disguise. 
    But this Court in effect has held that the definitions of obscenity in Roth against United States, Manual Enterprises against Day, Jacobellis against Ohio and the Mishkin, Ginzburg and Fanny Hill cases are adequate. 
    It follows that the definitions in 484-h give sufficiently definite noticed of what materials are within its prohibition and do not place an excessive burden on the deal.

    You've got to go beyond that, don't you, to take care of this particular case and say that two things are outside of the protection of the First Amendment. 
    Number one, the Roth type of thing as embellished by subsequent cases and number two, something that is less than Roth in the case of children, don't you have to take that position?
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="2636.340" stopTime="2665.858">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    No, I -- Mr. Justice Fortas, I agree that these magazines if sold to adults would not constitute a violation of any obscenity statute. 
    However, taking these magazines insofar as children are concerned I submit that they are obscene -- that they have been held obscene by our State's Highest Court in accordance with definitions set forth in Roth and the other cases with changes in phraseology limiting its application to children.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2665.858" stopTime="2710.445">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And your state's -- from your state courts might have held that over and over again.But by on the basis of a colloquy between you and Mr. Justice Brennan, this Court would have to say that these particular magazines here are within the protection of the First Amendment if you relied only on Roth and our decisions today. 
    Now what you're asking us to do and I perhaps you have to ask us to do is to come out with another category. 
    Category restricted to statutes dealing with children.
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="2710.445" stopTime="2710.944">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    Well, this is the --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    (Inaudible) in the statute, I certainly (Voice Overlap) --

speaker="william_cahn" startTime="2716.612" stopTime="2727.080">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    I believe that this is the variable concept doctrine Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    I maybe mistaken but I believe this concept definitely applies in this particular situation.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2727.080" stopTime="2761.946">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, what is the -- what would you add to the Roth definition or subtract on the Roth definition in the case of children or why do you say that these magazines although by hypothesis would not be held obscene in the case of adults should be held to be within the First Amendment -- it should be held outside of the First Amendment protection in the case of children?
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="2761.946" stopTime="2787.582">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    Because taken as a whole these magazines are harmful to minors as our statute specifically states. 
    That the magazines in question, these magazines although not obscene to -- insofar as adults are concern when taken into consideration in the juvenile area are harmful to minors.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2787.582" stopTime="2797.597">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And what -- and we have to sustain that as being sufficiently precise and not too broad or too vague for First Amendment purposes?
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="2797.597" stopTime="2835.894">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    Yes, because harmful -- the terms in the statute are very explicitly explained each and every term used, nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, sadomasochistic abuse, harmful to minors and prurient interest and so forth. 
    Each and every item to which the statute refers is clearly defined by the statute. 
    And the changes to which I refer making the overall magazine harmful to minors is that which I asked to this Court to take in to consideration to accept.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    They were obscenity convictions and a fine had been paid and we dismissed the cases as moot.

    Mr. William Cahn 
    Well certainly let me say this from myself. 
    If I had a misdemeanor conviction upon my record and I had the opportunity to have it erased, I would seek every available pathway toward that end.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That doesn't answer whether or not those other cases are not precedents for dismissing this is moot.

    Mr. William Cahn 
    I can't talk without seeing the cases themselves Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    I asked you to forgive me because I just don't know the cases into which --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3407.367" stopTime="3417.667">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    There would be a different proposition I suppose if this suspended -- if these sentences could be imposed. 
    But if this --
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="3417.667" stopTime="3417.911">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    There is no sentence --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3417.911" stopTime="3418.618">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The case is over.
speaker="william_cahn" startTime="3418.618" stopTime="3496.726">
    Mr. William Cahn 
    -- to be imposed Mr. Justice White. 
    The case insofar as punishment is concerned is completely over it. 
    And may I conclude by restating that it is perhaps impossible to determine or measure cause in the realm of social affairs. 
    It is especially difficult to determine with certainty whether exposure to certain types of influences gradually shapes character or morals in given ways since such shaping force such -- since such shaping force works unobtrusively and does not manifest itself on dramatic incidents of cause and effect. 
    Thus, persons who demand certain scientific proof maybe asking the impossible. 
    Constitutional adjudication must be content with a lower order of demonstration or the community will be rendered helpless to protect itself against influences which common knowledge and much expert opinion brands is dangerous. 
    It should not be made to run the risk or to give itself to give itself to the uncertain rhythms of scientific progress.

    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    The few minutes, as to the question of mootness Your Honors on the very day that you dismissed those other cases, one was the Tannenbaum case and the -- I forgot the name of the other one. 
    This case was granted review and the year had not passed under New York law in which there could be execution under that sentence. 
    So, well I'm not prepared --

    That --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3564.648" stopTime="3572.342">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I gathered from the state's presentation that once that sentence was suspended, that was the end of the case --

    No, I wouldn't go along with that because it's a very same statute you had in the Tannenbaum case and in the other case --

    Yes, yes, right. 
    But that wasn't the gist of the decision. 
    The gist was that there could still have been execution within the year's time and while it may -- perhaps at this moment, I don't know.

    Mr. Emanuel Redfield 
    Yes. 
    I'll be happy to present that but before I terminate, I'd like to point out something that is substantive interest and that is the reliance here upon Mishkin. 
    I don't think this case has been disposed of by Mishkin. 
    First of all, in Mishkin you had a deviate class and it was not one of age. 
    In Mishkin, you have the books, the Court found that the books were directed toward this group and there were prurient appeal to that particular group. 
    He have an entirely different question of age, and Your Honor was very careful to point out to avoid Hicklin being revived by saying the following, “Since our holding requires that the recipient group be defined with more specificity than in terms of sexually immature persons, it also avoid the inadequacy of the most susceptible person facet of the Hicklin Rule”. 
    Thank you.
