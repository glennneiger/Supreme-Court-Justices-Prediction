Haynes v. United States
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="18.358">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No. 236, Miles Edward Haynes, Petitioner, versus United States. 
    Mr. Wright.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="18.358" stopTime="272.520">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday in the course of the Marchetti argument, someone asked Mr. Zeldes whether he regarded the Firearms Act as involving the same considerations as to wagering taxes and I was interested in that question because it's necessary for me to endeavor to persuade you that they're both unconstitutional. 
    I do think they involve somewhat different arguments. 
    The statutory schemes are totally dissimilar and as a result, I think, the considerations for the Court here are rather different from those involved in Marchetti and Grosso. 
    Indeed, as the party has developed the issues in their briefs, it would seem that really all that is involved here is a question of statutory construction because we are not fundamentally in disagreement on the constitutional issue except for its ubiquity use restriction argument, the Government concedes that if we have construed 5841, 5851 correctly that result is incriminatory. 
    It takes issue with our reading of those two sections of these very complicated and poorly drafted statutes. 
    I would like to go first to the second of the questions discussed by the United States and assume for the moment as every court, every lower court that has passed on the question has held that the requirement of registration in 5841 is itself unconstitutional. 
    I'd personally come back to argue that rather than simply to assume that at a later point. 
    If that is so, can you, as again the lower courts have held, nevertheless prosecute a person for possession of a firearm that has not been registered? 
    Here in petitioner's view that the answer is reasonably clear and the answer is one, apparently and importantly as statutory construction. 
    The United States reads 5851 as meaning that you can be prosecuted for possession of an unregistered firearm only if it is not been registered at anytime by any person so that if some prior possessor has registered it, they say that the present possessor is under no duty to register and therefore we're -- we aren't incriminating him or when we prosecuted. 
    This seems to me an extremely difficult reading of the statute to take in the light especially of the Treasury Regulation No. 179120, that requires registration unless it is registered to him. 
    It doesn't say that it's enough that it has been registered to somebody else. 
    It says he has to register unless it is registered to him. 
    And here, I think, the registration faithfully carries out the statutory purpose. 
    The provisions about 5841 seem to look to the present possessor. 
    They -- the first section -- sentence of 5841 says that every possessor has to register, but then the exception in the second sentence, you're not required to register with respect to a firearm which such a person acquired by transfer, importation or which such person made if the provisions of the chapter applied and if the provisions required thereto were complied with. 
    The focus here is on the possessor. 
    He is the "such person" to whom the statute is referring and it is talking about his acquisition by transfer or his making. 
    The -- it seems to -- in view of the petitioner that the United States has no support in the cases except the very recent ones that have drawn these torts distinction for the proposition that prior registration by somebody else dispenses with the requirement that the present possessor register.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Professor Wright, I have a -- and I had a difficulty with your argument in this respect perhaps because I don't understand it. 
    Let me put a simple proposition to you. 
    Let's assume that the law says that it is a crime to drive an automobile in the District of Columbia with an expired license plate. 
    Let's assume that the -- after March 31, 1967 I drove my automobile. 
    Now is it your position that thereafter, the -- I could not be compelled to buy a license or a new license for my automobile because that would incriminate me on account if I had possession of the automobile and drove it after a license had expired which is a crime.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="329.172" stopTime="337.725">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I don't understand, Mr. Justice Fortas how buying a new license would be an admission that you had driven the car at the time when your old license had expired.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="337.725" stopTime="350.299">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, under this -- under the Firearms Act, all you're saying as I understand it, when you register as I am now in possession of the firearm, is that right?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="350.299" stopTime="351.596">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Yes, that's right.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="351.596" stopTime="364.196">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Just as when I buy a new automobile license, what I'm saying is that I'm in possession of an automobile and I intend to drive it on the streets of the District of Columbia.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="364.196" stopTime="364.277">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I should --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="364.277" stopTime="431.120">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But that's where I have -- had a difficulty in understanding what I believe is the -- your basic argument, that is to say that if I register a firearm and say that I now possess the firearm, what respect does that imply that I have been in possession of it unlawfully here before you. 
    You have to have it in order to possess it, in order to apply for a license. 
    That's point one. 
    And point two, even if there might be some admission that for a moment of time or a month of time or a year of time I had it in my hot hands without having registered it, does that relieve me of the need to license it? 
    A man has to have it for sometime before he can apply for a license I assume.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="431.120" stopTime="441.341">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I suggest, Mr. Justice Fortas, that a closer analogy would be if you had a local statute providing that everyone who has stolen a car shall be required to buy a licensed plate for it.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="441.341" stopTime="444.847">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, you like that better and I like mine better.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="444.847" stopTime="452.221">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Well, but mine, I -- with great respect, it seems to me to come closer to the statutory pattern of the National Firearms Act.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="452.221" stopTime="483.918">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's exactly the point of difference, I -- you'd have to show me a little more clearly than I now see it that that is in fact the pattern in the Firearms Act. 
    Firearms Act does not as I see it say that you must register only those firearms which are in your possession unlawfully by a theft or otherwise. 
    It doesn't say that.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="483.918" stopTime="501.981">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I think, fairly read, it does with one minor exception because it says that if you acquire this lawful, if the transfer provisions of the law were complied with when it was transferred to you or if you made it and you complied with the making provisions of the law, then you do not have to register.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="501.981" stopTime="577.837">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And you're saying, because of the negative implication or the negative effect of that that the law has to be read as if it meant that you register only if it's in your possession unlawfully that is to say that previous owners have not register yet. 
    But I'm afraid that there are two, I sort of fall off the back in your bicycle which is rare because the difficulty is that it may be in my possession because of by reason of a gift, by reason of purchase, by some lawful reason and I'm totally ignorant as to whether it has or has not been registered. 
    That may not be an uncommon occurrence. 
    And certainly, I think you also have to look not only at what may possibly be the circumstances, and affected by the statute but the statutory scheme and intent, the -- in fact dramatic effect of the proposal.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="577.837" stopTime="606.877">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Oh, I'm glad if I could pull you back on my bicycle by endeavoring to analyze the statutory scheme as I have said. 
    It seems to me, Mr. Justice Fortas, that if you acquire this firearm that we are talking about by gift. 
    You are then required to register under 5841 unless the transfer provisions were complied with. 
    If they were complied with, you don't have to register. 
    If --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="606.877" stopTime="619.099">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why, why not? 
    Because that (Inaudible) -- suppose the provision is that you'd have to go through the making or the (Inaudible).
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="619.099" stopTime="620.551">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    And to collect the tax that's involved.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="620.551" stopTime="625.462">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, but at least the Secretary knows then where the gun is and who has it.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="625.462" stopTime="707.034">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Right. 
    But if these provisions have not been complied with, when the gun was given to Justice Fortas, then he is guilty of two crimes: First, if he doesn't register it, he has failed to register under 5841 and possesses an unregistered firearm contoured to the ban of 5851; and second, he is also the possessor of a firearm that has been transferred without the transfer provisions being complied with so that he could be prosecuted quite apart from the registration provision. 
    This, it seems to me, is the fundamental vice of the portion of the Firearms Act that we are attacking and our attack here is a very limited one. 
    It goes only to the registration provision. 
    The vice of it is that it is so unnecessary. 
    Indeed, it's only purpose seems to be to provide a means for a multiple sentences for a single transaction because in any instance in which a person may be prosecuted for possession of unregistered firearm, he may also be prosecuted for possession of a firearm which has been made or transferred without complying with the making or transfer provisions so that here, we are asking people to come forward and accuse themselves of crime to no good purpose. 
    Now, as I said earlier that there is a minor --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="707.034" stopTime="726.372">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Let's see, what's the crime? 
    Let's suppose again that I'm in possession of a firearm that is required to be registered and I have no knowledge of whether it has or has not been transferred. 
    Can I be prosecuted under this statute and for what?

    Let's suppose that I have registered it myself to see or I have filed registration.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, isn't that what we're talking -- and isn't that what we're talking about here. 
    The question is whether the act of registration is -- violates the Fifth Amendment, whether the act of registration would -- has an unnecessary incriminating tendency or effect. 
    Is that what we're - isn't that the issue before us?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="780.260" stopTime="781.772">

    And what I want to know is, if I acquire either by gift or by purchase a firearm that ought to be registered and I register it, and I have no knowledge or let's assume that I have no knowledge whether it has been transferred or purchased by a prior owner in violation of the Act. 
    What's -- what crime have I committed?

    Even though I have registered immediately, it comes into my possession. 
    You said that I'm guilty of it -- of a -- in violation of the law. 
    I have -- and I have personally in guilt of violation of the law even though immediately I got my hands on it, I rushed down and register it without unwrapping the package.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="858.322" stopTime="869.177">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    But even without unwrapping the package, if you got it lawfully, you don't have to register; if you got it unlawfully, when you register, you were admitting that you got it unlawfully.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="869.177" stopTime="877.745">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I'm asking you, what if -- what do those words mean in the context of the statute, lawfully and unlawfully.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="877.745" stopTime="976.726">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    They mean whether or not you complied with all the detailed provisions as to transfer or making. 
    Now, the Government does put quite properly some situations in which the duty to register may apply although the acquisition was not unlawful. 
    These, as the Government's brief concedes are not the very common situations. 
    And I'm not sure that we would agree with all of the situations the Government puts so illustrating us but they do put the case of the transfer between a maker and a license dealer that registration would be required here even though the transfer provisions need not be complied with. 
    But the same argument that the Government now puts forward that -- perhaps you find a lost gun and this is not a transfer and therefore you don't have them lawfully. 
    This was put to the Ninth Circuit in the Russell case, a leading case in which the registration provision was held unconstitutional and the Ninth Circuit gave what -- in our submission is the correct answer. 
    But even if these situations can occur that in most cases, the duty to register applies only to the unlawful acquisition of a weapon. 
    Therefore, the registration will be enough to be a link in the chain in any instance. 
    It has an incriminatory effect even if the particular acquisition may have been a lawful one in these very rare circumstances.

    Yes, sir.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And If I understood you correctly, you said that the -- you understand the Government to concede that if you are correct in your interpretation of the meaning of the statute that you are also right in your Fifth Amendment claim that you are --?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1001.255" stopTime="1002.849">

    Except the use restriction --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But this is also -- major correct in your major correct in your Fifth Amendment claim. 
    Now do you in the other hand concede that if the Government's correct in it statutory construction, that you're claim under the constitution is without merit?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1017.872" stopTime="1094.777">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    No, sir. 
    Plainly, I have a tougher constitutional case but I still think I have case. 
    We concede, in fact, this much of the Government's statutory construction as I've just said that there are some rare cases in which the duty to register may apply to a lawful act possession. 
    We take sharp issue with the Government on it construction of 5841. 
    But even if I were wrong there, even if registration by a prior owner is all that is required, then we submit that it is up to the Government to prove that there was some prior owner who might have registered without himself of being incriminated. 
    We think this is similar to the decision twice now in the District of Columbia Circuit involving the Communist Party that it is before the prosecution can convict this person can convict this person. 
    It has to show that there was somebody else who could have registered. 
    Else, we're back to the Lovelace case where the Government inadvertently in its indictment alleged that he had -- had he, the defendant had failed to register and the Fifth Circuit ruled that out. 
    He said, Here, you're attacking the defendant for his personal failure and that you can't do because he can't be required to register.

    Can I ask you another hypothetical question? 
    Let's take a case of a pawnshop, which is required to report all articles purchased to the police or are all articles taken in pledge, I suppose and is it a -- would it be a defense to a prosecution for failure to comply with that registration requirement that may tend to incriminate the pawnshop owner because sometimes he buys stolen goods and that that may be a violation of the law?

    Why would that makes any difference on the -- as an analogy of your argument? 
    I thought you're going to answer and make that answer and I wonder if it makes any -- if it makes any different at all when if you don't have to take the position that it doesn't matter. 
    In other words, are you suggesting that petitioner here, Mr. Haynes, can successfully defend here only if he isn't -- is innocent in mind but he can't defend that he took this knowing that it was a hot weapon?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1200.524" stopTime="1249.952">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    No, I'm certainly not suggesting that. 
    My attack of the statute here is that it imposes an absolute criminal liability. 
    My difficulty with your pawnshop proprietor is that if the substantive law is that when he comes into possession of stolen goods and reports them to the police, there is no criminal responsibility for receipt of stolen goods. 
    Then I would see no self-incrimination problem. 
    If the law is on the other hand that a pawnshop proprietor may be convicted for stealing or stolen goods even though (a) he did not know about them; and (b) he reported them and -- well, I think I'd leave out in the (b). 
    If he can be convicted of innocent receipt of stolen goods, then I would think to be a serious self-incrimination problem.

    The analogy would be if you had a statute that any person who has already smuggled goods into the country must report the fact and the prosecution were not for smuggling but for not reporting. 
    They are, I would see, of course, the Fifth Amendment problem. 
    I think that by the making and transfer provisions, the Government effectively regulates firearms. 
    It is able to keep a detailed record of them that the registration provisions serves no additional purpose except to say, Well, now if you violated these things, please come forward and tell us. 
    And this is what the Fifth Amendment is all about but we don't ask the citizen to do that. 
    By all sayings he could have been convicted for having made a firearm. 
    And in fact the information against them had three counts and the Government for reasons of its own chose to proceed on the registration count rather than on other counts. 
    Counts that I think could not be challenged on constitutional grounds. 
    There are several cases cited on our brief from which the Government has been scared of 5851 so it's dismissed the 5851 indictment for non-registration and got a new indictment for possession of a weapon that's been transferred in violation of law. 
    The Government can do that but the Government can't constitutionally do, we submit as send you to jail for non-registration.

    Do I understand, as you read these statutes that the upshot of it is that you have to confess to the violation of one criminal offense in order to have a defense to the violation of another. 
    In other words, that your only defense against possession of a firearm within the definition is that if you have registered it but if you register it, you're guilty of another criminal offense.

   Argument of Harris Weinstein
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1608.335" stopTime="1610.994">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Weinstien.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="1610.994" stopTime="2045.234">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think the last formulation that Professor Wright used perhaps best summarizes his claim of what the statute means and did in this case. 
    He said, I think, that we were sending Mr. Haynes to jail for non-registration. 
    I assume he means by that for Mr. Haynes non-registration. 
    And I think Professor Wright agrees that to reach that conclusion, both statutory sections, 5841 and 5851 have to be construed his way. 
    Now, I first like to turn if I may to 5851, which is the provision under which Mr. Haynes was prosecuted. 
    That's a statute that defines as a crime, possessing a firearm under certain situations. 
    One of those situations, and I'd like to read the exact language, "Is to possess any firearm which has not been registered as required by Section 5841." 
    Now, our position is that that in no way deals with the defendant's failure to register. 
    It is in the past tense. 
    It said -- says, Has not been registered?. 
    It's quite in contrast to another section, Section 5855. 
    It does deal with the possessor's failure to register. 
    In Section 5855, it makes a prohibition on shipping firearms and interstate commerce in certain situations and the first clause of that says, "It shall be unlawful for any person who is required to register as provided in Section 5841 and who shall not have so registered to ship in interstate commerce". 
    Now, we believe that the language, a quite different language of Section 5855, help show that Congress had a rather different idea in mind in the past tense that it used in Section 5851. 
    I'd also like to point out, if I may that if Professor Wright's reading of Section 5851 were correct, then this language, which Congress put into the statute in 1958 would simply duplicate the requirements of Section 5841 which require possessors to register and the failure to make that registration is punished under the penalty section of the statute, Section 5861 by the same penalty as it would apply to a violation of the possession placed in past tense in Section 5851. 
    And the last point I'd like to make on the meaning of this part of Section 5851 is that as I understand Professor Wright's argument, he refers to -- he relies on two words, Such person. 
    Now those words don't appear in 5851 as near as I can tell in any context. 
    My understanding is that they are taken out of 5841 and what the meaning of those words in 5841 as I see the statute has -- provides no help in interpreting the possession provisions in the past tense in Section 5851. 
    Now, I think it's fair that there are two points to Professor Wright's argument. 
    One that I just dealt with is that the charge against the defendant is that he himself failed to register. 
    Now, as I've indicated, we think that's wrong as a matter of statutory construction and for that reason alone, the conviction ought to be affirmed. 
    But there's a second essential element to the petitioner's argument and that is that under Section 5841, the registration requirement, the only people who have to register are those who already violated the law. 
    As cast in the District Court and through the briefing in this case, the attack on the statute was a simple attack on its face of the statute. 
    As we understand that to mean, it is that in the petitioner's view, there is no situation to which the statute can apply without resulting in the incrimination of the register. 
    Now, in the argument, I think Professor Wright has said, he agrees there are some rare, I think rare was his word, cases in which registration would be required without incrimination. 
    I would think to start with that alone is enough to defeat his argument that the statute is unconstitutional on its face but more importantly, in terms of what the statute means, in our view, it is those rare cases that he describes that the statute was particularly intended to apply them. 
    As I think Mr. Justice White's suggested earlier, the scheme of this statute is to require advance registrations or at least notifications to the Treasury of changes in possession of the firearms, these machine guns and sawed-off shotguns that are subject to the tax. 
    There are two situations generally in which the provisions of the statute will result in this type of advance notification. 
    One is when there is a taxable transfer and in these situations, the transferor has an obligation to obtain information about the transferee, to fill on a form, to send it to the Treasury to put the tax stamp on it. 
    In a taxable making, now that is a taxable making is when it is made by somebody who was not a manufacturer, who was not paying the manufacturers occupational tax. 
    The person who is making it is required to file in advance a declaration of his intent to make; that is in Section 5821 (e).

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Oh, while we recognize that statute applies to that, we -- I think there are two crimes in question here and I think we've got to distinguish which we're talking about. 
    If you were charged with receiving a gun that has been transferred unlawfully or that has not previously been registered, I don't see that that is distinquishable from a charge of receiving stolen goods. 
    If you're being charged with your own failure to register under Section 5841, then I think we would say that that's not compelling incrimination because you knew the gun was coming to you and you had the opportunity before you received it to determine whether your possession would be lawful and I --

speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2434.836" stopTime="2459.768">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't think it's a waiver argument because if you make the inquiry in advance, there should be lawful means of acquiring a gun. 
    And if you can make certain that the statute is complied with either by the transferor getting the information and paying the tax under 5814 or your registering it to yourself then I would believe that your possession would be lawful.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2459.768" stopTime="2508.285">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, as I understand the argument that Mr. Wright at least to give this that the statute makes it as Justice Fortas' question illustrate it, makes it an offense to possess a firearm as defined if anywhere back in the manufacturer or the chain of title there has not been a registration. 
    And therefore, if you require one in the way that Justice Fortas described, it's your -- and you register it. 
    You are then right then and there giving evidence that you are in possession of a firearm that somewhere back in the chain of title was not registered and you are therefore guilty of an offense.And on the other hand, if you don't register it, you are guilty of an offense. 
    Now, isn't that the argument?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2508.285" stopTime="2509.192">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Well, if we're talking about --

    You're guilty of a different offense.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2510.589" stopTime="2543.622">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    If we're talking about the non-registration by some prior possessor, again, I would analogize that to the receipt of goods where that person receiving it has some reason to believe that it had been stolen, I think this statute puts on the person who's going to get the gun the obligation of inquiry when he knows he's going to get it. 
    And if that inquiry discloses that the gun can't be possessed lawfully because of something somebody else did that can't be cured.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2543.622" stopTime="2545.543">

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The other crime, burglary, receiving stolen good, assault and battery, any of these things, and the argument leads to the fact that he -- since you have an option to do or not to do this criminal conduct, if you do it, you waive the Fifth Amendment. 
    And that's an argument that I have a great deal of difficulty in accepting.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2576.388" stopTime="2627.798">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    As I understand it, this crime is different from the others that you listed because it goes to possession. 
    And, if we're talking about 5851, which is this crime, the statute that makes certain types of possession a crime. 
    It's the moment of possession that creates the criminal liability and it's a possession that's made criminal because of the past history of a gun. 
    Now, the fact that you could determine the past history and avoid taking it is not what we would consider a waiver. 
    It's an option. 
    You make a free choice to commit this crime as you would any other crime.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2627.798" stopTime="2691.314">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But I wonder if that really is the only argument that you've got to support this and I suppose that people have gone to the store and let's assume that these weapons can be purchased via mail or at the grocery store or something like that and I assume that a person who purchases one of these or takes a gift, it could be said and what could be argued that a person who puts his wallet, takes a gift doesn't have the same reason to know that it's taking some hot merchandise, doesn't have the same basic -- the knowing that he is taking a hot merchandise. 
    That it make the case comparable to a gambling situation because everybody knows that gambling is unlawful in most states.

    I'm not questioning your argument in the slightest but I want to know, I like to know before we decide this case if we are going to in the -- in deciding for the petitioner here if we are going to nullify the smuggling laws and maybe the Pawnbrokers Laws and the Firearms Law and all other laws which require registration and the theory that if a man is dishonest and is violating the law, you can't compel him to register because it might admit his guilt.

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    But I do think that if this kind of registration is nullified, the pawnbroker requirement, the automobile registration requirement would have serious questions. 
    I think you would have serious question, say in a case where a man who didn't file an income tax in one year claimed that he never had to file again because that would suggest to the Government that he had committed a crime earlier, you have -- not filing.

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I think in -- say in the narcotics area for example, a person who is supposed to register and had made an illegal transaction beforehand would be able to claim that by registering it, he would be incriminating himself of the prior transaction. 
    If I may briefly, there are two other points that I would like to turn to. 
    First, Professor Wright has said that we have an obligation of showing that some prior possessor would have to have been able to register this gun without suggesting that he is guilty of some crime. 
    Well, we first disagree with that legal proposition as we suggest in --

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    We would first disagree with that legal proposition because it would be putting Mr. Haynes in the position of resting on the supposed rights of some people whom we don't know and in situations we know nothing about. 
    To transport Justice Holmes words in Sullivan, we would be letting Mr. Haynes go inside a conjurers circle that somebody else drew and the timings that we weren't aware of and for reasons that we're not aware.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is this a matter of standing or is it -- or is your point that the Fifth Amendment prohibits compulsory self-incrimination not compulsory incrimination of somebody else. 
    Which is it or neither?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="3086.798" stopTime="3174.796">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I think it is essentially that it prohibits self-compulsory -- self-incrimination. 
    Now, I wouldn't argue here that there is no situation where one person's protections require that somebody else be able to invoke the other person's right. 
    I just don't -- wouldn't want to try to envision every possible circumstance. 
    But we certainly think that here, where you don't know whose rights that they are or in what situation they might have been claimed and when they never were claimed before any tribunal that there -- we don't have this obligation. 
    But going beyond that, we think we can fulfill the obligation even if we had it because it's quite clear that someone at some point had the opportunity to bring this gun to the Government's attention lawfully. 
    If he made it and was subject to the making tax, he could've done it then. 
    The maker could've done it. 
    Otherwise, the first transferee, as if the maker was not subject to the tax, the first transferee who was subject to the tax, either his transferor could've complied with 5814 or the transferee could've complied with 5841. 
    So we think that with each firearm that is inevitable that there would be someone who is in a position to comply.

    Well, what do you do with the regulations (Inaudible)?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="3181.195" stopTime="3279.326">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    We would -- the thrust of that regulation I think, is that you have to register in one of two situations. 
    One is where there -- no one has committed any sort of a crime of the transfer and that the other situation is that the person must register who has gotten the gun in a way that the Government should have gotten notice but didn't. 
    Now, these two, I would suggest is somewhat similar to the pawnbroker statute. 
    The registration doesn't show incrimination that registration doesn't -- has nothing in it to suggest why it's come in and we recognize that the statute applies to a whole host of people. 
    We don't know who they are.It's intended principally to bear on people who run no risk of incrimination. 
    Now, we think that every tax statute that relies on a system of confession certainly closes some threat of incrimination such as the person in Sullivan who files a tax return and shows no source for his income, I think runs the risk of the Government investigating the sources of his income. 
    We don't think that this regulation poses any more serious risk of information on -- that sort of person runs in complying with the Income Tax Laws.

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    The -- I think that was a situation when the Ninth Circuit decided the Russell case. 
    And the question would then be whether 5841 which report -- itself requires registration affirmatively, is unconstitutional on its face. 
    And our position would be that the answer to that, the argument based that the Ninth Circuit accepted in Russell is that there are these situations that the statute is intended to apply to where no one can contend that there is incrimination from registration. 
    And we would disagree with the result in Russell.

    If -- we think that Russell is based on an erroneous reading of a presumption contained in the possession statute that was there at the time Russell was decided.

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    We think that's an erroneous reading because we think that there's a placement of the word ?such? in the presumption that describes such firearm. 
    And we think that refers back to the first sentence of the -- of 5851 as it read it that time and still does in the beginning -- which talks about a firearm that has at anytime been transferred or made unlawfully. 
    So as we read the presumption, the Government has got to prove possession and some prior unlawful making or transfer. 
    This is the view that the Sixth Circuit took in for Forgett and that we think is correct in the answer to the underlying analysis in Russell.

   Rebuttal of Charles Alan Wright

    Mr. Wright.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="3698.459" stopTime="3821.406">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The argument for the United States with regard to the National Firearm Act, things to my mind Learned Hand's admonition not to make a fortress out of the dictionary, I think that admonition is specially apt in a statute as poorly drafted as this one is. 
    It is a hodgepodge of different provisions adopted by Congress at different times. 
    And I do not think it would stand dramatical analysis. 
    The fact that the past tense as used in a particular provision of Section 5851 seems to me less revealing than the existing of -- that the existence of the treasury regulation, saying in fact that every person of the United States possessing a firearm not registered to him shall register the firearm. 
    I would like to put a concrete example, if I may to indicate how we think the statute has to be construed. 
    Suppose, Mr. Weinstein has a firearm that he has acquired lawfully, transfer provisions had been followed when he acquired it. 
    Mr. Weinstein then gives, sells, loans, or otherwise transfers the need of firearm. 
    Under what duties do I stand? 
    I suggest that first, under the first sentence of Section 5841, I am a person possessing a firearm. 
    Therefore, that person imposes a duty to register. 
    Under the second sentence of 5841, no person shall be required to register with respect to the firearm when such a person acquired it by transfer if the provisions of this chapter were complied with. 
    But that doesn't help me out because when I acquired it by transfer, the provisions of this chapter were not complied with. 
    Therefore, I am still a person under a duty to register and when I register, as I now must under 5841, I say, I acquired a firearm unlawfully from Mr. Weinstein and I go to jail for it.

    Well, you mean the fact, the mere -- the fact that you went up there and registered and you say from that and there'll be a permissible inference that you had a guilty conscience.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="3965.020" stopTime="3973.706">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    There is at minimum a permissible inference and on the reading the Ninth Circuit gives to 5851, the Government has now made a prima facie case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3973.706" stopTime="3983.896">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, but do you read there, it sound like, (Inaudible)?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="3983.896" stopTime="3985.476">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    That's right, I can see that.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3985.476" stopTime="4000.113">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And so, you still think the Government though, when it sees a registration to come in, its going to say to itself, "Well, this must has been in an unlawful acquisition rather than a lawful acquisition", although we know there are some lawful acquisition.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4000.113" stopTime="4023.584">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    The Government has gone to think that this isn't a transaction that bears very close investigation and even if it happens that minus one of those rare cases in which the acquisition was lawful and I'm there for registering only because I'm a law abiding citizen. 
    That does not mean that I will not be prosecuted for unlawful acquisition and that this may not be used very effectively against me.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4023.584" stopTime="4030.469">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But this is measurably different than refusing, taking a privilege on showing the source of your income on income tax returns, doesn't it?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4030.469" stopTime="4033.807">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I do not understand how that can be used an evidence against me.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4033.807" stopTime="4041.369">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It's a quite the -- but if this is quite a tipoff to the Government, the Government might say this is very, very -- that this bears very close to scrutiny --
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4041.369" stopTime="4041.547">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Yes it might.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4041.547" stopTime="4049.377">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- just like your -- just like the registration of a gun, where some of what -- even though the acquisition might be legal.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4049.377" stopTime="4064.866">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I grant that it would. 
    But in the great bulk of instances, the filing of the return is in itself incriminating and in those other few instances, it has a devastating potential as against even in the instance of a defendant.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4064.866" stopTime="4101.468">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, he has prepared -- you see we are at a stage of the case where you object to the introduction of the registration point. 
    And your argument would be very good if -- I suppose if the Government actually prosecuted you for possessing an unregistered gun or for acquiring a gun that had been transferred illegally and altered the registration statement. 
    But you're saying here that the statute is unconstitutional and that nobody should be required to register any gun even if he acquired it lawfully.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4101.468" stopTime="4103.587">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    That is just what I'm saying.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4103.587" stopTime="4105.830">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, you're saying the statute is unconstitutional on its face.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4105.830" stopTime="4122.002">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I'm saying the statute is unconstitutional on its face that a constitutional statute could be drafted to require a registration of lawfully acquired guns and that there are already enough statutes on the books that penalize the unlawful acquisition of guns. 
    Thank you.

    So far as I know --

    Of course they're 5841 or 5851?

    If it's not on the registration form, I don't believe --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4155.133" stopTime="4159.183">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's not. 
    This one is an application, an order for transfer of a firearm --
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4159.183" stopTime="4160.240">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    When you're making a transfer.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4160.240" stopTime="4170.207">

    That's form for firearms and then there's a declaration of intent to make a firearm, form 1A firearm, requires fingerprint from the applicant.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4170.207" stopTime="4173.629">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Fingerprints and photograph too.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4173.629" stopTime="4177.491">

    But the registration form does not, you're telling me?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4177.491" stopTime="4178.880">

    Yes, that's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4178.880" stopTime="4190.663">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Have you thought of the -- or looked into at all the impact of the argument you are making to us today in the Federal Narcotic Laws?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4190.663" stopTime="4237.393">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I have thought about it of course and then anticipated that the -- that would be a matter of concern to the Court and I finally concluded that Justice, I see a significant differences between the wagering scheme and the Firearms Act so the Narcotic Statutes are such a different statutory scheme and I think they would have to stand on our own bottom. 
    I do point out that the Narcotic Statutes supplied to a business that is in many respects entirely legal. 
    The statutes do not endeavor to reach only the illegal transactions. 
    They would -- they require people to register and keep records when doctors lawfully possessing narcotics.In that respect, it is very different from this statute that hardly ever reaches anybody, except the lawbreaker.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4237.393" stopTime="4265.716">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, there is a presumption that a possessor of narcotics is in possession of narcotics upon which the tax had not been paid and it's up to him to rebut that presumption. 
    If he does, he can get the same kind of difficulty that you say this tangled up into the cross, the quick sawing effect of (Inaudible) of different criminal statute. 
    There are those basics somewhere in the statute --
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4265.716" stopTime="4266.385">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I think if (Voice Overlap) --

speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4268.117" stopTime="4274.082">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I've prefer really not to answer that question. 
    I don't feel well enough briefed in that statutory scheme.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4274.082" stopTime="4289.637">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But there, it's pretty clear that this, at least briefly, would get pretty close to some of those narcotic laws which are on the same general area of the Fifth Amendment concern, is it not?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4289.637" stopTime="4300.335">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Only if the Congress in adopting the Narcotics Laws indulge in this unnecessary -- a form of legislation as I did in my submissions here.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4300.335" stopTime="4303.621">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But it can be argued as someone know it did.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4303.621" stopTime="4311.200">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Perhaps so and if so then I would not flinch from making of it in the argument against them.
