Edwards v. Pacific Fruit Express Company
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="9.351">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Elijah Edwards, Petitioner, versus Pacific Fruit Express Company. 
    Mr. Werchick.
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="9.351" stopTime="262.172">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act was halted in its infancy when summary judgment was granted against petitioner in the District Court. 
    The judgment was granted in favor of respondent Pacific Fruit Express, the District Court saying that respondent was not a common carrier by railroad and therefore not under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    The Ninth Circuit affirmed this judgment explicitly construing the coverage of the Act narrowly and stating so in its opinion, briefed opinion as specifically rejecting what it termed a broader definition of the terms of the Act. 
    This Court granted certiorari. 
    The issue essentially before this Court is the question of coverage under the Employers' Liability Act and whether it is to be decided as this Court has approached similar questions of coverage and also the general application of this Act in the past or whether the question of coverage is to be given a new and narrow technical meaning. 
    Facts of this suit as it come to this Court are not in dispute. 
    It is essentially conceded. 
    The petitioner was employed by the respondent. 
    He was injured on the job. 
    He was working in Roseville, California on the yards of the -- that are operated by the respondent. 
    It is a large refrigerator car icing operation. 
    The facts, of course, describing the specifics of the operation are set out in great detail on the record on the briefs and I will refer to some of them as I proceed, but I don't think it's necessary to take the Court's time to set out all of the facts relating to the description of respondent's operation. 
    Sufficed to say at this point that it is not disputed, in fact it is set forth in respondent's affidavit in the record that petitioner's job involved the servicing of railroad, refrigerator boxcars, placing of ice, loading and unloading of ice and heaters, and other equipment in and out of refrigerator boxcars, for the purpose of making these boxcars able to carry perishable commodities in interstate commerce. 
    And about this, it does not seem to be any dispute in the record. 
    Regarding this -- the factual description of Pacific Fruit Express, there is also very little disagreement. 
    The disagreement between the parties here before this Court seems to be the conclusion to be drawn from this description. 
    Respondent is described with partial accuracy as a refrigerator car company. 
    And by the Interstate Commerce Commission statistical reports with also -- with partial accuracy as a private car line. 
    Respondent is owned wholly by two rail haul lines, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads. 
    In fact, it is more than a car company because it owns some roughly 25,000 boxcars, refrigerator boxcars and is the largest owner and operator of these cars in the United States. 
    It dominates what might be called the refrigerator car company industry or branch of the railroad industry if you will. 
    It represents basically half of that industry in terms of the number of employees, its holding in refrigerator cars alike. 
    There are seven such companies in the United States, all of them owned by rail haul carriers and operated to service. 
    The obligations of those rail haul carriers that they're required by law to provide the care necessary to ship perishables by railroad in the United States. 
    There are about one million carloads of perishable commodities shipped in the United States each year and respondent in their words originates and otherwise handles about 285,000 carloads, or approximately almost 30% of the nation's total. 
    Respondent describes itself in this record as in materials in this record as the nation's largest operator of refrigerator railcars. 
    And in 1965, PFE cars moved over one billion miles.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Who services the cars themselves?
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="264.318" stopTime="377.262">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    In this instance, Pacific Fruit Express services its own cars. 
    And servicing consists -- before the trip begins, Mr. Chief Justice, taking a car and making it ready. 
    In fact Pacific Fruit Express builds the car in many instances. 
    Maintains the car as required by law to keep its cars in condition to comply with the Federal Safety Appliance Acts, which it does sometimes itself and sometimes by paying another railcar repair installation to do the work for them. 
    Pacific Fruit Express takes the car and prepares it for service by cleaning it, by taking it to its various plants located in different parts of the west. 
    Seven, I think it is major plants and several icing stations different points in the country. 
    And then places the necessary refrigerator or heater equipment in this car and then makes it available to a line haul railroad so that it can be taken out in commodities loaded in. 
    And now this is not where the service stops however because, Pacific Fruit Express is paid by the mile that the car is used and provides continuous service over this car putting ice in it wherever needed at its various stations across the United States or altering the character of the service. 
    The shipper may call Pacific Fruit Express directly to alter the character of the service. 
    They invite this in their advertising literature. 
    They list in the telephone directories. 
    And Pacific Fruit Express keeps their cars spotted all the way across the United States and can order them diverted. 
    The shipper request this, nor sent to Chicago and if the shipper wants it to go to Los Angeles instead, the shipper is invited to call PFE. 
    It is not told to call the line -- haul line necessarily. 
    He can call either, and PFE will have that car diverted. 
    They give the necessary instruction and the car will be diverted.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Who makes the necessary repairs to the car?
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="380.739" stopTime="535.134">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    Pacific Fruit Express maintains several repair shops of its own, in which it repairs its own cars and cars of other car companies, rail companies, and the like if paid the standard rates set by the American Association of Railroads. 
    They will also, if their car happens to be located in an area which is not near one of their own shops but requires repairs, pay the standard rates to another railroad company or repair company to do the repairs in their shop. 
    As it can be seen from the record, Pacific Fruit Express not only owns but controls, operates, and services this largest freight of refrigerator railcars and trailers in the United States. 
    Their business revolves around the roughly 25,000 cars that it owns. 
    But according to the Interstate Commerce Commission Reports which we've cited in our brief, Pacific Fruit Express also rents cars from Southern Pacific and Union Pacific to add to its fleet. 
    Now Pacific Fruit Express, as I indicated, places these cars in rail service by providing them to any line haul railroad in the United States. 
    They are not private contract line had dealing only with say one carrier, one other carrier being completely subsumed to one part of the business, but rather will deal with any part of the public and any part of the railroad community, and making their cars available and in providing protective services. 
    They do this by charging approximately 5 cents per mile. 
    They do not charge, with very rare exception, for term use of the car. 
    Occasionally, according to their literature, they will rent some cars to a shipper on a monthly basis. 
    This is what I would call -- concede would be the renting or leasing of a refrigerator railcar. 
    But I would maintain that insofar as it is a standard in the refrigerator car business to charge by the mile that a car is used, this indicates a carriage activity that's going on a transportation activity, which as I would like to suggest later is crucial in applying with Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    Pacific Fruit Express does more in controlling the distribution of the cars because they also do market research. 
    They also go out and survey the agricultural needs in the areas early in order to determine how many cars will be needed. 
    They discuss with shippers where cars have to be provided and where they'll be needed.

    Mr. Arne Werchick

    Physically touched.

    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    Yes. 
    Let us say that a car has started from San Francisco to Chicago. 
    They have icing stations and facilities between San Francisco and Chicago and the --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="560.642" stopTime="565.461">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And those facilities are owned and operated by Pacific Fruit?
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="565.461" stopTime="566.857">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    That's right.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="566.857" stopTime="573.700">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    As far as I know, they do not.

    Then how did they get in commerce?

    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    How does Pacific Fruit Express get in commerce or how --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    How did the employees, they're not in commerce are they?
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="587.427" stopTime="622.176">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    The employees themselves, yes, Your Honor. 
    The employees are in interstate commerce. 
    The test that this Court has established many times in the language of the Federal Employees Liability Act itself specifically establishes this, does the activity of the employee substantially affect interstate commerce. 
    If you took him away, would you halt or disrupt the interstate commerce? 
    I can -- I think best cite to the Court is Reed versus Pennsylvania decision which this Court established where a clerical employee who handled blueprints sitting in an office was found to substantially affect interstate commerce because --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="622.176" stopTime="631.303">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But if there was a switching accident, it would be an employee of a railroad that would be injured, wouldn't it?
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="631.303" stopTime="637.010">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    Not necessarily at all. 
    These cars have to be switched on and off of the Pacific Fruit Express terminal, Your Honor.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I'm talking about when they're on the line of the Southern Pacific, and one of these cars injures an employee, it would be an employee of the railroad.

    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    Well, I couldn't say whether that would always be the case or not.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="658.927" stopTime="661.250">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, it wouldn't be a Pacific Fruit employee.
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="661.250" stopTime="680.096">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    I -- each -- it ordinarily, as I understand it at least in California Pacific Fruit Express has its own yards which are adjacent to or part of other railroad industry set up. 
    So that they can provide immediate icing service whenever the car is needed or immediate heating service or repair service to refrigerator cars.

speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="684.632" stopTime="697.298">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    My understanding is that there would be no reason for a Pacific Fruit Express employee to be out on the tracks in the middle of Kansas or what have you as the train is moving from here to -- from San Francisco to Chicago, from here to Chicago.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="697.298" stopTime="699.401">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That's one to point his wording.
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="699.401" stopTime="752.072">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    I would -- if I may add to that statement Mr. Justice Marshall, I think that it's important to consider the decisions of this Court and other courts which should be confirmly established in the area of terminal, belt and yard companies. 
    They have been held to be within the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    And yet there will be no terminal employee on the train as it's traversing the United States. 
    In fact, it may never even be a terminal employee on the train per se. 
    I had occasion to have reference to some of the cases which are cited in our brief. 
    One particular come -- coming from Florida, their District Court where all the employee there did was wash the trains apparently. 
    Somebody else for the terminal company directed the movement of the train once it entered the terminal facility. 
    And then what they did they washed it, and cleaned it, and made it ready for the next journey.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="752.072" stopTime="759.866">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, Pacific Fruit says that these yards are huge and your area is small.

    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    Well --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I'm not saying I agree with them.
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="762.417" stopTime="782.472">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    They also say in their literature that their yard in Roseville is 1 1/2 square miles. 
    And I maintain that that's fairly sizeable railroad installation. 
    The train stations in most of our communities don't cover much more than that, I don't think sizably less in many of the smaller communities, I would say.

    In this case, the employee was injured while he was operating a motor vehicle. 
    And he was going from one part of the icing yard to an icing dock. 
    He was not injured on a railroad car itself. 
    But his work and the work in which he was engaged did specifically involved the making of railroad cars ready for interstate commerce. 
    Now again under the decisions which this Court has decided under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, that this does not seem to be required. 
    Plainly, it does not seem to be required that the employee must be working on a railroad car when he sustains his injury, that was --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, but the language is common carrier by railroad, is it?

    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    That's right. 
    But as -- I think that perhaps most clearly pointed out, I believe it was the Hammarstrom decision, which is cited in our briefs in Missouri Appellate Court that the language is simply stated. 
    The words by railroad referred to nothing but the instrumentality, the type of industry that Congress was talking about. 
    There's no magic to the phrase by railroad. 
    It refers in fact in the early days the word used to be used to mean nothing but a highway, a particular type of road, only this was a steel road rather than a concrete one.

    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    Its rates, in a sense, essentially they regulate it.

speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="1123.749" stopTime="1152.253">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    The contracts between the railroads and the so-called private car companies must be filed and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission and do not become effective until approved. 
    They have since 1940, have the authority to command these companies to turn over their books, provide information and cooperate in investigations so that they can determine what the rates should be.

    Was it?
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="1221.049" stopTime="1279.498">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    The only language of this Court on that subject, Mr. Justice Brennan, has been the statement that they need not hold themselves out to the public at all and can still be a common carrier. 
    That if they perform a vital transportation service in railroad transportation, that makes them a common carrier by railroad. 
    And I have reference to the terminal company and the stockyard and beltline railroad cases. 
    The fact that they acted as agent for a common carrier line haul operation and took some of the burden from the shoulders of that railroad and in the sense divided up the labor, made them part of a system of common carriage by railroad. 
    This concept goes back as far as the Southern Pacific Terminal Case of -- I think 1908 where a terminal that did nothing but provide normal terminal facilities and wharfage was held to be under the Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdiction because the Court at that early stage said, “You can't allow railroads to go out dividing up into small parts (Voice Overlap) control”.

    Where a railroad employee was injured on a dining car or something while the car was in the terminal and the injury was brought about because one of the terminal switching engines have struck the dining car. 
    But there as I recall it we turned it on the question whether a vital part of the operation of the railroad had been turned over by the railroad companies that set up the union terminal. 
    I forgot the name of that, (Inaudible) was it, or something?

    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    It doesn't come immediately in my mind, Your Honor. 
    Here, there's no question to the vital part of a railroad operation that has been turned over to Pacific Fruit Express. 
    The railroads are required by law to provide --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    All that it seems to happen here is that the railroads want -- they want to provide a refrigerated car service, instead of manufacturing or buying their own refrigerated cars, lease them or how do they get them? 
    Some way they contract for them from this company, is that right?
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="1355.315" stopTime="1373.380">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    Precisely, instead of buying them themselves because they would be legally obligated to do and servicing and operating them and controlling them and maintaining them and repairing them and building them themselves, they've setup a separate company to do this under a separate incorporation, but is doing nothing but the business of the railroad is legally compelled to do.

speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="1398.254" stopTime="1431.210">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    The degree of involvement in the interstate transportation of goods is essentially what it is. 
    If a company merely builds cars and sells or rents them on a term basis maintaining no control and not operating them and not getting into the carriage business itself, it's obviously not a carrier because it's not creating risks and hazards in the railroad industry in that sense. 
    But this company is doing a part of the active transportation work from the carriage of goods.

speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="1457.411" stopTime="1488.615">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    No, as I put it on my brief, they stand in the relation of -- to the carrier as basically a shipper. 
    They're nothing but a bulk shipper collecting the smaller parcels from the individual shippers and putting them together in a large package and delivering them to the railroad. 
    If you took them away from the railroad industry, the industry would go on as it is, except the shipper would have the problem having to get his goods down to the station himself, the same with the express company. 
    But you if take away the refrigerator car operation, there's just not going to be any shipment of fruits or vegetables or other perishables in the United States.

    Our position is this, if it please the Court. 
    The Pacific Fruit Express is not a railroad in the sense that we understand it. 
    And the legislative history and judicial history of this Court very clearly establishes what is a common carrier by railroad for the purposes of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    That's the first point I wanted to make. 
    The second point is, there is no need and no reason for this Court to want to strain or to extend the coverage of the Federal Employers' Liability Act because of the specific directives of Congress and because in my view and as I put forth in the brief, it is an inferior remedy for these men who are covered by California workman's compensation and I will address myself to that later.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, now what -- is that -- reading here, I -- now I recall it but we said in Sinkler it was. 
    Its manifest that the corporate autonomy of the belt railroad and its freedom from detailed supervision of its operations by respondent there, the Missouri Pacific, are irrelevant in as much as the switching (Inaudible) of the belt railway at the moment of the collision in the station was engaged in furthering the operational activities of respondent.

    Mr. John J. Corrigan 
    The respondent in that case, Justice Brennan, had a non-delegable duty. 
    When you are an employer of a railroad men and you're a rail carrier, you have a duty to that man no matter who hurts him if he's on the job and that's what happened in the Sinkler --

    Mr. John J. Corrigan 
    I would assume that they come under the Act because they are employed by a railroad. 
    And the key test here and the reason that the case of Reed versus Pennsylvania Railroad that we've cited is so important is this. 
    The test is not what the man is doing at a particular moment. 
    We're not going back to the moment of the injury test that this Court was faced with before the 1939 amendment to the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    What we're involved here as was pointed out in the Reed Case, you recall that was a case where a lady was high up in a building, a clerk in Philadelphia someplace, and there was a cracked window, and the wind came, and pane broke, and it cut her face. 
    This Court said that you don't have to have calluses on your hand or soot on your face or cinders in your hair to become under this Act. 
    You have to be employed by a common carrier by railroad. 
    That is the test.

    Mr. John J. Corrigan 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now the Pacific Fruit Express Company is a company which leases or grants, as you will, on a mileage basis refrigerator cars. 
    And it supplies what are known as protective services in connection with that leasing or renting of railroad cars. 
    By that is meant, it supplies ice, it supplies mechanical equipment in the cars to refrigerate perishables or to keep the temperature up in case of cold weather to preserve the perishables. 
    It does not switch cars for any railroad. 
    It does not switch cars for the public. 
    The only place that it has any track is within the confines of its own plant where it services its cars -- plants I should've said. 
    Now it -- of necessity would have to have tracks within plant because it services its own railroad cars and then they have to be placed on rails to move them about within the plant area. 
    It has no switch engines other than two light engines used within its shops at Roseville and Tucson, Arizona to move the cars around within the shop. 
    So in this sense, it has --

    Within who's shop?

    Mr. John J. Corrigan 
    These locomotives never leave the shop. 
    And this is why this is important. 
    You know, there have been other cases in lower courts involving the Ford Motor Company, General Electric, Armco Steel where in these companies had intra-plant railroads. 
    And the question was since they have a railroad running within the plant, they must come under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    These cases are set forth in our brief. 
    The point was though, and the decision was in those cases. 
    These are all federal district cases. 
    I believe one of them is a Circuit Court decision. 
    It was that because they're running a railroad doesn't make them a common carrier by railroad that this -- so in those cases, even though they actually had an operational railroad, it never left the premises of the industry involved and wasn't treated as a common carrier.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Where is that report?
speaker="john_j_corrigan" startTime="2056.277" stopTime="2275.553">
    Mr. John J. Corrigan 
    That's in the brief, Your Honor. 
    And it's the United States -- it's this Court's opinion, it's reported in 237 U.S. 
    And I should call your attention also to Wells Fargo versus Taylor in 245 U.S. 
    Now these cases held this that a Pullman porter in the Baltimore &amp; Ohio case, a pullman porter working on an interstate train moving in interstate commerce did not come within the Act, because the Pullman Company was not an interstate carrier by railroad, unanimous opinion of this Court. 
    In Wells Fargo versus Taylor, unanimous opinion of this Court, it was held that an express company employee did not come within the Act. 
    So far as the question of freight forwarders, Mr. Justice White, that was decided in the case of Lafsco. 
    I don't remember the name of the defendant therein but it appears in our brief and it was specifically held that freight forwarders do not come within the Act because they are not common carriers by railroad. 
    Now what I'd like to do at this point is to go through very briefly the legislative and judicial history so that you can see that this Act was intended for operational railroads in the sense that we understand it. 
    The Act was first passed in 1906 and it was held unconstitutional, because at that time, the first Act and I believe this is very important said this, “That this Act shall apply to every common carrier engaged in trade or commerce”. 
    In 1908, this Court held that that first Employers' Liability Act was unconstitutional. 
    And one of the things this Court pointed out was it applies to too many companies. 
    It applies not only to railroads but ferries, bridges and things of that sort. 
    And that's -- so the Court held that unconstitutional.Congress cited the Court's opinion in the first Employers' Liability Act case in their reports and then amended the statute to say it applies only to common carriers by railroad. 
    This Court then had brought before it the second Employers' Liability Act case in 1912. 
    And at that time, this Court said, "Yes, it only means common carriers by railroad". 
    And they referred to the first Act which was held unconstitutional which went too far. 
    Now after that second Employer's Liability Act case in 1912, there was the Baltimore &amp; Ohio case, the Robinson case, wherein this Court said it doesn't apply to porters. 
    There was the Wells Fargo versus Taylor where it said it doesn't apply to express company employees even though they may be working on trains. 
    Then there was a trilogy of cases which are very important under the Interstate Commerce Act. 
    And on this subject Mr. Justice Brennan, this company is not controlled or answerable to the Interstate Commerce Commission except that it has under a 1940 amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, it has to supply uniform accounting method. 
    That's the only control that the Interstate Commerce Commission has over refrigerator car companies.

    Mr. John J. Corrigan 
    The Safety Appliance Act does not apply, Mr. Justice Brennan to this kind of company for this reason. 
    The Safety Appliances Acts are directed to common carriers by railroad who in their service carry such cars. 
    Now if we build a car, we have to make sure it has a safety appliance because the railroad won't carry it. 
    But the United States attorney when he brings an action for a violation of the Safety Appliance Act does not and cannot, under the law, bring in against a refrigerator car company but must bring it against the carrier who's carrying it in commerce.

    Mr. John J. Corrigan 
    This is very important to my case and that's what I was just getting into now, Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    After these refrigerator car companies cases in around 1920, this Court held in a unanimous opinion that in three refrigerator car cases which I have cited, that they are not common carriers by railroad. 
    Congress must have known of these cases because they had great impact. 
    The Interstate Commerce Act was amended in part as a result of it. 
    Now with the knowledge of this Court's unanimous holding in three refrigerator car cases and in the other two cases I mentioned, in the decade of the 30s, there was a lot of railway legislation. 
    I've cited in page 15 of my brief seven laws that got passed or amended and in every law from 1934 to 1939, they specifically included refrigerator car companies. 
    And the most notable example was the Railway Labor Act. 
    The Railway Labor Act in 1934 was amended to include refrigerator car companies because they had never come under the Act before and Congress wanted them under the Act. 
    And Congress was aware of these prior decisions of this Court. 
    So they amended the Railway Unemployment Insurance Act. 
    They amended the Railroad Retirement Act three times to bring them in within its coverage.And then in 1939 they had hearings set out on page 14 of my brief when they gave specific determination whether they should extend the Federal Employers' Liability Act to include lesser companies other than common carriers by railroad. 
    There was specific discussion on this issue. 
    And Congress specifically decided not to extend it. 
    And the only railway Act that I know that doesn't include refrigerator car companies is the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    I think this is very significant. 
    And I think it's --

    Mr. John J. Corrigan 
    They knew about refrigerator car companies. 
    That's why in 1940, the year after they amended the Federal Employers' Liability Act, they passed an Act amending the Interstate Commerce Act. 
    I believe it's Section 114, sub (b) when they said that refrigerator car companies systems of account and accounting methods had to meet this Commission's approval. 
    But beyond that we're having no jurisdiction over you. 
    So Congress knew about refrigerator car companies and they brought it under every railway law there was, but when they got to the Federal Employers' Liability Act, it was discussed. 
    The railway labor was there and they said no. 
    Now this history that I'm trying to relate here has been very significant in the past decisions of the Third Circuit, the Ninth Circuit set forth there and the California Court and in the Utah Court. 
    This influenced them. 
    They said Congress did not intend these companies to come under the Act.

    It would Your Honor under this Court's decision. 
    And a recent decision in Gollesby versus United States Steel in 379 U.S. and in a very important decision in 244 U.S. called Winfield versus New York Central. 
    They're cited in my brief the Winfield case. 
    Yes, this is -- you would take -- there are 4,000 other people working for Pacific Fruit Express. 
    You would automatically divest them of their rights under California workman's compensation. 
    And I think that as it's pointed in some of these prior refrigerator car company cases, this is not something that the other courts have been willing to do lightly, because it's pointed in great detail I believe in my brief. 
    The California workman's compensation statute is simply a superior remedy for a working man. 
    Now, we're not just limited -- ourselves here to Elijah Edwards but what about these other people? 
    For example, under this statute, Elijah Edwards could go back to trial if I'm wrong and he comes under the Act and he could lose this case because we're still talking about negligence in this statute. 
    And I think this was indicated that negligence and proximate cause in the FELA variety is still part of the law, this Court so held in Bal -- Inman versus Baltimore &amp; Ohio.

    Some mention was made here of belt liner terminal line railroads. 
    They are not like the Pacific Fruit Express and they distinguishable. 
    They rely on the Parden decision. 
    Now -- and they rely on the Brooklyn Terminal. 
    These cases are cited in the brief. 
    Now a terminal railroad like the Parden or like Brooklyn in those two cases, they run a little railroad at the end of the line where they make up, break up trains, cross city streets. 
    They have a marshalling yard. 
    They switch for the public. 
    They switch for other carriers.

    They make a quotation from Parden and they say this in their brief. 
    It's important to know about it. 
    They say -- Parden says this, “The Federal Employers' Liability Act is at least as broad as the Safety Appliance Act and the Railway Labor Act.” 
    In the Parden case, the reason this Court made that decision and that statement a couple of years ago is because out in California, we have a belt owned railroad in San Francisco. 
    And it comes under the Railway Labor Act and it comes under the Safety Appliance Act. 
    And in Parden, you said that they come under the FELA the -- so that was what that statement was about, a state owned railroad as such. 
    Thank you very much. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Arne Werchick
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3384.740" stopTime="3387.391">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Werchick.
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="3387.391" stopTime="3496.016">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    I'd start to point out that under California Public Utilities Code 211 which is cited in our brief, the word common carrier under California law specifically includes refrigerator and car renting corporations. 
    Secondly, the question of Federal Safety Appliance Act, the Safety Appliance Act is directed to the vehicles themselves, to the instrumentalities. 
    In your decision of the United States versus California, this Court said, it could go after the belt line. 
    It didn't have to wait until it got on to a full line haul railroad in order to enforce that Act in considering that decision at its narrowest. 
    It stands for the proposition that the holder of the vehicle and anytime that somebody is injured, or anytime the unsafe practices found is the person responsible. 
    This is perhaps the most aptly illustrated in the Florida case that I mentioned earlier, McCullough versus Jacksonville Terminal also cited in the briefs. 
    There, the terminal company did nothing with the car except clean it. 
    They moved it for the purpose of servicing it. 
    It was defective under the Safety Appliance Act. 
    Suit was brought under the vehicle of the FELA. 
    And recovery was allowed even though there was no transportation involved in that sense, merely the cleaning of the car making it ready for transportation. 
    The question of what happens if the railroad divests was raised. 
    Suppose it gives away what's -- we maintain is really what it's doing here. 
    And this is answered in part or at least by analogy in Section 57 of Title 45 which is also part of the FELA. 
    And it says that a common carrier for the purpose of that Act is anybody, a receiver or a lessee or anybody. 
    It says carrying out the operations of a common carrier by railroad. 
    And that Section has never been used to decide a coverage case. 
    I might suggest in my mind that it might be perfectly adequate to decide coverage cases because it says anybody performing the function of a common carrier by railroad and it doesn't say a bit of the function of a whole function.

speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="3525.220" stopTime="3536.032">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    In the Railway Express case, it's discussed I think from the Fifth Circuit, I'm not sure Your Honor. 
    It specifically says it is a common carrier but because of the lack of railroad equipment it's just not operating by railroad. 
    Now I --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3536.032" stopTime="3537.213">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How about the Pullman Company?
speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="3537.213" stopTime="3567.238">
    Mr. Arne Werchick 
    The Pullman Company is an anachronism as far as the Robinson versus Baltimore &amp; Ohio Case. 
    But Robinson merely said, he couldn't sue B &amp; O because he was employed by the Pullman Company. 
    He was not an employee of Baltimore &amp; Ohio.And the FELA gives a remedy only to an employee of the carrier. 
    That was an agency case essentially or a joint servant question. 
    Now granted there was a sort of an assumption that stated in that case and I maintain that it's not a valid assumption that you can never have two common carriers by railroad working together.

    The terminal does more than wash cars.
