Whitehill v. Elkins
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="0.000" stopTime="128.014">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    -- from the statute, the definitional provisions of which were identical to those voided in the Baggett and Dombrowski cases are unconstitutionally fraud, vague and indefinite. 
    The facts in this case are comparatively simple. 
    It's a direct appeal from a final order and judgment of a statutory three-judge court sitting in Maryland, dismissing the appellant's complaint on the grounds of a prior precedent to this Court. 
    The appellant, a Quaker, is an author of works of fiction and nonfiction, and a teacher of Creative Writing at the Johns Hopkins University. 
    He was invited in the summer of 1966 to teach Creative Writing at the University of Maryland for the academic year of 1966-1967. 
    He was to be paid $7,000 over 10 months. 
    In July, he received by mail a copy of the contract to be signed and certain other documents including the certification of applicant for public employment which if I may I'd like to read to the Court. 
    It's captioned required by law, Article 85A, paragraph 13 Annotated Code of Maryland 1957. 
    It appears by the way in the transcript at page 11 in the appendix of the appellant's brief at page 16A. 
    It states, “I, -- leaving space for the name --, do hereby certify that I am not engaged in one way or another in an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States, or the State of Maryland, or any political subdivision of either of them, by force or violence. 
    I further certify that I understand the aforegoing statement is made subject to the penalties of perjury prescribed in Article 27, Section 439 of the Annotated Code of Maryland,” -- and there's a space for the date and the signature.

    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    However, he has to take this oath as authorized under a specific statute and it's our contention that the Gerende case, if that's what you're referring to Justice Harlan, does not really hold for the proposition that the oath can be read without the statute. 
    And if it does, the subsequent decisions of this Court will make it quite clear that an oath cannot be considered outside of the context of its statute. 
    And --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="221.405" stopTime="225.057">

speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="235.987" stopTime="248.262">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    It has two references. 
    It has a caption and it also provides that it's subject to the penalties of perjury and the only way in which this could be subject to the penalties of perjuries on a statutory basis which is also a reference to the statute ultimately.

    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Yes, but this would be statutory perjury and the only statute it provides for the oath happens to be the overact itself. 
    In addition, the phrase in one way or another we contend is unduly broad and vague. 
    But Your Honor --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's all?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="282.785" stopTime="291.187">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Well this particular oath to me would still suggest is unduly vague to the extent that it has the phrase in one way or another in it which defies the definition --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="291.187" stopTime="296.113">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes, but it also got the phrase, overthrow the government by force or violence.
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="296.113" stopTime="296.981">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Certainly.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="296.981" stopTime="303.227">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And it didn't relate to overthrowing the Government in any other way, does it?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="303.227" stopTime="305.686">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Well, but it says in one way or another. 
    That could --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="305.686" stopTime="307.174">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    By force or violence.
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="307.174" stopTime="320.281">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    By force or violence. 
    That could be read to mean the “in one way or another” phrase that mere adherence to an organization that's engaged in an attempt or about to be engaged in an attempt to overthrow the government by force --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="320.281" stopTime="323.062">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But of course, hasn't been so read?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="323.062" stopTime="371.522">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    It -- it's not clear. 
    The only judicial determination of the statute and oath other than the Gerende case is the Court of Appeals of Maryland's decision in the Shub case in 1950. 
    And while -- one could say that the Court of Appeals of Maryland attempted to narrow the construction of the actual statute, it certainly isn't clear and it's our position that the Court of Appeals reading of the statute would contemplate mere advocacy of abstract ideas within the ambit of the statute and therefore the oath. 
    And also mere membership, mere knowing membership in an organization, not even necessarily qualified to active membership and certainly not qualified to membership with specific intent to support the goals, the unlawful goals of the organization.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="371.522" stopTime="385.196">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well is that your argument that the oath as construed by the highest court of the state, it means something more than it seems to say?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="385.196" stopTime="399.990">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Well, our argument is that the oath as read with the statute as construed by the highest court of the state clearly contemplates that which this Court declared unconstitutionally broad and vague in Keyishian and Elfbrandt and Baggett.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="399.990" stopTime="407.463">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But I believe the statute out as it -- would you perhaps -- what is your presentation to us?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="407.463" stopTime="410.622">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    If the statute is just left out entirely, well --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="410.622" stopTime="410.796">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes.
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="410.796" stopTime="413.795">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    -- we have great deal of difficulty leaving the statute out. 
    There's no other authority --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="413.795" stopTime="414.195">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I understand that.
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="414.195" stopTime="414.973">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    -- in the oath.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="414.973" stopTime="415.609">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I understand that.
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="415.609" stopTime="433.102">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    But leaving the statute out, it's our position that the phrase “in one way or another" which is a phrase admitted -- accepted by the Court of Appeals of Maryland and by this Court in the Gerende case has no definite meaning. 
    And if it does have a definite meaning, it's too broad.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="433.102" stopTime="439.652">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So it come back to reliance on that phrase for all of them on the construction of the act on the Shub case.
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="439.652" stopTime="443.379">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Well, if you insist Justice Fortas that we have to leave the statute out, I --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I wasn't trying to insist that; I was trying to --
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="445.645" stopTime="447.008">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    I do rely upon that phrase but we also make an --

    (Inaudible) relied on your (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="448.544" stopTime="498.641">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    We also make another substantive argument with respect to the oath if it's read by itself and that is we believe that these negative disclaimers by themselves, by their very nature, violations of the First Amendment that -- just is across the board requirement that one say, “I am not disloyal”, whatever that means. 
    But that's a violation of the First Amendment. 
    In addition, we suggest as the brief amicus curiae of the AAUP did that this kind of an oath, not giving anybody an opportunity to explain or get clarification of the oath or explain his reasons for not stating he is not disloyal that by not giving any opportunity for a hearing or an explanation that the oath violates procedural due process in the First Amendment context.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="498.641" stopTime="510.180">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Would you say that if you required a teacher to swear that if he would uphold the constitution of the United States that would be unconstitutional.
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="510.180" stopTime="535.979">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    That's a harder case Justice Fortas of course. 
    I think we might be willing to argue that there's no warrant for an across the board declaration by all persons but I think we might fall back to an intermediate position and suggest that if teachers were singled out as the only group to swear, only group among public employees that that would raise people protection problems for us if --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="535.979" stopTime="538.731">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, all federal employees have to take an oath to have effect?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="538.731" stopTime="540.270">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Right.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="540.270" stopTime="548.607">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Are you suggesting that that would be unconstitutional for federal employees or in the group of federal employees?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="548.607" stopTime="573.370">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    No. 
    In this case, we don't think we have to reach the question whether an affirmative declaration of allegiance is unconstitutional. 
    We certainly see that there's a basis in the text of the constitution itself for this kind of a declaration. 
    So I can't answer that question so far as my client is concerned. 
    Definitively, we're faced with a negative disclaimer and it's not an affirmative declaration.

    (Inaudible)

    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You're not going to affirm (Inaudible).
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="583.984" stopTime="619.726">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Well, we do go so far as to suggest that a loyalty oath that requires a negative disclaimer, I am not disloyal, I am not a subversive person, I am not engaged in, that this carries such encored connotations that it is itself an undue burden on the First Amendment. 
    So far as an affirmative statement of allegiance is concerned, we don't go so far in this case as to argue that that would be unconstitutional. 
    We'd like to see that case before we had to address ourselves to the particular issue of course. 
    If I may proceed --

    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    It could be taken to mean other than by force or violence and certainly even if read to be modified by force or violence, it could be taken to mean adherence to an organization engaged or about to be engaged and overthrow without any specific --

speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="653.466" stopTime="683.531">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Well, that's not quite accurate Justice Harlan. 
    Maryland didn't do that and Attorney General of Maryland made a recommendation. 
    Just as an Attorney General in Gerende stated that he would advise various officials in the state to give the oath that was approved or apparently approved in Gerende. 
    As a matter of fact Justice Harlan, that oath was never consistently given, there are subdivisions in this -- in the State of Maryland they're still giving the oath in terms of the definitional phrase in Section 1 of the Act.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="683.531" stopTime="686.652">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    So far as this Act is concerned (Inaudible).
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="686.652" stopTime="687.416">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Right.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="687.416" stopTime="689.091">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you not?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="689.091" stopTime="894.987">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    That's right. 
    So far as the oath that Mr. Whitehill was requested or required to sign, it did not include the membership provision. 
    I will argue further along that the Attorney General probably has no authority or not adequate authority, or power to rewrite the oath and you certainly has adequate authority or power to rewrite the statute which was judicially construed albeit not as clearly as we would like in the Shub case. 
    Basically, appellant agrees that the first issue before the Court is the current status of the Gerende decision. 
    However, before addressing or readdressing myself as the case maybe to Gerende, it might be appropriate for me to just outline briefly the four substantive or meritorious grounds on which appellant contends that the oath and the statute are unconstitutional. 
    First, I suggest that it's our position that the oath and the statute were unconstitutionally broad, vague and uncertain in degradation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. 
    Second, we contend that this indiscriminate loyalty of or non-disloyalty disclaimer, otherwise unconstitutionally infringes the First and Fourteenth Amendment freedoms of belief, association and academic freedom. 
    Third, in violation of procedural due process, the oath and the statute further infringe the First and Fourteenth Amendment interests by denying public employment without affording any hearing on questions of loyalty or subversiveness and by shifting burdens of proof with respect to these questions to the applicant. 
    And fourth, together the statute and the oath constitute an unlawful bill of attainder. 
    Now this Court's decision in Gerende, the 1951 very brief per curiam decision in Gerende involved Section 15 of the Act, so-called Candidate's Oath. 
    In Gerende, the Court relied upon the Court of Appeals of Maryland's construction of that provision in Shub versus Simpson. 
    Perhaps if I could refresh Your Honor's memories with respect to Gerende, in that case you said, “The scope of the state law was passed on -- in Shub". 
    We read this decision to hold that to obtain a place on a Maryland ballot for candidate need only make oath that he is not a person who is engaged "in one way or another in the attempt to overthrow the government by force or violation,” and that he is not knowingly a member of an organization engaged in such an attempt. 
    At the bar of this Court, the Attorney General of the State of Maryland declared that he would advise the proper authorities to and accept an affidavit in these terms to satisfying in full the statutory requirement. 
    Under these circumstances and with this understanding, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 
    Now appellees insist that the decision in Gerende in effect severs the certification or oath from the statute and insulates it, claimed innocuous on its face as we've just discussed from constitutional attack. 
    Appellant respectfully disagrees. 
    First, the certification is not innocuous on its phase.

    That is, I do not hold or act upon certain political ideals which is purely First Amendment matter. 
    If you ask a man who is to be admitted to the practice of law, have you ever been convicted of a felony?

    The very narrowness of that inquiry only highlights Section 14 of the statute and Section 10 of the statute. 
    Section 10 says that no subversive person shall be employed by the state. 
    Section 14 provides for continual surveillance of persons in the employee of the state, including teachers, including Mr. Whitehill had he been employed by the state. 
    Continual surveillance of these people to determine whether --

    I don't see that those are before us.Are you arguing that they're before us (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="1369.232" stopTime="1471.801">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Yes we are. 
    We are arguing -- our basic argument Justice Fortas is that you cannot in the light of the Elfbrandt decision in particular read this oath without its statute. 
    In Elfbrandt, you'll recall Justice Fortas that the oath on its face was apparently innocuous. 
    It was even an affirmative declaration of allegiance. 
    One didn't find out what the defect in the oath was until he read the statute and discovered the legislature had put a specific gloss upon the oath and a gloss that this Court found was unduly broad. 
    The same thing is true in this case. 
    We can't conceive of how the oath can be read without the statute, where the Attorney General himself, in his brief suggests that the authority for requiring the appellant to execute the certification is found in Section 11 of the statute. 
    That's the only authority that the Attorney General that any state agent has for giving this oath. 
    As Justice Sobeloff suggested in his special concurrence in Whitehill, I am inclined to agree that the prescribed oath or statement is not to be judged in isolation but in conjunction with the statute. 
    For in the absence of a statute, there would be no authority for demanding any statement under the penalty of perjury. 
    There is no other basis for this statement to be requested or rather demanded of these people. 
    That's the only authority the state has to ask the -- it's not possible, we submit to therefore read the oath without its underlying statutory authority.

    I understand that.
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="1526.019" stopTime="1568.443">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    On the Sweezy case Justice Stewart, the Attorney General was authorized somehow, by the legislature of New Hampshire to make inquiry to investigate subversive activities in the State of New Hampshire. 
    The Supreme Court, this Court overturned I believe a contempt citation of one called Sweezy basically on the grounds that it didn't know what the authority, the scope of authority of the Attorney General was in the -- in this First Amendment area without some clear -- very clear statement to the authority of the Attorney General. 
    His activities would therefore abridge First Amendment rights which -- including academic freedom.

    Yes.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1656.233" stopTime="1658.598">

speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="1663.409" stopTime="1752.607">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    That is in effect correct. 
    But we would like to buttress this by suggesting in the Garner case, Justice Frankfurter suggested, and that was in the same term as Gerende. 
    The Attorney General of Maryland did not give this assurance, the assurance he gave in the Gerende case. 
    As a matter of personal relaxation, I believe a requirement. 
    He was able to give it on the basis of the interpretation that the Court of Appeals of Maryland, the highest court of that state had placed upon the legislation. 
    The Court of Appeals of Maryland has not pass upon this legislation since that statement was made. 
    All he has to go on is the interpretation of the statute and the oath that was made in the Shub case back in 1950, and the operative legal rules with respect to First Amendment interest in the oath area, particularly with respect to vagueness, breadth, and indefiniteness, have been significantly changed. 
    As he himself recognized by attempting to delete from the oath -- the phrase I -- and I am not a member of -- knowingly a member of an organization engaged in such an attempt. 
    Now he can try to do that, he can delete it from the oath. 
    But of course if we're right in our view that the oath can't be read without the statute, that won't get him anywhere. 
    And we suggest further that it's entirely possible if he has no authority to act. 
    So, in particularly in this First Amendment area, it's incumbent upon the Court to closely examine whether or not he has such authority to act.

   Argument of Loring E. Hawes
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1848.913" stopTime="1850.744">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Hawes.
speaker="loring_e_hawes" startTime="1850.744" stopTime="2027.546">
    Mr. Loring E. Hawes 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I should first like to distinguish this interpretation of Elfbrandt that was presented here with respect to the legislative gloss. 
    Now in Elfbrandt, the reason that legislative gloss became important was that the perjury portion of the statute incorporated within it that the person who is taking the oath shall not knowingly and willfully become or remain a member of the Communist Party, etcetera. 
    This is not the case in the Maryland certification situation because the Maryland perjury statute is simply a criminal statute for making a false statement. 
    Now, the words “in one way or another,” we fail to see how these words could possibly give anyone any trouble. 
    I mean, in any way. 
    Its mere surplusage, its additional language was neither adds to nor takes away from the words or meaning of the oath itself. 
    The Court on a number of occasions has found no constitutional difficulty from the vagueness standpoint in construing the words overthrow the government by force and violence. 
    These words have been used in federal statutes such as the Smith Act and the vices of vagueness which has been found in other oaths and other laws and not been found in those words. 
    The oath in Baggett versus Bullitt which was referable to a Washington statute which is identical to that in Maryland is distinguishable also. 
    In that case, the oath said that, I certify that I'm not a subversive person as defined by the Act and there was no limitation upon the definition of subversive person in that case, in the oath that was taken in the State of Washington. 
    And so the case of Baggett versus Bullitt does not constitute a precedent for overruling Gerende or making the Maryland oath as presently stated invalid.

    Mr. Loring E. Hawes 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The question of the authority of the Attorney General is apparently still bothering the Court. 
    And I should once again try to establish where this authority comes from and how it affects this interpretation of the law here. 
    Now, this may not be in the brief, but in Article 5, Section 3 of the Maryland constitution, it is stated that the Attorney General shall give his opinion in writing on any legal matter or subject. 
    And in Code Article 32A of the Maryland Annotated Code Section 3, the Attorney General shall have general charge supervision and direction of a legal business of the other state and shall be legal adviser and representative of and perform all legal work for boards, institutions, departments, etcetera of the state. 
    Now the University of Maryland of course is a department, an institution or an agency of the state. 
    The applicable part of Section 11 of the overact is that every board in this case would be the Board of Regents or other agency of the state which employs --and so forth employee shall establish by rules, regulations or otherwise procedures designed to ascertain before any person is appointed or employed that he or she as the case maybe is not a subversive person and that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that such persons are subversive persons. 
    Now, this is quite similar to the charge in Section 15 which was construed by this Court in Gerende where an affidavit was required for a person who is a candidate for election. 
    That he is -- he or she is not a subversive person as defined in this Article. 
    And our argument here is that if the oath prescribed here which was the one that this Court said was sufficient under Gerende can be given under Section 15 that certainly the same oath should be able to be given under Section 11 of the Act.

speaker="loring_e_hawes" startTime="3029.476" stopTime="3101.850">
    Mr. Loring E. Hawes 
    Well, in the letter that is in the appendix to appellant's brief on page 18A, which is a second page to the letter from Attorney General Finan to Governor Tawes dated May 13, 1966. 
    In that letter, the Attorney General suggested -- and this is giving his legal advice to the agency -- to all of state agencies. 
    In this case, to the governor, to the Secretary of State, commissioner-personnel, and a copy of course went to the University of Maryland. 
    And on the basis of this letter, it is up to the state agency involved to prescribe the oath and to give it to its employees. 
    Now, there is one distinction here with respect to commissioner-personnel -- he does not prescribe the personnel procedures for the University of Maryland because of the Autonomy Act of 1952. 
    And this clause --
speaker="justtice_white" startTime="3101.850" stopTime="3107.103">

speaker="loring_e_hawes" startTime="3149.600" stopTime="3164.090">

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3306.766" stopTime="3329.355">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Voice Overlap) where is the power of the Attorney General to modify an Act of the legislature which says one thing? 
    Or do you contend that you have broad general powers to make regulations of this kind of change and it will.
speaker="loring_e_hawes" startTime="3329.355" stopTime="3657.046">
    Mr. Loring E. Hawes 
    Well, the -- let's look at this way. 
    The -- we're talking about two O's here. 
    First, the one prior to 1966 which is in identical words of what this Court said in Gerende, the Attorney General could advise the state agencies as conforming with I guess the Maryland law and satisfying its requirements completely. 
    Now, what the Attorney General has done here is to limit that further. 
    Now if the department had not taken his advice and used the old pledge, we might be up here on a different case. 
    But in this case, he did not, the department -- of the Board of Regents took the Attorney General's advice and use this to take the form. 
    Now with respect to the negative nature of the oath which was brought up, we would say this is -- in the very fact that you could have an oath, this doesn't differ too much from the certifications that the facts are true and correct and so forth that one makes on your income tax forms, employment applications, auto registration, auto licenses and so forth. 
    And on those -- on certain types of applications, an applicant maybe asked whether he is taking narcotics or his -- a consumer of a certain amount of alcohol or certain other very personnel type of questions which don't reach First Amendment freedoms, beliefs or speech and so forth but nevertheless or in the same type of form that this particular certification is. 
    Now, with respect to the -- the extent of the oath in reaching the innocent person who is a mere member of an organization or something of this sort, it should be noted that the oath itself -- the title to the other law itself -- the Act itself states that this is an Act to add a new Article making it a crime to commit acts or advocate acts intended to affect the overthrow of the government and so forth by an -- violence and so forth or to attempt or conspire to do so. 
    Now, this Title and the Act itself which construed by the Maryland Court as set forth in our brief, as its intention is to prevent infiltration into our state, county and municipal governments of person who are engaged in one way or another in the attempt to overthrow the government by force or violence. 
    And this interpretation of the intent of the Act was taken in by this Court in Gerende to be the full meaning of it. 
    And it is our contention that a certification in this language therefore is sufficient under all the cases involving loyalty oaths to this time. 
    And that this Court would have to overrule Gerende and possibly Garner or Cramp and at least distinguish these cases if it were to make an adverse ruling with respect to this oath on the grounds of vagueness.
