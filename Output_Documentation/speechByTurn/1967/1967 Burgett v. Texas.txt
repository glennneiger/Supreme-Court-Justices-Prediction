Burgett v. Texas
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="13.570">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 53, James Cleveland Burgett versus Texas. 
    Mr. Gooch.
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="13.570" stopTime="164.881">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Petitioner, James Burgett seeks the indication of his right to counsel. 
    He was convicted in a Texas State Court on a jury verdict of ten years. 
    He was -- had his conviction affirmed on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas and on his own motion obtained a writ of certiorari in your court. 
    He was indicted for assault with intent to murder. 
    The charges against him were brought by a jailer in the town of Greenville, Texas where he was being held for a trial. 
    At the time of his trial as his trial proceeded, his court appointed counsel in Greenville filed a motion to quash the indictment which alleged four prior convictions which the state used to invoke one of the habitual criminal statutes, the result of which would be life imprisonment. 
    There was no state procedure available before trial to attack the prior convictions. 
    The motion to quash as set out in the statutes applied only to technical features of the indictment such as an illegally constituted grand jury. 
    Nevertheless, the court appointed lawyer moved to quash, stating that he didn't have enough information to make any further attack. 
    There was no action taken insofar as the record is concerned on his motion to quash but the counsel really couldn't expect the Court to take any motion since the Texas law was clear that the defendant was not entitled to have copies of the prior convictions that were going to be used against him and that the defendant was not entitled to object prior to trial to the use of any prior conviction, instead he had to make his objection in front of the jury. 
    As the trial began, the state read the indictment and the jury was told that petitioner was duly and legally convicted on four prior occasions. 
    As the evidence came in, the state introduced into evidence one version, first of one of the Tennessee convictions alleged. 
    That conviction stated on its face that petitioner did not have counsel. 
    There was a --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="164.881" stopTime="166.528">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That was a conviction for what?
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="166.528" stopTime="167.792">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    Forgery Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="167.792" stopTime="169.712">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    A felony in Tennessee or?
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="169.712" stopTime="300.644">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The conviction recited on his face that he had appeared in court without counsel and there was absolutely nothing in the record to indicate that counsel had been tendered to him or that he had waived counsel. 
    His court appointed lawyer objected on the ground that the conviction showed on its face that petitioner did not have counsel and that there was no indication of waiver which brought him squarely within Carnley against Cochran. 
    Secondly, he raised the issue of course under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The judge reserved ruling and the state offered the same conviction and evidence, this time, a different and inconsistent certified copy of the same conviction. 
    The second version did not have a recitation that counsel was not present. 
    It was simply silent on whether counsel was present. 
    Again, there was no language in the second certified copy of the same conviction to indicate that petitioner had been tendered counsel or that he had waived counsel. 
    The Court then proceeded to receive evidence again without making a ruling and again over counsel's objections, proceeded to hear evidence concerning a Texas conviction for burglary, the preceding in 1964. 
    The judge after a hearing, partially in camara, ruled out the Texas conviction on the ground that it was void on state law grounds. 
    He did not admit the first version of the Tennessee conviction that recited that petitioner was of -- without counsel. 
    He did admit into evidence the second inconsistent version of the Tennessee conviction stating -- overruling defendant's objections, the trial proceeding. 
    There was nothing else in the record to indicate what happened until the Court's charge in which the Court charged the jury that they had heard certain evidence that tended to show that the defendant had been guilty of previous crimes and that they were not to consider that for any purpose.

    Sir, the other two Tennessee convictions were never directly offered into evidence.

speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="390.216" stopTime="564.407">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I like to place myself now in the shoes of the District Attorney in this rural county of Texas just before petitioner's trial. 
    He was indicted early in April of 1965 on this habitual criminal charge to be tried later that month. 
    As evidence, I as the District Attorney have four alleged prior convictions. 
    Now, only two are required under the Texas Act but I decided to use four prior convictions which I am permitted to do by the Court of Criminal Appeals. 
    I look at this convictions and I see that at least one Tennessee conviction that I'm going to offer in evidence is inconsistent. 
    I have their -- I do not know and cannot tell which is the true certified copy of the Tennessee conviction. 
    But this I can see that on the certified copy of the conviction that I'm going to offer in evidence it affirmatively states that petitioner was without counsel. 
    And also, there is nothing in any of the convictions or any of the papers certified under Civil Secretary of State of Tennessee or of the clerk to indicate that petitioner was offered counsel or that he waived his right to counsel. 
    As the case goes to trial, my opponent files a motion asking to see -- asking for more information about this convictions that I'm going to offer in evidence. 
    I do not have to give it to him and I don't give it to him. 
    Instead, I make him make an objection in front of the jury after I've already read the indictment to him and an indictment to the jury, I make my opponent object in front of a jury and assert at that time petitioner's constitutional rights. 
    The first opportunity really that petitioner's counsel had. 
    The trial judge admits the conviction and the trial proceeds. 
    The jury is never told that petitioner was never validly convicted. 
    They're simply instructed at that late date not at the time the evidence was offered but at the time of the charge not to consider. 
    I don't see how any lawyer reading Carnley against Cochran and Gideon against Wainwright, could reach the conclusion that those convictions could -- were valid and could be used in evidence against petitioner or could be used to invoke the Habitual Criminal Act of the State of Texas.

    Do we know that there was no waiver of counsel in the Tennessee case?

    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    If the Court please, I cannot honestly say that for this reason insofar as the record before this Court is concerned there is no indication that petitioner waived counsel. 
    If I were permitted to testify based on what petitioner told me, I would say that he was not tendered counsel --

    Well, (Inaudible) --

    -- and he did not waive it.

    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    By the same token, the State of Texas never contended in the trial court that there was any waiver. 
    They never contended in the Court of Criminal Appeals that petitioner waived counsel. 
    In response to petitioner's petition, they conceded that their proof failed because respondent did not have counsel in Tennessee and only in their brief that they include as exhibits two affidavits filed long after the record were certified in this Court purporting to be affidavits of the trial judge and the District Attorney, reciting the conclusion that petitioner waived counsel. 
    I was given no notice that these affidavits were going to be taken. 
    I was given no opportunity to cross-examine these state's witnesses. 
    Petitioner was given no opportunity to confront these witnesses against him and petitioner was given no hearing in which his credibility could be placed in context with these affidavits.

speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="685.729" stopTime="711.657">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    Sir, I believe the Court's already said that in Carnley against Cochran expressly that unless there is an allegation or evidence of waiver or unless the judgment itself shows waiver, the conviction is void. 
    And petitioner's counsel did all that he had to do under Carnley against Cochran to throw the burden back on the state by pointing out that the -- there is an affirmative showing of no counsel and no showing of waiver.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I wonder then if you haven't left out a very important thing with this appeal. 
    So, I mean, the facts that the alleged four indictments or four convictions against this man in the indictment and read those all four of them to the jury and then made no attempt at all to prove to them.
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="775.960" stopTime="787.898">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="787.898" stopTime="789.244">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="789.244" stopTime="878.874">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    And the standard on appeal on those cases provides no relief that the penalty is not enhanced which is exactly the position taken by the Court of Criminal Appeals on appeal. 
    They would not let Mr. Burgett even have his case considered because, under their own decisions, unless the penalty has actually been enhanced, the petitioner has no standing to complain about the use of the prior convictions and evidence against him. 
    In particular, the case that they relied on, their most recent case, the defendant was given 99 years instead of life imprisonment and the Court of Criminal Appeals held that he had no standing to complain because he only got 99 years instead of life under the enhanced statute. 
    So based on appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeals with no prospect of securing consideration of his claim that his trial jury was prejudiced by this evidence being alleged in the indictment read to him, offered into evidence and then only slightly cured if it all by the instruction of the Court. 
    If the Court please, this is strictly in violation of your rule in Chapman against California which requires when there's unconstitutionally obtained or used evidence comes into the trial if the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not contribute to the result in this case.

    And as the Second Circuit held under Rotier against Labely (ph), the defendant is entitled to a hearing on recidivism free from the taint of this void prior convictions that the state, really, I don't believe can sustain their burden of showing that it had no effect at all on the jury's ten year sentence.

    The only alternative is to insulate the judgment from attack and let him suffer the harm. 
    Let him go back to the other state and attack it which he probably can't do and in Texas is not permitted to do. 
    And in fact, in Texas, he's not even permitted to tell the jury that he is attacking in a sister state, his prior conviction on the ground that they -- it was obtained unconstitutionally. 
    The only alternative is to say that once you have an out of state conviction that the man cannot challenge it at all and he has to suffer whatever penalty is -- because I don't believe that that is a position that the Court want to take.

    Well, the tuning if I read it correctly Your Honor, it depends on the restraints that are being placed on the man presently. 
    It may well be that Tennessee would have to give him a hearing. 
    But more importantly, Texas should give him the hearing. 
    Texas is much of a position to determine this as anyone else. 
    If --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1282.135" stopTime="1304.595">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I gather your position would be to -- if you put yourself back in the shoes of the state's attorney, he wants to offer this prior crime and he offers them in the presence of the jury and the jury hears them and the judge excludes them and he gives an instruction. 
    You should come up here with the same argument.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But why wouldn't you? 
    The jury has heard the fact to the -- of the claim prior conviction. 
    The judge says that, “Well, that man was convicted without counsel. 
    I exclude it.” 
    The jury -- the judge wouldn't necessarily follow from your position that you must have a separate hearing on the admissibility of this evidence outside the presence of the jury.
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="1327.455" stopTime="1337.397">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    Yes, sir.

    I don't believe so. 
    He was indicted for that and they're recited in the judgment that he was convicted repetition of offense but from the sentence that he received, he did not receive enhanced punishment. 
    So I really believe that's a clerical error although as far as the record is concerned, he was convicted as a criminal repeater.

    Did the jury come in and say that they found him guilty of this offense?

    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    No, I perhaps tried to compress too much in one sentence. 
    The jury would never -- was not charged on the habitual criminal. 
    Well, you say, were only charged on assault with intent to murder in a lesser included offenses. 
    They returned a verdict of guilty in ten years. 
    The judge, when he entered the formal conviction against the road on the face of the conviction, convicted assault with intent to murder repetition of offense. 
    So insofar as the formal judgment of conviction is before you, it reads assault with intent to murder, repetition of offense.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1494.756" stopTime="1501.284">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Repetition of offense is a means the recidivist statute.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, It seems to me that the first question we may have before us is whether they consider this as a recidivist case or as a case of conviction under the assault with intent to murder statute.

    Despite --

    He was --

    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    Yes, sir. 
    And that -- the jury does -- was not asked a question concerning whether or not this man was convicted of other crimes which would have been the procedure otherwise. 
    Now, I wish -- I would like to save a little time in rebuttal. 
    I do wish to make one other statement and that is that petitioner was not given the opportunity to be present when the prosecution conducted the voir dire examination of the jury and it seems to me that the -- with -- it's very clear or how critical -- critically important it is for the man to be sitting there so he can observe the jury when the prosecutor is asking the questions, so that he can form a basis of who's going to be leading which way so he and his lawyer can have an adequate opportunity to strike the people that they think are against them from the start. 
    So that the petitioner can be assured when the jury gets in the box that he hadn't even started with the prosecution and that he knows as the best that you can know that he is going to get a fair shake of the jury.

    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    Alright, Your Honor, (Inaudible). 
    When this Dallas County conviction was ruled out incorrectly, this was a 33. 
    The Court could affirmed that or it could reform that judgment. 
    The Court of Criminal Appeals could reform that judgment on appeal or if even as in the penitentiary it could not been collaterally attacked and so if it had 33 years, it was still a good conviction. 
    It wasn't bad faith on the part of the prosecutor. 
    It was a bad ruling on the part of the trial court that kept the Dallas County conviction out. 
    On these habitual criminal cases, the conviction must be prior in time. 
    The commission and the conviction must be prior. 
    And one conviction had prior to commission of the next act. 
    So when the Dallas County conviction went out then the prosecutor could not go forward with the Tennessee conviction so he had to withdraw the Tennessee conviction. 
    So what the prosecutor could have shown in regard to the Tennessee convictions is not in this record. 
    So then when the Dallas County conviction went out, he could not go any further as a matter of law with the Tennessee conviction. 
    So that's the record you have before you and the fact that it went to the jury or if they heard about it and the Court instruct it. 
    Let's look at this. 
    There was no objection for the fact --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2055.641" stopTime="2060.716">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why was it -- it couldn't -- you couldn't put the Tennessee conviction in?
speaker="leon_douglas" startTime="2060.716" stopTime="2080.010">
    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    They couldn't put the Tennessee convictions in because for a circuit conviction, it must be of like character and the forgery is not of like character to assault, intent to murder under Texas law. 
    So as a matter of law then that went out of the case and they had to go back to the assault with intent to murder.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2080.010" stopTime="2082.480">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, why didn't you put it in your indictment?
speaker="leon_douglas" startTime="2082.480" stopTime="2101.106">
    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    Because -- assuming that the Dallas County conviction was good in which the record and the law that I've cited in the brief I think would show was good, used the Dallas County conviction then we could go to the Tennessee conviction. 
    You have to have three of them under Article 63 to get the habitual. 
    Now to bring it down to the second case, there -- for the second offend there --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2101.106" stopTime="2103.773">

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2187.689" stopTime="2241.472">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Alright. 
    Now let me ask you this. 
    You have said that it's necessary to overrule Spencer if we're going to reverse this case, leaving out all except the two convictions concerning which no evidence was offered at all. 
    What comfort do you get out of Spencer for saying that a prosecutor can go before a grand jury and have four convictions charged against the man and then when he gets to trial reads it -- reads the indictment with the four convictions to the jury and then makes no effort at all to approve two of them.
speaker="leon_douglas" startTime="2241.472" stopTime="2242.369">
    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    Well, if it would be --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2242.369" stopTime="2251.548">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I just -- you said we have to overrule Spencer and I just want to know what comfort you'd get out of Spencer if you think Spencer said anything of that kind?
speaker="leon_douglas" startTime="2251.548" stopTime="2291.252">
    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    In Reed Your Honor, there were eight prior convictions and you needed three. 
    I don't get any comfort out of it except that it could have been a habitual crime -- habitual criminal case if the state had been permitted under the law to prove those cases to make three of them. 
    If we've been permitted, we could have made -- I say that we could have made a life sentence case if he hadn't incorrectly ruled out the Dallas case and that's no -- that's when the law says, you can't go any further. 
    When we knocked out the Dallas case, well we could not go any further as a matter of law and that's the reason it was not -- they couldn't go in to those.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2291.252" stopTime="2297.060">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did you offer them to show you good faith in having charged them in the indictment?
speaker="leon_douglas" startTime="2297.060" stopTime="2309.108">
    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    May I go on to this good faith. 
    The district attorney offered to stipulate the prior convictions and the -- they -- there's nothing in this record to show that they wanted to see these prior convictions ahead of time.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2309.108" stopTime="2313.482">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But he wouldn't expect them to -- that they were all bad, would you?
speaker="leon_douglas" startTime="2313.482" stopTime="2315.421">
    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    Your Honor, I don't know if they're bad. 
    The Tennessee --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="leon_douglas" startTime="2316.789" stopTime="2374.402">
    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    The Tennessee law, we could look at that just a moment. 
    It has -- had a statute since 1855 requiring appointment of counsel in all felony cases. 
    And even in misdemeanor cases. 
    I checked the cases in Tennessee and I found three that mentioned without counsel. 
    One of them was reversed or about three of them reversed because it didn't give them enough time to prepare -- appointed counsel to prepare for trial. 
    Another case was reversed because the justice of the peace did not advice the defendant of all his rights or right to counsel. 
    No cases were reversed. 
    I looked through the Sixth Circuit cases from back past the Gideon versus Wainwright. 
    I found no cases that had been reversed in the Sixth Circuit or denial of counsel in Tennessee. 
    And with that, I think that looking at the law there, no case has been reversed in Tennessee. 
    I couldn't -- I think it's a presumption that he perhaps had a lawyer. 
    And --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2374.402" stopTime="2377.730">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So rather that's a presumption there, I think.
speaker="leon_douglas" startTime="2377.730" stopTime="2431.732">
    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    Well, it -- when no cases had -- there was, excuse me. 
    There was one case reversed, Chandler versus Fretag was reversed in this Court. 
    That was a Tennessee conviction. 
    Here, the man was charged as habitual. 
    They asked if he want a lawyer and he did not. 
    He later found out that he was charged an habitual criminal, he said, I want a lawyer. 
    They denied him a lawyer. 
    Under those circumstances, this Court reversed. 
    And that's the only cases -- I wouldn't say that's all of them, but that's the only cases that I know of. 
    Now, under -- we started out of course as a -- as an habitual and under these cases that are submitted to the -- that I have submitted to you that we couldn't go forward with those. 
    Now, I don't think there's any bad faith shown. 
    I think it's a bad ruling on the trial court and this defendant made no objection to the reading of that indictment because of these prior convictions in it, but there is nothing in the record he showed to ask -- to see this judgment. 
    And if you permit this proceed --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    Yes sir. 
    Texas has the procedure. 
    Everything that the appellant or the petitioner's complaining about has a procedure now as -- and even in capital cases where you have a separate hearing on this habitual criminal cases where you read the -- you do not read the prior convictions to the jury. 
    You read the indictment on the primary offense. 
    You have penal -- you have the guilt hearing and after that's over then you submit it to the jury. 
    We have changed that effective January the 1st of 1967.

    In all cases. 
    When we're up on Spencer, we had it in the felony cases and now in the ordinary felony. 
    Now we have it all cases, capital, felony and misdemeanors where jail time might be assessed.

    Mr. Leon Douglas 
    It cannot happen again. 
    Article 3707, there is a case that's not cited in Southwestern (Inaudible) is the Williams case and our court has indicated or shown that the capital cases and all the case now while you have a separate hearing. 
    We now have a motion to suppress. 
    If this evidence was not admissible under our system now, we have this motion to suppress and it would not go to the jury since it would not be read under 3707 and Article 2801, while we have a motion to suppress. 
    Our procedure has been corrected and I think that under the case of McClellan versus U.S. where we had a case came up that this Court denied a read in and where they had courts of inquiry, not of publicity while the legislature changed that and this Court says that we will not reverse this because Texas has corrected its procedure. 
    And with that, we submit to you that this case should be affirmed.

   Rebuttal of Gordon Gooch
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="2985.743" stopTime="3138.957">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I have to make several points in a short time. 
    First, I'd like to say is that Mr. Douglas I believe gave you the order backwards. 
    The Tennessee convictions were offered first and the judge did not preclude any evidence coming in on the Tennessee convictions that were offered. 
    The judge specifically said that he would reserve his rulings until the District Attorney offered all evidence that he was going to offer. 
    And when the district attorney -- this is on page 36 to 41 in the record. 
    Secondly, obviously then the state was not prevented from making any proof they cared to make in connection with the Tennessee conviction that was admitted in the evidence. 
    Third, I don't see how they conceivably could make this a life sentence case not only with these convictions but also in the brief they argued because the jury knew that the defendant was in jail, that the jury could take that evidence into consideration and impose a life sentence. 
    The plain truth is he wasn't even convicted at the time that he was held in jail. 
    Next, the offer to stipulate the choice that the defendant has to make is -- make these constitutional objections in front of the jury suffer the prejudice are stipulated outside the presence of the jury when the state has the right to require the defendant to put on any evidence that he has about punishment outside the presence of the jury. 
    But the defendant doesn't have that right, only the state. 
    We only ask that the odds be evened a little bit. 
    Secondly, the motion to quash the indictment does not go to striking prior convictions. 
    It's simply to the form and substance, the content and it does not cover this point in the statute. 
    It does not cover those points in the cases. 
    Next, there was an objection to the Dallas conviction. 
    What they offered first was the Dallas indictment. 
    The Dallas conviction was objected to. 
    Next, this can happen again. 
    This can happen again for the simple reason that even with the two state's trial, the state can still under the present law use these void convictions during the punishment phase of the trial, unless the defendant has some way in advance to prevent them from doing so. 
    After guilt has been determined and you begin the punishment phase, the indictment is read to the jury and we're right back where we started.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3138.957" stopTime="3155.749">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But Mr. Gooch, that's a different point really from the one that you're here on in this case, which is, as I understood you in light of the sentence here, there was prejudice and what happened about these other convictions, which entitles your man to a reversal of his -- of this conviction.
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="3155.749" stopTime="3161.509">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    I believe that Mr. Burgett was prejudiced not only on the issue of punishment but also on the issue of guilt (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    That's true, sir, but he'd still be prejudiced when the jury gives (Voice Overlap) --

    But it --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3174.041" stopTime="3178.911">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You're here really on prejudice in the conviction itself, aren't you?
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="3178.911" stopTime="3181.041">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    And the punishment since the jury sets the punishment.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3181.041" stopTime="3187.422">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It will be content if the result here where it would set aside for a new determination of punishment?
speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="3187.422" stopTime="3200.969">
    Mr. Gordon Gooch 
    If the Court please, I have to think about that. 
    I certainly would though better than have Mr. Burgett spend the next ten years of his life with this -- in his way.
