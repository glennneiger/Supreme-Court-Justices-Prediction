Sibron v. New York

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Nelson Sibron, Appellant versus New York. 
    Mr. Juviler.

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The New York County District Attorney's office appears as amicus curiae in both the Sibron case number 63 and the Peters number 74. 
    Time for oral argument has been made available to us from the time allotted to the Sibron case. The interest of amicus as a prosecutor in a major crime infested city is in preserving the constitutionality of the police patrol practices of long standing, which have been codified in the New York stop and frisk statute, the statute that is under attack in both the Sibron and the Peters case. 
    Whether the question is reached in the Sibron case as Mr. Justice White noted yesterday it must be passed in the Peters case, if it is not reached in the Sibron case and the issues therefore as well as the interests of amicus survive the unusual procedural features of the Sibron case. 
    We propose to --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May I ask you if the Peters case was tried on theory that there was a stop and frisk?

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Yeah I believe it was Your Honor from the testimony of the police officer as to his conduct.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="99.292" stopTime="105.270">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That was a rationale of the case, was it, not arrest for probable cause?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="105.270" stopTime="127.403">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    There actually was no express finding by the hearing court, but on a motion to suppress the District Attorney of Westchester County took the position that this was a lawful application of the stop and frisk statute. 
    He did not seek to justify the officer's conduct on the theory of probable cause.

    And on what basis?

    On the basis that the officer lacked reasonable grounds to suspect that the defendant Sibron was behaving in a suspicious manner.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You also do you – what position do you take as to whether the actual frisk or search whichever it maybe as within the scope of statute constitutionally considered?

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    We join with Mr. Siegel in contending that this officer was not really applying the stop and frisk statute at all as was clear from his testimony and that the stop and frisk statute did not apply to the conduct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="200.891" stopTime="205.682">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's not quite an answer. 
    You know the facts in Sibron.

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="206.359" stopTime="230.658">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What the officer did and my question to you, your capacity as representing New York County, is whether you consider that, the action of the officer there in that case in Sibron as being within the scope of the stop and, so called stop and frisk statute constitutionally considered?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="230.658" stopTime="232.199">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    We do not.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="232.199" stopTime="267.627">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In other words then there are two reasons here for the confession of error. 
    One is a lack of reasonable or the basis for reasonable suspicion and the other that this was not what that officer actually did, that is to say reaching into the man's pocket, was not what permitted by the stop and frisk statute in terms of the constitutional limitations from the application of that statute.

    That is exactly our position.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So even if there is reasonable suspicion to within the meaning of the stop and frisk statute, what the officer did it went beyond -- what you think the officer could constitutionally do under the stop and frisk statute?

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well don't you think Peters is a probable cause.

    Well isn't that what happened there?

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well how do we get to stop and frisk now, he had probable cause?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="392.862" stopTime="430.090">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Because I think probable cause has been used in two senses. 
    In one sense, its probable cause to believe that a specific person has committed a crime and that is the standard, which justifies actually taking the suspect to the station house and booking him for burglary. 
    I think perhaps in that sense there was no probable cause at that moment. 
    However probable cause as Mr. Justice White pointed out in the Camara case in the last term in this Court does not always mean probable cause to believe that a particular person has committed a crime.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="430.090" stopTime="433.209">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You just mean – don't you mean he just had – he had reasonable suspicion?

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    He had reasonable suspicion that what he did was reasonable.

    He had a reasonable suspicion to stop him, to stop him and detain him momentarily and to frisk him?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="442.014" stopTime="456.046">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Precisely, and if the label of probable cause to detain is placed on this rather than reasonable suspicion, we would quite agree that under either label, what the officer did was reasonable, it was quite reasonable.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="456.046" stopTime="462.630">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    MBut if there is probable cause, they don't get to the stop and frisk statute, is that correct?

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Only if the facts fail to show probable cause for an actual arrest and booking of the suspect as the appellants urge in these cases.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="472.318" stopTime="481.466">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You agree that if we think that this was a probable cause case, we are prevented from passing on the constitutionality of stop and frisk statute?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="481.466" stopTime="492.703">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    If there was probable cause to believe that Mr. Peters at the time the officer opened his door was attempting a burglary then it would be unnecessary to reach the constitutional question.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="492.703" stopTime="518.110">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    My understanding to say that the state can rely first on arresting a man for probable cause and if they failed in that that, they can fall back to the stop and frisk law and rely on that because well they didn't have probable cause they did have reasonable suspicion?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="518.110" stopTime="554.129">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    I think that as a general practice Mr. Chief Justice, the officer relies first on the stop and frisk powers and only subsequently on the arrest powers. 
    There are undoubtedly borderline cases where in a close case, perhaps Peters is such a case the quantum of evidence does not establish probable cause for arrest, probable cause to believe and yet under all of the facts and circumstances what the officer did was reasonable as that term is employed in the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="554.129" stopTime="572.132">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then you have two bites at it. 
    The first you can try -- first you can try a probable cause and if it fails in the constitutional sense, you can then fall back on your stop and frisk law and say well at all events we are entitled to stop and frisk him and justify the arrest?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="572.132" stopTime="630.172">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    If the standards of the statute are met. 
    I think that what Your Honor suggesting is nothing new in the law of Fourth Amendment. 
    There are cases where an officer will execute a warrant which subsequently proves to have been based on insufficient cause in the officer's affidavit and yet in the course of the officer's subsequent investigation and execution of the warrant, he develops in a lawful manner probable cause for arrest. 
    Now while the principle, impetus historically for that officer's conduct may have been probable cause, this Court has held -- may have in the warrant, this Court has held that if the warrant does not meet the tests of probable cause under the Fourth Amendment, the officer can, as Your Honor suggests, fall back and I see nothing unreasonable about this under the Fourth Amendment, so long as what the officer did was reasonable and fulfills the requirements of the statute.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="630.172" stopTime="632.634">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, let's try your case, I beg your pardon.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="632.634" stopTime="633.857">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No problem.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="633.857" stopTime="660.073">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Let's take a case, if you will, in which the officer has probable cause but he has plenty of time and opportunity to obtain a warrant but without obtaining a warrant acting solely on the basis of probable cause, he arrests the person. 
    Is that arrest valid as a matter of constitutional law?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="660.073" stopTime="678.073">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Under the decisions of this Court it is, unless the officer has deliberately delayed the arrest for some unworthy purpose such as waiting for the suspect to get to his home, so that he can use the arrest as an excuse for searching the home, incident to arrest.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="678.073" stopTime="703.827">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May I ask you this? 
    If in this Sibron case the officer had reasonable suspicion that this man was carrying narcotics, not probable cause for doing so and had proceeded as he proceeded here, will the case be relieved of error?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="703.827" stopTime="777.361">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    I think not because based on the findings of the hearing court as expressed in its colloquy with counsel, the court found that the officer's purpose in reaching for Mr. Sibron's pocket was not self-protection, but rather to seize an object that perhaps the suspect was going to throw to the ground and we do not feel that such an action is reasonable. 
    However, I think there perhaps could be unusual circumstances not raised in any of the cases presently before the Court where a sudden movement by a person detained in a suspicious circumstances, a man who's been observed on tenement roof as the case we cited our brief from the New York files, who was moving from roof to roof late at night and the officer goes up to the tenement roof and stops him and suddenly the man makes an action towards breast pocket, I think there it would be reasonable to eschew in the particular case, the external padding to prevent the additional danger to the officer, but that is not in any of the cases presently before the Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="777.361" stopTime="797.034">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Would you distinguish the Sibron case from the stop-and-frisk law because in Sibron case, they not only said they were looking for weapons but they actually took other things from him and convicted him on that score?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="797.034" stopTime="906.493">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    They took them Mr. Chief Justice in a manner that was not reasonable. 
    We do not feel that only weapons maybe admitted in evidence if the officer's maneuver that discovers something other than a weapon was legitimately and reasonably a frisk for a weapon. 
    But the Sibron case has even further problems than that. 
    The Sibron case, I think it's clear, does not square with the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the stop-and-frisk statute as expressed in its actual written-in opinions, and we propose to address ourselves to the actual degree of intrusion that the stop-and-frisk statute does permit and to compare that to the constitutional standards for reasonable searches and seizures. 
    The first, actually the basic provision in this statute is not the frisk. 
    It's an accident of jurisprudence that the cases that have come before the Court this week have all involved discovery of tangible objects. 
    As the briefs of the National District Attorneys Association makes clear, they have an appendix with sample cases of detention, the average case that have come to the attention of the lower courts and of this Court on petitions for certiorari, are cases where there's merely a stop, a questioning and a detention and this is really the heart of the stop provision. 
    The frisk is merely an adjunct to this more essential part of the stop-and-frisk theory which has been codified after long practice in the New York statute.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="906.493" stopTime="909.311">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    When does the frisk end?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="909.311" stopTime="955.362">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    The frisk ends when the officer determines either by this patting -- either by this padding that there are no grounds to suspect that there is a weapon, I pat myself here it's quite obvious that that's the case or when a potential dangerous weapon such as a gun or a gravity knife, a hard object is felt, the officer then of course in all humanity is entitled to examine internally only that specific region of the suspect's person. 
    Now while the statute uses the word “search” it has been narrowly construed in Judge Keating's opinion in the Peters case to cover only this patting, Your Honors that --

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Yes, that's correct Mr. Justice, unless there's an extraordinary circumstance such as the Court felt existed in the Taggart case. 
    Now, we may different with the Court of Appeals in specific fact situations as to what the extraordinary circumstances are. 
    There, there was specific information relating to a specific weapon at a particular part of the suspect's person. 
    There was a crowd of children around the suspect. 
    Now perhaps, it could be argued both way that this is not dangerous enough --

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Precisely because the standards, for reason -- for intrusion of particular types that are cognizable under the Fourth Amendment vary from case to case. 
    This Court has repeatedly made clear that the standards are flexible, depending upon the circumstances of the particular intrusion, the degree of intrusion and it's the degree of intrusion is proportioned as it is in the stop-frisk-theory to the degree of knowledge that the officer has and this is a reasonable search. 
    I think the Camara case made that quite clear.

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    The (Inaudible) case to which Your Honor refers was decided prior to the passage of the enactment of the stop-and-frisk bill. 
    The stop-and-frisk statute says that the officer may search the person. 
    Now that has been, that has been construed by the police department and by the law enforcement agencies which prepared guidelines, interpreting this law, same agencies that sponsored the law that has been construed as not including opening a briefcase or a ladies handbag. 
    These are items which reasonably can be taken from the suspect during the detention and placed out of reach. 
    We do not urge that opening those items is necessary and I don't think that the Court of Appeals would so hold now at least that is unsettled in New York law since the passage of the statute that is before the Court.

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    I think that will depend upon the facts of the case. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals has stated in the Peters case that the detention is for a short and reasonable period. 
    They have not had occasion to apply that interpretation to specific cases other than the Peter's case itself, which I think is illustrative of a detention. 
    We have to be frank. 
    This is a detention that is reasonable. 
    The officer caught a suspected burglar on a landing after running after the burglar ran down a flight and half of stairs. 
    It was reasonable for him to make a brief detention in order to return the suspect to the scene of the suspected crime --

    Yes, I am arguing the Peters case because that's correct Your Honor. 
    To return Mr. Peters to the scene of the crime, to determine whether indeed the suspicions were correct, whether there had been signs of a break in the apartment opposite, whether the door opposite had forced open. 
    There are typical cases from actual occurrences in the New York City, which illustrate this. 
    We cite several in our brief. 
    The lady whose handbag has been snatched, who tells an officer on the corner that a young man or two young man have run north with a handbag. 
    The officer sees a young man running two blocks north. 
    Now he can't take that young man to the station house and book him for a grand larceny. 
    He doesn't have probable cause to arrest and book, but its perfectly reasonable for him to make a brief detention in order enable a quick confrontation between the suspect and the --

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    It is a custody, but not necessarily Mr. Justice Brennan a custody for purposes of Miranda, because in the Miranda decision, there was compared or there was an explication of that term in same sentence, the suspect is deprived of his freedom in any significant way. 
    So that the Miranda case acknowledges that there is some restraint on freedom, which is not sufficiently significant to give rise to the Miranda warning.

    Could you tell me what it was the law enforcement people have in sustaining this -- the right to have what you call this temporary confrontation, which would authorize and enforce the detention for a few moments? 
    Why is that so much better, produce so much more consequences than just the fact if an officer presence making his presence known, and doing what any officer could do anyway without a statute or without any constitutional problem just walking up to some person asking him a question what are you doing here, without being able to detain him, fellow walked on, that's the end of it? 
    What real contribution does the ability to forcibly detain him for a moment, for a few moments? 
    What additional contribution to that to prevention of crime?

    Mr. Michael Juviler

    I think that, that alone is limited and as Mr. Justice Marshall noted yesterday, when an officer tells someone to stop and ask them what he is doing and holds him for that period, there is some degree of official authority that is conveyed to the suspect that he must remain there. 
    I think the prevention is that the officer makes his presence known specifically addressed to that suspect and if he learns his identity, I think he is prevented any (Inaudible) crime in that neighborhood at least in that area.

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    We are not proposing any specific time limit beyond that which is reasonable. 
    I think if it gets beyond 20 minutes there has to be a very good reason for the continued detention and in my examination of the cases, a longer detention where this no probable cause to believe is really not necessary for law enforcement. 
    I think that the ambiguous situations in the great instance can be cleared up as in the cases that we cited in our brief in New York City, in a few minutes. 
    Now reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, just as the standard of an unreasonable delay in arraignment under the Federal Statute is not a minute by minute chronology but something which has to be examined. 
    We would not -- I cannot conceive of any instance where eight hours would be reasonable.

speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="2264.824" stopTime="2314.510">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    I think he can only take him and it's only necessary and proper to take him to the immediate area where the crime has occurred, I accept I can conceive of one instance which is cited in one of the briefs in the appendix to the National District attorney's brief, where there was a reasonable suspicion that a certain automobile had been engaged in a known burglary and it was seen at the other end of town. 
    Now the officer on patrol there who received the description saw this car, but he wasn't present at the burglary, he detained the car and in a matter of a few moments a witness and a police officer from the scene were rushed across town to the scene and they established that this was the car and these were the people engaged in the burglary, that was –
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2314.510" stopTime="2322.651">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose the rush had been the other way? 
    Suppose they had taken the suspect across the city for people to look at him and so forth?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="2322.651" stopTime="2376.730">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    I think that would be reasonable as in the case of the purse snatch for example where you had a distraught woman whose purse was snatched and she hysterically gave a description to the officer, I think it's reasonable for the suspect to be brought back to the scene or the woman screaming in the window up above and a man is stopped down here. 
    I think that, and in the Peters case where the burglary suspect was brought from the fifth floor landing up to the sixth floor, I think this is a very limited type of detention which doesn't include the handcuffs, the cell bars, the booking and the crowded police station and that is not needed and it's not authorized by the New York cases or the Court of Appeals cases and the statute in New York.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2376.730" stopTime="2388.204">

    The suspect can be sequestered as well in police car with two or three police officers and he can't be in the station, can't he?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="2388.204" stopTime="2437.965">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    Yes I think the problem here is actually one not of the place, but of the degree of force or official coercion that is needed and I think putting someone in the police car its not so much where he is, but that this is a use of a greater degree of force or official restraint than just asking him to remain where he was, where he is while the radio call that he made to see whether the car is stolen, for example. 
    I think that is the traditional police practice. 
    I think there is a certain extent Mr. Justice Warren where these cases as in all search and seizure cases under the Fourth Amendment have to be reviewed on a case by case basis deepening on a facts of the particular case and while there are always borderline situations --

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    In the customary law, in the decisions of every court in the lower courts that have reached this including the Federal courts and in the common law probable cause to believe to book someone and arrest him is not required for a minimal limited detention of the type that is authorized by the New York statute. 
    Undoubtedly, there will be cases arising where the detention goes beyond those limits as there are cases in every police rule under the Fourth Amendment and I think the courts and this Court are well-equipped to point out to the police the true standards and the proper boundaries as the cases arrive.

    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    I think it's a dangerous. 
    I think he chased him so that he could stop him and bring him back to the scene. 
    I think he chased Mr. Peter so that he could stop him and bring him back to the scene and see what happen and I think it would have been unreasonable to expect the officer to do that without making a very minimal self-protective inquiry. 
    Now if the officer had been shot and killed that would have been impossible to balance against the number of people who are touched in those circumstances.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2666.119" stopTime="2735.246">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I'm not -- that officer did act reasonably in the circumstances, he didn't even act with probable cause, but I understood you to say a moment ago absolutely this stop-and-frisk ordinance was limited to instances where the officer thought his life was in danger. 
    Now in this case, in the Peters case, he walked out of -- these men were tiptoeing along the hall and he opened his door and banged it and when they heard the bang they ran, and ran down to couple of flights of stairs and he chased them and caught them. 
    Now, in applying the stop-and-frisk law you have to say that officer did that because he thought his life was in danger, would you, wasn't, didn't he do that because he thought these men were burglars and he detained them because he thought they were burglars.

    Yes, well isn't that a question of probable cause.

    Well, reasonableness of frisk, under our Constitution is been said to be probable cause, isn't it?
speaker="michael_juviler" startTime="2754.016" stopTime="2833.227">
    Mr. Michael Juviler 
    It's probable cause to believe in the context of an actual arrest and it's context of other searches or intrusions, probable cause can just mean reasonableness that was the express language of a majority of this Court in the Camara case. 
    I think that the probable cause standard which is stated in the Fourth Amendment applicable to warrants is not designed to cover every intrusion of any kind and the Court has repeatedly so held. 
    That is just one example, singled out by the framers because there was a particular evil that was aimed at that required the specification of that one example of reasonableness. 
    And whether the Court should consider this probable cause or consider it a search or seizure that is not unreasonable. 
    I think the ultimate result is that what the officer did in this case and many other cases that it represents was reasonable and if it's reasonable the conduct should not be disapproved by the Court and evidence obtained in this reasonable manner under traditional rulings is admissible in Court.

    I must speak to the question of mootness which was not raised at any stage of this case before yesterday. 
    I have a minute and 40 seconds left and I have a minute and 40 seconds argument prepared. 
    Jurisdiction was noted in this case before this Court's decisions in Jacobs and Tenenbaum against New York and before this Court's decision in See against Seattle. 
    In all these cases there were suspended fines or non-felony sentences which could not be executed at a later date. 
    Under Jacobs and Tenenbaum, Sibron is moot, under See against Seattle it is not. 
    The problem of mootness is of particular concern in New York where it's virtually impossible for an appellant in New York to obtain bail pending appeal and thus preserve this case for Federal review. 
    Moreover, under Section 555 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, bail on appeal is prohibited to one situated as well as Sibron. 
    This Court should reconsider Jacobs and Tenenbaum or at least limit them to cases that did not become moot because of the petitioner's indigence or because of the state's limitation upon the right to bail pending appeal. 
    The confession of error in this case points up the weakness of the Jacobs and Tenenbaum rule. 
    Sibron is a case concededly wrongly decided which if dismissed will never be set right. 
    On the District Attorney's concession, we have stated that our only interest as advocate for Sibron is to obtain making sure of his conviction. 
    Our response to questioning yesterday stems from our doubt as to this Court's power to except one District Attorney's concession that the New York Court of Appeals erred not once but twice in holding that it's own statute applied to this case and also from our conviction that the non-bailable petty offenders of New York should be able to rely not only on the conscience of one man in a busy District Attorney's office to see that they get justice, but on the entire judicial system of the State of New York especially where the consent is not upon the New York Courts within its own Court system.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 74 John Francis Peters versus New York. Mr. Friedman.
speaker="robert_stuart_friedman" startTime="3012.655" stopTime="3179.019">
    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    May it please the Court, this cause is before the Court today on direct appeal from a judgment of the New York State Court of Appeals, which judgment confirmed the defendant's conviction for the illegal possession of burglar's tools. 
    On this appeal, the defendant contends that a certain search of this person and the seizure of evidence there from constituted an unreasonable search and seizure of his person in violation of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. 
    In this case, as in the Sibron case, the validity of a state statute, namely Section 180 (a) of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure has been drawn into question. 
    Additionally there have been raised in this case broad questions, which concern the rights of our citizenry to move about freely without undue police interference. 
    May I briefly set forth the factual material, underlying the events in this case? 
    The appellant was arrested in the City of Mount Vernon in New York on July 10, 1964 at or about 1 pm on that day by a man by the name of Lasky who at that time was a police officer attached to the Police Department of the City of New York. 
    On a preliminary hearing in the City of Mount Vernon, officer Lasky testified that at the time in question he resided in the six-floor apartment of a very large multiple dwelling, located in the City of Mount Vernon and that approximately at 1 pm on that day he had finished taking a shower, or he was in the process of taking a shower, when he heard some noise outside of his apartment door. 
    He testified that he went to the peephole of his apartment door, looked out and then he saw two men whom he did not recognize, tiptoeing to the common hallway of the premises. 
    Then his testimony was that he made a telephone call and that he put some clothing on, again looked through the peephole of the door, saw these two men in the common hallway tiptoeing and that he left his apartment with his drawn service revolver in hand. 
    And then he heard the two men descending the staircase, common stairway of the building and he pursued them and that he apprehended the defendant at a point midway between the fourth and fifth floor landings of the common stairway of the premises.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Wasn't there a little more to the facts on that, didn't he say that as soon as he came -- when he came out of his door, he slammed the door deliberately to see what affect it would have on them and when they heard that slamming of the door, they ran, ran downstairs, am I wrong in that?
speaker="robert_stuart_friedman" startTime="3203.381" stopTime="3225.272">
    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    My recollection of the testimony Mr. Chief Justice is somewhat different, though it maybe a slight difference. 
    I don't believe that he testified that he slammed the door for that purpose. 
    He may have testified that he slammed his door and heard them exiting hastily, but I don't believe that it was done for that purpose or that there was any testimony in the record to that effect.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3225.272" stopTime="3232.226">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is it your position that these facts do not constitute probable cause for an arrest?

    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    Mr. Justice Fortas it is not only my position, but it was the New York Court of Appeals' position because --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I understand that.
speaker="robert_stuart_friedman" startTime="3238.138" stopTime="3272.685">
    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    -- in referring to this case later on in the Taggart case when they summarized all of their decisions as to what had gone before, they say that in 20 N.Y.2d 335, that, “And even in People v. Peters, where the officer initially frisked the defendant and felt something hard, this Court held that the officer did not have "probable cause" to make the arrest until he actually reached into the defendant's pocket, withdrew, and identified the burglars' tools.” 
    So this has been conceded by the People and reflects the opinion of the Court of Appeals additionally.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Some of us may feel very pleased of the very high standards of the New York Court of Appeals in this instance, but when you look at in terms of the Fourth Amendment, you regard this as a case of probable cause?

speaker="robert_stuart_friedman" startTime="3294.480" stopTime="3345.429">
    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    That is not a case of probable cause. 
    Yes I do regard it as not coming up to the level of probable cause, because in the first instance whatever suspicions may have been in the police officer's mind, there is nothing factually in the record which gives rise to the inference of the commission of any crime or the imminence of the commission of any crime. 
    If we examine the totality of his observations, he saw two men tiptoeing in the hallway and while this may not be legitimately normal conduct as I believe Judge Galloway in the County Court decision denying suppression, I believe that was Judge Galloway's language, “I maintain that every conduct that one observes which is not perfectly normal, perfectly legitimate does not necessarily give rise to probable cause.”

    No, Your Honor I agree that he does have suspicions, but I disagree with the proposition that he has probable cause to believe that there was a crime, that a crime had committed, or was about to be committed. 
    As a matter of fact when officer Lasky grabbed this appellant by the collar and dragged him down half a flight of stairs and asked him what he was doing in the building. 
    He said that he was there for the purpose of visiting his girlfriend and upon being pressed for the name of the woman in question, the defendant said he didn't wish to reveal the name of the woman in question because she was a married woman and that explanation at least on the face of the explanation is consistent with tiptoeing through a common hallway of a large multiple dwelling, where there a 120 families.

    Then the policeman who testified here got his service revolver and finally went charging, after making this telephone call and went charging out of his door with a drawn revolver and it seems to me that there should have been a lunacy inquiry about this policeman or that one has to read this with some with authority here and assume that these noises were something more than just a noise that they consider a citizen tiptoeing down the halls so it wouldn't disturb people having a siesta.

    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    At the door that is correct Mr. Justice Brennan, but may I say that in a situation like this it is appellant's contention that where you have suspicion which does not rise to probable cause that the proper police action and one which he does not even use the statutory authority for, could have consisted very reasonably in observing what these two men were doing possibly following them and possibly demanding an explanation without the use of the force of their presence in the building and if the purpose was to deter a burglary, if that was his objective in mind at that juncture he would be have accomplished his purpose, but I don't think the record shows that, that was his purpose at all, because the record shows that when he removed this plastic envelope from the defendant's pocket it was an opaque envelope that was sealed. 
    So that at this moment in time when you have the envelope taken from the defendant he had no knowledge as to the contents yet, but in any event he had no fear for his life because the defendant had no hard object at that point. 
    At a later point in time the record shows he opened up the envelope in order to discover what was inside of it which leaves one to the inescapable conclusion that the search of the appellant was for the primary purpose of exploring for evidence.

    I would presume that they were because it was conceded below that the issue in this case dealt with the reasonableness of the search and seizure vis-à-vis was there probably cause where we can see -- where we contended on the preliminary motions that probable cause does not exist in this case and where the courts agree that -- New York Courts agree the probably cause did not exist and decided this case on the basis of the statute Section 188 and on the basis of case law having substantial equivalent, substantive equivalent of the statute and I refer to People v. Rivera which is found in 14 N.Y.2d I believe. 
    And all events if we look at the statute, if I might turn my directions to that for a moment, you have a situation where the courts seek to substitute a standard of what is described in the statute as reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    As I apprehend the distinction as is outlined by the New York Court of Appeals and really that is the only basis that I can have for an opinion as to the meaning of reasonable suspicion as opposed to probable cause, reasonable suspicion calls for the intuitive appraisal of a police officer that a crime has been committed or is about to be committed and in the words -- exact words of the Court of Appeals, I believe it was Judge Keating's words which said that the standard of knowledge, the quantum of knowledge that the police officer has at that juncture when he entertains a reasonable suspicion is lower on the scale of criminal activity then would be required in a probable cause case so that you are dealing with a standard which is less than probable cause in a constitutional sense as we have known --

    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    Yes, but then we would be dealing with the same quantum of evidence and knowledge which we have known in traditional causes -- in probable cause cases and the Court of Appeals has settled for something less and its conception here what reasonable suspicion means and this appellant states that we -- and its our position that we cancel something for probable cause.

    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    No I conceded that, if I may develop this for a moment. 
    This was directed against the type of indiscriminate type of searches that might take place based upon the whim and caprice of people in authority and in particularizing the requirements for a such a search by mandating a requirement of probable cause, we sought I believe during our history to narrow the base of those instances where the liberties of people in general as opposed to a particular individual whom there is a certain quantum of evidence to believe has done or about to do something wrong should be searched. 
    When the level comes to probable cause, this Court in the past has indicated that it's a reasonable level and then it falls below probably cause, it is an unreasonable level and the difficulty with the standard proposed by the New York legislature and the New York Courts is that the interpretation of reasonable suspicion can be so varied as to differ with every policemen who was out on the street because it only calls for an intuitive reaction on his part and when the Court of Appeals concedes that it calls to less than probably cause in the sense that this Court has from time to time has enunciated, it is saying that we are going to give a policeman the authority to stop citizens on a lesser bases for but believing that they have done something wrong in a criminal sense, than we would if they went to a magistrate and applied for a warrant or some other judicial authority because we are going have to rely on the generality of experience police judgment to conduct searches and their judgment and their reaction to a situation to determine reasonableness. 
    And I suggest that it's just this is type of rationale and it is just this type of evil which the Fourth Amendment sought to protect against, to interpose a judicial barrier at a -- with a definable standard, rather than leaving to the --

    The cases that we never hear about are the cases where there has nothing been produced because they never get to Court and it's the right not only of this appellant, which of course I am primarily concerned with, but it's the right of our citizenry in general, which we must concerned with and the generality of these cases are never heard because we only hear about those cases where the hunch has been correct, but the ambiguities to which a great number of our citizens are put are unimaginable and this statute would broaden --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Friedman, I'd like to refer back to the strange situation that Mr. Justice Black was put to you because I want to know how far you want us to go in this case. 
    You recall what it was, when the man was caught in the alley and so forth. 
    Now, I wonder if there is an element in the case that we haven't yet discussed. 
    The question you've discussed, the question of whether you had the probable cause to believe that the man had committed a crime or was about to commit a crime and you thought that there was not and therefore he didn't have the right to stop him and frisk him. 
    I wanted to ask this in the light of the fact that I suppose you will agree that a police officer has the right of self-preservation when he's in a dangerous situation, being in the dark alley, below with a man under very suspicious circumstances in the morning and the man who has no explanation and will give no explanation. 
    I wonder if the officer before he leaves that man, doesn't have the right. 
    If he has probable cause to believe that he might be injured by the bullet firing on him or throwing a knife on him because he -- I wonder if he wouldn't have probable cause in that sense to frisk the man to see if he had a weapon and if we shouldn't put that element into the case also if -- in other words I'm asking you even the Court, if the Court should agree with you to the extent that we can't do this, they can't stop and frisk him on suspicion whether if somebody considers its reasonable, whether police officer considers it reasonable or not, if were the police officer has probable cause to believe that his life is in danger, in his investigative process, if he does not have the right to find out if the person from whom the danger might come, is armed and in a position to inflict that [Inaudible]
speaker="robert_stuart_friedman" startTime="5294.569" stopTime="5306.451">
    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    I assume that Mr. Chief Justice, I assume that your use of the word probable cause and your hypothetical was using the constitutional sense --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5306.451" stopTime="5342.224">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I do but what I'm mean is this. 
    There might be one set of facts, it would be probable – would constitute probable cause or would not constitute probable cause for the purpose of arresting event. 
    There might be another set of facts or the same set of facts might be sufficient to constitute probable cause so far as the officer's safety is concerned and if those two -- if those two shouldn't be accommodated in these kind of situation.
speaker="robert_stuart_friedman" startTime="5342.224" stopTime="5484.608">
    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    I will accept the proposition Mr. Chief Justice that probable cause in every case differs one to the other depending upon the facts of a given case. 
    I say that when probable cause exists in a constitutional sense for an officer to believe that someone's about to pull a revolver on him or harm with some of the barbarly fashion then he has probable cause in the traditional sense for believing that a crime is about to be committed and has every right independent of a statute to take some action. 
    But here if you're going to lower that to a lower, to a lower standard which has been interrupted by our New York Court, a standard requiring merely the subjective evaluation or as Judge Van Voorhis stated, it would allow searches on -- practically unlimited searches based upon a subjective operations of the police always to mind without the -- any evidence of overt criminality then you reach a point where you must draw some objective standard for determining the police officer's, the reasonableness of the police officer's conduct otherwise you are permitting a standard which is unenforceable in terms of restricting a police officer from making a intrusive searches which violates a citizen's right of privacy. 
    In this particular case, the unworkability of the standard of reasonable suspicion is clearly demonstrated by the fact that -- if by no other fact then in the Sibron case the Court of Appeals of the State of New York felt there was reasonable suspicion, the attorneys involved in that case did not, and the Kings County District Attorney office at this late date decide that it did not. 
    The unworkability and the harm to be perceived statute like that is in fact that a man like Sibron can do six months in jail, I hold no brief in narcotics people, when -- he wasn't sent there according to law. 
    And if you are going to make exceptions as to our system and permit this type of incarceration when the steps preceding it are not lawful, then I think we do harm and injustice to our whole system of law and order. 
    In the final analysis our citizenry in general has to pay the price for that diminution in the protection for the individual.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5484.608" stopTime="5550.040">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, you are arguing that that under no circumstances can – can these – can an officer see a person has a weapon unless he has probable cause for believing that a crime has actually been committed. 
    Now I am wondering if an officer can't be in certain circumstances where he might not have probable cause to believe that the crime has been committed, but he does have probable cause to believe that he might be seriously injured or killed if he doesn't take some precaution. 
    And I am asking you if you want to force us to the point where we say that even if he does have probable cause to believe that he will be killed or injured that he cannot, cannot go over to a man to find out whether he has a weapon with which he would -- with which he could do that.
speaker="robert_stuart_friedman" startTime="5550.040" stopTime="5571.912">
    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    I suggest that there might be as Judge Van Voorhis suggested a middle ground. 
    I can offer the constitutional rationale to support it and that is formulating new exclusionary rules with respect to the products of such searches as a deterrent to police officers making baseless searches of this sort which I believe –

    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    As Mr. Judge Van Voorhis' situation, but I think that there must be some protection in answer, direct answer to your question I think that we have to bear in mind that the base upon which we are going to allow an invasion of privacy to occur should not be indiscriminately broadened or open the door to that base and to whatever extent that we protect the liberties of our citizens in general it -- consistent with the good of the community we must try and keep that phase as narrow as possible and as particularized as possible to the individual as opposed to the generality of people.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5612.243" stopTime="5674.422">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well I am not disagreeing there, but it seemed to me that the counsel for the state agreed that this ordinance could only be for the purpose of enabling a law enforcement officer to protect his own life. 
    Now I just won't agree. 
    Now that being true I am just asking you if there aren't some circumstances where an officer confronts a person without probable cause for believing that he has committed a crime. 
    But before he leaves, he has reasonable grounds; probable cause for believing that he might get killed or injured if he doesn't find out if the person has a weapon like that man is poking in the alley, that Justice Black was talking about.
speaker="robert_stuart_friedman" startTime="5674.422" stopTime="5690.273">
    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    I suggest in answer to your question that in those extreme circumstances, you have a case which comes within the preview of our traditional probable cause notions that a crime is about to be committed or is ensuing because when a police officer --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5690.273" stopTime="5709.205">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now you are shifting your ground, because you told Justice Black that he didn't have and therefore he couldn't decide and therefore he couldn't arrest him. 
    You tell us also that this is an arrest to go over and to find out if he has weapon and I want to find out if --
speaker="robert_stuart_friedman" startTime="5709.205" stopTime="5822.659">
    Mr. Robert Stuart Friedman 
    My answer to your question would be no. 
    In those situations absent probable cause in the traditional sense, he ought not have a right to search the man or the suspect for the simple reason as I view the construction of the statute as we have it now for example in New York. 
    The unworkability of it is illustrated that by decision it is implied that in every case the police officer is going to have to fear for his life because as Judge Keating said the answer to a question maybe a bullet. 
    So if that's the position, it would seem to me that at least in New York and I don't hypothesize in what statute might be drawn that would be a better statute but at least in New York the situation is as I read these cases that on every occasion that a police officer stops someone, he has to frisk him because -- or search him because he presumes that he is in danger because he maybe -- the answer to the question may be a bullet. 
    Well if this low level of causation or search, just restricted to the subjective operations of a police officer's mind other than for example a situation where there is a noticeable bulge or a suspect does some overt act where he reaches into his pocket and the police officer reasonably suspects or has probable cause, a set of phrases you want to apply that he is about to withdraw a revolver and use at the police officer or a knife, I think if you would hit the standard as you have in New York my answer today, my answer will have to be a no. 
    If they are more workable, a more definitive standard can be worked out, then I say the answer is a, we have to judge in the light of requirements for a Constitution.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well your argument seems to me has gone beyond the Sibron case and has gone beyond this case, we are on right now and you want us to state a general rule that prevents the police from doing these things under any circumstances.

    I am not suggesting that some type of legislation and I don't suggest that the New York legislation is the answer, might solve some of the problems that's affecting a balance between the need for law enforcement and the protection of privacy for the individual. 
    I am suggesting however that the construction given by the New York Courts to a statute and to the police officer's action in this particular case offends the individual rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment that is what I am suggesting.

   Argument of James J. Duggan

speaker="james_j_duggan" startTime="5956.370" stopTime="6078.930">
    Mr. James J. Duggan 
    Mr. Chief Justice may the please Court. 
    What I am afraid has happened here is that perhaps because of a label that's been hung on this law, it's called the stop and frisk and I think perhaps because of that label that it has been thought that these two rights, the right to stop an individual and the right to frisk him arrive simultaneously and exist coextensively and I don't think that's so and I don't think a reasonable interpretation of that law should be that that's so. 
    Now crime is rampant in the streets. 
    That it's certainly not something that I think there can be any significant argument about. 
    The Federal Bureau of Investigation cites statistics that indicate that some classes of crimes have risen as a much as 18% in the course of the past year. 
    The President's commission on crime has indicated that the FBI figures only scratch the surface. 
    There isn't, I don't think anyway, any argument that where a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe or probably cause to believe that an individual has committed a crime. 
    No one will argue I think that he has the right to arrest that man. 
    However, if he has less than those reasonable grounds to believe that individual has committed a crime, he may not arrest him and so in response to this middle ground, this completely uncontrolled, at least statutorily uncontrolled ground between the individual against whom no suspicion may arise and the individual whom a police officer may reasonably have grounds to believe that he has committed a crime, the New York Legislature responded by passing the Stop and Frisk Law.

   Rebuttal of James J. Duggan
speaker="james_j_duggan" startTime="6522.830" stopTime="6666.955">
    Mr. James J. Duggan 
    I don't this being applied Your Honor, because when you say regular it imports a certain prescribed or preordained course of conduct and it's not -- I don't think to be anticipated that in a preordained way or a preregulated way that suspicious circumstances are going to occur, which will make this a necessary or a routine thing or a 4 o'clock every afternoon affair. 
    A stolen car for example I should assume yes that it would be done on a routine preordained basis because a policeman is to be expected to be able to see a stolen car. 
    I have heard a great many people say here that is the subjective determination of the officer and I would like to answer that point because I just cannot believe that this Court is prepared to decide that what a police officer decides on the streets is the very last word in the point, because the fact that we stand here this morning debating the reasonableness of what Samuel L. Lasky did in the hallway of a public building in Mount Vernon in July of 1964 certainly gives the lie to any suggestion that the policeman is the final arbiter of the thing. 
    By reason of this Court's determination in Mapp against Ohio and Miranda against Arizona, New York has now developed, something they never had before, a workable, practical daily routine whereby the admissibility of evidence prior to a trial is decided upon and passed upon as a legal question. 
    There's nothing so amorphous as reasonable grounds for anything. 
    So if you're going to rely on a policeman's capacity to decide what is reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been committed, I see no reason for withdrawing from him, the acumen to decide when there's reasonable ground to suspect because on the following morning, a court will convene some place in that jurisdiction who will pass on whether or not this officer had these reasonable grounds to suspect.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6666.955" stopTime="6703.694">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Duggan, didn't your court through the opinion of Judge Keating equate this reasonable suspicion to the intuitive sense of a police officer who had been trained for years both to the schools and in his work to suspect people, crime and so forth? 
    Didn't he equate that reasonable suspicion to the intuitive sense of a police officer?
speaker="james_j_duggan" startTime="6703.694" stopTime="6746.922">
    Mr. James J. Duggan 
    He made that equation Mr. Chief Justice, but I don't think that he intended by that to indicate that this police officer was not going to be called into account. 
    Now it may very well be that he did say that reasonable suspicion, which has to be acted upon immediately will arise more quickly or more perceptibly in the eyes of an experienced police officer. 
    I don't think he said that we're going to accept this police officer's determination blind. 
    I don't think he intended, I'm sure he didn't intend.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6746.922" stopTime="6802.952">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But the trouble is there is this judicial supervision that you speak of in the normal case. 
    The police officers could stop and frisk, hundreds of people in the day but maybe only one of them where they found a gun or found a sort of burglars tools of something of that kind, and that would be the only case of whatever been in the court. 
    The other hundreds of people who are stopped and frisked, nothing has found and where many of them are innocent people, never will reach the courts unless you have a suit for damages or of threats some thing of that kind and I think it's almost impossible to find a situation where the police are curtailed in anyway by such actions.
speaker="james_j_duggan" startTime="6802.952" stopTime="6876.365">
    Mr. James J. Duggan 
    Your Honor I hesitate very long to tell this Court that it's not going to be able to do something. 
    But if the Court decides that the way to curtail unwarranted frisks and searches by police officers where there's no evidence found is to tell them that they will suppress the evidence which is not found, I think perhaps the Court maybe disappointed. 
    Because for example, if it is to be decided by some municipal police agency that the very fact that a police officer will go out and just if I may be excused for using a police expression roused everybody insight, on the theory that if these people know they are subject to being searched, they won't carry guns, they won't carry a contraband equipment. 
    If this is going at some point, at some place in the state of New York to be an official policy that is going to continue to be an official police policy because they won't be doing it for prosecutor purposes, they will be doing it for purposes of control and it won't get to us.

speaker="james_j_duggan" startTime="6893.011" stopTime="6982.534">
    Mr. James J. Duggan 
    -- saying that this statute does not authorize a search and I'd like to return to that point for a minute because there's there the seed of why perhaps in this particular case an exclusionary role is perhaps not going to be as effective as it was in Mapp against Ohio. 
    This statute basically and truly only authorizes a stop. 
    This was designed to give a police officer a weapon to use in that very large area between total innocence and likely guilt and all was stopped or I'm sorry, all the, all of the frisk or search depending on which word you prefer, purports to do is to give the police officer a way of disarming the person whom he has stopped. 
    That doesn't mean that he can look into his shoes, it doesn't mean that he can conduct a search of the interior of his clothing, it does not mean and most especially is this case is illustrative of that it, it does not mean that this police officer may look for evidence. 
    Because the fact of the matter is Mr. Justice Marshall has pointed out, this wasn't his city, it wasn't his responsibility, he had to go far out of this way to do what he did in this case. So it's fairly apparent that he was not looking for evidence.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Shifting, you're shifting the assumptions on it. 
    Let me do it again. 
    I'd suppose that he's got reasonable basis for stopping him --

    Mr. James J. Duggan 
    Yes sir.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And he has a reasonable basis for fearing that he may be in danger that he the police officer may be in danger. 
    Then you'd say that you might have to man down first thing and he does that. 
    Not content with that he reaches him into the man's inside pocket and you know he hadn't felt anything, it feels like a gun or a knife and he pulls out a glassine envelope containing narcotics. 
    Has he or has he not violated the -- is there or is there not a violation of the Fourth Amendment in the sense that in the Mapp against Ohio this, the narcotics that he found cannot be used in evidence.
speaker="james_j_duggan" startTime="7247.916" stopTime="7254.070">
    Mr. James J. Duggan 
    I think there is a violation of the fourth Amendment and I don't think under those circumstances he could use the narcotics.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    The whole case here is -- your case here must necessarily unless we assume that there is probably cause, the case here must assume that a police officer when he came across the so fake envelope containing the burglary tools --

    Mr. James J. Duggan 
    I don't believe so Your Honor, it's in the record, he felt a hard, a hard object which could have been a knife.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7289.372" stopTime="7312.526">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well his testimony is ambiguous about it, well he said at least as I remember, as to whether, whether he thought it was a knife or did not think it was a knife, but anyway you have to make the assumption that the police officer went after what he thought or might reasonably have thought was a lethal weapon, alright?

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And then you take that, then you go from there and say that even though what he pulled out was not a knife, but a sort of burglary tool or let us say a pouch containing narcotics that that maybe used in evidence against him?
speaker="james_j_duggan" startTime="7331.939" stopTime="7347.869">
    Mr. James J. Duggan 
    I do say that, yes sir because if the search was reasonable at its incidence, when it began if was reasonable then what it turns up equally should be a reasonable exercise of the right of search that attached in the first instance.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You are not to limit to right to search to the statutory premises and you may not limit the fruits of the search and what maybe done with the fruits of the search.

   Argument of William I. Siegel
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7647.764" stopTime="7655.291">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Siegel.
speaker="william_i_siegel" startTime="7655.291" stopTime="7842.793">
    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court and in these few minutes I want to make specific if I can an argument which I think has informed the general discussion that which I can't believe has been put in haec verba. 
    The Fourth Amendment is the historical product of the experiences of the colonists with the minions of King George who would walk into a man's home and rummage among his papers and who when they went into his home had the express purpose of finding evidence on the basis of which he could be arrested, convicted, and imprisoned. 
    And the language of the Fourth Amendment with its two clauses one prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure and the other restricting the right to search to search warrants that is to search is made upon severely restricted warrants, pictures this historic genesis of the Fourth Amendment. 
    Now -- and this Court has had occasion before to enlarge the scope of search permitted even under the restricted language, the restrictive language of the Fourth Amendment. 
    One of the justices pointed out in the history of this Court that you could search in vain in the Fourth Amendment for the right to search as an incident to a lawful arrest itself based on probable cause and yet ex necessitate because conditions required if this Court laid down this, or may I say engrafted upon the Fourth Amendment, this exception which cannot be found in the language of the Fourth Amendment itself. 
    Just because the purpose of the search and in this agreement which some of my colleagues I believe New York has authorized a full search in the Taggart case just because the purpose of the search is not to procure evidence upon which to convict a man, but is solely for the purpose of protecting the officer in the performance of his obligatory public duty and his very necessary public duty. 
    The standard of probable cause can be relaxed because the purpose of the search is not the historically prohibited purpose of entrapping a man and out of his own effects and papers convicting him.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7842.793" stopTime="7844.428">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may have fine minutes more Mr. Siegel.
speaker="william_i_siegel" startTime="7844.428" stopTime="7902.868">
    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    Thank you very much Your Honor. 
    And since this is so, the standard I say maybe less than probable cause. 
    Now it has been objected here that probable cause is an amorphous standard, something you can't, -- I mean reasonable suspicion is something which cannot be measured, it cannot be weighed but by the same token probable cause cannot be lineally measured or quantitatively weighed. 
    It has to be hammered out on the anvil of the experience and litigation from case-to-case until there will arise or be created or there will emerge a standard of reasonable suspicion such as this Court was able to do in the Brinegar case about probable cause.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7902.868" stopTime="7957.466">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well Mr. Siegel you say the constitutional standard may relax upon standards and -- where the purpose of the search is not to secure evidence for the commission of the crime, but let's assume the moment that is so, what do you say to such -- what do you say in answer to the question that I asked of Mr. Duggan, that is to say if the search is justified by a purpose other than the search for evidence, that the search is justified because it is merely directed to protection of the policeman should anything that he finds which is not related to that be excluded from evidence.
speaker="william_i_siegel" startTime="7957.466" stopTime="8019.376">
    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    Here again Your Honor I am in disagreement with Judge Van Voorhis who would restrict the usability of it to the weapon for the protection against which the policeman is permitted to make the search. 
    There is an analogy I think here with an arrest based on probable cause, a search incidental to that arrest, that search is permitted for a weapon in order to safeguard the officer for the means of instrumentalities with which that crime was committed or for the fruits of that crime and yet if the search is based upon an incidental to unlawful arrest and it turns up some contraband completely independent of the fruits or instrumentalities of the crime with relation to which the search was originally made the defendant can be prosecuted for that. 
    Now if that is so --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="8019.376" stopTime="8033.581">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well I think we all understand that, but you are asking us to use a standard here to do what you call relaxing a constitutional probation.

    Mr. William I. Siegel 
    I am sorry I didn't ask that. 
    I didn't intend to say that. 
    I am saying that this is not prohibited by the constitution because the purpose for which this search is made is not the purpose for which the Fourth Amendment was written and is not the purpose for which the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment or an implementation of it was created by this Court.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="8072.239" stopTime="8087.475">

    In every other place, in every other field of human activity experience is valuable and people are supposed to benefit by the utilization of their experience. 
    Now why must we throw away the policemen's experience because it maybe used improperly, that is what courts exist for and the fact that there maybe a misuse of his power, does not mean that we have to destroy the power and deprive the community of the benefits which a proper exercise of the power brings. 
    I said in my brief that this would be very much like Charles Lamb's burning down the barn in order to get rose pig, there's a much easier way to do it and I thank Your Honors for the privilege.
