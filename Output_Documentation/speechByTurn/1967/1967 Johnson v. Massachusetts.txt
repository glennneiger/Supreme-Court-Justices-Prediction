    Mr. Harrington I am very impressed with your response to the question that Justice Douglas asked you yesterday, whether the points that you are making here were properly raised below. 
    I assume you're going to get to that this morning.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="47.984" stopTime="59.107">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    I think that my argument will deal with that and if Your Honor does not feel so, I feel myself charged at some point to come back to your question.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="59.107" stopTime="65.690">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well that’s Justice Douglas’ question yesterday which you said you were going to get to, I just wanted to remind you of it.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="65.690" stopTime="198.952">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    Well to continue Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the court as you will recall at the -- shortly before the afternoon recess of yesterday I had asserted that the position which I assert that the burden of proof of showing the voluntariness of a confession should be on the prosecution, was supported by Miranda v. Arizona and I say that primarily because I think it’s plain in Miranda and the Arizona that it is intended that the same procedural rules with respect to an involuntary confession applied in both state and federal courts. 
    I say it is not, it is of significance though not of the same significance that the Miranda rules themselves were such that the burden of proving compliance was placed squarely on the prosecution. 
    I should also observe that in Miranda Mr. Justice Clark in his opinion where he dissented in three cases and concurred in one says this is at page 503 of the opinion and I think that I would best read this sentence. 
    In the absence of warnings, the burden would be on the state to prove that the council was knowingly and intelligently waived or that in the totality of the circumstances including the failure to give the necessary warnings the confession was completely voluntary. 
    Now I think it’s perfectly clear that even that standard was in no wise observed in the case at bar where there was custodial interrogation. 
    There was clearly an absence of warnings. 
    The burden was not on the prosecution and indeed the voluntariness question was not considered in the light of the totality of the circumstances.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you of your argument as reference to burden of proof is confined entirely to the burden of proof that you are now mentioning.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="208.187" stopTime="236.664">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    Well it has two aspects to it. 
    It has the aspect of the burden of proof in the voir dire that was held as a preliminary examination. 
    It also has an aspect that I will come to in just a moment that in this particular case the jury never received a question of the voluntariness of the confession.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="236.664" stopTime="244.190">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It does go further than the waiver of the right to counsel the burden of proof.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="244.190" stopTime="292.420">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    What I suggest, what I urge I that the burden beyond the prosecution of showing the voluntariness of the confession as well as warnings with respect to the confession. 
    This is the English rule, it is the rule in Ireland, it is the rule in the federal courts, it is the rule in most all of the states. 
    There are seven which to our research have the burden on the whole issue of voluntariness placed as Massachusetts places it. 
    My argument goes just to the voluntariness issue.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="292.420" stopTime="310.353">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    As I recall it -- I have read my dissent recently in the Deno case, one of my arguments was that this was a burden that rested on the state to show that the jury had to preside but the court projected that.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="310.353" stopTime="337.499">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    My argument I suggest Mr. Justice Black is entirely consistent with your dissent in the Denno case. 
    And your dissent contains the proposition for which I contend that the -- in this case where there was no explicit waiver that the jury should have passed on the question of voluntariness.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="337.499" stopTime="364.636">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Will you make a two step deal Mr. Harrington. 
    Number one, I gather your proposition is there must a voir dire determination of voluntariness at which the state has the burden of proving voluntariness. 
    In other words, over the objection to the admission of the confession as I understand it, this creates the requirement of a voir dire.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="364.636" stopTime="364.952">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    Correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="364.952" stopTime="385.104">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And in that proceeding, the state must bare the burden of proving voluntariness. 
    And if the court determines that yes, the confession was voluntarily given then you go a second step and say nevertheless the issue of voluntariness must begin to be submitted to the jury for ultimate determination, is that it?
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="385.104" stopTime="394.444">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    Exactly with the burden still on the commonwealth or the prosecution show that it is voluntary. 
    And I suggest that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="394.444" stopTime="400.071">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In addition to that that it includes the guidelines in Miranda?
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="400.071" stopTime="413.395">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    Yes, I of course, I'm not in any -- in no way detracts from the guidelines in Miranda. 
    This problem arises of course in a pre-Miranda case. 
    And I suggest that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="413.395" stopTime="418.738">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is that the Johnson case retroactive --

    Mr. John Harrington 
    The Johnson v New Jersey?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="420.198" stopTime="421.776">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="421.776" stopTime="516.159">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    I say that was the last point but I might as well come to it right now. 
    There are perhaps three aspects to this, one I assert that these constitutional rules with respect to voluntariness and the procedures with respect to voluntariness are such that they are retrospective in application. 
    Indeed in Johnson v New Jersey this court said that the defendants convicted prior to the date of Johnson v New Jersey had the benefit of the increasingly meticulous test of voluntaries made it -- and that Johnson v New Jersey quite plainly distinguished between the prospective application of the Miranda rules and the Escobedo rule and the test with respect to voluntariness. 
    So I say that on this branch of my argument as to procedures, there should be retrospective application with respect to the branch of my argument that goes to the point that as a matter of law in these circumstances, the confession should begin to involuntary -- that involves no retrospectivity or prospectivity problem because those doctrines, when this court upon its own independent review has determined that a confession must be deemed to be involuntary that --

    If your proposition that the issue of voluntariness after the judges decided in voir dire out of the presence of the jury that the confession was voluntary as again to be submitted to the jury. 
    What's your view of the defendant’s position if he is taken the stand in the voir dire under the presence of the jury, what does he do when the issue of voluntariness has then became the subject of proof before the jury after the judge’s determination.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="648.497" stopTime="738.623">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    This is where the burden has the real bite because if Massachusetts for instance, and in many states indeed I think that this may be the federal rule, if you take this -- if the criminal defendant takes the stand for any aspect of the case, he opens himself up on the whole case -- sort of the converse of the federal rules of civil procedure where the cross is limited to the issue. 
    But in Massachusetts there's no question. 
    If he takes the stand to testify to abiding the whole issue or his guilt or innocence is open on cross. 
    And if the defendant has the burden, he has often a very difficult choice to make. 
    If the burden is otherwise, if the burden is on the prosecution so that they have to prove that they have that burden then in all the circumstances, the confession was voluntary. 
    I don’t need to belay that the importance of the burden rule for that proposition. 
    It strikes me that if this court were to say that Jackson v Denno -- and the case sensed that have not only the requirement that maybe this reliable and precise determination of the voluntariness issue before the case goes to the jury, but that also imports absent and post expressed waiver, are claiming that the issue go to the jury.

speaker="john_harrington" startTime="778.687" stopTime="842.746">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    Well I have two answers to that. 
    One, this case in one a general answer. 
    The general answer, I suggest that if the burden of proof were different it then becomes always a jury case. 
    If this is part of the government’s burden, the jury always gets it. 
    In this case, even though the defendant did not take the stand. 
    I say that if the totality of the circumstances, rule had been applied, given the fact that there was before the jury, the evidence of this man’s injuries of his custodial isolation of his absence of warning it appeared in the negative way but the testimony was, is that all that they said and all that was said was a confession. 
    I mean it was perfectly obvious there was an absence of warning, an absence of counsel and isolation. 
    And I say that on a totality of circumstances test that question could have gone to the jury.

    I assert it and I say that the answer which the supreme judicial court gave to these propositions when advanced to them were twofold. 
    One, that there was no evidence of involuntariness before the jury and that brings up this sharp question. 
    There wasn’t any evidence if the only test was physical beating. 
    There was evidence if the totality of the circumstances must be considered.

    Mr. John Harrington 
    If I am right, that will be true, that’s always true in a criminal case where the prosecution has the burden and the defendant can sit there through the whole trial and move verdict of acquittal at the end of it and get a jury’s verdict at the end of it without ever having gotten out of his chair.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I understand if you're arguing the defendant. 
    The evidence of a confession -- in evidence of a confession, the jury has a right to pass all the truthfulness of that submission, decide it and that the fact and that it be fact then there was some lack of freedom of choice, is a question that the jury has to determine beyond the reasonable doubt, he is guilty.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="956.739" stopTime="983.838">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    I would say that the jury should be entitled as the government having the burden to decide that the government had failed to carry it and had not persuaded them that the confession was in all the circumstances voluntary whether the judge has or has not -- they don’t get the question unless the judge has satisfied himself that applying constitutional criteria that it was voluntary.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But what are the issues though on the question of voluntariness and this particular case as I understand it, the only specific question that was raised was that of physical beatings.

    Is that right?

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright, now on the question of voluntariness. 
    Is it your position that although other issues were not raised, it is the state’s duty to go ahead and to show somehow that a length of the arraignment or the length of the confinement and questioning was not such as to produce involuntariness conclusion of involuntariness that he was well fared so that that didn’t have any bearing on it and it either had counsel or waived counsel or was or was not warned, is that sort of thing you're telling us?

    Mr. John Harrington 
    Yes it is Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1084.444" stopTime="1124.810">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You're saying that once a defendant asserts that the confession was involved the state has a duty without reference to any particularization of reasons on the part of the defendant as to why the defendant claims the admission was involuntary. 
    The state then has the duty to negative all possible factors, which might be result in a conclusion that the confession was involuntary. 
    Is that your position?
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="1124.810" stopTime="1147.159">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    Quite that way Mr. Justice Fortas, I wouldn’t put it that their duty was to negative every possible contention. 
    I would put that it was the duty of the prosecution to persuade the triar of fact in the first instance the judge at the voir dire and then the jury that the confession was voluntary.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1147.159" stopTime="1150.867">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now tell me how do you do that? How does the state do that?
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="1150.867" stopTime="1168.192">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    Well I would think that they would, by showing the circumstances and if they didn’t show, if for instance, if they had to show that there was no warning then they -- in a sense they have shown some evidence that’s against them and then they have to show these circumstances under which the --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1168.192" stopTime="1267.349">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But we assume that Miranda was not retroactive and if we assume that the warning is not as a matter of federal constitutional law necessary in this case because it’s pre-Miranda. 
    Then, I should think that it was not the duty of the state in this case or we can hold that that was the duty of the state in this case to show that the warning was given. 
    And I don’t understand frankly, I have a greatest difficulty and coming to grips with your point. 
    Now it’s possible quite possible to argue that when the defendant raises a specific issue such as that the confession was the result of physical beating. 
    When he raises that due to some evidence however small, then the state has the burden of proof to show that the either he was not physically beating or that the physical beating had no causal connection with the confession. 
    And I can understand your burden of proof argument in that respect. 
    But when you -- I understand that you're going much further than that in saying that regardless of the specific issues that the defendant tendered, the state has to go ahead and prove voluntariness. 
    I don’t understand it.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="1267.349" stopTime="1297.924">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    Well my argument -- I concede that my argument goes beyond the necessities of this particular case where it did appear from the evidence, from the defendant’s mouth that there was a beating. 
    And if the suggestion of Your Honor be that that is such to shift a burden of proof or indeed even at that point even a burden of going forward, this case meets that, however from my observation, my analysis, my research --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1297.924" stopTime="1326.525">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Excuse me but right there, I wonder if it does because you say you're not challenging the finding and there was no physical beating while he was in jail or as I understand it, is that a cause of connection with the confession? 
    But you're not challenging then I don’t say we can conclude anything other than that the state whatever burden that has with respect to the physical beating charge.
speaker="john_harrington" startTime="1326.525" stopTime="1451.436">
    Mr. John Harrington 
    I was accepting what I thought was a suggestion that it was the contention rather than the proof to the satisfaction of the triar of fact which was enough to invoke the change of verdict but let me say only on that, that well I think my argument goes beyond the necessities of this case and perhaps it’s dangerous to argue beyond the necessities of the case, I suggest that an analysis of the authorities and analysis of the principles which go from them will indicate that the position that I have taken is the only one that reasonably can be taken. 
    Now I don’t have time enough to develop that. 
    I just want to very briefly in the moments that I have here to one last problem in this case, which I suggest has a variety of intellectual problems to it. 
    And that is that there may be a question of the prospectivity of the Miranda rules with respect to a new trial. 
    If this case were to be decided on the question that the matter of law -- as a matter of law in these circumstances the confession was involuntary, no prospectivity or retrospectivity question is reached. 
    However, if this case were to be decided on a ground that the procedures adopted by the Massachusetts courts did not need constitutional standards and that for that reason Johnson was entitled for a new trial. 
    Then I suggest the question arises that this retrial would necessarily be after the Miranda decision that that question would arise in my brief I have pointed out the quite not split that has occurred on that and I command the reasoning of the Dorothy case in California. 
    Thank you Your Honor. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Brian Concannon

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Concannon?
speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="1457.513" stopTime="1565.947">
    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    Mr. Chief Justice and May I please the court. 
    In the totality of the circumstances, the confession here was a voluntary one. 
    There's no question before this court as to the physical coercion that was found as a fact not to be served by the trial judge. 
    Whether or not there was psychological coercion is to be determined by balancing the circumstances of pressure against the power of the individual to resist that pressure. 
    The circumstances of pressure were delineated by my brother. 
    The power of the individual to resist in this case is as follows. 
    This was a 29-year old man. 
    He had been to the eighth grade or in any event had attended junior high school, his IQ measured under less than ideal circumstances was 86 in the dull, normal range. 
    He had experienced in the military service as a (Inaudible) guard and as defendant. 
    He had significant experience with the police with regard to arrests and interrogations for violations, alleged violations of motor vehicle law, public utility law, assault with a dangerous weapon, armed robbery, disorderly conduct and homicide. 
    One of those investigations involved a 5-hour custodial interrogation. 
    Whatever deficiency if indeed there was a deficiency in this man’s IQ as theoretically measured should be more than out waived by his practical intelligence and by his sophistication in dealing with the police as a result of his experience.

    On this occasion in question and on every other occasion which he had dealings with the police this man was not done as to his rights. 
    His statements to the police on this occasion and on other occasions negative it seems to me the aspect of an ignorant individual who was being intimidated by the police. 
    The record is abundant with his asseverations to the police. 
    I don’t have to make a call I don’t have to tell you cops anything. 
    I know my rights. 
    In addition to the spectacle of cross examining his accuses at the time of these confrontations and lineups are you sure that I'm the person, did you see me shoot the cop. 
    If there were 10 called on the lineup could you have picked me out?

    Mr. Concannon, do you go farther to say he didn’t need a lawyer to trial? But how efficient was he?
speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="1642.739" stopTime="1686.430">
    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    He certainly was not as efficient Mr. Justice Marshall as a trial lawyer. 
    But I mentioned his activity in cross examining his accusers to point out not that he did not need a lawyer but that this was not the kind of individual that appears in the cases decided by this court showing -- deciding involuntariness. 
    In no case this court has decided do we have a finding on involuntariness in such circumstances as these. 
    Certainly not -- no case has gone this far with regard to the coercive pressures and no case has gone this far with regard to the power of the individual to resist and it’s for that purpose only that I mentioned it.

    Lieutenant Richardson warned this man at the booking desk pursuant to Massachusetts law that he had the right to call a lawyer, a bail commissioner, a friend or a relative. 
    The trial judge found as a fact that this warning was not completely communicated to the petitioner, partly due to the confusion in the police station partly due to the obstreperous conduct of the petitioner himself.

    Mr. Concannon, you seem to stress that this man had had some experience with the courts and with interrogation and that he said he knew his rights and that he did not have to answer any questions of the police and that he would not answer their questions. 
    Yet after that they questioned him from what it was 9:30 at night until 6 o’clock in the morning. 
    Would that not indicate that what he said was involuntary?

    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    I don’t think so Your Honor this questioning was not constant questioning, giving the greatest leeway to the interpretation of the record that we point out in footnote 10 of our brief. 
    This man could not have been questioned for more than two-and-a-half hours at most. 
    But I agree with Your Honor to this extent that this is conduct which is impermissible by today’s standards but we’re talking about pre-Miranda cases.

    Then he was given medical attention and put in a cell and these facts were not fully developed for the simple reason that at trial, he claimed that he was being beaten all the time. 
    The judge disbelieved this. 
    This opacity of facts as to just how many policemen were around. 
    There were many dozens of policeman that came to the court to testify so that at various times during the night he was in the presence of more than a hundred policemen.

    Mr. Brian Concannon

    Is that an accurate statement?

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Accurate thinking that there was no request made or any additional request made -- .
speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="2224.737" stopTime="2331.371">
    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    That’s perfectly accurate. 
    More than that there was a bench conference at which the attorneys discussed with the judge what questions -- what instructions would be given. 
    No mention was made of an instruction on voluntariness and a small wonder why because defense counsel deliberately shows not to emphasize the confessions of the jury. 
    This was an experienced criminal trial error, he chose rather to concern himself and to focus in the minds of the jury one question and one question only and that was the question of clemency. 
    The defense counsel had a perfect opportunity immediately after the voir dire and after the jury had been brought back into the room to mention to the jury that he was contesting voluntariness. 
    The trial judge said to defense counsel, when defense council objected the second time, what is the nature of your objection counsel whereupon trial counsel said and I'm paraphrasing, “Your Honor, the nature of my objection is the same I raised in the voir dire.” 
    He had a perfect opportunity to say at that time the nature of my objection, the confession was involuntary, he chose not to do that. 
    At the close of the testimony, the defense counsel addressed the jury in argument and said to them I wouldn’t now try to convince you to find the defendant Ronald Johnson not guilty. 
    I wouldn’t attempt to insult your intelligence, after that the petitioner himself addressed the jury in an un-sworn statement as is the custom and as is his right under Massachusetts law and he said all the evidence which the prosecutor presented to you was true where upon he asked the jury for clemency.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But beyond that he said there was no sense in my taking the stand because all the evidence points to you, I could have went out all day and probably all next week trying to prove that it wasn’t because all the evidence is there, the evidence was presented to the jury.
speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="2346.493" stopTime="2362.325">
    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    That’s right Your Honor. 
    The evidence was overwhelming in this case which was a sufficient reason to persuade counsel and petitioner to adopt this strategic waiver of contesting voluntariness before the jury.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I suppose that your adversary’s position is that the state had the burden of proof on voir dire and the state had the burden of proof before the jury to show voluntariness, that’s my understanding of this decision. 
    I suppose we should find -- I suppose we should conclude and by no means at that point but suppose we should conclude that the voir dire finding of voluntariness or that the case had not been made to show involuntariness.

    No Your Honor, I think that if -- I would like to change my answer on that.

    Though it’s true that my brother did include in is brief by way of a footnote on page 43 of that brief before the SJC, a discussion of the rule for the respect to burden of proof. 
    This wasn’t an argument however this was a dissertation. 
    It begins by saying it’s unclear under Massachusetts law whether the defendant has the burden of going forward or whether the defendant has the burden of persuasion as well. 
    The footnote goes on to discuss the Massachusetts law and it mentions indeed federal law.

    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    Well, I think the purpose of rule of assigning his error in any event of raising the question at the state level is to allow the state to decide the question which involves state law and federal law within the matrix of the state law. 
    Indeed a case cited by my brother, the case of Musser versus Utah makes that very clear, that this is the reason behind the rule and that this court should not decide the question without giving the courts of Massachusetts, an opportunity to pass upon the constitutional challenge to its laws. 
    I don’t think that that --

    Only—

    In that case didn’t we send something back for a determination in the voir dire kind of proceeding didn’t we?

    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    I cited Henry versus Mississippi in the brief Your Honor I believe to show that this court without passing on the question directly indicated at least in the opinion that it was possible for the counsel to make a strategic waiver which our position is -- was done in this case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2849.305" stopTime="2863.076">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well I was thinking of the procedure you suggest. 
    As I understand, your suggestion was that we find there was error in the allocation of burden of proof and we ought to send back only for a redetermination of voluntariness.
speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="2863.076" stopTime="2864.028">
    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    Yes.

    Is that something like what we did in Henry?
speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="2867.081" stopTime="2988.744">
    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    It may have been -- the picture that’s clearest in my mind however Sims versus Georgia. 
    The petitioner argues that these -- the standards set down by this court whenever used in weighing the factors indicating voluntariness in the court below. 
    But in the voir dire, the judge heard evidence of the defendant’s education, his occupation, his physical condition and appearance at that time, his apparent intelligence and temperament, the then apparent total lack of warnings and the fact that he was in a police dominated atmosphere. 
    Later on, on the hearing of a motion for new trial, he heard further evidence of the defendant’s prior experience with the police and he heard further evidence that warnings under the Escobedo rule were totally lacking in addition to the evidence that a warning was attempted to be given. 
    He heard evidence of the defendant’s activity in cross examining, accuses the fact that he have received food during the night in his prior military service. 
    Upon all this evidence, the judge said, I will satisfy by the fair weight of the evidence that the defendant gave the statement voluntarily. 
    So it may well be that even if the burden of proof which Massachusetts assigns to the defendant would theoretically violate the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It was harmless here because it made no difference. 
    The judge found that on the fair weight of the testimony in the evidence the defendant gave the statement voluntarily.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2988.744" stopTime="2994.110">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr. Concannon, did the trial judge ever mentioned his weight rule?

    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    The weight of the evidence Your Honor?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2994.836" stopTime="3001.601">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Did he ever mention that rule as such or that he was relying on that rule?
speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="3001.601" stopTime="3077.064">
    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    No he didn’t Your Honor and to the extent that he didn’t -- to the extent that he didn’t articulate because he couldn’t say Miranda then. 
    He said that he did not articulate the prior Massachusetts law for example saying that failure to warn with significant was caused by the purposeful methods of trial counsel. 
    The record is abundantly clear that the trial judge gave the defendant the opportunity to state the defendant counsel to state exactly what he was relying on. 
    And it seems to me that regardless of where the burden of proof is, a litigant be he a civil or criminal litigant has an obligation to the court to indicate to the court at least in a semi specific way of what he is relying on. 
    And in this case a load -- although the defendant was given full opportunity he chose voluntarily this was not mistake on the part of trial counsel. 
    He was represented by quite competent counsel. 
    The counsel chose to zero in first on physical brutality and then on fairly to give the Escobedo warning.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3077.064" stopTime="3106.597">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Because if your brother is correct as to the law, it wouldn’t be the duty of the defendant to do anything except for the duty of the prosecution. 
    Whenever there is a confession, whenever there is a confession, it’s the duty of the prosecution, according to him, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the confession is voluntary. 
    That’s correct, if it doesn’t behold the defendant to do anything.
speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="3106.597" stopTime="3125.871">
    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    I supposed that’s true Your Honor but in this case the defendant did do something and did point out to the trial judge what he was relying on. 
    So that it seems to me even if this Court says assign the burden of proof was error, that it should make no difference in this case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3125.871" stopTime="3147.214">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But the jury never heard anything about this. 
    If he is correct in his view of the law then what happened in the voir dire doesn’t have very much to do with it because the prosecution didn’t take the first step in proving that this confession was voluntary before the jury.
speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="3147.214" stopTime="3147.412">

    I suppose --

    But you could say that the state has a burden of proof on the voluntariness issue without concluding that it must order the jury to do it. 
    I'm assuming to say that the burden of proof in the hearing outside the presence of the jury was on the state. 
    It must sustain the burden without saying that it also has to sustain at the board of jury.

    Yes.

    Mr. Brian Concannon

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But why isn't that your answer to your adversary, that we’ve already decided that question. 
    I'm sure Massachusetts’ completely free of it once, as I gather some states do, they have an initial determination of voluntariness by the judge and then they resubmit the issue of voluntariness to the jury. 
    But I thought we said in Jackson v. Denno, so far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned. 
    The only constitutional requirement is that if the determination of voluntariness by the judge outside the presence of the jury. 
    And after that except to the state but the constitution doesn’t compel it to submit the issue of voluntariness.

    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    Well it is my answer but I'm going further than that Your Honor. 
    There's no question Jackson v Denno does not require that the case -- the question of voluntariness go before the jury.

speaker="brian_concannon" startTime="3330.399" stopTime="3349.736">
    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    Well if this court decides that the burden of proof question is before it and if it also decides that the burden of proof question was not implicit in Miranda and it further decides that the state has the burden of going forward in the voir dire as well then I suppose that’s correct -- that was constitutional--

    I'm -- I did not prosecute the case at the trial level and I get this case as most others in the attorney general’s office on the appellate level. 
    So I'm probably not that qualified to state what the police practice was at this time in the city of Boston. 
    I would conclude by saying that the trial judge had before him in evidence all of the facts that this court has considered relevant to voluntariness of the confession. 
    Certainly the trial judge does not have to articulate all his findings and there is the normal presumption that a trial judge does consider all the evidence before him. 
    And to the extent that he did not state that all of the things were done which this court has now said should be done in the Miranda case. 
    This was prompted only by the purposeful trial tactics of the counsel and this court should not upset the finding of the trial judge to voluntariness which was obtained by one of -- not one but two factual hearings. 
    In essence this is the third factual hearing which the petitioner is now seeking. 
    And I think this court can find that on the basis of all of the evidence in the record in the totality of the circumstances this confession was voluntary. 
    I don’t propose to color match but in no case before this court have facts of so little weight with regard to involuntariness that prompted the decision the confession was voluntary.

    Do you know of any case this court has had in which they held a man and questioned for about 6 hours intermittently, took into full lineups and have people ask him question which were taken down by a stenographer and then took him in a room with 100 policeman, do you know of any this is, in this court or any other court up in Massachusetts that approves such a procedure?

    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    The answer is no Your Honor but I don’t really think that that’s as coercive as something like what was done in the (Inaudible) case which this court decided was a case for voluntary confession where the defendant had no sleep for the first 42 hours of captivity. 
    I don’t think it’s as coercive as—

    Mr. Brian Concannon 
    No, but he was kept for a matter of -- no, no. 
    But again my answer is on the totality of the circumstances the man did not sleep for 46 hours. 
    He was kept for a matter of weeks by the police and his confession was finally given after he said to the police if you take me out in --

    I don’t think it was continuous interrogation, no.

    But this man was never during all that period, he was never in jail.

    I believe so Your Honor.
