    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 949, Reuben K. King, Commissioner of the State Department of Pensions and Security of Alabama et al. 
    Appellants versus Sylvester Smith, individually on behalf of her minor children et al. 
    Mrs. Stapp, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="mary_lee_stapp" startTime="28.756" stopTime="312.029">
    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    May it please the Court and Mr. Chief Justice in this honorable Court. 
    I represent the appellants, Mr. Reuben K. King and the State Board of Pensions and Security which is the host in making Single State Agency in the Department of Alabama responsible for the title for of the Social Security Act, the public assistance title known as Aid to Dependent Children in Alabama and on the national level, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. 
    We have been designated as a single State agent, said to effectuate the purposes of the Social Security Act. 
    And we are here on a suit of class action, suit in which the three judge panel starts down to Alabama substitute parent regulation as being violated by the Equal Protection Clause. 
    The lower court essentially held that the regulation of deprived, needy children of Equal Protection, and we are here to state the validity of the regulation and to show this Court that it is a reasonable classification particularly in the light of the Alabama Program and in the effort we are trying to make in the program. 
    The facts stated in the opinion by the lower Court are essentially facts that both counsel agree upon, there is -- I will briefly state them. 
    The plaintiff was the mother of four children who had been receiving a Dependent Children. 
    The policy, the substitute parent policy, was the plot against her, particularly I would say part two of the policy. 
    She went into the District Court and eventually secured an hour of which struck down the entire regulation. 
    We all contend that when one of our main contentions is that the lower Court was incorrect in striking down all aspects of the regulation when only a portion of it are applied to the plaintiff. 
    We are concerned of the differences and facts that the lower Court stated with our version. 
    The case worker who terminated the Aid in applying this substitute parent policy against her learned of the relationship between the plaintiff and a person we described as a substitute father but for the purposes of this court, you might think of it in terms of a substitute spouse. 
    We have a difficult semantic problem sometime with HEW and in trying to arrive at a good way to say things. 
    We sometimes are misstating the essence of what we want to tell you. 
    This regulation which was applied against the plaintiff purported to and did describe what we call in Alabama as informal relationships. 
    And our purpose is to try to place these informal relationships for purposes of public assistance in the same situation as persons who are married. 
    And the reason is it’s because persons who are married that is needy families do not get Aid in Alabama. 
    The program is restricted to able bodied persons, who do not have any kind of espouse, for the living in a common law relationship, one that is not recognized by law at all. 
    The plaintiff in this case considered that the case worker had learned of the relationship from some third party, I believe our version of it is that she had read it from the case record but had known about the relationship at the time when the policy was not in effect or the new case worker who came in. 
    And therefore went to the plaintiff and asked her about this. 
    And the plaintiff admitted or stated to the case worker, “Yes this is true. 
    I do have this relationship which fits part two of the regulation.” 
    And on that basis Aid was terminated.

    Was any action instituted against the substitute, whatever it was spouse or whatever?

    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    No and we have (voice overlap). 
    And I think we might as well get this out on the table right now. 
    There is no duty of support necessarily in the substitute parent regulation. 
    This is not based on that concept at all. 
    This is a lesser election on the part of the state to include informal groups. 
    Sometimes the substitute father the may owe a duty of support to some of the children. 
    Sometimes he just may be living life -- sort of the stepfather as it were without the benefit of marriage.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="390.146" stopTime="404.551">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, then what you’re telling us is that the substitute father rule regulation applies even though the substitute father is not the father of any of the dependent children.
speaker="mary_lee_stapp" startTime="404.551" stopTime="477.850">
    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    We stated that in that jurisdiction statement. 
    And in coming up here, we wanted to make that perfectly clear that it’s based on the informal living situation of the families. 
    And I would like also get this out on the table while we are talking about it. 
    Anyway you move in this case, in the classification you are affecting insular minorities, there is no way that (voice overlap). 
    I believe this Court has described, is it insular minorities? 
    We are concerned in welfare with persons who are very needy, who have many needs. 
    And any way we move in the welfare program, we are affecting many people. 
    And this is because we have a very limited program and we are trying to raise the variance. 
    I would like to state that the purpose of this policy was to take money that was being used on the broad case load basis and utilize it on a small case load. 
    And the basis of doing this was to eliminate persons who live in informal living arrangement --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="477.850" stopTime="480.543">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes ma’am, but our problem is one of equal protection --

    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    Yes, that’s right.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="481.017" stopTime="483.920">

    And therefore a problem of reasonable classification.
speaker="mary_lee_stapp" startTime="483.920" stopTime="484.738">
    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    That is correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="484.738" stopTime="503.289">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, the reason that these dependent children are otherwise eligible for Aid, are not getting the welfare payments as if their mother is having a relationship with a man, period, end of the story, is that right?

    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    No, I think it is (voice overlap)
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="503.535" stopTime="510.280">

    It doesn’t matter whether the man is or is not the father of the children. 
    Is that right?
speaker="mary_lee_stapp" startTime="510.280" stopTime="546.166">
    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    If you are approaching this purely from a duty of support point of view, I can certainly see why you are asking this question. 
    It is true in many marriage situations that the father also does not support the children. 
    In the testimony we attempt to elicit the reasonableness of using this as a method. 
    And you will notice out through the testimony, they kind of direct us -- of being questioned show that many instances in the married families you do not have an actual support coming in.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="546.166" stopTime="552.890">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes ma’am, but you’re telling us that this father under Alabama Law, this is spouse or—

    Substitute spouse.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    This man, let’s call him a man and we’re so -- that this man under Alabama Law has no duty to support these children, is that right?
speaker="mary_lee_stapp" startTime="566.937" stopTime="574.171">
    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    And if you think Social Security Act never permitted states to make these classifications, I think you’re right in asking this question.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="574.171" stopTime="583.961">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No ma’am, you let me ask a question, and then we’ll see. 
    This man under Alabama Law has no duty to support the children.

    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    May or may not. 
    In this particular instance, in this particular case that was true. 
    Yes sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="589.639" stopTime="610.280">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The children are dependent children. 
    Other dependent children are entitled to aid under your program and the federal program. 
    These children do not receive aid because this man who owes them no duty of support is having a relationship with their mother.
speaker="mary_lee_stapp" startTime="610.280" stopTime="619.991">
    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    I think you had just hit the thing that puts shock and horror in the hearts of everybody who hears it.

    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    Initially. 
    Initially think in terms in this policy, we consider that the actual ADC grant is a low paying amount to a mother to help her in her primary duty of support, take care of the children. 
    It is therefore of the nature of the grant we are speaking of that gives rise to the question of why we are here.

    I think we would consider, it is to be used for the child and we would certainly hope that if the state and the federal government is going to own this trouble it is going to be used for the child.

    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    I know of nothing other than the mother herself going to the office and stating --

    There’s nothing that child can do.

    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    We know of nothing that the child in this family or the child in the married family can do. 
    I might point out -- in Alabama the mere fact that the people are married disqualifies the child.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="687.834" stopTime="714.534">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What I'm saying is the child’s mother who is living alone. 
    And that child gets aid because the child needs milk. 
    And next door, there is another child with another mother, but that child’s mother is running around with the man so you’re discriminating those two children.
speaker="mary_lee_stapp" startTime="714.534" stopTime="752.497">
    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    I would say that we maybe discriminating in the long run more against the married mother who has a husband who is not doing to will for a few weeks. 
    They have no funds and she looks at those and sees the postman. 
    And this was true before the regulation. 
    She sees the postman deliver a check to a woman who is living out of wedlock. 
    And I am speaking here of the first part of the policy which we would say is the true living situation. 
    She sees him deliver the check to the mother and she does not get a -- because she is married.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="752.497" stopTime="756.960">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But I can’t see why the child is denied milk.

    Well I would hope that.

    It was what her mother did.

    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    I would hope the mother when she gets a public assistance check does use the check for daycare purposes but there’s no requirement that she do so.

    If it does not simulate the marriage relationship then I would think that we would not have a classification under deprivation of real support and our theory on it is this, that the relationships that these persons live in simulate the marriage relationship. 
    And since we do not give aid two able-bodied married persons, we do not think it makes sense for a case worker in interpreting the program to have to not give aid to one and not give aid to the other two.

    One is the interest of the state itself in rendering a more responsible program to reduce case loads to give an effective service keeping in mind that we have such a tremendous number of children that are not even beginning to be reached in the program. 
    The second thing is this great public concern and I think it's much greater than you may realize of underlying situations that are tend to bring about illegitimacy for example.

    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    May it please the court. 
    The history of the regulation indicates that its sole function was not to save money but to restrict case loads, to act cumulatively against certain families. 
    At page 710 of the appendix as set forth in the minutes of the Board in Alabama when they passed this particular regulation, and Commissioner King in response to the question of Mr. Justice Fortas was asked at the trial. 
    “Mr. King, are you aware of any legal machinery which can make it mandatory to such so called substitute parents carry on the responsibility of supporting the child?” 
    He answered, no. 
    The next question, “Do you know of any one case whereas the result of the application of the substitute parent rule, the alleged father or parent has contributed to the support of the children?” 
    The answer was no. 
    And when Alabama some 23,000 people were cut off from Aid. 
    In Georgia some 23,000 people were cut off from Aid. 
    And in Louisiana, some 10,000 people were cut off from Aid for the same regulation. 
    According to HEW, there are nearly one half a million children in the country at the present time being denied aid because of this regulation.

    18 states have this regulation or similar regulations and is set forth in the appendix to my brief.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is it typical of the states not to give ADC to the children of married couples, no matter how impoverished --
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1333.695" stopTime="1358.184">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    Throughout the country, there are ADC programs and ADCU programs. 
    I think some 18 and 19 states have adopted the program whereby they give Aid even though the man is in the house even though the married spouse is living there. 
    It's a regulation that was passed on a test basis in 1961, was that thereafter an experimental regulation is presently in effect. 
    The States have the option with respect to whether they want to adopt it or not.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1358.184" stopTime="1360.513">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And then you say a minority of the states have this?
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1360.513" stopTime="1362.401">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    Yes. 
    But the thrust of-—
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1362.401" stopTime="1370.052">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The majority of the states do not give Aid to Dependent Children if their parents are married, no matter how poverty stricken, is that correct?
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1370.052" stopTime="1419.928">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    Yes, I'd like to add supplemental to the Court, give you the list of those states and I will also furnish you with the regulations. 
    The other analogy that Mrs. Stapp makes, that if the substitute father marries the man, in other words, it encourages immorality, if the substitute father marries the man, then it's not that his interest, in other words to marry them because Aid will be lost. 
    That's not the way that federal regulation is written. 
    The federal law provides that if the man does marry the woman, and if the man is the step parent, he's still not legally responsible for the child, and Aid should go to that as family. 
    Now what Alabama has done, it compounded the substitute parent law, with the provision that the step parent doesn't -- the presence of the step parent cuts off the children from Aid. 
    And therefore that family has denied Aid.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1419.928" stopTime="1427.326">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Does federal program permit a state to cut off the Aid to a child who suddenly acquires a stepfather.
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1427.326" stopTime="1437.834">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    The handbook transmittal which is the federal interpretation of those regulations is very clear and specific in the sense, that Aid should be given even though the man and the woman marry --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1437.834" stopTime="1439.533">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As long as he doesn't adopt the children.
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1439.533" stopTime="1441.147">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    Right, or as long as he's not the natural father—
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1441.147" stopTime="1450.547">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So a state regulation to that effect cutting off the child and if he suddenly acquires a stepfather who doesn't adopt him, a state regulation in that effect would be invalid--
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1450.547" stopTime="1503.749">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    It should be disapproved and that is the interim regulation which Alabama has passed in this case, pending the disposition of this case, pending the disposition of this case. 
    And if this Court narrowly interprets this case just to strike down the classification based on sexual morality, rather than the classification based on support, Alabama and all the other states will then pass other regulations unrelated to the question of support. 
    For example, they will deny Aid to a child if the father funded the child. 
    Where if the man in the house funded the child or if the man in the house takes the child to church, or if the man in the house indicates any kind of interest in the child, the basic issue is placed by Mr. Justice Fortas is the question of support. 
    And the only grant for the denying a child Aid is when that man is legally obligated to support them is removed from the house.

speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1517.224" stopTime="1573.220">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    The HEW in December 11th of 1964 sent back the last Alabama (Voice Overlap), in other words Alabama wrote and said, “Here's our plan HEW be applied to it in a serious negotiation of conversations and said, and it set forth in the decision that the Alabama plan is out of conformity with the Fleming ruling, is out of conformity with the constitution, is out of conformity with the Social Security Act. 
    Then Alabama was asked again to negotiate, to send another submission, and Alabama never did. 
    Now under Section 602 of the Social Security Act, the only remedy that HEW has, is to disapprove an entire plan. 
    In other words HEW was so upset about the plan, they would stop any Aid going to any children in Alabama. 
    The drastic measure which HEW has to take if they want to enforce something results in HEW being handcuffed.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1573.220" stopTime="1584.365">
    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1590.766" stopTime="1610.983">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    What I am concerned about in a sense is the feeling that in Georgia and in Louisiana, those plans have been disapproved. 
    And I can see the argument being made that if they were that inconsistent, they should have been approved. 
    I don't think one has to go further than that. 
    I think the statutory holding in this case will affect the 18 other states that we're talking about, I think a definition from this Court—
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1610.983" stopTime="1612.234">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Of what a parent is.
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1612.234" stopTime="1616.898">

    Should be, if I may say the decision of this Court—
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1616.898" stopTime="1618.085">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's the reading of the statute.
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1618.085" stopTime="1634.418">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    That's the reading of the statute, and that would cut against the substitute kind of regulation that Alabama has passed. 
    It was litigated below. 
    It will cut against the Alabama substitute parent regulation that is the interim regulation. 
    And it will cut against the substitute parent regulations against the other states.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1634.418" stopTime="1646.561">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Do I understand you Mr. Garbus to say that you think this case that can be decided in your favor purely on the basis of statutory structure rather than on any constitutional, is that right?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1646.561" stopTime="1649.369">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, it will still be a supremacy clause then.
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1649.369" stopTime="1721.727">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    Yes, you have in this instance and this is the first case before you like this, the relationship between HEW and the states that administer Aid. 
    And you have specific authority in HEW to approve proper state plans. 
    And I suppose one of the significances of the Fleming ruling was it again reasserted the right of HEW to pass on state plans. 
    And of course, the Fleming rule by implication then became more of a statute in section 604. 
    Now with respect to the question of the step for the support, the federal handbook exception at Section 3412 Subdivision 4 states as follows, “In the absence of a legal obligation to assume a parental role, a step parent is no more of a parent than any other person acting on local apprentice. 
    In these situations, the only safeguard to the child's right to assistance is its eligibility under the condition of being deprived of the support or care of the natural parent.” 
    Now the other parent spoken of in Section 3412 are all natural parents, whether married or not. 
    In other words, in Alabama if the man forced as an illegitimate child, he still can be compelled to support that child so long as he's the father.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1721.727" stopTime="1727.367">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What definition do you suggest that it would be given to parents from the statute, the one that you just read?
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1727.367" stopTime="1739.753">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    The definition would be that states must treat his parents for the purposes of ADC eligibility only persons with a legal obligation to provide support and that's the purpose of HEW.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1739.753" stopTime="1741.653">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Provided they are the parents.
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1741.653" stopTime="1839.762">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    Oh, yes. 
    The reading of the statutory history in this case justifies that interpretation. 
    The word parent is used several times in the statute itself and an analysis of how it's used in the statute leaves no doubt but then they're talking about the natural parent. 
    Under Section 602, a state plan must have a provision which “provides a prompt notice to appropriate law enforcement officials of the furnishing of Aid to Families with Dependent Children in respect of the child who has been deserted or abandoned by a parent. 
    Now the function of that notice provision to law enforcement officials is so that they can go out and compel support. 
    Now under Alabama Law, and under the law of most of the states in this country, you can't compel support from anyone other than a natural parent or one who has adopted the child. 
    Now HEW then in its handbook, in transmittal which again is the official regulation concerning what is a parent, directs states to give notice regarding only those persons who under state laws are defined as parents for the support of minor children. 
    Alabama's own welfare regulation states with respect to that notice provision, report parents who are legally responsible under Alabama Law. 
    These are the natural or adoptive parents of a child. 
    A natural parent includes the father of a child born out of wedlock, if paternity has been legally established. 
    It does not apply to a stepparent. 
    So the provision -- this attempted analogy that Mrs. Stapp was trying to make about an inconsistency, it's because the facts that she's talking about inconsistent with Alabama Law itself.

    Volume one.
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="1922.017" stopTime="2096.074">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    Yes it is. 
    In Alabama it's about 80%. 
    Well first of all, the Alabama statute which relates to the federal statute requires Alabama to furnish Aid to needy dependent children as defined in the Federal Act. 
    That's the Alabama Enabling Act. 
    So Alabama in passing that particular piece of legislation has decided to be bound by how the federal government defines dependent child, as have all the other states. 
    Now with respect to HEW, beside in the sense, Mr. Justice Harlan, you have the statute which specifically states that the state acts as the agent for the federal government with respect to dispersing of these funds. 
    You also have under Section 602, the obligations and the powers that are placed upon HEW in dealing with the states. 
    In other words, there is a greater power that HEW has in dealing with respect to the creation of welfare programs. 
    And one finds in many other areas because of the history that existing project on the Social Security Act came into existence. 
    Now Court below, when I think a good deal further than Mrs. Stapp indicated they did go. 
    First of all, they call the right is involved here a statutory entitlement. 
    They called it in other words, a right to receive eligible assistance. 
    And Secretary Fleming when he promulgated to set the Fleming Rule which is set forth at page 19 of the brief, talks about the right where the funds to “provide the basic essentials of life itself”. 
    Now if the Court does get involved in an Equal Protection argument, and the Court finds it necessary to determine which standard one is going to use, then I submit that the standard that should be used in this case is one of strict scrutiny. 
    That the right involved the right to eligible assistance, the right to life, the right to shelter, the right to food, the right to clothing, is the kind of a right that the man in this Court to closely and carefully analyze the kind of regulations that are being passed against them. 
    Secondly, the nature of the group that's involved in this case, the most helpless, the impoverished, and the destitute. Those people who are unable, these needy children unable to come into Court and clarify the kinds of regulations that we're faced here with today. 
    I think that the lower Court was proper, in it's decision every respect, I think the implications of the Fleming Rule will namely with respect to what is the function of these ADC program, what is impermissible, an impermissible attempt under the federal program namely in the Fleming Ruling to control illegitimacy suitable homes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2096.074" stopTime="2139.541">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- equal protection point of view but purely from the statute, and you concluded that the Alabama regulation was contrary that either the federal statute or to a federal regulation, or to a federal rule, would you say then that it's supremacy clause question or is it a matter of treating the State as an native federal government in administering the Act and that the Alabama regulation is simply doesn't authorize but a statute anymore than the similar regulation by HEW might not be authorized by the statute itself.
speaker="martin_garbus" startTime="2139.541" stopTime="2160.669">
    Mr. Martin Garbus 
    I would think that it's something other than a Supremacy Clause because of the existence-- because of the power in HEW to regulate the agency which it's specifically set forth. 
    I would think though that this case could be decided on the grounds that the regulation is inconsistent with the purposes of a Social Security Act, and is inconsistent with the Alabama regulation.

    In defining, as a dependent, in defining, as a parent, which is the language of Section 606, the man who has been described as a substitute father, someone who has no obligation to support them, and he never had seen the child, has not fathered any of the child, does not have custody, has no relationship to the children at all, nonetheless they lose Aid because of it.

    The purposes of the statute, it sets forth in Section 601, the purposes of the statute, the sole purposes of the Aid to Dependent Children Program, but to furnish assistance to needy dependent children.

    Yes.

    Do I understand that if the mother of four children has occasional illicit relations with a man who is not the father of those children, that those children under this Act can be deprived of their rights under the statute. 
    And that there is no obligation at all on the man who is called a “substitute father”. 
    That's correct, isn't it? 
    Now, do I understand that if she marries this man, and he becomes a stepfather of these children that he is not liable for their support?

    Yes. 
    Now, with respect to the argument about how this saves funds, if you have a case load of 150,000 people, and you're interested in saving funds, there's a reasonable way to do it. 
    You just allocate your funds among the most needy.

    In our answer to Mr. Justice White's lies question, we must comply with the federal regulation, yes. 
    HEW has not disapproved our policy. 
    It is under an AO, a negotiation statues. 
    We consider that it is very much like those States who have been approved, and therefore--

    Ms. Mary Lee Stapp 
    If you construed the statute like Mr. Garbus suggests, then HEW would never have had authority to permit any State to carve out lesser classifications. 
    Our theory and a theory all over the country for years, has been a child doesn't get Aid if there are two able-bodied persons in the home. 
    And this able-bodied person does not have to be a person who owes a duty of support. 
    Our regulation sets out to define the (Inaudible) of an able-bodied person who is not married to the mother.

    If you do take the course that's suggested by Mr. Garbus, you will not abolish informal practices.

    She will still have the problem of saying to a family who lives out of wedlock, “Yes, you get a check, but if you're married, you do not.”

    Justice, I would like to mention in connection with the statutory construction, there are excellent briefs that have been submitted on this point, rely on the house version of what the house bill suggested. 
    I do not have this in my brief, and I would appreciate if you're looking at the remarks of Senator Harrison, who is construing what deprivation of parental support meant. 
    And I believe Senator Black was answering here that there -- in senate, he stated “a state will not have to aid every child which it finds to be in need.” 
    Obviously, for many states, that would be too large a burden. 
    It may limit Aid to children living with their widowed mother. 
    Oh, it can include children without parents living with near relatives.
