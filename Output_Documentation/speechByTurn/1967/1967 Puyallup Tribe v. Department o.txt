    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Where we left off yesterday, I think I was discussing the impact of the off reservation Indian fisheries as they have developed in recent years upon the salmon and the steelhead resources of the State. 
    And in this connection, as you may recall, I was referring to certain graphs, which had been admitted into evidence by the trial court which I think demonstrate in graphical form the fundamental nature of the problem in terms of the salmon resource. 
    The graph which you presently see on the chart reflects --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Coniff, I wonder if before you get to that, if you can tell us just what rights under the fishing rights the Indians have under the Treaty as you see it?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="81.996" stopTime="168.636">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    As I see it, Your Honor, the Indians have a right not to be discriminated against and by virtue of the language contained in the Treaty. 
    Now we are relying upon the phrase, “In common with the citizens of the territory” and as I mentioned to Your Honor, yesterday, this phrase “In common with the citizen of the territory” also appears in another context in the Yakima Treaty; that has to do with the right of the Indians to go upon the public road ways. 
    These are interpretations. 
    It's further supported, Your Honor, by the minutes of the Treaty itself, by the minutes of the Treaty of Medicine Creek and the minutes of the Treaty at Camp Walla-Walla, which led to the Treaty negotiated with the confederated tribes and bands that presently are on the Yakima Reservation. 
    This document was admitted into evidence at the trial court, plaintiff's Exhibit “45”. 
    It is a copy of the National Archives Minutes. Referring to page 7. 
    “It was also thought necessary to allow them to fish at all accustomed places since this could not interfere in any manner with the rights of citizens and was necessary for the Indians to obtain subsistence”.

speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="256.444" stopTime="327.246">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    I will concede a very limited bartering although I will not -- at that time, the fish were extremely plentiful and it was certainly and it did not require any great deal of effort to obtain fish at that time, in aboriginal times or pre-treaty times by either Indian or non-Indian by simply putting in a very simple brush wear in shallow waters, which was the testimony at the trial court by the anthropologist. 
    The Indians were able to catch fish. 
    His testimony further was that the Indians did not fish in deep water. 
    They used spears, deep nets and brush wears in shallow water because they simply didn't have the technological ability at that time, with the materials that they had at that time, to construct an obstruction if you will to the deep water or the high velocity water streams; in other words, the main channels of the streams. 
    Their fishing activity occurred primarily in a more shallow tributaries in the various rivers that lead in or feed in into the Puget Sound area.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In answer to the question, the basic question of the Chief Justice as to what your position is as to the meaning of this provision of the Treaty, I want to be sure you -- I understood your answer. 
    You said the -- you thought it simply guaranteed that the Indians would not be discriminated against?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="366.018" stopTime="389.112">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    That is correct. 
    Remembering, Your Honor, that at that time, the Indians at Puget Sound (Inaudible) 1855 were not citizens and could at that time be legally discriminated against. 
    And I think that if the Treaty is read or interpreted in light of its historical context or setting, I think that this gives credence to (Voice overlap) the interpretation that I'm reaching.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="389.112" stopTime="400.729">

    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff

speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="419.820" stopTime="441.981">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    It is being administered equally to Indians or applied to Indians as well as non-Indians. 
    In other words, the law is a, assuming it meets other constitutional test of reasonableness and legislative object and so forth, it is applied uniformly to persons regardless of race, creed or color.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="441.981" stopTime="448.303">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What size is it -- any difference between nets of different sizes?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="448.303" stopTime="511.080">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    Well, Your Honor, the distinction that has been legislatively drawn by the legislature of the State of Washington is that “Thou shall not place nets; thou shall not operate with operate gear or nets of the type and nature which had already been described in fresh water streams of the State” and as I mentioned yesterday, the reason for outlawing netting and fish wheels, fish traps, all are prohibited. 
    Dynamiting is prohibited. Poisoning of the river is prohibited by the legislature to protect these fish in their nurseries. 
    This fish must be able -- must be protected from a net fishery because it constitute such a hazard to the maintenance of the run. 
    As I've mentioned, Your Honor, the economic value of the fish is such that if we further would restrict the Puget Sound fishery for sport and commercial and we got more fish to the mouth of the river, we would merely see a greater Indian take. 
    And, I think this is demonstrated --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="511.080" stopTime="528.428">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You really mean that if you've got 10 times as many fish at the mouth of the river get there now that there wouldn't be some feasible way of regulating the Indian fishing at the mouth of the river in order to ensure that enough fish got through and got up the river?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="528.428" stopTime="564.638">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    My position is, Your Honor, that this is not feasible because, as I mentioned yesterday, I believe in response to Your Honor's question, the fish at the time that they make the transition from salt to fresh water, tend to mill and halt. 
    They actually go through a physiological change. 
    The salmon do in their upstream ascent to the spawning grounds and they will sometimes hold and the evidence on this record and the opinions of the experts that testified in the trial below, clearly indicate that this fish tend to mill and they will hold for three or four weeks. 
    They further, Your Honor --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="564.638" stopTime="595.471">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but if you said -- I would suppose that if you said to the Indians who were fishing there that based on the number of fish that you find at the mouth of the river, if you said – your take should be limited to ex-fisher, ex pound and that's all. 
    Each day or some overall limit you could certainly find some way of guaranteeing that enough fish were left to get up the river.
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="595.471" stopTime="597.382">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    Well, Your Honor --

    You think that's just impractical?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="600.067" stopTime="622.807">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    I must respectfully disagree with your statement. 
    I do believe there are sound biological or management reasons for this State law. 
    But further, Your Honor, I point out to you, is it alright to – and I don't mean to be facetious - but would it be permissible to rob a store if you only took $50 as opposed to $500. 
    The question that I see it from my client's point of view --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="622.807" stopTime="648.267">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, yes but that assumes -- now you're going back to your first point that Indians don't have any right at all that -- and if the Court decides that the Indians do have some right beyond that the ordinary inhabitant, then he is not, he's not stealing $50 or a $1000. 
    He is exercising the right he is supposed to have?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="648.267" stopTime="656.742">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    If the Court finds that he has this right then I think, as a matter of constitutional law, that the State has no right to regulate.

    At all?

    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume though that there was this special right the Indians had another or shared by the other inhabitants. 
    You're suggesting to us that there's no practical way even if 10 times as many fisher arrived at the mouth of the river as were did it up stream. 
    There's no practical way of regulating Indian fishing so as to ensure that enough fish would go on up and still let the Indians catch some fish?

    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    Are you assuming -- Oh! 
    May I? 
    I don't mean to ask you a question and respond to a question. 
    I would point out to you the problem of milling and holding. 
    I would further point out that if the question of how many fish is left to the Indians, I would seriously doubt that sufficient numbers would escape up the stream to the spawning grounds, to perpetuate the run in anyway, anywhere near the -- a production level as opposed to merely maintaining these species of fish in existence and by that I mean one or two fish.

    It would be extremely difficult and force the problem. 
    In this connection, we do have a serious problem in the State of Washington with regards to the identification of members of these various 38 tribes. 
    To my knowledge, tribal rolls had been prepared for only the three or four largest tribes and the smaller tribes, the fragmented groups throughout Puget Sound, do not have membership rolls. 
    This has created serious problems in terms of law enforcement on the part of the game protector.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there no time of the year when it could be said that at that time, it is reasonable as a spawning season and that during that spawning season only the nets cannot be used rather than to say that that no time throughout the year could they fish there with such nets?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="816.050" stopTime="822.725">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="822.725" stopTime="843.306">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That that might be another thing but I'm speaking about biologically and scientifically, could they not limit it to the spawning season? 
    And after all, the only time you would really be interested in is the spawning season, isn't it?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="843.306" stopTime="922.182">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    Well, in the opinion, to answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice, in the opinion of Dr. Van Cleave, the dean of the College of Fisheries, whose opinion was corroborated by Dr. Hamilton and Professor Donaldson, three eminently qualified biologists who have spent their life in science studying the problems of salmon. 
    In their opinion, the answer to your question would be no. 
    They give several reasons for it. 
    I've already mentioned two. 
    There are others. For example, if you have a net fishery which actually sweeps the spawning area itself, which of course are in these fresh water streams, even the fish that aren't taken tend to be disturbed, and tend to spawn unsuccessfully. 
    And there's data in the record which studies and observations which have been made by trained people to indicate that this is a side effect. 
    In other words, the fish are harassed at or about the time that they are to engage in the spawning act. 
    They will tend to spawn unsuccessfully. 
    In other words, they will spawn prematurely in deep water rather than going and making the nest or the red in the gravel in depositing the eggs and continuing on in that manner.

    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    This is a 10% to the Columbia River compact, Your Honor, which is essentially joint management of the fishery by the States of Washington and Oregon. 
    This was ratified by Congress so that you have a concurrent jurisdiction established pursuant to the compact so that this particular (Voice overlap) will not apply.

    That is correct.

    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The point I was making by my illustration was that there is -- there have been in the last 30 years greater and greater restrictions placed upon both commercial and sport fisheries, particularly commercial.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1181.293" stopTime="1279.724">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That might be fine but I suppose the Indians, one of the Indian statement is that they have a right to fish at customary places by the Medicine Creek Treaty and that then the State comes along and says, “You can't fish at all because can't -- net at all here in fresh water for conservation reasons” but at the same time, the State permits a commercial fisheries to net in the salt water. 
    Now, both of them result in the reduction of fish population. 
    And there are regulations and restrictions with respect to commercial fisheries and the question that we've been pursuing here as I understand it, is why can't there be a comparable commercial -- comparable regulations with respect to the Indians' use of nets. 
    Now, may be they can't be in terms of fish taken, but can't there be in terms of some reasonable arrangements with respect to days and what not? 
    The fish that the commercial fisheries catch, don't go back and spawn. 
    May be some of them are on their way back from having spawn but others, I suppose, are on their way to the river to spawn and that matter where the fish is apprehended if it doesn't get to it spawning place, it doesn't spawn, is that right?

    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    The Indians are being regulated, Your Honor, on the same basis as all other --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1304.616" stopTime="1367.157">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, that's what we're pursuing here because I'm not at all sure, Indians have a right to pursue their fishing at customary places. 
    Customary place here is at the mouth of the river and when you say you can't do it at the same time you permit the commercial fisheries to use nets and you subject them to regulation. 
    The question is -- are you taking your interpretation of the Treaty on that basis, are you really giving the Indians equivalent or equal treatment with the non-Indians? 
    That's a question and it is somewhat affected by practical consideration whether you could subject the Indians to comparable regulations – that is in terms of days or something like that.

    No, assuming your construction which is that this is a “right in common”, that is to say that they have a right to fish there, which is subject to regulation by the State, but that the regulation must -- within human exacted to you than no more, they even handed in its operation on the Indians on the one hand and on the non-Indians on the other?

    And here, what you say is that the Indians can't net. 
    Nobody can net in fresh water. 
    I mean, the Indians can't net at all per se if they don't have any particular status with respect to salt water and as practical matter they don't engage in that kind of commercial fishing. 
    But you say that the commercial fisheries can net out in salt water and it's arguable. 
    I'm not saying anything more than that but I'm suggesting to you that it's arguable; arguable that that is not the equality of treatment.
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="1470.679" stopTime="1594.608">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    Well, I would have to respectfully disagree with you, Your Honor. 
    There are two points that do occur to me as a result of your statement. 
    The first is, that there in fact are numerous Indians who engage in the salt water fishery and in fact quite recently, the Bureau of Indians Affairs has obtained apparently the necessary appropriations and has purchased purse seine vessels for the Makah Tribes and the Makah Tribe is now going to be as a tribal operation, fishing commercial in the straits Juan de Fuca. 
    There are, as I mentioned, there are numerous Indians who do engage in the salt water fishery and there was certainly have no provisional limitation upon their ability to do so if they so desired. 
    I think another point that should be called to the attention of the Court has to do with the value of the fish at the time or at the point of its migration where it's caught. 
    Now if you take a fish that's up near the spawning grounds, you've got a fish that is changed substantially in quality, deteriorated in quality from that same bright fish, which would be taken in the salt water. 
    It has spent a great deal of its bodily energies in making its ascent or upstream migration. 
    Its flesh, it's body oils have been expanded. 
    It's flesh, rather than being firmed is soft and shrunky. 
    It is a very low commercial value fish. 
    The evidence, I believe, is in the record which indicates that some of this lower value fish would go down as low as three to five cents of pound for the first price to the fishermen as opposed to salt water in the same value of thirty-five to forty cents of pound. 
    These are very rough figures. 
    I'm giving you the exact market quotations but there is, there isn't can be and it is a substantial difference in the actual economic value of that fish, depending upon the point which it's taken.

    Why does the State limit commercial fishing to 280 odd days a year rather than 365?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="1603.565" stopTime="1637.760">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    Your Honor, I think this goes back about ten minutes and I know I'm going overtime in terms of my colleagues, I do want to point out that -- that was only the first part of my illustration. 
    In 1942, the States, under the Columbia River Compact, the States of Oregon and Washington allowed 274 days for gill nets in the Lower Columbia. 
    In 1967, the States of Washington and Oregon allowed 80 days, the same trend is apparent on the Puget Sound fishery, both as it would apply to purse seine or drift gill net type of fisheries.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1637.760" stopTime="1643.241">

    So why did they put the 274 in the first place instead of 365?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="1643.241" stopTime="1653.236">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    At that time, Your Honor, the management agencies, the persons who are trained in this field or in this science if you will, made the decision that they had a certain escapement goal to make.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1653.236" stopTime="1653.831">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They have what?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="1653.831" stopTime="1689.280">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    An escapement goal to make of so many fish over Booneville Dam of the various species. 
    At that time, the runs were in a lot better shape than they are now. 
    So, therefore, they were able to meet their escapement goal and yet allow this much fishery. 
    In order to meet the same escapement goal for that same number of fish over Booneville Dam on the Columbia, they had to reduce the fishery on the various species in the Columbia on salmon now from 274 days in 1942 to 80 days in 1967 and those figures are not -- they are fairly reflective figures in terms of --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1689.280" stopTime="1706.149">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The reason I asked that question was if you can put an arbitrary date like that on the commercial fishing, why couldn't you put similar date on the gill nets at the mouth of the river?
speaker="joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr" startTime="1706.149" stopTime="1756.008">
    Mr. Joseph L. Coniff 
    Well, Your Honor, I keep repeating myself but the problem is that if you allow a fishery there, it will say hypothesize one day a week and the fish that it's fishing, the stock that it's fishing is a stock that's milling as opposed to migrating, which is one reason by the way, Your Honors, that there is a fishery allowed in the lower Columbia for commercial purposes is because it is migration water as opposed to holding water. 
    This fish do not stop in their migrations. 
    They don't begin to stop until they are up either in the mouth of these rivers they've already made their salt to fresh transition in their life cycle and they don't begin to hold up until they begin to get up into the tributaries either above Booneville or up the water limit or one of the other tributaries in the Lower Columbia.

    Mr. Johnston?
speaker="mike_r_johnston" startTime="1891.002" stopTime="1967.947">
    Mr. Mike R. Johnston 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    If I can return a minute to what co-counsel was discussing, the fish are not frangible items. 
    They are not at all the same. 
    Even within a single stream, the fish are different. 
    They are possessed of different gene characteristics and they go to different parts of the stream and the difficulty with catching fish with a net at the mouth of the river on fresh water is that the fish mill around and they stay there and you fish over and over again on the same stocks. 
    The same fish are being fished today, tomorrow or next week, may be two weeks from now depending on how long they stay there. 
    And so what you would effectively do is you effectively destroy a certain portion of that run and that portion that once it's destroyed, it may never return again. 
    In other words, fish A may go three miles upstream, fish B will go four miles upstream, fish C will go five miles upstream. 
    If you remove fish A, there aren't anymore fish A's. 
    If you catch every fish A, then effectively you destroyed that portion of the run.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1967.947" stopTime="1990.131">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If you have commercial fishing for 274 days a year and some of those days, the fish are on their way through the Sound up to the rivers to spawn, you're cutting down the number too that are going up their to spawn, aren't you?
speaker="mike_r_johnston" startTime="1990.131" stopTime="2031.849">
    Mr. Mike R. Johnston 
    You're always taking numbers. 
    That's the reason for having a resource; it's the utilizing. 
    And what you try to do -- if you're trying -- the commercial fishing as regulated in such a way -- the fishing boat stays in one place and the fish goes, the fish swim by essentially. 
    Now if the fishing boat stays in one place and the fish are staying in one place, everyday of scooping out the same sparks all the time and you're destroying, effectively destroying a portion of the run. 
    They will never, probably never, come back. 
    Commercial fishing is allowed in Puget Sound, for example --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2031.849" stopTime="2035.414">

    We're sports fishermen. 
    Take it. 
    And it makes no difference. 
    This bloodline ancestry is not of any concern to us.

    Because if you start of with the conclusion, I'm not saying that I do but that's what this litigation is about fundamentally, you start off with the conclusions that the Indians have a right here and that that right is being impaired by the regulation.

    Our position essentially is that the Treaty gave the Indians a right to fish in common with the citizens of the territory. 
    In 1855, the Indians had effectively had no right. 
    As a legal matter, they had no right. 
    There weren't citizens. 
    They were just simply people who had been defeated and conquered. 
    The Treaty was made with them and they gave them a right to fish in common. 
    It was a grant from the United States to the Indians, not the other way around.

    Mr. Mike R. Johnston 
    Oh! 
    It's in the interest of maintaining the resource and it's commercial fishermen benefit from that and that's correct. 
    But it's not -- it's in the Indians own interest themselves. 
    The Hoko River is a perfect example of what happens when you over fish a stream. 
    In 1952, they got 10,000 silver salmon in the Hoko River. 
    It's a stream that runs through the reservation and we have no control over it and then the runs have gone down to about 3,000 fish a year, that's their take. 
    That resource has effectively been destroyed.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3358.187" stopTime="3366.999">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that necessarily from the Indian fishing or might be from 274 days a year commercial fishing?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I know, but why then did they drop the 274 to 80?
speaker="mike_r_johnston" startTime="3377.679" stopTime="3384.316">
    Mr. Mike R. Johnston 
    Because the resource is dwindling. 
    The total numbers of fish available are coming down. 
    They're getting smaller.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3384.316" stopTime="3406.258">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did you have the same thing in the Sound which you have here? 
    Your fish is dwindling because of the method of fishing and the number of fish they take.
speaker="mike_r_johnston" startTime="3406.258" stopTime="3479.784">
    Mr. Mike R. Johnston 
    Your Honor, the reason that the runs are – they are going down over a long period of time. 
    It's the difference between 274 days and 80 days was 27 years. 
    In other words, the fishing time was cut down over a period 27 years. 
    Here's another example of what happens. 
    This is the Yakima River. 
    It's a river that runs through an Indian reservation. 
    The Indians have a perfect legal right to fish there as much as they like in any matter and in any means they'd care to choose. 
    In 1953, there are approximately a catch of about 2,000 salmon and that was in the escapement and the escapement to spawn of about 6,000 salmon. 
    The catch goes up and the spawning -- the numbers of fish available for spawning have to decrease. 
    It simply have to decrease because there are only so many fish in the river. 
    The more you catch, the fewer there are to spawn.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3479.784" stopTime="3492.291">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I understand that the only legal [Inaudible] is that we have a long commercial fishing season. 
    They're bound to catch fish along their way up to spawn.
speaker="mike_r_johnston" startTime="3492.291" stopTime="3493.232">
    Mr. Mike R. Johnston 
    That's correct.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3493.232" stopTime="3511.983">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If you stop them, if you don't stop them from taking those fish when they are their way up to spawn, why don't you contribute very greatly to the same condition that you say will exist if the Indians are permitted to gill net on the river?
speaker="mike_r_johnston" startTime="3511.983" stopTime="3516.138">
    Mr. Mike R. Johnston 
    Your Honor, these fish are already in the river. 
    They're there and that's where did they take it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3516.138" stopTime="3517.315">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I know, I know those --
speaker="mike_r_johnston" startTime="3517.315" stopTime="3555.576">
    Mr. Mike R. Johnston 
    Alright, and it does no good. 
    It does no good to let 400 fish get to the river, if the Indians are going to take all 400 of them. 
    It makes no difference whether it's 400 or a 1000. 
    They're going to take them all if you -- ordinarily, with that 500 fish get to the river and you let a 1000 get to the river and the Indians take all a 1000, it makes no difference to the spawning, that's just as barren and just as empty. 
   
   
   
   Argument of George S. Woodworth
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3555.576" stopTime="3560.153">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Woodworth?
speaker="george_s_woodworth" startTime="3560.153" stopTime="3765.599">
    Mr. George S. Woodworth 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I speak of the interest of Oregon in this litigation because Oregon shares with Washington a community of interest, which is particularly referred to the area of the Columbia River drainage. 
    The Columbia River runs between Oregon and Washington and by virtue of congressional approval of a compact between the States, Oregon and Washington jointly managed the Columbia River, fishing on the Columbia River. 
    Now, the Columbia River is different from the Puyallup River or the rivers in most of western Washington because the Columbia River is the highway by which the fish reach the up river streams. 
    So we have a little different problem in the Columbia River that is indicated in the rivers of western Washington. 
    In that river, there have been built a great number of dams. 
    It started in 1941 with the completion of Grand Coulee Dam. 
    Grand Coulee Dam wiped out 1100 miles of salmon spawning streams. 
    Since that time there have been five dams built below Coulee, each of which has had its impact on the -- not only on the ability of the fish to spawn, but on the ability of the fish to reach their spawning beds. 
    And it's for this reason because that -- the States of Oregon and Washington have used their staffs of experts in the fisheries to attempt to determine how many fish must pass up the river in order to preserve the runs. 
    I think it's been spoken up here that in 1911, 50 million pounds of fish were harvested out of the Columbia River. 
    That was in 1911. 
    Since and the last figure we have was for 1967 when 9 million pounds were harvested and 1967 was one of the best years we've had in the Columbia River in recent years. 
    In -- part of this period, when we've kept records, we've kept the record of the Indian catch because they report it to the selling agencies. 
    In 1959, the Indians on the Columbia River caught 39 thousand pounds of salmon. 
    In 1967, when we think there were probably not more than 75 or may be 80 Indians fishing, they caught 1,300,000 pounds of fish. 
    The whole purpose of the two agency's activities on the Columbia River has been to enable enough fish to get upstream, to keep an even balance if we could just keep --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3765.599" stopTime="3775.868">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, is any difference between the effect of the Indian catch and the non-Indian catch on the Columbia River?

speaker="george_s_woodworth" startTime="3831.350" stopTime="3840.910">
    Mr. George S. Woodworth 
    Indians are catching more fish because the State of Oregon has been enjoined by the federal court from interfering with the Indian fishing.

    Mr. George S. Woodworth 
    I think it's the position of the State of Oregon, Your Honor, that the Indian fishery should be subject to some modicum of regulation in those areas where the fish are most vulnerable.

    Mr. George S. Woodworth 
    Your Honor, I think it's my position and the position of the State of Oregon that the Treaty gives the Indians the right to fish at certain stations in the river and this right cannot be denied them. 
    To what extent the Indians may fish at this usual and accustomed places? 
    We feel it's a matter which this Court has passed on a number of times before that it's a matter in which the States have the right to regulate. 
    Up to this time, the Court has only said in number of cases and I'm referring now to ward versus Race Horse, Kennedy versus Becker, Tulee against Washington and the Village of Cake versus Eigen. 
    In all of those cases, the Court has said that the Treaty rights of the Indians as to their off reservation activities are still subject to State regulation.

    Mr. George S. Woodworth 
    Our local federal court has said they can. 
    We're enjoined from enforcing our hunting and fishing laws against them and I think the answer is they do. 
    But hunting doesn't cut down the resource as unlimited fishing is apt to do and it's with the fishing industry that we're principally concerned and we don't want to and we're not making a case for the commercial fishermen. 
    The commercial fishermen have already been inhibited. 
    Commercial seasons are set on the Columbia River for different runs and generally they are by days. 
    As an example, in the summers of 1965, well in the whole year, 1965, 1966 and 1967, all commercial and sports fishing for the summer chinook was closed on the Columbia River. 
    There was none. 
    No sportsmen talk this rod out, no commercial fishermen took his gear out, but the Indians caught 10,000 chinook salmons that summer.

    Mr. George S. Woodworth 
    If there's to be an Indian fishery, there will be a season for it and it will be set to accommodate the run as it moves up the 200 miles of the river.

   Argument of T. J. Jones III
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4438.619" stopTime="4456.638">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Gentlemen, you're time was expired but Mr. Jones, who is here from Idaho, isn't not? 
    You may have five minutes to close, Mr. Jones if you wish and counsel may have additional five minutes if they desire.
speaker="t_j_jones_iii" startTime="4456.638" stopTime="4620.736">
    Mr. T. J. Jones III 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    There's only one or two items here that I want to talk about in view of the shortness of the time that I have. 
    I wanted to point out to the Court that all of our opponents in the Puyallup's case, this of course does not include Mr. Tanner and his clients, the Nisquallies, here before the Court have suggested that the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior in July of 1967 offer the best solution to the problem of off reservation Indian fishing. 
    The States have rejected this offer by the Department of Interior. 
    This, of course, is not the first time that the three involved States: Washington, Oregon and Idaho have rejected the pro offered federal regulations. 
    Nearly three years ago, in July 1965, the Department of Interior circulated proposed regulations almost identical to those that were promulgated by the Secretary in July of last year. 
    These proposed regulations were delivered to the Governors of the three States with the request that the States support the Secretary in the adoption, promulgation and the enforcement of the federal off reservation Indian fishing regulations. 
    After due consideration, the three States unanimously rejected the proposed federal Indian fishing regulations on the basis that amongst other things that out of the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the power has not delegated to the States by the Constitution and are prohibited to it by the States, prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively or to the people. 
    That by virtue of this Amendment, it is historically been held by this Court that title to wildlife resources insofar as you're capable of ownership, rests in the States as a trustee thereof for the benefit of all the citizens of the States, Indian and non-Indian. 
    And therefore, it's the States took the position that neither the federal government nor the Indians have the power to regulate State resources.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4620.736" stopTime="4626.587">

    Yes, we have to file memoranda to the Court on that point.

   Argument of Arthur Knodel
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="4862.279" stopTime="4896.207">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Supreme Court. 
    First of all, let me state that I can see nothing inconsistent with the idea of having an adequate, having such ruling that would impose upon the Indians the duty or a restriction to permit a proper escapement to continue this run of salmon because no group wants to maintain that salmon run more than the Indians. 
    There is nothing –

    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    I don't think --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4904.901" stopTime="4909.220">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- I think that permits a proper escapement when you're fishing at the mouth of the stream.
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="4909.220" stopTime="4966.492">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    I don't think this is -- the State's testimony repeatedly showed that they had different -- they have a fish biologist showed how they could follow this fish down the straits, the Puyallup run or any other run and then select from that run as they proceed down into the mouth of the Puyallup. 
    Let me point to the Court and it probably answers this question little more indirectly. 
    This is the map of the Puget Sound area. 
    This is the area what they referred to as Commencement Bay. 
    Commencement Bay is a 52 square mile area and your fishing in approximately commercial fishing ends approximately two miles from the mouth of the Puyallup River. 
    This red line here is the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Indian reservation which has never been terminated by any Act of Congress. 
    The state --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4966.492" stopTime="4978.871">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But the Indians -- did the Indians still -- there is still a reservation in existence except as an abstract conception?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="4978.871" stopTime="4988.386">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    It is a reservation in this sense. 
    There was a General Allotment Act. 
    In that General Allotment Act, the various area was allotted --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4988.386" stopTime="4990.881">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    To the Indians respectively?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="4990.881" stopTime="4991.261">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    This is correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4991.261" stopTime="5001.458">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And if a reservation exists, and it exists conceptually and not in terms of land ownership?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5001.458" stopTime="5156.753">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    This is correct. 
    Much of the land is still owned by the Indians themselves as allotments in the course of the Tribe itself owns the land within. 
    But anything, this was an Article II granted to the Indians of the Medicine Creek Treaty as their exclusive right. 
    They reserved this in which they can live peacefully and which they could fish from. 
    Now, the fishing right is a communal right that belongs to the Tribe itself and in this particular case, they have never been -- the fishing rights never been abandoned by them, it has never been terminated by the federal government just like federal government has never terminated the reservation. 
    And there is a termination statute which specifically provides that the federal government can terminate a reservation or can terminate a Tribe. 
    One other thing I wish to bring out is these fish, when they proceed up to Puyallup River, the fishing actually, the Puyallup fishery actually ends just on the other side of what we call the Clarks Pink Bridge with approximately three miles up from the mouth of the Puyallup River, from the mouth of the river. 
    These fish then proceed up and spawn. 
    There is no spawning in this area at all, there's none. 
    There's no spawning inside this particular area here. 
    The fish proceed up to other crate. 
    The State showed yesterday a rather detailed, it is here, on these tributaries. 
    The fish will travel, like I say, 40 to 50 miles up and then they will go to these various branches: the White River, the Stock River, the Clark River, numerous rivers that they do. 
    But one thing I want to submit to the Court is this: that assuming the Court rules that the State does have the right through the exercise of its police power to totally restrict the off reservation fishing or the “in common” fishing, this is not going to resolve the problem. 
    Because of this, there are in addition to the Puyallup reservation, there are 17 other reservations in the State and as it turned out, the fish, the greatest number of fish always happen to be going into the reservation area, in the area that the Indians have their fishing exclusively and as the State has indicated, “exclusively”. 
    They concede, everybody agrees here that on a reservation, the Indians have the right to fish unrestricted.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5156.753" stopTime="5160.897">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Did they concede that that applies to the Puyallup reservation?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5160.897" stopTime="5180.310">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    No, the State takes the position that the Puyallup reservation no longer exists, their position is that. 
    However, they do recognize for example the Quinault reservation and other reservations. 
    The State says those exist, but what the State is doing is gradually taking away the fishing rights of the Indians.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5180.310" stopTime="5196.730">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So that if they -- if the Puyallup Indians wanted to fish upstream on the Puyallup river within what you submit as a reservation, you would had the same problem with which we're dealing now?

    It's a 3-mile area that the Indians have in fishing from the mouth of the river up to the point up here, it's approximately 3 miles. 
    It's the area the Indian net fishery has been taking place. 
    They see -- the problem I think is this that some place down the line, it's our contention that this whole field of Indian matter arising out of the Constitution, the Constitution, it's our position, we're dealing with Treaty, we're dealing with Indians, we feel that this is a federal domain and the point is this. 
    If this Supreme Court makes the finding that the Indians do have a right, that they do have this Treaty right as we believe we have, and then places upon the federal government the position that they assist in these regulations and they work with us. 
    Now the interesting thing about it, this has been such a conflict on this point that the federal government did not come in to help these Indians until at the State Supreme Court level. 
    The situation got to the point where they felt they had to intervene. 
    But here we are, Indians, we're sitting, we got a Treaty, we've got a Treaty with the United States Government, a promise from them and what happens? 
    The federal government isn't fighting with the State or they don't want to get too far involved. 
    They feel the law is too vague or something. 
    The State in turn keeps very actively going.

    Suppose we decided that this Treaty did not give the Indians the rights for which you contend, how many Indians would be directly affected? 
    Do you or somebody here said the only one who is endangered, as I understand it, was kind of fishing don't to much more than a 100 in number.

    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    At the trial, it was shown that 70 different families fish --

    Seventy different families --

    In this fish in this way?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5596.217" stopTime="5601.330">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    Yes, fish commercially in this usual and accustomed ground. 
    Now --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5601.330" stopTime="5603.905">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Are you talking only about the Puyallup now?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5603.905" stopTime="5697.197">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    I'm talking about the Puyallups, yes. 
    Now, the one thing it affects all of them but this is something everybody losses sight of. 
    Is this fishing by the Puyallups has been under considerable harassment, after the Satiacum case came down in 1953, up to that point, the State was continuously arresting and taking Indians. 
    Satiacum was arrested in 1953. 
    The State of Washington, by a split decision, determined that Satiacum was released and then the Indians proceeded to fish more. 
    This is true. 
    They had fished prior to that time but it was a continuous harassment by the State. 
    Then what happened was, since then, as the records will show, the State has been openly watching and doing everything possible, gathering it's facts, it's data to come back in and select another time and another day to come back and move in. 
    This has made the fishing such a difficult position for these Indian people that it's been difficult for them to possibly work on it. 
    We've also had the problem that the federal government has been rather weak in this particular field because they haven't really known exactly what they should be doing, but I think once the Court determines that this is a right, that the right is there and it's certainly our contention that this is the federal area and this will be taken cared of in the State of Washing -- Oregon will go ahead and resolve this problem.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But may I ask you, Mr. Knodel, if under the Treaty, you make any distinction between the rights -- the communal rights of the Tribe and the rights of an individual, who is a Puyallup Indian, to go out and engage in commercial fishing?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5793.078" stopTime="5795.108">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    I don't know whether I understand the question --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5795.108" stopTime="5826.260">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you mean that these individuals who are commercial fishermen, because they are Puyallup Indians, have the right to exercise all of the rights that the Tribe, as a communal group, can exercise under the Treaty? 
    By that, I tell you why I asked a question. 
    You said a moment ago that this never went through the reservation?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5826.260" stopTime="5826.652">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5826.652" stopTime="5866.212">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And that on the reservation, they could do anything they want insofar as fishing is concerned? 
    I suppose there, they would do what is communal rights. 
    The Tribe could control it. 
    Do you mean that that would also give the rights to individuals to go out as individuals to compete with other commercial fishermen for their own particular benefit, not for the benefit of the Tribe and may be in opposition to the views of the Tribe so far as the use of the river is concerned?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5866.212" stopTime="5887.238">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    It is tribal position that this is a communal right. 
    The on reservation fishing, the usual and accustomed fishing, this is subject to control by the tribe. 
    And if the tribe determines to cut down or whatever the tribe determines to do, the tribe has that right because it is a tribal right. 
    It doesn't belong to any individual.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5887.238" stopTime="5890.960">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But did the tribe get any benefit from this commercial fishing?

    They have not.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5891.990" stopTime="5894.070">

    But why are they interested in there?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5894.070" stopTime="5913.607">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    They are interested because they have certain tribal people that are fishing, that are interested in this particular fishing right and these are part of the tribe and if these men are restrained or prohibited from fishing, then of course, we have the problem that the other members loss their right too.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5913.607" stopTime="5924.218">

    As to the fishing, yes.

    What restrictions did they put on it?
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5946.920" stopTime="5955.564">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    There's certain length of nets and so various different items. 
    Now, we've had one problem with that which I -- is it so much alright for me to continue?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5955.564" stopTime="5957.569">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, you may answer the question.
speaker="arthur_knodel" startTime="5957.569" stopTime="6050.777">
    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    The problem we've had is this. 
    The Puyallup Tribe prepared these regulations, the governing tribal counsel. 
    These regulations were submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and at that time they were submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which was a good member years ago, a problem developed because of all the uncertainty in this particular field. 
    As to the usual and accustomed fishing and the State's position that they have the right to regulate, federal government had no right in this area, then as a result, no action was taken. 
    Now, anything the Tribe does, we have to do through because we are more or less created or Treaty as with the United States Government. 
    We've got to do through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
    Now, what's happened, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the federal government has just been slow to get around to this problem if they just haven't caught up, I guess. 
    Now, there's starting to and you will notice how they came in on passing these regulations, these other regulations they submitted and also they entered this case when we got to the State Supreme Court. 
    So, what I'm saying, now that the federal government has taken the position or this Court clears the air and says, “Well, this is a Treaty right and if the Indians do have a right to fish, this is a federal government area. 
    You're going to have the federal government come into this and assist these Tribes in proper and decent conservation. 
    You're going to have on the reservations anyhow so this is just as good a place to start as any”.

    They've mixed with the white people, they've gone to the schools and integrated with them and they do not maintain any kind of tribal relationship.

    -- and in order to prepare, hearings were had to bring the various people up to, you know, to determine whether they were members of the Tribe and after they had arrived at that decision, this roll was completed and in the by-laws it states that no one – “that in order to be a member of the Tribe, you would have to be born within radius of 20 miles from the Indian hospital”, which is right in the heart of the, right next [Inaudible]

    Mr. Arthur Knodel 
    Well, the point is, the matter that it didn't get into the Brief because the Supreme Court of the State of Washington ruled there was a Tribe. 
    So the matters that came up before this Court is the question of what right does the State of Washington have to regulate the usual and accustomed fishing grounds and the fishing rights of the Puyallup Indians. 
    This is the matter before the Court so I didn't submit anything on this particular matter.
