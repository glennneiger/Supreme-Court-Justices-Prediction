    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    26, Raymond Hopkins, Petitioner, versus John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. 
    Mr. Weinstein.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="16.655" stopTime="69.904">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday, as the Court adjourned, I was reviewing briefly the administrative procedures followed by someone who has applied for and been denied Social Security benefits. 
    To summarize them quickly, there are essentially two steps in the administrative procedure: a hearing examiner and Appeals Council. 
    There's an opportunity to present evidence at both stages. 
    There's an opportunity for counsel at both stages. 
    In fact, as the record in the District Court here showed, Mr. Hopkins in this case was represented for the first time at the appeal stage, although he had written notice at least of his right to counsel at the lower stage and he did testify at the hearing that he could read. 
    Now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="69.904" stopTime="72.774">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But it's counsel to be chosen and retained by him.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="72.774" stopTime="75.416">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    That is correct. 
    There are --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="75.416" stopTime="81.791">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There's no provision within the agency to get the free legal help or advice, is there?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="81.791" stopTime="113.394">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    No, there is not, Mr. Justice Stewart, but I was interested to learn last night from the annual report of the legal services program of the Office of Economic Opportunity that, in the most recent fiscal year, they provided assistance to something over 3,000, I think the number was 3,200, applicants. 
    And, while the statistics don't show the stage which that occurred, I would infer that it occurred at some administrative level since the number of pending Court cases don't, I think, reach that number. 
    But, there is --

    Under Social Security generally. 
    I do not know how many of them with disability, how many were old age or survivors, but I-- the number was 3,200-and something.

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    The neighborhood legal services program of the Office of Economic Opportunity. 
    The line in their report, just listing on categories of welfare problems, lists Social Security matter or something of that euchring gives a number like 3,200 cases during a fiscal year.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What is -- what is the responsibility of the examiner in the situation?

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I would think, certainly, it is and I think that what I have been able to uncover since yesterday is, for example, instructions to personnel and the field officers of the Social Security Administration. 
    And, there's a paragraph of instruction that is called “explaining hearing,” and they are told to give the applicant who is dissatisfied with what's been done with his initial application oral advice together with the written advice about what his rights are. 
    And, one of the sentences in that states as follows: inform him that a hearing is a semiformal proceeding before a hearing examiner wherein he may present evidence, witnesses, and oral or written arguments and may appear with an attorney or other representative. 
    The statute, by the way, makes allowance for representation by non-attorneys. 
    And, also in the instruction, it tells the employee of the department to follow in the oral presentation a booklet that is entitled “Right to Appeal” that I would presume is also given to the applicant and describes generally what the review procedures are.

    I cannot -- I cannot answer that, Justice Fortas.

    Please do that.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="406.807" stopTime="419.306">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And, in that connection, Mr. Weinstein, I think you told us yesterday that whatever this proceeding is-- this judicial proceeding is, the determination is made on the agency record.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="419.306" stopTime="439.501">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Yes. 
    Now, there are three possible determinations, Justice Brennan. 
    One is to affirm, one is to reverse, and one is to remand to take more evidence or for reconsideration in the administrative level. 
    And so, the record wallet is closed for purposes of the District Court's decision on the merits. 
    The District Court may direct a reopening of the record.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="439.501" stopTime="448.337">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But, I gather, really crucial to the claimant's whole case is the kind of record that's made in the agency, isn't it?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="448.337" stopTime="513.432">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    To the factual part of it. 
    Of course, I think that a large measure of the litigation that's taken place over the last five or seven years has gone to the legal standards in this area determining disability and the Courts, I think, showed a rather short disagreement, at least in some circuits, with the agency's interpretation. 
    Now, there was a petition for certiorari pending, but this was resolved by Congress in the recent Act which, I believe, in Section 158 (b) of the Act became effective January 2 of this year overruled the Court's that had disagreed with the agency's interpretation of disability. 
    And so, I think it's hard to gauge or really to say that the factual determinations have been largely dispositive because there has been this legal dispute and, as I say, that it had resulted in a split among the circuits that Congress has now resolved.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="513.432" stopTime="519.909">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Do you know -- do you know when evidence is taken at these hearings as a verbatim transcript?

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Yes. 
    I had been under the impression that the -- yesterday that the hearings had been brought to this Court. 
    Now, I've checked this morning and found that, although they are in the record of the District Court, they had not been brought forward on appeal because the issues had gone solely to the maximum attorney's fees and I, with permission of the other side, I assume we could have this sent forward to this Court. 
    What it shows is a record of 129 pages, including transcript, exhibits, the hearing examiner's written decision, the appeal counsel's refusal to go further while looking at additional evidence, the brief that Mr. Sharp submitted to the appeals counsel, and --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="561.162" stopTime="568.857">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Are we to understand then that such a transcript, under agency regulations, is required when the hearing is held?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="568.857" stopTime="593.414">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Yes. 
    And I understand that as a matter of course this type of booklet or exhibit would be attached to the agency's answer to the complaint to the District Court. 
    Now, this particular transcript shows 55 typed pages of evidence at a hearing lasting perhaps two hours, but there is the same type of transcript that one would have in a Court proceeding.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="593.414" stopTime="601.795">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is the only question presented in this case is the amount of fees to be paid a lawyer?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="601.795" stopTime="613.679">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    The question, I think, is even more limited than that, Mr. Justice Black. 
    It's the maximum amount of the fee that a District Court can direct for representation before that Court.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="613.679" stopTime="623.311">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That is whether it can be measured by the fee or the amount paid to claimant alone about the other beneficiaries --

    That's --

    -- a family beneficiary claim.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="625.165" stopTime="626.329">

    That is correct, Justice Black.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="626.329" stopTime="631.422">

    That's the only issue that's on defense that is presented in any way but --
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="631.422" stopTime="694.846">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    That is right. 
    There's no contention in this case that there was any inadequacy of procedure or any inadequacy of representation and, in fact, I do not think that the Court decisions-- the earlier Court decisions suggest that. 
    For example, the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have each, in earlier cases, gone over records where the applicant was not-- chose not to have counsel at any stage through the Court of Appeals, and commented on the meticulous nature of the hearing examiner and the administrator's actions. 
    And, if the Court is interested in those decisions which are not in our brief, the Eighth Circuit is Brasher against Celebrezze in 340 F.2d at page 413 and the Ninth Circuit decision is Paul against Celebrezze at 337 F.2d, page 352.

    Thank you.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="701.811" stopTime="716.011">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And the amount on which the government claims this fee must be computed is the amount paid to the person who's actually injured rather than to his family?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="716.011" stopTime="820.687">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    That is correct, Justice Black, and we reach this I think on a two-pronged argument, one on the basis of the-- what the committee report says that the Congress had in mind and the other is on our reading of the plain language of the statute. 
    The legislation arouse at-- after a time when the Courts had adopted the practice of approving fees in these cases, generally according to contingent fee arrangements that the applicant had entered into with his counsel, often going as high as 30% or 40% or 50% of past-due benefits, and it was at this point that the legislation was introduced and we think for the purpose of cutting back on this Court practice. 
    And, the committee report which we've set forth at pages 10 and 11 of our brief has the following Act. 
    It has come to the attention of the committee that attorneys have, upon occasion, charged what appear to be inordinately large fees for representing claimants in Federal District Court actions arising under the Social Security program. 
    Usually, these large fees result from a contingent fee arrangement, under which the attorney is entitled to a percentage frequently one-third to one-half of the approved benefits. 
    Since litigation necessarily involves a considerable lapse of time, in many cases large amounts of accrued benefits, and consequently large legal fees are payable if the claimant wins his case. 
    And then, there's a sentence that we quote that, like the two sentences that Mr. Sharp referred to yesterday, paraphrase the statute. 
    And -- but from this --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="820.687" stopTime="836.983">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you happen to know whether the contingent fee arrangements before the statute was passed made the contingency dependant on the recovery -- total recovery or on the recovery of your claimant?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="836.983" stopTime="881.399">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I can only speak with precision to the one in this case, Justice Harlan, and that was signed by both, I believe, Mr. Hopkins and Mrs. Hopkins. 
    And that probably, it went to both. 
    I don't recall the precise language. 
    Let's -- I think that the language is, at best, ambiguous. 
    It says that Mr. Sharp isn't hired to prosecute his claim, referring to Mr. Hopkins, but then the document is signed by both Mr. Hopkins and Mrs. Hopkins.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="881.399" stopTime="886.729">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do those contracts have to be filed with any -- with the agency?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="886.729" stopTime="907.497">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I do not believe so if it takes place with respect to Court proceedings. 
    When the fee is charged for proceedings before the agency, then it has to be subjected to the approval of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and it's a misdemeanor to charge more than he approves.

    Mr. Weinstein, if I may interrupt you just a moment. 
    Again, when I ask you that question about the examiner, what I really want to know is this. 
    What is the function of the examiner when he takes the evidence in these cases? 
    Is he sitting there as a judge in an adversary case deciding between the claimant and the agency or is he there to help and to see that the claimant gets all the facts in the case in the record?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="976.171" stopTime="979.039">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, he surely sits there to make a decision.

    I beg your pardon?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="979.697" stopTime="1007.046">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    He surely ma-- sits there to make a decision and he does give -- render a written decision. 
    I don't know and if in terms of his instructions or the Secretary's conception of the hearing examiner's role to what extent he is expected to seek out evidence on behalf of the claimant, but we would certainly include this information in what we would provide the Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1007.046" stopTime="1041.039">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Because I know, in some workman's compensation jurisdictions, the examiner there is suppose to look after the interest of the claimant. 
    That's why they don't encourage lawyers to be in that initial hearing and the examiner, himself, is suppose to see that the claimant gets a fair deal, gets his facts brought out properly and that no advantage taken of him. 
    And I just wondered if that same principle was in this situation.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="1041.039" stopTime="1048.687">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Well, I do not think that there's been any contention that these proceedings have, in a general way, been unfair to claimants.

    But if you have -- but if you have an ignorant man, we'll say or don't use that harsh word, let's just say an unschooled man who comes to a hearing of this kind and he faced with the agency and he needs to prove his claim, he's not capable of doing it. 
    And, I just wondered if it was a duty of the hearing officer to help him an to see that the facts are developed and that it's all in the record there so that a fair appraisal can be made or whether he's there as a judge in an adversary proceeding and letting each party put in its own evidence. 
    I don't know. 
    I'm just -- I think it would be enlightening though to -- for the Court to know that.

    If you don't know, why, there's no use in taking time on it now.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="1103.269" stopTime="1225.260">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Alright, sir. 
    In view of this legislative history which was least intended to cut back the fees then being approved and paid through Court actions, the Congress adopted Section 206 (b)(1) of the statute, using the word “claimant.” 
    And, as I suggested yesterday, the very narrow question of interpretation in this case and the only question presented in this case comes down to what does the word “claimant” mean in this statute and we suggest, in terms of statutory interpretation, there are several clauses in the statute that modify the word “claimant” and conclusively define it in a way that can mean only the plaintiff who happens to be before the Court in that case, that is the head of the family in this case, Mr. Hopkins, and that it does not include anybody else. 
    We begin this analysis of the language of the statute with the first phrase. 
    The statute begins, “whenever a Court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant under this subchapter,” we suggest to the Court that the language, “a judgment favorable to a claimant” is something that ordinarily would refer to a plaintiff before a Court. 
    He's the person on whose behalf and whose favor a judgment is rendered. 
    Then, the statute goes on to speak of “claimant under this subchapter who was represented before the Court by an attorney,” and we suggest that there are two points in that phraseology. 
    First, the language “before the Court.” 
    It suggests the claimant is the person who is before the Court, the person who is a party.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes, but his claim if what -- if he won his case like a plaintiff in a lawsuit, if he won his case they would follow, from the judgment in his favor, certain consequences. 
    And, those consequences would be payments not only to him but to his wife and children. 
    Am I right about that?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="1461.128" stopTime="1609.173">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    In this case they would be, Justice Fortas. 
    And, a ques -- but I think the word “claim,” to begin with, is a case that has a generally accepted meaning in the law. 
    The claim the formal -- listed on the formal request for hearing here, the claim given in the caption of the transcript was only the case of Raymond Hopkins and the question whether he himself was disabled. 
    Now there are two -- I think it's important to recognize here that there are two ways procedurally in which the dependant's claims can be disposed of. 
    In this case, it happened that the dependant status was approved before Mr. Hopkins' own claims were terminated, so that they were all approved. 
    They were all receiving claims. 
    They were all receiving benefits on their original claim. 
    All benefits were then terminated because the -- in the Secretary's view, Mr. Hopkins' disability had terminated. 
    When the Court directed the Secretary to resume Mr. Hopkins' benefits by finding that he was disabled, the result was the Secretary knew that Mrs. Hopkins was indeed the wife of Mr. Hopkins, that there were these children, that they all satisfy the necessary requirements of age to quo -- the statute establishes and, therefore, Mr. Sharp could say that, in this case, it followed automatically that the benefits were resumed. 
    But, another case that could equally arise would be saying the circumstances where the Secretary found at the very beginning that there was no disability. 
    Therefore, the Secretary would not ordinarily have reached the claim of the dependants. 
    He wouldn't have determined whether there was a marital relationship. 
    He wouldn't have determined whether the claimants satisfy the requirements of age. 
    In that situation, the judgment in favor of Mr. Hopkins would've only established one of three essential facts and two would not yet been established. 
    They couldn't be litigated in the Court as a claim in the Court until Mrs. Hopkins and the children had gone through the administrative procedures. 
    Presumably, they would benefit and the Secretary would have reached the same determination and allow the claims administratively with no need for asserting a dispute.

    For a disabling injury to the -- I do not -- I don't know whether it was work connected. 
    It does not have to be, but it hinges on this -- the fact of disability. 
    I think there is also an additional matter in the statute that helps us define a claim because the statute speaks of the limit on a fee for such representation, and such representation refers back to the representation before the Court of the claimant. 
    And, the statute goes on to s -- in setting the maximum amount of the fee, says that it shall not be in excess of 25% of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment. 
    Now, here again, we suggest that the word “entitled” is a word with a distinct legal meaning. 
    It should mean claim of right and the claimant, in this case Mr. Hopkins, is the only person who has a fixed claim of right by reason of the Court's judgment.

    Wherever the Secretary disputed the relationship or the age. 
    The -- first, this type of litigation in itself represents perhaps 3% of all Social Security claims, but there are a variety of cases where, say, the relationship of parent and child might dis-- be disputed. 
    One example of that the Court might be interested in is a case called Chernack in 360 F.2d, I don't recall the page citation, where the question was whether there had -- this was a widow's claim for benefits that was allowed. 
    And then, there was a child. 
    It was the father's child but not the mother's child, and the issue was whether the child had been adopted before death of the father and, therefore, entitled to benefits under the statute. 
    But, there could be this kind of controversy. 
    There are controversies as to whether there's a marriage. 
    If they don't all come together in one case at the same time, they will not all come before the Court at the same time.

    They were not, Justice Black. 
    In this case, the Secretary had no disagreement with the proposition that Mrs. Hopkins was a lawful wife, these children were at the proper age to collect benefits.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2066.616" stopTime="2233.844">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, Mr. Weinstein, before Mr. Hopkins won his lawsuit, he and his wife and dependants children were receiving about something under 9 -- $8,000. 
    Then -- and I mean to say before the payments were stopped, then the payments -- let me withdraw that and rephrase it. 
    Mr. Hopkins' wife and children were receiving benefits under the Act. 
    Then, the payment of those benefits was stopped because of the conclusion of the agency that his disability had seized. 
    Then -- so, Mr. Hopkins' wife and children were receiving zero. 
    Then, the proceeding was brought and, in the Court, Mr. Hopkins' lawyer managed to win the case. 
    Then, Mr. Hopkins was entitled as -- and his wife and children were entitled to receive approximately $8,000 past-due payments, and there was one letter written to Mr. Hopkins, which appears as appendix 5 in the record before us, one letter in which it was said that “we're sending you a combined payment -- a check for combined payment for you and your wife, $5,000, and the children's check will be sent to you shortly.” 
    Is it -- so that, simple, perhaps over simplified, lawyer's way of looking at this thing, but Mr. Hopkin -- the benefit that Mr. Hopkins received as a result of his claim was approximately $8,000 and the ceiling fixed by the Act would be 25% of that total recovery. 
    And, that's the simplicity of it and I admire the -- it seems to me, and I admire your -- the way you've gone about this to arrive in another construction of it. 
    But, a claimant makes a claim and what happened here, as a result of winning the litigation, was that not only Mr. Hopkins but his wife and children received moneys. 
    And then, the statute says that the lawyers -- that the Court may allow the lawyer a ma -- a fee up to 25% of the recovery.

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2265.295" stopTime="2320.896">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    As a matter of fact, I don't understand that because the lawyer has a contingent arrangement with the client. 
    It doesn't say -- you don't complicate it very much. 
    You find out what the judgment of the Court was, what the client received, what was the recovery in the litigation, and then you take a percentage of that. 
    Now, there may be other consequences that have to be established in other litigation, and I should think it would be normal to read the language of Congress in the ordinary sense that lawyers are accustomed to. 
    And, when Congress said the 25 -- Congress talked about the 25% limit, it was thinking in terms of the total recovery in that litigation.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2320.896" stopTime="2365.899">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I think that our disagreement is in terms of whether or what is the significance of the phraseology that Congress has used, and Congress has spoken of the person before the Court who becomes entitled to something by reason of the judgment. 
    And, in terms of the significance of the contingent fee arrangement, our understanding of the legislative history is that Congress was quite dissatisfied with the Court-approved contingent fee arrangements and that Congress was trying to put on the Courts the responsibility of approving fees within a fixed limit that did not eat into the award to the claimants.

speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2458.379" stopTime="2590.060">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I think one difference is that, in this case, the claims are not always or usually litigated together because a controversy may only go to one part of the claim or any controversy, say, the children might have might be resolved at the administrative rather than in the Courts -- at the Court level. 
    And, I think that one consequence of the -- what I would call the broader reading of the statute for which the petitioners argue is that where there is a separate controversy between the wife and the Secretary where she proceeds differently in the administrative process, where as -- if 25% of her funds have been paid to the lawyer who represented her husband, where -- from where is the Secretary going to satisfy the fee that the statute tells him to allow to whoever represents the wife. 
    Now, I think what the statute does is give the wife and the children and the husband their options. 
    Each can or cannot hire a lawyer to present their particular facts. 
    The husband can hire a lawyer to present his facts on issue of disability. 
    Then, the wife and the children can determine whether it's worthwhile to pay additional money to have a lawyer present the question of whether they are wife and children and whether they are of the appropriate ages. 
    And if -- if they choose to present that controversy through a lawyer, then there ought to be, and Congress in the recent legislation contemplated that there would be, funds left to pay that lawyer to encourage him to come in. 
    The -- if, on the other hand, they ch -- decide that these facts are so clear and simple, as they apparently were in this case, it would seem to us that Congress has taken the view of not requiring them to pay a lawyer because these facts aren't subject to controversy.

    Mr. Harris Weinstein

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2618.950" stopTime="2622.201">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    It's not an open-ended issue as well.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2622.201" stopTime="2662.578">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I -- I think it's true, Justice Harlan, that their case to a very great extent depends on the proposition that the reading that we intend for results in fees that are too low. 
    Now, of course, one consequence of their reading, I imagine, would be that single claimants would never be represented because it would follow from their reading that the fee for representing a bachelor or a widow or a widower would be less than half of the fee for representing somebody who was married with two children even though the controversy might be of the same nature. 
    But, beyond that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2662.578" stopTime="2664.940">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Did he say that they would never be represented?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2664.940" stopTime="2670.015">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Well, the contention -- let's say that the representation would be inhibited, Justice Stewart. 
    Their argument is that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2670.015" stopTime="2678.378">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If that same argument on for any contingent fee, I suppose no bachelors could ever get a lawyer to represent him if he was rundown by an automobile, on your theory.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2678.378" stopTime="2758.674">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I think their theory, as I understand it, is that the fees under the reading of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have such a low limit that it is not economic for attorneys to take these cases, that they need the higher limit for the cases to be economic. 
    If that's correct, the lower limit that they say is inadequate will always apply unless they are dependants. 
    I'm assuming, by their argument, that this would inhibit at least the representation of single people and we would suggest that that is not a result that Congress likely wanted to bring about. 
    But, beyond that, I think that if you look at the amount of fees that had been allowed here, if you compare it to the amount of work that is ordinarily involved and fees allowed in other situations, that it -- that you'd -- it appears that this argument is not one that is clearly right. 
    It's not one that is clearly wrong and it's one that belongs in Congress if it hasn't already been lost there. 
    These fees here are only for representation in Court. 
    To the extent that there has been representation before the Secretary, the lawyer can't go to the Secretary and apply for a separate fee.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2758.674" stopTime="2769.664">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Incidentally, it might be irrelevant at the administrative level, a man who were represented by a non-lawyer, is that non-lawyer entitled to fees.

    Yes, that's right, Justice Fortas.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So, there's no possibility of two fees because if he wins once, that's it. 
    Is that right?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="2789.922" stopTime="2882.761">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    There had been some cases, for example, where there'd been a Court proceeding followed by a remand. 
    I believe the Courts have contemplated a fee from the Secretary for his -- for the work there in front of the Courts because -- but as -- we have collected some statistics which we set out in a footnote in our brief and the median fee for these representations, under our reading of the statute, has been running $800.00 or $900.00 for a proceeding that is limited essentially to a motion for summary judgment on preexisting record. 
    The Fourth Circuit, which has taken what it considers a broader reading and what it says it is rejecting a literal reading of the statute, has so far refused to allow a fee as high as the petitioners argue for. 
    In fact, most recently, the case of Redden, I believe it is, where the Fourth Circuit originally rendered the decision that resulted in the conflict with this case was back into the Fourth Circuit on the allowance of the fee and the District Court had allowed a fee of 25% of the $16,000-benefits payable to the whole family. 
    And, the Fourth Circuit said this is just too high and they cut it back to something around 2,200 and the 25% of the -- only the father's benefits.

    If you perhaps covered this. 
    Is -- is the statute absolutely clear that if lawyers representing the husband and the husband isn't the claimant and all that he can collect from the claimant, according to you position, is up to 25% of the claimant's recovery, do you think the statute precludes him from collecting privately anything from the wife?

speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="3032.906" stopTime="3063.237">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    This is in Section 206 (a) of the statute which is Section 406 (a) in the US Code and, it allows the -- together with the amendments that went into force this January, it allows the Secretary to adopt rules and regulations governing fees. 
    It directs him to allow a fee to any representative which presumably a lawyer could be if he prosecuted the wife's claim before the Secretary.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3063.237" stopTime="3092.096">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but if there's a -- if the lawyer takes the husband's suit to Court and has an arrangement with him, he can collect from him and have it withheld from the benefits up to 25%, and you say either the statute or the regulations make it quite clear that the wife would be forbidden to pay him anything or that he would be forbidden from taking anything from the wife.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="3092.096" stopTime="3102.852">

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I think there's been some suggestion that the Secretary is parsimonious in these matters, although this is again a matter for, I would think, for the Congress. 
    The -- our review of the fees, which is not in the brief, indicates that the Secretary, in the last several years, each year allows several hundred fees. 
    I think, in the calendar of 1966 there were over 800. 
    A majority of them are under $500.00. 
    On the other hand, a good number of them range from 500 and some much as high --

    Well, anyway, the limits to the --

speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="3160.171" stopTime="3160.790">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    I think that would be --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3160.790" stopTime="3164.518">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is not to be found in this section that sets the 25%.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="3164.518" stopTime="3171.277">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    No, it would be in Section 206 (b)(2), the immediately following subsection which I don't believe that anybody has printed.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, you say that there is a safety valve out of this 25% limit, in the sense, if he could convince the Secretary that he -- that the wife should be permitted to pay him something for recovering something for her too even if she wasn't the claimant in the Court, the Secretary could do it.

    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Not as we read the new statute. 
    It -- the 25% limit is on the withholding.

    Yes.
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="3200.964" stopTime="3223.241">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    But, the statute says that the withholding from the accrued benefits shall be the lesser of the fee approved by the Secretary or 25% or the contingent fee, and I assume that means that the approved fee could be higher than 25%. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Harold H. Gearinger

    Mr. Gearinger.
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="3225.574" stopTime="3447.895">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Without attempting to qualify myself as a more expert, given this field, than Mr. Weinstein, I do have some environmental and circumstantial advantages, in that, I was in the pit in these cases and all the way through from the administrative level. 
    We have a saying, if the Court please, in my area and Mr. Justice Fortas's area, very sagle judge who once said to me, “tell it like it is.” 
    And, if I may, Justice Brennan, and with the pleasure of the Court, let me very briefly outline the exact procedural steps that are involved in the background of this particular narrow question here today. 
    The disability we are concerned with here is not necessarily to have resulted from any industrial accident. 
    It can be from sickness. 
    The substantive decisions under who is disabled or voluminous in the reports. 
    That particular substantive question concerns, I would say, 95% of the cases that reached the District Court and certainly 100% of the cases that reach the Appellate Courts. 
    To begin with, a man who considers himself, let's take Mr. X and Mrs. X and three minor children under the age of seniority, under the age of 17, and he has, as in this case, a very limited formal education and has done a menial task all his life. 
    And, let us assume that he has some demonstratable disablement and he goes to the local district office of the Social Security Administration where he is confronted by a clerk who inquires as of his name, his address, his age, his genealogy, his wife's name, and his children's names. 
    At that particular point -- and this is by statute, at that particular point, there is an application made by Mr. X, an application made by Mrs. X, and an application made by Mr. X for his minor children, so that there are then before the administrative agency three claims. 
    The next step in this hierarchy is for the Social Security Administration at the field level to investigate these circumstances with field operators. 
    Let us assume that Mr. X receives adverse consideration all along this administrative line until he reaches this Court, and I think Mr. -- if the Court please, this is important to understand the specific question that is --

    He gets a denial. 
    In other words, based on Mr. Justice Brennan on his not being disabled, there is no passing upon the question of the entitlement to the wife and children.

    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    Numerically, I believe it's to 21. 
    However, in these families, if the Court please, we usually find by practical experience in the class of people who apply for these benefits the daughter marries and becomes emancipated, the young man goes in the Army, the Navy, the Marine Core.

    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    Or become self-maintaining. 
    Let us, if the Court please, go on to the very next step so we can see how this hearing examiner acts which is the pivotal point here. 
    Let us say that Mr. X is denied administratively. 
    He then is told by the agency that he may ask for reconsideration. 
    That's the next step. 
    He asks for reconsideration and the early denial is affirmed. 
    He then is told in formal fashion that he may request a hearing before the hearing examiner. 
    The hearing examiner then sets it down for a hearing and, at this point, without going a step further, the Court has inquired very pertinently what is the duty of the hearing examiner and I would respectfully submit to the Court that a judicial evaluation of that hearing examiner's position is very apt here. 
    For example, Judge Hemphill in Columbia, South Carolina, in Robinson versus Celebrezze which is cited in our brief says this, “the statute provides a ridiculous maximum fee for compensation of counsel at the hearing level where the determination may well shape the course of the remaining years of a tired life well spent dedicatedly given at the looms of industry. 
    If the hearing examiner within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, appointed through the Civil Service Rules, if the hearing examiner acts as judge, jury, prosecutor of the claimant, an advocate for the Secretary, the unrepresented claimant is beat before he starts.

    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    In a most subtle fashion and may I relate, if I may, if the Court please, my own experiences at that level. 
    There have come to my office many cases after the unrepresented claimant and his family had appeared before the hearing examiner. 
    They have now received a notice that the appeals counsel sitting in Washington has affirmed the hearing examiner's denial of disability and, therefore, the denial of benefits to the entire family. 
    And, he comes in and said “I received this notice and I think it says something about a Court.” 
    The statute then provides that, upon the final denial by the Secretary through the voice of the appeals counsel sitting here in Washington, within 60 days in a jurisdictional question arises, a suit may be filed or must be filed within 60 days in a Federal District Court. 
    This is the point, I respectfully submit, that most of us at the Bar get into this question.

speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4056.049" stopTime="4137.365">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    I do know, if the Court please, from my own experience that this happens, and I see this in record after record. 
    For example, from the substantive question of disability, I would venture that in every one of the records I have read, there is questioning by the hearing examiner of the head of family claimant. 
    And, one of the questions always asked is, “How did you come here this morning?” 
    And if he drove there, he's not disabled. 
    This gets into each record. 
    I hesitate to say these things because some of my best friends and acquaintances are these hearing examiners. 
    I admire their ability but, nevertheless, we are confronted with this record which then cannot be heard de novo by a District Court but can only be reviewed to determine if there is any evidence in that record to support the Secretary's denial of benefits. 
    That's the test. 
    And, by that time, the barn door hinges have rusted and the mule has been stolen and the record is closed, and there's very little that can be done by an attorney because the Court cannot entertain any new evidence at that level at all.

    The question here is only one of after Mr. Hopkins was represented by Mr. Sharp in the judicial proceedings and was successful in his representation of that family. 
    The position of the respondent here is, very simply stated, 25% which is the maximum not to exceed that and not necessarily that, but not to exceed 25% applied to the base of only that which was paid directly to and for Mr. Hopkins, not including the benefits derivatively arrived in these proceedings to Mrs. Hopkins and the dependant children. 
    It is the position of the petitioner here and in the Sims case, which is pending before this Honorable Court on a petition for writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit which is my case, the position of the petitioner in both instances is that the clear intent of the Congress in this particular statutory provision was to limit a district judge exercising the discretion which is his, having seen the people, heard the case, and in a better position to evaluate the services rendered, to set a fee not to exceed 25% of the benefits resulting from the judgment.

    What additional work would a lawyer have to do in the case of the man who had a wife and three children to do in order to get that decree over what the man with -- in the case of the man who was a bachelor?
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4567.541" stopTime="4590.979">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The amount of legal professional work, undoubtedly, would not be too dissimilar. 
    They would be almost alike, except if at the hearing examiner's level if he were in -- if he were representing them there, he would of course call upon the wife, the children, the neighbors, or anyone else to appear in that hearing and, herein, testify.

    They testify as --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, you'd have to have other witnesses for the bachelor just the same whether they were wife and children or not, or it might be a mother and a father, brothers and sisters.

    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    In most cases, Mr. Chief Justice, the hearing is conducted on exhibits of medical reports --

    I know.

    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    Not on the substantive question of the disability of the head of family.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4634.953" stopTime="4641.339">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Alright. 
    Now, what in addition to that would they have to prove for the man who had a wife and three children?

    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    The relationship of those dependants to that claimant and their entitlement as his dependants.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4648.525" stopTime="4658.276">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then they would have to ask two questions, one for the wife, “are you the wife?” 
    And she would say, yes, and you'd have to ask somebody if the children --

    Children --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Alright. 
    Now -- but still you are of the opinion that Congress couldn't limit or shouldn't limit the attorney's fees to a percentage of the original claimant himself but, on the other hand, you claim that Congress intended that a lawyer should take up to 25% of everything that comes in to the wife and to these children from the time their legs and arms were happed up until they're 21 years of age.
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4697.531" stopTime="4698.950">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    No, Your Honor.

    What do you ask them?
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4699.828" stopTime="4718.627">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    We say this, Your Honor, that because the substantive question of disability is only the head of family claimant and that the benefits flowing to the wife and any dependants he may have, of course, is insulary to a determination of that first substantive question.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4718.627" stopTime="4719.677">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4719.677" stopTime="4726.375">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    So that, they would have no benefits had he not been found disabled.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4727.174" stopTime="4734.961">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Please start off here, don't you, at the statutory provision that limits the base to the amount of past benefits?
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4734.961" stopTime="4736.242">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4736.242" stopTime="4752.034">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Actually, what happens here if a lawyer is successful is that Mr. Hopkins is enti-- and his wife and children are entitled not only to pass the sums but to payments in the future.
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4752.034" stopTime="4753.308">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    That is entirely correct, Mr. Justice Fortas.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4753.308" stopTime="4770.890">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But the statute provides that the lawyer is confined to the amount that is received before Mr. Hopkins or Mr. Hopkins et al. has by reason of past accruals.
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4770.890" stopTime="4772.466">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    That's entirely correct, Mr. Justice Fortas.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4772.466" stopTime="4783.372">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Not only that, then you have a 25% ceiling on that base and then you have the discretion of the Court to cut below that 25%.
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4783.372" stopTime="4783.866">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4783.866" stopTime="4784.691">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is that the way it works?
speaker="harold_h_gearinger" startTime="4784.691" stopTime="4793.921">
    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And, in a practical sense, the Court does not in any case or in all cases automatically grant 25%, and he should not. 
    He should not --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4793.921" stopTime="4861.282">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Whether this 25% or not, and whether it is prospective or whether it is retrospective in the percentages that he's entitled to get, why should a man in the case with the wife and three children have to be entitled to get 25% of all of the payments that had been made to the wife and children if all he has to do is ask him if they are the wife or are the children? 
    Now, don't you think that Congress has a right to say that it shall be limited to that -- to just the claimant himself rather than the other, and don't you think in a case of this kind Congress intended to have a strict application so that these people would not be -- this kind of claimant should not be overborne by lawyer's contracts?

    You can answer the question.

    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    I think that we have concerned ourselves and I apologize for concerning myself so much with the function of this organization and not to the interpretation of the statute.

    Mr. Harold H. Gearinger 
    On my happy conscience, Your Honor, if the Court would like to have them lodged with the clerk. 
    The -- the simple and final position in this case of the Government on one hand, and the petitioner's on the other is that we say that it was the intention of the Congress not to divide and separate bachelors and fathers and mothers since the benefit went to the family unit, and there is no provision in the statute under consideration making such separation. 
    And, in that connection, the petitioner here in this case relies and urges very respectfully of this Court the position and interpretation taken by Chief Judge Hainsworth in the Fourth Circuit as being the proper interpretation of the statute. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
