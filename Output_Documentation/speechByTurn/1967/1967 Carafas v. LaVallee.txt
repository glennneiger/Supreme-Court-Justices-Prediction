Carafas v. LaVallee

    No.71, James P.Carafas, Petitioner, versus J.Edwin LaVallee, Warden.

    Mr. James J. Cally 
    Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Honorable Justices of this Court. 
    In this case here we have several violations, we believe, of the Constitution of the United States as they apply to this individual, Carafas. 
    The facts are simply as follows, on June the 3rd, of 1959, a theft complaint was given to the detectives of Nassau County which is in Mineola, New York. 
    Someone had -- someone has stolen furniture from a development. 
    It developed that a Cadillac and a trailer was seen in the vicinity of this area sometime earlier that day. 
    And as a consequence of the situation, the detectives learned who the owner that automobile, a Cadillac automobile was and it was James Carafas. 
    Thereafter, the detectives learned where he resided -- 35-53 36th Avenue, in New York -- in Queens, New York and they went to the premises. 
    This is a premises which contains two-stories. 
    The first storey was occupied by a physician and the second story was occupied by Mr. Carafas and his family. 
    Upon arriving there, Detective Grame and Capler (ph) turned the knob of the door and entered the premises in the vestibule. 
    Thereafter, they said they went into the doctor's office and they inquired where Carafas lived and someone said, "upstairs", and Detective Grame and Capler (ph) then mounted the stairway. 
    As they mounted the stairway, they said they noticed some furniture which was on the landing which was of the type described to them by the owner of the Development. 
    And upon reaching the top of the stairway, they said they put one James Carafas under arrest. 
    The version of the defendant or the petitioner in this instance is quite different. 
    His version is that he was lying on a divan in his living room, and that these two detectives walked into his living room, awakened him and then start to run -- rushed at into his premises. 
    So much so that quite a commotion was caused and other police had to be called from the City of New York. 
    Both husband and wife were put under arrest. 
    Now the issues involved in this particular case are as follows: whether or not the evidence that was procured at this time should have been suppressed under the Mapp rule, which this Court decided on June the 19th, 1961. 
    And whether or not the violations of the Constitution also occurred as to the individual rights as to whether or not he had to be questioned without an attorney or whether he had to be given his constitutional guarantees. 
    Now, we contend --

    Mr. James J. Cally 
    Alright, sir. 
    Now, it is also suggested that in a companion case of which you all note that there are the minutes in the appendix, in a particular page 239 of the appendix, you will note the testimony of Detective Grame (ph). 
    You'll also note his testimony in the trial minutes which are covered in the appendix 149 through 155 and you'll also note his testimony in the appendix concerning the hearing that was held before District Judge James T. Foley of the Northern District of the State of New York. 
    You'll find that the version is quite different on each occasion. 
    There are variant differences. 
    We say that there was a violation and this is born out by this fact that on the hearing to suppress on a companion case, and if the -- another matter which covered the Bath Oceanside Development, the Court there determined that that evidence should have been suppressed, but this came after the Mapp rule had been invoked.

    Mr. James J. Cally 
    Well, Mr. Justice White, let me say this to you as a basis for this statement. 
    I don't believe that they passed upon any of these questions to be quite frank with you because what we did was refiled a notice of appeal. 
    After the notice of appeal was filed, then this man proceeded to -- proceeded in forma pauperis and of course and the Attorney General of the State of New York filed their affidavits and opposition and then asked in a cross motion to dismiss the appeal and subsequently, a reargument was made on the behalf of the -- of Carafas and of course that was denied also.

    Mr. Justice Harlan, I understand that. 
    And I've read the dissenting opinion in that particular case, handed down by Mr. Justice Warren quite thoroughly. 
    I think as far as the mootness is concerned, it really slams the door upon an indigent individual who -- for no fault of his own but through -- of course a quagmire of legal morass in -- on his way up to the Supreme Court has been estopped from urging this particular matter. 
    Now, it is true that he was dismissed on March the 6th, 1967, but by that time, we had already filed for writ of certiorari which was granted in October 19 --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="614.952" stopTime="627.528">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    This isn't necessarily a question of mootness. 
    The question also, is it not, whether the District Court or the statute as the power issue with, respect for the man not intentionally.
speaker="james_j_cally" startTime="627.528" stopTime="700.828">
    Mr. James J. Cally 
    It is true. 
    But this Court also came to this conclusion in another case, if Your Honor pleases. 
    In the case of Potter against the United States, which is also under the same Title, Title 28, but it's under Section 2255. 
    Under that particular Section, the Court came to the conclusion that if there was an error in the judgment, even though this man had been dismissed and was no longer in custody, that could be corrected and they proceeded to correct it, to correct the error in the record. 
    Now, I think this is analogous to the situation in this particular case even though Ellis against Parker says, “Well, once you've been dismissed, once you've been discharged from custody of the law, then you no longer have a right to be heard on the problems that had transpired. 
    I think you it would be sure irony if we -- if the defendant didn't have or the petitioner didn't have a right to be heard on the transgression of these constitutional rights because economically and politically he's through.

    He is working as a hotel assistant manager, sir. 
    And of course, this stops him from getting a good job with a large hotel which is now been built in Brooklyn, Manhattan Hotel as a resident manager. 
    And of course, if this was made known for those authorities, this man certainly will not be able to hold that job.

    Mr. Cally, I wish you'd tell me how you get around Nowakowski.

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="810.517" stopTime="855.637">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, in Nowakowski, we held that -- when the District Judge grants a certificate of probable cause, the Court of Appeals must grant an appeal in forma pauperis, assuming there is showing of poverty and must proceed to a disposition of the appeal in accordance with its ordinary procedure. 
    Now the Court of Appeals here, as I understand it, denied despite the fact that the District Judge had issued a certificate of probable cause. 
    The Court of Appeals here denied the application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis.
speaker="james_j_cally" startTime="855.637" stopTime="899.338">
    Mr. James J. Cally 
    But they went a step further, Judge. 
    What they did here was this, Judge, an appeal was filed before this motion was made so that the only question that they had before them was the question as to whether or not they would allow this man to appeal in forma pauperis. 
    They did not have the appeal before them at that time but they wanted little further, Judge.What they did then is state -- has made a sweep in rule and then said, “We'll deny your appeal too”. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Brenda Soloff

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Miss Soloff?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="906.667" stopTime="994.852">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The threshold question here as has been recognized is that this case falls squarely within the decision of this Court in Parker against Ellis. 
    Like the petitioner here -- there, the petitioner here has completed his sentence and he has been released from custody. 
    Since, to secure habeas corpus relief, the petitioner must be in custody. 
    He must be challenged in the constitutional validity of that custody and the only relief authorized is a form of discharged from custody. 
    This case is moot within the meaning of the habeas corpus statute and the decisions of this Court. 
    The habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. 
    Sections 2241 through 2254 speaks consistently and exclusively of the availability of habeas corpus to someone who is in custody. 
    Each Sections speaks of custody, custody must be alleged, the custodian must make the return, it's just -- pardon me. 
    Even the rules of this Court, especially Rule 49, recognized that continued retention is essential to continue jurisdiction in a habeas corpus proceeding.

    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    -- the petition was filed on March 20, which was some two weeks later. 
    After the decisions of this Court in Parker and Ellis, Jones against Cunningham and Fay against Noia, Congress amended the habeas corpus statute, at least three sections of it, and it continued the custody requirement. 
    And in fact, it added a new subdivision (a) to Section 2254 which provides, “That the Supreme Court or Justice thereof, a Circuit Judge or a District Court shall entertain an application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the United States”. 
    So I think that Congress has in effect -- there was never any question about it, adopted the Parker against Ellis.

    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    -- to apply to this Court and that therefore it is not -- it's not an unjust result that they don't have further collateral attack by way of habeas corpus where they have had the benefits of full appellate review.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, even though there are constitutional violations in his conviction, you mean this -- he had no right to come to this Court?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="1400.314" stopTime="1438.414">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Not by way of habeas corpus. 
    Habeas corpus traditionally is a method of attacking what we call unconscionable custody. 
    Once custody runs, so does habeas corpus jurisdiction. 
    Congress hasn't provided that I know of any plenary appellate review of state court judgments of conviction by way of collateral attack. 
    They've provided only this attack on custody and this is I think perfectly just in view of the fact that the administration of criminal justice is left to the states and that they have that -- petitioners have had the opportunity to go through the states and to come to this Court.

    Do you make any distinction between the situation where he's on bail and when he's in custody?

    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Not for purposes of this case, Your Honor. 
    I don't know whether the law is that in New York or not. 
    I don't think it is but I'm not sure. 
    My only point in bringing that up is to show that the time didn't run while he was going through the state courts. 
    Petitioner's claim on the merits has always been that he was the victim of an unlawful search and seizure. 
    I'd like briefly to say that our first response to this is that this is a pre-Mapp trial and we would urge at this point in this case that Mapp should not be held to apply to people who were in the direct appellate process but passed the trial stage at the date of the Mapp decision. 
    I think that this Court has not held to the contrary and I think that the decisions in Johnson against New Jersey and Stovall against Denno, indicate that Mapp should be brought into conformity with the Miranda rule and with the Wade and Gilbert rulings.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the -- but the specific decision, you're concerned with is the Linkletter decision, isn't it?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="1791.272" stopTime="1818.015">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Yes, but Linkletter is also not a bar to this, to this reading of the case because the facts in Linkletter were and I think that the decision limited itself to those facts quite specifically that the entire process, the entire appellate process had in fact been concluded before Mapp was decided so that the retroactivity of Mapp had only to reach back to that point.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1818.015" stopTime="1822.745">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, Linkletter was pretty clear in what it said, didn't he -- isn't it?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="1822.745" stopTime="1901.777">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    I believe that there's -- I don't have Linkletter in front of me, but I believe there's a statement in Linkletter to the effect that we're dealing with the facts of this case and I believe it's in the context of chronology. 
    I am sorry. 
    I don't have the opinion here. 
    In any event, we believe that there is no bar by any decision of this Court to this result and at the same reasons which led this Court to hold Mapp not retroactive. 
    It should lead it to hold Mapp not retroactive to this point. 
    We can't seek to avoid the merits of this case for any particular reason because the case is clearly frivolous on the merits. 
    The facts are in the brief. 
    Judge Foley made quite complete findings after reviewing a -- some 1181 page trial record and holding his own hearing, and I won't go into them here. 
    The reason that I bring up the fact that the appeal is clearly frivolous is the Nowakowski reason, that is, petitioner says in his brief that the appeal was dismissed by the Second Circuit. 
    He's (Inaudible) here today because it was frivolous and we have absolutely no quarrel with that position.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2025.358" stopTime="2102.731">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Miss Soloff what Nowakowski held, as I remember it, I understand it is that once a certificate of probable cause has been granted by the District Court, then it is incumbent upon the Court of Appeals to treat that appeal as an ordinary appeal as of right, to treat it in accordance with its usual procedures, the way it treats appeals as of right to the Court of Appeals and I suppose then the question becomes whether this is a -- consistent with the regular procedures of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss an appeal as of right in the manner that this was -- this case was dismissed without argument but simply on the records. 
    I know, in my experience in the Court of Appeals that the one where I sat, sometimes did do that if it was -- upon motion to dismiss, the Court sometimes did so with appeals as of right if it could be shown that there was a failure to prosecute or some other grounds. 
    But some Court of Appeals don't do that and I suppose the inquiry therefore should be whether this is in accordance with the ordinary and regular procedures of the Court of Appeals with respect to appeals as of right.

speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="2106.188" stopTime="2150.159">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Let me say this. 
    Certainly, I think that they have a right to truncate appeals in accordance with what they consider to be the priorities in the merits of appeals. 
    We handle in our office very few appeals as of right to the Second Circuit. 
    We handle in the New York Attorney Generals' Office, usually habeas corpus and cases involving constitutional questions in which there would really -- usually be no basis for dismissing for want of merit. 
    So I can't say that the Second Circuit -- but I know for sure the procedure of the Second Circuit although I have seen them dismiss appeals.

    And the only further relief which would be forthcoming after the original record was before the Court and the notice of appeal had been filed, would be to file further briefs and hear oral argument and we suggest that it is within the power of the court not to do this. 
    And if that's -- this was a dismissal on the merits and for a very good reason.
