    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court. 
    In this case probable jurisdiction has already been noted. 
    It's a -- an appeal by a former policeman who was dismissed by the appellees. 
    This policeman was served with departmental charges involving conspiracy to violate gambling laws -- the next -- and suspended. 
    The next day, he was subpoenaed before the grand jury of New York County and asked to sign a waiver of immunity from prosecution. 
    It was announced at that hearing that it was a criminal investigation into conspiracy to violate gambling laws. 
    The appellant refused to sign such a waiver on advice of counsel stating that since he was a target of the investigation, the grand jury had no authority to subpoena and question him. 
    He was not questioned. 
    He was not granted immunity but rather excused and thereupon was served with an additional departmental charge, refusal to sign a waiver of immunity before the grand jury as required by Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution and Section 1123 of the New York City Charter. 
    And --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I'm a -- I want to be sure I understand the context here. 
    He -- what he did was refuse to sign a waiver of immunity which would imply to me that otherwise he would have had immunity had he testified?
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="129.473" stopTime="142.435">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    It is my position, Your Honor. 
    The appellant's position that since he was under subpoena. 
    Any testimony that he gave at that hearing would cause immunity to attach to the substantive area of the inquiry.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="142.435" stopTime="144.097">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As a matter of New York law?
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="144.097" stopTime="147.287">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    As a matter of New York and I believe federal law as well.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, but perhaps required by the Constitution, if --
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="150.063" stopTime="150.805">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="150.805" stopTime="161.950">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You can make a person testify if you give him -- brought enough immunity. 
    And do I understand that New York law does -- would have given him immunity --
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="161.950" stopTime="162.481">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Under these circumstances --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="162.481" stopTime="166.586">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- in the absence of his signing a waiver of immunity.
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="166.586" stopTime="302.859">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Yes. 
    There is a more formal procedure under 244 -- 2447 at the Code of Criminal Procedure which was not followed in this case. 
    But it is my position that he would have been granted immunity had he testified under the compelled compulsion of the subpoena. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now the appellant was served with an additional charge, refusal to sign a waiver of immunity by the police commissioner and directed to report for a hearing on that charge. 
    Upon appearing, the appellant requested that all three charges; the substantive charges as well as the procedural charge of refusal to sign a waiver be tried at once. 
    This request was denied and the hearing proceeded under objection on the one charge of refusal to sign a waiver of immunity. 
    And the grand jury minutes and the District Attorney testified at that hearing and resulted in the dismissal complained of in this action. 
    No disposition of the substantive charges of misconduct was made. 
    It is the appellant's contention that the requirement to sign a waiver of immunity before the grand jury imposed by state law is an unconstitutional limitation on the federal constitutional provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and therefore must fall under the federal supremacy of laws section. 
    I think it's very important to keep in mind that he was under substantive charges involving the same area of grand jury inquiry at the time he was asked to sign a waiver. 
    He was not someone against to whom charges were not then and there pending. 
    Appeals through the Courts to this Court subsequently followed. 
    The Court of Appeals of the State of New York said that the Garrity case undoubtedly partially invalidated these sections, these sections of law requiring the waiver. 
    May I inquire whether we break for lunch now, Your Honor?

    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Thank you. 
    A portion of the subpoena would be inadmissible but absolute immunity I don't think would apply unless the formal procedures under the New York Penal Law were followed. 
    And there was a definite intention on the part of the grand jury to confer that immunity. 
    There was no legal residuum here respecting the substantive acts of misconduct. 
    No finding whatever. 
    The only act of misconduct here was an invocation of a federally protected right against self-incrimination. 
    Under Malloy against Hogan, the protection of Fourteenth Amendment is coextensive with that of the Fifth and it applies to the states. 
    The Court of Appeals of the State in New York in this case has held that a refusal to sign a waiver of immunity is equivalent to and an act of invoking a privilege against self-incrimination. 
    And that being the highest court in the state, I think that their interpretation of the statute is binding for all purposes in this case.

    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Your Honor, the Court of Appeals of the State in New York by Mr.-- by Judge Fuld, Chief Judge Fuld, has said in its opinion in this particular case, “definitely that a refusal to sign a waiver of immunity under this circumstance is in fact an invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination in the opinion itself”. 
    And therefore, taking this interpretation as being binding by the highest court in the State --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="427.505" stopTime="432.336">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that's not a -- is it -- that's hardly a construction of the state law, is it?
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="432.336" stopTime="432.946">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    It says construction --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="432.946" stopTime="453.006">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That would be binding clearly of course, we would all agree would be binding on us if that were a construction or an interpretation of a state, of a New York state law, New York law. 
    But is it binding if it's a -- suppose a construction of the federal constitution? 
    It's not binding on us.
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="453.006" stopTime="453.194">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Your Honor --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="453.194" stopTime="454.183">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's what it is.
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="454.183" stopTime="629.124">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Your Honor, it was a construction of a New York State constitutional provision. 
    Article I, Section 6 required the appellant according to the Court of Appeals to waive his immunity -- waive his privilege against self-incrimination and testify. 
    That is directly from the opinion in this case. 
    Now the New York State constitutional proviso, accepting public officers from its own protection contained against self-incrimination under Article I, Section 6 at the same time seeks to add a proviso to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and a proviso to the Fourteenth Amendment when no such proviso exists in the federal constitution. 
    Therefore, it is the appellant's position that the statute is unconstitutional that the requirements are unconstitutional for continued public office. 
    Now, the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment have applied not only to criminal sanctions but also to administrative sanctions citing for example (Inaudible) case, Lovett, and a few other cases in my brief so that we have a situation where there is a penalty visited upon this appellant strictly by virtue of his invocation of a federally protected right. 
    The right -- the invocation of that right has proved costly and it is a federally protected right. 
    The action of the State in New York in requiring its public officers to waive a federally protective requirement is not, I believe, a constitutional one. 
    Now this -- Court of Appeals of the State of New York has said that Garrity undoubtedly partially invalidated Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution but they don't say what part of that is invalid nor is there any saving clause that I could find in the New York State Constitution saying that a part of a Section is declared unconstitutional. 
    The rest survives. 
    At any rate, the Court of Appeals has said that the question when Gardner was before the grand jury and all the way up to the time of the Court of Appeals decided its case and including today, they have said that this is an open question that this Court has left the question open. 
    Yet, they have countenance by their affirmation. 
    The full penalty against this appellant for a cause of action which is perfectly consistent with the very openness of the question so we feel --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="629.124" stopTime="650.013">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is there any question as to whether the issues before the grand jury matters upon which petitioner was going to be questioned? 
    Is there any doubt that those questions were related to the scope of his duty as a policeman?
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="650.013" stopTime="705.419">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    There is no doubt in that in respect. 
    However, it also inquired into an area under which he was charged by the department existing charges which to this day have never been disposed off. 
    So that it is -- the Court of Appeals of the State in New York has said that the appellant herein committed an act of misconduct. 
    Yet, they recognized that the very question is an open one. 
    Is the appellant held to a higher degree of knowledge of the law than the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals here or his actions or were his actions perfectly consistent with the very openness of the question, which we hoped to close today. 
    The --

    Did he had administrative hearing -- if he had there -- before his dismissal?
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="711.103" stopTime="718.141">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The sole question at that hearing was did he or did he not refuse to sign a waiver? 
    There was a motion at that hearing --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="722.898" stopTime="777.175">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    There was no automatic dismissal. 
    We have a (Inaudible) point in that that the mere invocation of the constitutional privilege is not an act of misconduct as far as we're -- as far as the appellant is concern. 
    We have a situation also where to apply this statute as the Court of Appeals of the State of New York has applied it. 
    We would have a shift of burden of proof of misconduct when the precepts of due process of law and the statutes involved in the State of New York placed that burden upon the prosecution. 
    The prosecuting authority of the State in New York by an extrinsic independent evidence must come up -- prove acts of misconduct, substantive acts of misconduct.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose this policeman were brought up on charges that -- suppose there's a grand jury investigation and it was known that the focus of that grand jury investigation was a charge that he had shot and killed a man while he, the policeman was on duty? 
    And he was called to testify. 
    Let's assume he refused to testify and he refused to sign a waiver of immunity on the -- both on the Fifth Amendment grounds. 
    Would the -- could be a constitutional principle in your opinion that would prevent the state from discharging him as a policeman?
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="825.732" stopTime="833.686">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    If it appears that there was a disciplinary reason for asking it rather than a supervisory one.

    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Yes. 
    If it appears that his answers will tend to incriminate him, either disciplinary action for example. 
    I feel that he would have a right to maintain silence. 
    If it is used to investigate for supervisory reasons, for example strengthening patrols in the certain area or even suspending him pending investigation of extrinsic evidence, then for that limited purpose, I would say that he could answer it.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="866.734" stopTime="892.497">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Oh! 
    The case I have put to you they say 1429. 
    It's not a good idea to have policeman on our force who go around shooting people instead of arresting them and so we want to look into this and this is purely supervising. 
    That's what they say and then can -- then is the state justified in dismissing him?

    Mr. Ronald Podolsky

speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="897.517" stopTime="920.794">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    -- in a disciplinary sense, then I would say that his refusal to answer, in addition to the extrinsic evidence of the fact of the killing and the gunshot and the ballistics test, it would be illegal residuum there to support a dismissal if the request were for a supervisory rather than a disciplinary reason.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    The bar is not an absolute one. 
    That is to say, it is not in every case where the policeman claims a Fifth Amendment protection that the state is disenabled by a reason of the federal constitution from dismissing the man from public service. 
    Have I stated that clearly enough?

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And what's your answer?
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="957.636" stopTime="1003.968">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    My answer is that if -- if the -- it goes back again, Your Honor to the purpose of the questioning. 
    If he is assured, if he's granted in effect immunity from prosecution, administrative or otherwise, then that's another ins -- another situation as not being used against him. 
    It's being used either to strengthen patrols or get him off a sensitive post or whatever it is. 
    But if it's going to be used against him in a disciplinary sense, then the state would just have to unfortunately content itself with gathering extrinsic evidence independently gathered to discharge this officer.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1003.968" stopTime="1026.170">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is it your position that if the department has evidence that this man has been associating with gamblers in an illegal way and perhaps accepting bribes and it calls the officer in and asked him about his conduct in relation to that that he can refuse to testify?
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="1026.170" stopTime="1031.372">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    Especially -- yes, especially, if he's under departmental charges, which he was in this case and if --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1031.372" stopTime="1036.926">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, suppose they want to -- suppose they want to do it to find out whether they're going to fire him or not?
speaker="ronald_podolsky" startTime="1036.926" stopTime="1102.566">
    Mr. Ronald Podolsky 
    I don't think his answers there can be used against him, Your Honor. 
    There can be -- they -- at that point, he is the focus of an investigation and once that comes, we have constitutional -- the questions arising, a constitutional objections to his response. 
    If he is being accused, he has a right to be confronted by his accusers and cross-examine him before he has a duty particularly to go ahead with the evidence to counter it. 
    So state must have a extrinsic evidence which would result in a legal residuum. 
    Under those instances if they have enough to dismiss him, his silence would advance no tenable reason in mitigation, extenuation or explanation for his continued service but his silence again cannot be used as a confession of guilt under any circumstances. 
    We have a situation where the state is attempting to add a state proviso to a federal constitutional provision. 
    Under Malloy against --

    Well, that is the position that the appellant takes in this case. 
    There are no -- now the reservations in Spevack against Klein, Footnote 3 and also Mr. Justice Fortas' reservation in that case, spoke about a silence at a disciplinary hearing. 
    The appellant's silence in this instance was not at the disciplinary hearing. 
    It was a grand jury hearing without disciplinary powers with powers to indict. 
    It was a criminal investigation so I think that the reservations there -- I don't agree with them but I don't think they apply in this case. 
    I think that the reservations are not appropriate either because there would be a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination which applies to states here. 
    Again, I'd like to emphasize there's no -- at this hearing that they give, the hearing. 
    The dismissal is mandatory.

   Argument of J. Lee Rankin

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    General Rankin.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="1290.854" stopTime="1589.698">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is a case that is of great importance to all municipal governments, state governments and federal governments, federal government in this country. 
    The problem is whether or not a person occupying official position, one of the most important of which is a policeman in any city. 
    Law enforcing officer can be asked in regard to the performance of his duties. 
    Mr. Justice Black -- Stewart brought out properly the issue in this case which did not involve the questioning in regard to the performance of those duties because the appellant refused to sign any waiver. 
    But he gave as his reason even more than that in that he said that, “Under the law, it was not legal for him to be subpoenaed before a grand jury where he was a target of the investigation”. 
    So that he made it plain that he would not answer any questions regardless because he said, "He could not legally be brought before the jury". 
    Now, he was in error in regard to the law in so asserting although he did it under the advice of counsel. 
    The law as set out by the Court of Appeals of New York in Tomasello, and Goldman, also in Stude make it plain that there is a right and legal power to subpoena him before the grand jury. 
    But there are certain instance under the Constitution of New York that result from that if he testifies. 
    And if he proceeds to testify, he gets protection regarding that testimony. 
    That is automatically giving him whether he claims the privilege or not in regard to any testimony that he gives. 
    And that protection concerning that testimony is less than the protection or the immunity he would get under Section 2447 of the Penal Code. 
    In that, it protects him concerning the use of that testimony and any of its fruits but not -- does not extend to the coverage of matter, thing or transaction involved in 2447. 
    Or is the same kind of protection that the Court described and provided in Murphy against Waterfront. 
    This case, we think is controlled by the decisions of this Court in Nelson, Beilan and Lerner against Casey. 
    Except that since those cases, this Court has moved on and included Murphy against Waterfront and Garrity so that a person called before the grand jury has protections that were not present in any of the three cases that I've named. 
    Beyond that, this inquiry by definition in the constitution and also in the charter provision is a limited inquiry. 
    It does not relate to security risk and loyalty and other elements that are involved in those cases but to -- is in precisely the question of the performance by the party involved of his official duties in that job. 
    Now, this case dramatically presents that problem.

    That's a class and as a reasonable classification and this constitutional provision and the charter provision were in response to the reaction of the people in the State of New York in connection with the See Berry investigations, to the idea that people who admittedly had done all kinds of criminal acts showed in those investigations could continue to occupy their public positions because there is nothing the people could do about it.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But general, suppose this man had been dismissed from service for a refusal to sign a waiver and period, nothing more. 
    Is that different in your submission from the result that they would've obtained if you knew this case has a dismissal for refusal to answer questions with respect to his official duties?

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    I think the case of dismissal just for a refusal to sign a waiver is the most difficult case because the heart, the essence of this right, the people of New York wish to assert is to find out how this man was conducting his work on behalf of the people. 
    Now, this --

speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="1824.657" stopTime="1844.202">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes, because there you are going getting to the question of the particular conduct. 
    On the other hand that if he will not -- if he just refuse to answer which is the effect, a refusal to sign a waiver, certainly, when he has -- gets the immunity, it does under Murphy and Garrity.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, but we have a further gloss on this case and that he refused to answer or sign the waiver and to answer on the ground that he could not even be subpoenaed before the grand jury. 
    So it would be a futile act for us to try to follow up and compel him to answer under the decisions of the Court because he took the position that he couldn't be sworn and he couldn't be compelled to answer.

    Well, did your Court of Appeals treat it as your brother said, as I understand him, did the Court of Appeals treat this as the case in which he refused to answer the questions as well as case of refusal to sign a waiver?

    But the grand jury in New York has a power to make presentments which involved the recommendations about the conduct of the laws, enforcement, and other matters of that kind. 
    So if they have this broader right, broader interest, and it seems to us that the grand jury should properly be able to inquire into the manner in which public officials are performing their duty. 
    And then they correct commendations to the legislature or the governor, other officials as to how these laws should be changed or improved to carry out the purposes --

    Can he be dismissed for his refusal to sign that waiver?

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    I have difficulty with answering that categorically in light of your decision in Murphy against Waterfront and in Garrity and trying to arrive at the question of whether or not how much immunity you did give in those cases which clearly say that there is -- that the testimony could not be used and the fruits cannot be used but does not go as far as Counselman's dictum. 
    That I think is the issue of the question that you're asking.

    What -- where -- of course, no questions were asked of this man either before the grand jury or at the administrative hearing except that the latter to establish that he had indeed refused to sign that waiver of immunity.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is it clear what kind of investigation this was? 
    Was this an investigation of his conduct as a police officer as has been assumed and stated here or what was it? 
    It wasn't -- it did involve his shooting anybody, did it?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2604.787" stopTime="2620.304">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Before the grand jury, no it did not involve his shooting. 
    It involved the question of the bribery of police officials regarding -- to keep them from interfering with gambling activities in the city.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It was an investigation of organized gambling, was it?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2623.325" stopTime="2629.607">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, it was an investigation of bribery transactions that were --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2629.607" stopTime="2631.009">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of alleged police corruption?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2631.009" stopTime="2631.762">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2631.762" stopTime="2634.177">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Corrupting of the police department by gamblers, is that it?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2634.177" stopTime="2717.746">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    That's right. 
    And this particular appellant was thought to be one of those involved in the bribery at the time of the investigation for the grand jury. 
    And when he was given the hearing and took the position that he would not sign the waiver and the reason -- and that he would not -- could not be required to testify before the grand jury because he could not be called and sworn before the jury. 
    There was no purpose in trying to do anything more about asking about what he'd done because he was indicating that he was taking illegal position but he didn't -- could not be compelled to testify from that point on. 
    The importance of this issue is obvious and I'm sure that the Court has recognized in connection with the footnote that was referred to and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Fortas and the very structure of our Government and it’s various parts in the federal system and the right to try to find out what any official has been doing and his doing in the performance of his duties.

    I don't know of anything of that kind, Mr. Justice. 
    I offhand had thought that that would not add anything because he would be presumed to know what the constitution provides and what the charter provided.
