    Number 174, Clyde Franklin Lee et al, petitioner versus Florida. 
    Mr. Kirkland.

    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland 
    Mr. Chief Justice and if it may it please the Court. 
    This matter is before the Court today on oral argument arising out of a conviction in a state court of petitioners Lee, Brashin and merit in 1964. 
    The defendants were brought on for trial before the trial court on various counts of violation of the Florida Lottery laws and dissemination of raising information by telephonic methods. 
    The trial resulted in a verdict of guilty as to three of the defendants petitioners here and during the course of the trial, take recordings or wire recordings of conversations had between the petitioners Lee, Brashin and Marrette and others were introduced at the trial over objection of the counsel for the defendants below. 
    Now, the procedure used and I might address and say in this instant, Florida does not have a permissive wire tap law or a law similar to the one apparently just struck down by this Court in the Berger case that New York has. 
    The method adopted in this case were that police officers and deputy's sheriff of Orange County arranged with the Winter Park Telephone Company to install a line, a telephone line in a house next to the petitioner Lee's house and advised the telephone company they wanted a party line, that is a line that was on the same cable with the petitioner Lee. 
    The --

    Petitioner Lee already on a party line?
speaker="edward_r_kirkland" startTime="145.991" stopTime="209.348">
    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland 
    Mr. -- the evidence I believe will show in this case that Mr. Lee ordered a private line. 
    There is some dispute as to whether or not he was ever advised that he was given a party line instead of a private line. 
    There is evidence that there were some conspiracies so to speak between the deputy sheriff who ordered the line in the one part telephone company to arrange a party line for Mr. Lee so that they could then intercept telephonic communications on that line and record them. 
    The testimony is here before the Court. 
    I can't recall exactly what it was but I know that there were some evidence that there was a cast of agreement or conspiracy between the telephone company and the deputy sheriff to give Mr. Lee party line so that they can then ready how down the street which they did do.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the evidence shows as I understand it that your client Lee was advised that whenever he might've ordered he was advised that he was on a party line by the telephone company?

    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland

    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="edward_r_kirkland" startTime="247.028" stopTime="255.082">
    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland 
    Yes, sir. 
    This is judicial license Mr. Justice White more than an actual factual reading of the testimony will show. 
    I believe the testimony will show --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="255.082" stopTime="259.053">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you mean that a Florida Court on this historical fact finding here?
speaker="edward_r_kirkland" startTime="259.053" stopTime="259.993">
    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland 
    I'm sorry sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="259.993" stopTime="545.146">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We should differ with the Florida Court on this? 
    No, sir. 
    I don't think if this finding is really relevant to the issue if the Court wants to file or believe with the historical fact that the Florida properly stated the question and I would certainly be happy to go along because I believe the very ruling of the Florida Court is limited to the statement that Your Honor had just made or the finding of the Florida Court that there was knowledge on the part of Mr. Lee that he was getting a private -- a party line instead of a private line. 
    The first and most obvious fact is that at no time did the police or the deputy sheriff seek a search warrant to obtain the information which they subsequently obtained by the use of this equipment. 
    Now, to go in a little bit more into the history of what happened. 
    Once the defendant Lee obtained this party line, the police arranged with the Winter Park Telephone Company to install a party -- another party line in a house which were rendered -- which was rendered by the police and an electronic actuator and some other sophisticated type of electronic surveillance equipment was attached to a wall outlet in the house which permitted the police to overhear by headsets and to record by equipment, recording equipment all the conversations that were either placed from an outgoing call or were received by incoming calls. 
    There is no evidence in the record nor has the state contend in its brief and our position to this petition that the police had probable cause to conduct a general search which I believe the State of Florida will have to concede. 
    They did in this fact, a mere search for evidence which of course has been condemned by this Court many times. 
    There was no effort whatsoever to obtain a search warrant to conduct the search. 
    The police merely arranged to have a party line installed in Mr. Lee's house and for the telephone company to install a line whereby they could intercept and record the messages. 
    I believe that the distinction is there is one amounts to no difference for this reason Mr. Justice White in answer to your question. 
    Admittedly Mr. Lee, according to the findings of the appellate court of Florida had knowledge that there was a party line in existence. 
    This creates then a double standard if Mr. Marette who called in from his private line and if Mr. Brashin who called in on their private line are protected either under the Fourth Amendment or by Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act then it would resolve itself to an economic problem. 
    That is a person who can afford a private line carries the immunities of a private line without the burdens of perhaps being eavesdropped upon. 
    Now, like this Court has and of course counsel is certainly aware of Schwartz versus Texas a case some years ago where in this Court held that Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act does not apply in state court and we're cognizant of this case and I'm satisfied the counsel for the respondent will argue this case very strongly. 
    But I have noted in the recent case of Pugach versus Dollinger where justices of this Court including the Chief Justice have stated that the rationale or the underpinnings of Schwartz had been swept away by the case of Benanti versus the United States. 
    Now, in the Pugach case, although there was an affirmance of the lower court, the issue was not directly connected with the question of the applicability of the rule of exclusion under 605 in this federal court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="545.146" stopTime="560.312">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, in so far as the -- in so far as this is not a statutory violation but rather a violation of the Fourth Amendment as made applicable to the states thorough the Fourteenth --

    Yes, sir.

    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland

    Katz was a federal case.

    Was a federal case versus U.S., yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="581.687" stopTime="606.978">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I'm not directing my question to your -- to the Schwartz case which involved the wiretapping in violation of the federal statute, it was held in that case that even though the federal statute was violated the results of what was found in the wiretap could be introduced, could constitutionally be introduced into a state court criminal trial. 
    That decision preceded Mapp against Ohio?
speaker="edward_r_kirkland" startTime="606.978" stopTime="608.546">
    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="608.546" stopTime="628.699">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And in so far as in this case you're relying not on the violation of the federal wiretapping statute but rather a violation of the -- of your client's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures you don't have any problem about excludability do you since Mapp against Ohio. 
    It's all I'm asking.
speaker="edward_r_kirkland" startTime="628.699" stopTime="717.928">
    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland 
    Well, we are underpinning our appeal on both that we're asking the Court to revisit Schwartz versus Texas and to depart briskly from that decision. 
    In view of the statements by Mr. Justice Douglas in the Pugach case which for all intents and purposes swept away the rationale of the Schwartz versus Texas case. 
    We're asking the Court to reverse on both grounds. 
    Now, briefly touching on the Fourth Amendment question reiterate once again defendant Lee was in his home talking on the telephone while police officers were intercepting and recording conversations that he had with the petitioners Brashin and Marette and others. 
    In the recent case Katz versus United States, the -- this Court reversed a conviction based upon evidence obtained by the federal officers after they had placed an electronic device on the top of a public telephone booth and recorded the conversation of Mr. Katz and others concerning the dissemination of bidding information or book making.

    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland 
    The evidence in the appendix says, states that the officer who did it disconnected two screws at the base within the home that they had rented, the base board which made a direct connection with the line of the petitioner Lee and it facilitated the recording because it was not necessary then to release or pick up the receiver which gives a click and it was a bit sophisticated for me but apparently this was in fact a direct connection with the party line.

    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland 
    Yes, sir. 
    As a matter of fact the officer who did it in response to this question made this answer. 
    The question in other words, it was something more than coincidence that this line happened to be a line on a party line with 411 Manor Road and the answer I beg your pardon. 
    The question, that was something more than a coincidence that the line that was installed was on a party line with the Lee house. 
    Answer, Yes, we did installed it for the fun of it and it is obvious throughout the entire examination of the witness that they're not only talked the Winter Park Telephone Company in the giving Mr. Lee a party line when he actually ordered a private line but also the arranged with the Winter Park Telephone Company to install another party line in the house next door in order to conduct this surveillance.

    No, as a matter of fact I'm incorrect. 
    There were others on the line and because we attempted to get their conversations and the state law does not permit us to have this discovery but there are other people on the line whose conversation were likewise recorded because this infirming machine could not differentiate between intrastate, interstate, party line calls or anything anytime the wire was picked up in the Lee house or incoming call was made into the Lee house, the electronic currents actuated this gadget and started recording all of the conversation that took place. 
    So, there were others on there whose privacy were being invaded and were not violating law apparently.

   Argument of Wallace E. Allbritton
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1577.598" stopTime="1584.891">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Allbritton.
speaker="wallace_e_allbritton" startTime="1584.891" stopTime="1760.365">
    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The controlling question as I understand it to be in this case is whether a person who is operating an illegal gambling operation over a party line telephone has a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy. 
    Before addressing myself to that question, I would like to comment very briefly on the remarks made by my colleague. 
    First, to answer a question put by one of the justices, petitioner Lee did in fact know that he was on a party line and he had been told by the man who installed the party line telephone and that is in the appendix. 
    Next, one of the members of this Court inquired as to whether or not the Court below did find that the petitioner had been told that he was on a party line telephone and that court did sole said out in its opinion and that is in the appendix also. 
    Now, we contend that there was no wire tapped in this case within the meaning of the Federal Communications Act. 
    All the police officers it did was to have a telephone installed in a house on a party line and in order not to have to pick up the handle of it every time the telephone rang in there, they put an automatic actuator attached to their own party line so that when the telephone rang in the petitioner's house they could hear it without having to go through the manual operation of picking up the telephone handle.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How about if it rang in somebody else's home, somebody else was on that party line, did it record all of their conversations too?

    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    No, sir. 
    That is one of the reasons. 
    The main reason was to keep the police officer from having to pick up the thing every time the telephone rang and he had a headset on, where he could hear it.

    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    Yes, sir. 
    That this becomes arguous at times over a period of time. 
    Now, as I believe what we are concerned here with is whether or not the petitioner Lee in conducting an illegal gambling operation over a party line telephone had a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy. 
    Now, on the one hand we have Hester v. United States which says that a man in an open lot does not have a reasonable expectation then on the other hand we have the recent Katz case. 
    I agree with the Katz case. 
    I think that when a man goes in a telephone booth and closes the door, pays the toll and talks that he is justified to believe that the words he speaks can only be heard for the -- by the person for whom they are intended.

    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    I would hope that it would be, I don't know whether it is or not and whether courts going to have it be retroactive or not. 
    In ascertaining --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    You -- you urged us to hold Katz retroactive?
speaker="wallace_e_allbritton" startTime="2193.056" stopTime="2223.349">
    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    I don't believe that you would have to hold Katz to be retroactive in order to sustain this case Justice White. 
    Because I don't believe that the petitioner Lee had a reasonable expectation that what he spoke would be heard by only -- by the person for whom intended that is protected by the Constitution.

    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    No, I don't think it's irrelevant at all.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2228.367" stopTime="2236.057">

    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    I don't think Katz that the case here can be controlled by Katz. 
    Now, in determining whether or not there is a reasonable expectation, first we have to look at where the person is at; two, what the person is doing; and third how it is being done. 
    Now, here the man was in his private house; two, he was conducting an illegal gambling operation; and three, he was doing it over a known party line.

    Well, Mr. Allbritton, it seems to me that you're saying that the police may run the house or install a party line in order to listen on and establish party line the conversations between other people on the party line that you would necessarily argue that even without renting a party line from any from the telephone company that they could just simply tap a party line anytime or any place they wanted to because the people who talk on that line anticipate that somebody is going to overhear them and if it would justify the police in buying a party line and picking up the receiver and listening to other parties on the line I don't know why it wouldn't justify the police in just not running a party line but just tapping the wire.
speaker="wallace_e_allbritton" startTime="2456.457" stopTime="2458.654">

    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    Yes, sir.

    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton

    And getting to the Fourth Amendment and going back to what he was doing, I again reiterate that the college boy would not be too concerned with who overheard him for this reason if the Court please he knows that he is not violating any law and he knows he's not going to be prosecuted. 
    Now, that isn't the case here. 
    This man knew he was violating the law and he knew that the police were trying to shall we say apprehend him or catch him.

    Here, if the petitioner had been talking on a private line in his own house then as far as I'm concern I would be out of Court because there I believe that the man would have a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy. 
    But where he is not talking on a private line he knows he is talking on a party line, I don't believe that he has such a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.

    I think that would be incorrect and I don't believe to this Court would uphold it. 
    I don't believe they can do that but when they rent a house and pay for the installation of a telephone and they do it in their own house, on their own telephone and it's not a violation of any law whatsoever then I don't see anything wrong with it.

    I believe that Katz case finally cut the underpinnings I believe is the word that was used from the Olmstead case, I believe.

    Mr. Attorney General, could I ask you a question? 
    In this community where I gather people I have party line telephones let us suppose that a client telephones his lawyer, client telephones his lawyer. 
    Now the client can waive the lawyer-client privilege, does the notice upon which you're relying here, the notice that the publicity of the use of the party line operate to waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to the matter that the client has communicated to the attorney?
speaker="wallace_e_allbritton" startTime="3157.197" stopTime="3161.988">
    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    I can't answer that. 
    I have not given any thought whatsoever to that type of --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3161.988" stopTime="3182.638">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well it's kind of related to the proposition which you are stating. 
    What you're saying is that the use of a party line telephone waives any right of the user to insist upon the confidentiality of the communication.
speaker="wallace_e_allbritton" startTime="3182.638" stopTime="3183.459">
    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    Yes, sir. 
    I do.

    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    I don't know sir.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, this hasn't answered the question whether this man was communicating with his lawyer or not. 
    You still have question of principle here, don't you Mr. Attorney General?

    You do and --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    It's to whether a person who uses a party line telephone surrenders whole claim to confidentiality. 
    You also have the question here as to whether the police were conducting a search and deliberately adopted this device to conduct the warrantless search. 
    Those are the questions in your case.
speaker="wallace_e_allbritton" startTime="3237.604" stopTime="3266.393">
    Mr. Wallace E. Allbritton 
    Let me put it this way sir. 
    I don't believe that the use of the party line means that a person has released all claims or rights of confidentiality but I do believe that it does release his right to have his conversation protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3266.393" stopTime="3282.484">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I see. 
    Do you think that it's only with respect to Fourth Amendment right that the use of a party line constitutes a waiver or surrender?

    I can't give you a categorical answer on that sir.

    I guess what you're really claiming is the aid or opportunity of party line listen to his neighbors accusation when he has a party line that the Constitution doesn't step in that make him a criminal if he exposes what he heard on his party line.
speaker="wallace_e_allbritton" startTime="3309.687" stopTime="3320.083">

   Rebuttal of Edward R. Kirkland
speaker="edward_r_kirkland" startTime="3320.083" stopTime="3428.885">
    Mr. Edward R. Kirkland 
    Very briefly touching on two points in answer to Justice White's inquiry about the retroactivity of Katz. 
    I don't think this is that violent because it would not be necessary to make Katz retroactive as to trial to this cause and the grounds on which we are relying are preceded -- the trial preceded Katz, the grounds on which we were relying are similar to those raised in Katz and would be merely reaffirming Katz if this Court applied the rationale of Katz and not making it prospective in application as opposed to retroactive. 
    The point that the general here has completely overlooked is that there are three appellants. 
    The record indicates that Brashin and Marette had party -- had private lines and there was no evidence that they knew Mr. Lee was on a party line. 
    So certainly, when they picked up the phone and dialed Mr. Lee, whatever their motive was, they did not exposed themselves to any recordation, interception or interference and the evidence in the case that convicted Brashin and Marette was nothing more than the recorded conversations and I think this answered Mr. Justice Fortas' question that the incoming callers certainly should be given the protection and I think in this case the outgoing caller should be afforded to protection. 
    Since he has granted the privileges of the line and the immunities, he certainly should not have carried the burdens of having a party line.
