United Mine Workers of America, District 12 v. Illinois Bar Association

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 12, United Mine Workers of America, District 12, Petitioner, versus Illinois State Bar Association. 
    Mr. Combs.
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="17.973" stopTime="245.313">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The principal question involved in this case is whether or not that a State Court decree conflicts with rights of coal miners, members of labor union and it holds that such labor union is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by employing an attorney on a salary basis to represent it’s members with respect to claims arising under the state’s Workmen’s Compensation Law. 
    The Bar Association of the State of Illinois filed a complaint in the Sangamon Circuit Court on behalf of it’s committee on unauthorized practice of law alleging that for many years District 12, United Mine Workers had been engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in that it involved an attorney, a duly licensed attorney, State of Illinois to represent its members on workmen’s compensation claims who were injured in the course of their employment. 
    District 12 filed an answer admitting that it did employ such an attorney by stating that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States that it had a right to do this. 
    It denied that it had engaged at time in the unauthorized practice of law. 
    The Court granted a sovereign decree in the Circuit Court in Sangamon County and joining the continuation of this legal aid claim. 
    District 12, United Mine Workers appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois and this Court affirmed the decree of the Sangamon Circuit Court. 
    The legal aid plan in question here was set up by a convention of District 12, United Mine Workers in 1913 at a convention held at Peoria, Illinois. 
    The convention consisted of delegates from the various local unions and various coal mines in the state of Illinois. 
    Now District 12 is a branch of United Mine Workers of America, a national labor organization. 
    It's composed of some 14,000 members; 8,500 of these members are working members and some 5,500 are retired members. 
    The legal aid plan in question here was set up as I say in 1913. 
    It was set up because the delegates, the coal miners at the convention in their discussions said that the claims that they were filing in the state Courts with connection with their injuries were being mishandled. 
    I think the words juggled were used and that even the claims were not mishandled that it cost the injured employee approximately 50, from 40% to 50% of the rewards given and attorney fees and in cost to the Court.

    Workmen's compensation solely.

    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Well it was in fact that contemporaneously worth it, I think that the workmen's compensation law was passed in 1912, if I'm not mistaken and this occurred in 1913. 
    Now frankly Your Honor that the discussions merged in the gut of the need of a Workmen's Compensation Act as well as problem they we are having of recovering any damage since that common law.

    Yes Your Honor, District 12 is branch of national organization, administrative purposes and this jurisdiction is in the State of Illinois and Iowa.

    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Yes. 
    But the Compensation Act and the legal aid plan is confined here to the State of Illinois.

    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Yes Your Honor it is in the record but I can answer because it was proceeding, official proceedings, we have had cases, I have in Kentucky and in West Virginia and some discussion in Ohio. 
    All of these cases were settled to the satisfaction of the local bar associations and committees, that there was no Court action in any of these cases because they settled before that, they were satisfied with our explanation of --

    Did you settle by making any changes in your setup?

    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    In West Virginia there were some slight changes made. 
    But I think the heart of the matter is -- would still be this question of paying your salary here.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Does it give the services exclusively Mr. Combs to this work or does he have additional plan?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="387.319" stopTime="403.640">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    He has additional work, because in no instance that I know of is the attorney involved solely practicing compensation law. 
    As a matter of fact it's proven to be more satisfactory to have an attorney in the general practice of law in the community where he is to handle these cases.

    Well, the terminology that is been used just simple been that they pay him a salary so much, so I'm not making a point in the distinction on what he does, I don't know about what he calls it, but --

    Do you pay taxes on this man?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="476.226" stopTime="498.640">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    I think in some of them they do and some of them they don't. 
    I think they arrangement sometimes, they're not included I might say this. 
    For our purposes of pensions and for group health these attorneys are not included as employees, because they are considered to be on a fee basis. 
    I'd like to read the terms of employment if you like.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="498.640" stopTime="509.854">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    No. 
    Does the Illinois compensation system provide for an award a fees to an attorney representing an injured employee?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="509.854" stopTime="529.359">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Only in this respect Your Honor. 
    If there was a controversy with reference to the fee they will set an award and yes there is a controversy on whether or not it was unreasonable they would act on that, but all of the awards or fees are not made by the commission, it is made for private contract between the claimant and the attorney.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="529.359" stopTime="535.308">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well in this cases where it's made by the commission, does this attorney keep the fee in addition to the salary?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="535.308" stopTime="537.603">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Not if -- the attorney involved here, no sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="537.603" stopTime="539.904">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What happens to the fee?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="539.904" stopTime="617.258">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    I don't see where there would be a fee awarded, there's no claim ever entered for a fee. 
    There would be no occasion for such an instance to arise, because his sole compensation is to be according to his employment contract, his salary is paid by the union. 
    And the recipient receives the entire amount of the award, no cost whatsoever deducted. 
    And I think it's pertinent, since Mr. Justice White asked the question, that in the initial setup of this legal aid plan in 1913, the resolution authorizing the District Executive Board to setup a legal department and to employ a competent attorney to represent these members and these workmen's compensation claims. 
    The resolution itself specified that this was to be available to the claimant if he wanted, if he didn't -- if he wanted it and if he did not want this then he could get counsel of his own choosing and the department would be available to that counsel for any investigative work for getting ready to file that counsel, the man chose that was in the original employment authorization by the men who were at the convention.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="617.258" stopTime="625.606">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you don't offer to pay any of the expenses of attorneys that some member may hire rather than this man in the legal department.
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="625.606" stopTime="655.337">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    That is correct, with this exception, he is not paid, that's right. 
    The question is, that's right, but under this plan Your Honor the local unions designate particular persons in the local union to help this man who is injured to help him get his information and to help him (Inaudible). 
    Now this is agreeable to that attorney at the cost of the union and that was provided in the initial employment. 
    Now the current case rules 1963 --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Does it bother you then stating (Inaudible) and then here and there something about it, does it bother you to say it briefly as possible that the, exactly what is your organization and how it functions?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="670.285" stopTime="726.671">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Well I'd be happy to. 
    United Mine Workers of America is a Labor organization setup in 1809. 
    It has jurisdiction throughout the bituminous and Anthracite Coal Fields in United States and Canada. 
    I suppose it is close to the between 75% or 80% of the coal miners belonged to the United Mine Workers. 
    And they bargained in the coal industry through districts we call them and District 12 is such a district. 
    These districts are administrative divisions of United Mine Workers for purposes of administrating the contracts and the constitution and the laws et cetera. 
    And this District 12 is a division of United Mine Workers of America labor organization and the income of the district involved here comes from the dues of the members of that district and the international union.

    Since that time.

speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="752.352" stopTime="762.650">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Yes, now the current attorney was involved as a result of a resolution of 1913, now here is this important contract I like to read it, it is very brief.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What contract is that?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="763.826" stopTime="808.230">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    This is the contract between the current attorney who represents that Workman's compensation Department in District 12 that's involved here, this attorney is involved in this case. 
    And this is in private contract made by District 12 Executive Board reserved to the resolution of 1913 and is on page 19 of the record here and it reads as follows, it's dated 26th of September 1963. 
    The District Executive board has authorized the undersigned to make arrangements with you to handle as attorney, compensation cases for District 12 and their dependence to plead and desire your services.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="808.230" stopTime="810.044">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that compensation only?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="810.044" stopTime="973.125">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Compensation only. 
    If accepted by you the salary will be $12,400 per year. 
    You will also be allowed and paid reasonable expenses. 
    It will be your duty to see to it so far as possible with the help of the secretaries in the Springfield and West Frankfort offices and Offices of local unions that no member or dependent loses his rights under the act by reason of failure to avail himself, avail in time. 
    Also to represent him before the commission if he desires your services, if he is represented by other counsel you will immediately turn over his file to such counsel. 
    You will receive no further instructions or directions and have no interference from the district nor from any officer and your obligations and relations will be too and with only the several persons you represent. 
    This arrangement is (Inaudible) and acting President. 
    Now that is the employment of this counsel and in addition to the services of this counsel and by the way he is a member of the State Bar Association of Illinois, he is a member of the American Bar association and he is a duly licensed attorney and as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, he is a Senator in the State of Illinois. 
    Now in addition to the services of the attorney, the Union Secretaries in the offices at West Frankfort and in Springfield are available to this attorney to assist him in the filing of these claims and getting the material that's necessary for these cases. 
    This attorney meets about twice a week in these offices, he is available for conferences with any injured claimant. 
    The claims that are filed here are filed on forms that are distributed to the local unions and with the assistance of members of that local union to the injured claimant. 
    And this form provides the necessary information about what kind of injury he has, when it occurred what medical records that he may have and what the controversy is about. 
    Whether or not that he is paid what he thinks is due or whether or not that his compensation has been cut off before it should be cut off and whatever the dispute is between the attorney and I mean between the claimant and the coal company involved.

    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Yes, Your Honor he is included in this only this complaint, he is included because under canons 47 and 35 that he is lending his assistance, he is charged with many assistants with the district and the unauthorized pact of law in that respect. 
    Now there has been no complaints filed by any other person except this Illinois bar Association, there is none of the members complaining, there's nobody had a claim that's complaining at all, it just simply complained in the bar association.

    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    No, his contract is solely for workmen's compensation. 
    Now with respect to other practice in his deposition which is the matter of this record here, the questions were asked if as a result of his employment, the attention that that he got, did he get more involvement among the coal miners and he said very little -- he might have represented one or two and he didn't remember that. 
    But as far as the union and the contract is concerned no, that's all he represents them and it was one exception that he said that some of these officers of the district that they should ask him some legal question or something like that he would be glad to give it but he didn't practice, his contract was exclusively for workmen's compensation.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What precisely is your constitutional claim?

    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    What I didn't, I beg your pardon.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1107.512" stopTime="1111.118">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What precisely is your constitutional claim?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="1111.118" stopTime="1209.147">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Our constitution of claim is precisely representing Brotherhood claim that these coal miners had right to meet and to consult and advice with each other on what they thought would be their best protection under this workman's compensation act, and in this particular case and in doing that that they had a right to agree through their union which they had traditionally depended upon to employ an attorney or to instruct the union to employ one in the system of Compensation Act. 
    We think that this case falls squarely under the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen's case decided by this court. 
    Now if Your Honor would like the Supreme Court of Illinois distinguished between the Trainmen case and this case at bar here by saying that in the Trainman case the question of the union paying, the attorney did not come up and it wasn't decided by this court and it wasn't because they worked out another plan with relation plan. 
    And the Illinois court the sole objection they had in this legal aid plan was just simply that the union had no right to pay this man on salary basis and that they restricted now from having any financial connections between the union and the attorney employed. 
    They wanted the claimant to pay back and we say that that is not necessary because after all if they have this constitutional right, they have a right to make it effective in a lot of these --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1209.147" stopTime="1221.233">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Let's see Mr. Combs's that in other words the Supreme Court of Illinois has said you had a service limited to referral to this particular lawyer of your members.
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="1221.233" stopTime="1221.704">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1221.704" stopTime="1222.727">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That would be all right.
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="1222.727" stopTime="1223.906">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1223.906" stopTime="1230.141">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But the wise thing is as they saw it was simply that you paid him a salary.
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="1230.141" stopTime="1230.461">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1230.461" stopTime="1232.834">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    For performing the services for the members.
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="1232.834" stopTime="1391.968">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    That's right. 
    Let me read what it said, just very short. 
    Here's what they condemn this legal aid plan for, you have the court's words. 
    The lawyer is not paid for any services by the client. 
    His salary is paid by the association and because the interests of the employer and the client, the interest of the union collectively may extend beyond the interest of the injured member. 
    Now, our answer to that Mr. Justice Brennan is just simply this, that the testimony here shows conclusively that a claim, when it comes up that the claimant himself makes the determination on whether that will be settled or whether that will go on to hearing and the awards is incomplete sole control. 
    Now, there couldn't be any conflict between the union's interest and the man's interests, in the first place the interest came up for reason of these claims and the authorizations, the contract of employment, resolution setting up this department in 1913 specifically provides that this claimant is going to be in control of this lawsuit on what he wants to do of life. 
    And we think that the court's speculation here -- there's absolutely no evidence in this record but at anytime that there's been an abuse of this representation at all, that at any time there has been an abuse of this because of a conflict between the union's interest and the possible interests of the client. 
    And again for instance that in the future if this legal aid plan contend that first thing you know that they're getting people to get divorces for them and they would be doing this and doing that, well of course you can speculate almost anything but it's purely speculation, there's not a cental of evidence in this record that anything occurred here it wasn't to the satisfaction of these employees here, there's no complaints at all about their services, about the way their awards are settled to them and I am not saying this that in regard to that when they want this client to pay this legal fee, they're talking in terms here of this record was about five years in excess of $2 million and under the record here in the evidence, there would be at least 20% of that reward will go to the legal fees as such if it was with private lawyers together with the cause there and the Illinois Supreme Court conceded, it does a great benefit to these coal miner to arrange it independently.

speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="1645.827" stopTime="1649.732">
    Mr. Harrison Combs

    I don't, so then it's not your position I guess perhaps I misunderstood it, I thought that your position was that your association had a constitutional right to choose whomever you wanted to represent your members in claims against the claims of the industrial commission.

    Mr. Harrison Combs

    Well I could plan to a lawyer because you're trying to get their rights under worker compensations stats that is a practice of law, that is the practice of law, everyone is trying to practice law.

    Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court. 
    In order to start on even keel here I want to make it perfectly clear with respect to a possible misunderstanding that the court may have with respect to disciplinary actions against Mr. Stewart Trainer. 
    As regards of this particular problem here Mr. Stewart Trainer has no disciplinary action pending against him. 
    In other words with respect to aiding and abetting the unauthorized practice of law by a way of agency. 
    However and I must go outside the record, if the court would permit me.

    Yes sir.

    If this is unauthorized practice of the law, certainly the lawyer who is employed is guilty of unlawful practice of law.

    His complaint was that the present man who was his predecessor Mr. Trainer was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in being a salaried employer for the union and that was taken up by the bar association at that time and through developments it finally reached it's -- the point to where we file a suit at the approval of the bar association.

    No, the problem of unauthorized practice by the salaried lawyer is 10 years old. 
    The previous lawyer who handled this matter was a man Hannigan, and it is mentioned in the brief and in the record. 
    And he was a man who at that time -- shortly after the time the investigation began became ill and apparently our predecessor committee did not want to push the matter because he was apparently very seriously ill and it, he eventually as court realized died and this man took this place, and it was at that stage that the more active participation occurred.

    However that in and of itself is not reason why the state bar shouldn't act when it has brought to its attention a plan such as this one which does not guarantee to the individual minor, confident and loyal legal representation as they claim.

    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    First instance was the illness of Mr. Hannigan, it was pushed aside by the then members of the unauthorized practice commission because the man was apparently having a condition which, from which he, it was expected he would die. 
    They did not --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2389.600" stopTime="2391.270">

    How long was it --?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="2391.270" stopTime="2421.863">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    It was delayed from 1957 and 1959 till about ‘63 when Mr. Trainer took over and then – and incidentally in that period before that Mr. Chief Justice there was a period of time where Mr. Hannigan was interrogated by the committee and the same general information that appears in the deposition of Mr. Trainer came out at that time.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2421.863" stopTime="2428.253">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    He was working -- he was working as best he could under the circumstances of his condition and I believe he used his son to help him.

speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="2450.683" stopTime="2468.528">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    This of course I agree but it was never brought too ahead due to the fact that there was a certain humanitarian feeling towards Mr. Hannigan, they did not want to do anything at that time that would make him, would worsen his condition.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2468.528" stopTime="2469.515">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Did he die?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="2469.515" stopTime="2588.175">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Yes sir, he died and that is the reason why Mr. Trainer was replaced, as a matter of fact in an interim of some four or five months his son acted as the mine workers attorney and received his salary. 
    The problem -- the state of Illinois is confronted with a case of this kind is the plan itself clearly showed that the miners, please understand that as far as the Illinois State Bar Association is concerned our interest here is the public interest and the public in this case has to be the individual miner and it became quite evident from the record that here is a man who concludes 450 some cases a year that he was not doing the job that an person should do for those people -- because that is almost an insurmountable number of cases to handle if you are going to handle them properly. 
    He testified under those in his deposition that he seldom saw these people before the hearing -- that he only took them at the hearing and then I suppose he took the, well your company doctor says you have 10% of your life so therefore we'll try and get 10% of the life. 
    He never made any attempt except in rare instances which he admits, rare instances -- did he go and find out whether or not that company doctor was actually correct on that 10% life or maybe it might have be 70% of the life. 
    He didn't do any of the things that a true individual attorney client relationship would dictate to any lawyer. 
    He did this on a mass basis.

    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Our position is that, our position is that when you make the jump from mere recommendation to the employment of a lawyer, then you insert that particular union or that particular agency into the practice of law and you clove that union with the practice of law which is prohibited and the State of Illinois has the right to regulate the practice.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is it your point -- well the question is whether it's practice of law -- certain -- state regulation begins that's really the question, no question about the state power to regulate the practice of law. 
    But does the record here show that the union attempted to or did in fact confront the legal advice or the methodology used by Mr. Trainer in giving legal advice.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="2701.855" stopTime="2729.265">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand

    It was anticipated that these elements of the improper and insufficient representation would be further developed in this case, in the preparation of the case before it actually reached the trial stage. 
    But the union interposed this motion for summary decree. 
    At that time perhaps as not as able to look ahead and see what there is available to one, we likewise file such a motion and both motions were heard on the state of the record at that time and the court then determined from the state of the record at that time that there was evidence of unauthorized practice by the district lawyer.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's all there is in the case.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3131.166" stopTime="3133.609">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    That is -- my judgment is the basic element of the case.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3133.609" stopTime="3150.082">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well in substance what you're arguing here is that these people were being represented not by the lawyer or the lawyers, but that their legal work was if anything performed by a lay agency, that's your point.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3150.082" stopTime="3151.350">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    That is correct Mr. Justice Fortas.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3151.350" stopTime="3204.904">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And there -- and you have to show some basis for that argument because if we go to the compensation and commission records, I suppose it goes that John (Inaudible) who is represented by Mr. Trainer or whoever is a qualified lawyer. 
    Now then you have to show us if there are in this record factors which show that this lawyer was not -- was merely a nominal representative of these people and that the real representative was the UMW and thus far what you've told us, so far as I know is only that the UMW paid him a salary and that he did not collect the fee from the individual members, is that correct?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3204.904" stopTime="3206.505">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    That's correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3206.505" stopTime="3231.760">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What you're saying is that that's kind of (Inaudible) since the members then pay them – they then control them since the mineworkers paid them with salary, therefore the mine workers controlled him in the sense that the mine workers were really the representatives of people who appeared to be his clients. 
    Is there anything more on your position than that?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3231.760" stopTime="3242.102">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    No, there isn't -- they either control him or have the right to control him and they could use the influence of their organization to control them and so therefore --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3242.102" stopTime="3250.538">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose they did, what does that have to do with constitutionality, under the federal constitution of this law?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3250.538" stopTime="3255.294">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    It is my intention Mr. Justice Black that this isn't a federal question at all.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3255.294" stopTime="3301.076">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well Mr. Bertrand, you surely -- it is true isn't it that in Button, we got there with a Virginia system, under which the -- rather NAACP system in Virginia, where the compensation to the lawyer on behalf of the litigants was not paid by the litigants but was paid by the NAACP, wasn't it? 
    We there held that the Virginia -- I forget whether it was a statute, now I have to -- it was a statute, but that statute which -- tempted to prohibit this, did violate in that context the First and Fourteenth Amendments, isn't it?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3301.076" stopTime="3302.259">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3302.259" stopTime="3306.515">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now surely on the constitutional question, you just can't say there isn't any in light of that decision.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3306.515" stopTime="3337.584">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Well I can for this simple reason, because in that case there was, as has been time and time repeated, this was a case of political expression and in that case the opinion itself, the opinion stated sir that this was different than private disputes. 
    This was not a matter of private disputes, and this is a matter of a private dispute between the member of the union.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3337.584" stopTime="3349.342">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It certainly says that this was in an area of lawsuits to vindicate political rights, otherwise by the First Amendment.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3349.342" stopTime="3349.563">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3349.563" stopTime="3352.506">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But surely it didn't decide the question about the dispute, didn't it?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3352.506" stopTime="3354.133">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    No it did not, it left it open.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3354.133" stopTime="3357.058">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But we do have that issue before us --
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3357.058" stopTime="3376.653">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Then if you take the Virginia Brotherhood case, you will find there that the court stated there that the members had the right to discuss within themselves and to pick a representative, to recommend --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3376.653" stopTime="3386.633">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There wasn't any issue presented in the Brotherhood case as I recall it and that's correct, the issue presented by this case was not presented in that case.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3386.633" stopTime="3398.510">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Well the issue presented in the Brotherhood case was clearly that Virginia wouldn't let the Brotherhood getaway with a recommendation for -- approach.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3398.510" stopTime="3414.808">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Perhaps I didn't state my question well. 
    In that case whether or not the Brotherhood who was paying a salary to a lawyer, that the issue of the propriety of that in light of the constitution was not presented well.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you be making the same argument as the union here instead of calling in an employee and paying the salary, just paying the retainer -- say the gentleman was in private practice and a general practice or with a firm and the union just paid him --
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3435.703" stopTime="3441.778">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Mr. Justice White, I find no difference between a salaried employer and a person on retain.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3441.778" stopTime="3452.864">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I gather you would not make the same argument then if the union just told all of its employees go hire any lawyer you want and we'll pay his fee.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3452.864" stopTime="3454.017">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    That is correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3454.017" stopTime="3511.213">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Bertrand can you distinguish this case from the legal assistance program or the Poverty Office, the OEO. 
    That is to say as I understand it in some areas there are lawyers hired as -- on funds provided by the Poverty Program and they represent indigent people and they represent them not only before agencies of the government but before courts. 
    Now on the basis of your argument, these people are not paid by the clients, they are paid by the -- out of federal funds sometimes in some states out of state funds. 
    Now is it your representation that this is the practice of the law by the United States government and not by the people representing these indigents?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3511.213" stopTime="3526.630">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    On the contrary Mr. Justice Fortas, this is a question which you have raised is a question of taking care of the need of indigents. 
    The United Mine Workers District Club Members are by no means indigents.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3526.630" stopTime="3529.224">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What's that got to do with any legal front?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3529.224" stopTime="3530.441">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Well I submit that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3530.441" stopTime="3556.654">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Or the regulation of the practice of the law. 
    You don't make a distinction between Illinois law regulating practice before courts and agencies as whether the lawyer is representing an indigent he can do it, he can be paid by somebody else and is still professionally all right and vice-versa.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3556.654" stopTime="3565.236">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    But the bar of Illinois and the bar throughout this country did not object to the OEO program for the indigent. 
    They accepted--
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3565.236" stopTime="3568.927">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Oh I'm very proud, I'm very proud of the fact that they supported it enthusiastically.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3568.927" stopTime="3605.574">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    That's right. 
    But there is an entire difference between that type of representation and the representation for a person who is a salaried employee, a person who is making money and who has a claim for some injury that he received, this is an entirely different status and the bar has never stated that every human being is entitled to representation if they belong to an agency. 
    Now this --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3605.574" stopTime="3621.236">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You mean that's fundamentally different even though the individual minor lost an arm or a leg they could still -- different from the OEO situation because one is an indigent and the other isn't?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3621.236" stopTime="3625.922">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Mr. Chief Justice, yes I do. 
    I think that is correct, that there's that difference.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3625.922" stopTime="3627.208">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What if he lost both legs.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3627.208" stopTime="3630.511">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Well if he -- again I have to say that's the same thing.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3630.511" stopTime="3631.204">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Same thing.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3631.204" stopTime="3631.453">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Same thing.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3631.453" stopTime="3634.389">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What makes a person indigent and subject to --?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3634.389" stopTime="3667.113">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Well, he became indigent perhaps after that particular occurrence if you might say, maybe he didn't I don't know what the situation maybe from his injury that he received as a minor but that does not put him over into the class of the indigent before the event by any manner or means and it would have to be the most serious type of situation that you could call him then an indigent.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3667.113" stopTime="3690.144">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose a man was not an indigent and he lost both legs in an automobile accident and he then became indigent and he went to the OEO for help. 
    what is the difference between that case and the man who in an industrial accident loses both legs?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3690.144" stopTime="3706.827">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Because there's a protection of employment that he had in one instance as opposed to the other. 
    I would say that would possibly be one of the answer Mr. Chief Justice that he then wasn't necessarily an indigent. 
    He became poor by virtue of the fact he may not been able to work but in the case --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3706.827" stopTime="3709.970">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So did the fellow who lost his two legs in an automobile accident.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3709.970" stopTime="3800.533">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    But in the minor situation he has of course the protection of the collective bargaining arrangements and the welfare program of his union. 
    This brings to the question, the problem that is raised by the amicus briefs. 
    I think that the question of group legal service here is something that if the bar is to or to look forward to the potentiality of group legal service in our society, we're going to have such a situation that there will be no control of lawyers, there will be the situation that I have brought to the court's attention in the objections of where you've been advertised willy-nilly to the particular group that you represent instead of having just unions and laboring people being represented. 
    You will have the Airline Pilots Association, they could have all of their individual matters taken care of by their salaried lawyer, the American Manufacturers Association, the Illinois Manufacturers Association. 
    All of their various potential litigated matters or legal matters will trust anything of that nature, taken care of by a group arrangement.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3800.533" stopTime="3863.483">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Okay but those segments are not in this case but there are some things that are relevant I think that are now and how do you dispose off the legal aid bureaus in this country that are devoted to defending, taking care of people's lives in civil matters as well as criminal matters? 
    Now, just yesterday I happily paid my contribution to a group of lawyers in this community who have joined together for the purpose of representing indigents in civil manners. 
    Now, they don't pay any fees and they're controlled by this group of lawyers who employ lawyers to represent these people and that's done all over the United States where bar associations are really forward-looking and are trying to help indigents.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3863.483" stopTime="3878.679">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    And I would say that Illinois is a forward-looking bar association because it does engage in that type of procedure, there's a large legal aid bureau in Chicago. 
    There are many legal aid groups throughout the State of Illinois.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3878.679" stopTime="3885.378">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now what is the basic difference between that employment and the employment there is here?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3885.378" stopTime="3915.205">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Because there the people are in need of legal assistance and they don't have the means to get it. 
    They are not necessarily in the absolute impoverished state but they are in that nebulous state where they don't quite have enough money or they don't quite know what to do with some of their problems that are bothering them and this is a perfect place for them to go.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3915.205" stopTime="3938.513">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Isn't that the general situation so far as medical care in this country is concerned with a great mass of working people, they are not indigent at one moment but when they became ill, they are indigent because they can't pay the medical expenses but in this situation they can't pay the legal expenses to get their rights.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3938.513" stopTime="3954.211">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Of course Mr. Chief Justice I say that that's the extreme I mean we -- I claim that that's the extreme that they can't. 
    When you become ill you can't pay the medical and when you have a legal problem, you can't pay the legal fees, those are the extremes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3954.211" stopTime="3966.648">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    There are many millions of people who are supposed to be in that class or in this country from all of the studies that have been made, that's what brought Medicare into existence, isn't it?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3966.648" stopTime="3970.957">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    That is correct.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3970.957" stopTime="3976.697">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But it wasn't the extreme case, it was normal case.
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="3976.697" stopTime="4070.182">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Well, I don't know how you can categorize them of course in the true sense of the word but it was found there was a need to legal aid societies, lawyer reference services were established and the bar has done a great service to the public by being involved in all those things. 
    But what we're dealing here in this case is with an organization that has members who are not impoverished. 
    The State of Illinois is the fourth largest coal producing state in the country. 
    It has a tremendous potential of employment within the coal field. 
    There are some new developments in the coal field, that are just occurring right at the present time and these are going to mean more employment for the union member. 
    Recently the, one of the amicus put out a poll to try and find out just what type of person the union member was and the AFFL-CIO found out that their member is the type of person who goes to work, from work to his home in the suburbs and sits in his backyard with a highball in his hand and complaints about high taxes. 
    He is no longer the indigent, he is no longer the poor fellow, he's no longer the fellow who lives in the poor areas of the city.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4070.182" stopTime="4071.776">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How about Appalachia?

    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    Appalachia is a different thing what occurs in Appalachia and what is --

    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    I won't say no because if you remember Mr. Combs informed the Court that in Appalachia in West Virginia, they also had a complaint by the Bar Association and they sat down and worked it out. 
    We tried to get the minors to sit down and work this out with us, they refused, they took the adamant approach.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4105.732" stopTime="4107.130">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What did you want them to do?
speaker="bernard_h_bertrand" startTime="4107.130" stopTime="4150.310">
    Mr. Bernard H. Bertrand 
    We wanted them, our major premise was we wanted them to follow Illinois mineworker's opinion which said that you can recommend attorneys whom you feel to be competent; we wanted them to do that. 
    Now, there's no saying that we would not have perhaps by over the bargaining table, worked out something that in the judgment of the committee would have been considered a proper way of handling the union members business. 
    They wouldn't do so that's why we're here. 
    Thank you, very much. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Harrison Combs
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4150.310" stopTime="4155.340">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Combs.
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="4155.340" stopTime="4275.994">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Court please, by way of rebuttal in connection with the position taken by counsel that the bar association as a matter of policy had a compelling interest to protect the coal miners against their legal aid system of Illinois that's what it was known to. 
    Constitutional issues here as we see them were stated by this court in the trialing case. 
    This court said that the right of members to consult with each other in a paternal organization necessarily includes the right to select a spokesman from their member and could be expected to get the advice of his counsel. 
    That is the role played by the members who carry out the legal aid program, and the right for the workers personally through a special department, under a brotherhood to advise concerning the need for legal assistance. 
    Most importantly what lawyer and member could confidently rely on as an inseparable part of this constitutionally guaranteed right to assist and to advise each other, their only question of payment by counsel, by the union of the counsel. 
    The railroad workers by recommending competent lawyers to each other obviously are not themselves engaging in the practice of law nor are they are the lawyers who may select parties to any soliciting events. 
    It is interesting to note that in Great Britain unions do not simply recommend lawyers to members in need of advise, the retained counsel, paid by the union to represent members in personnel law suits, a practice similar to that which we upheld in NAACP, but --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4275.994" stopTime="4288.581">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Combs on the one hand, I gather you would also argue to sustain union counsel right across the board for members -- again by the litigation of all kind.
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="4288.581" stopTime="4293.226">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    I think there would be a difference if the Court please -- in this case, this --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4293.226" stopTime="4295.592">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well that's all, I just wanted to figure.
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="4295.592" stopTime="4362.774">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    Well let me read what the court said about that, I think I can get it for you in a minute. 
    “In our consideration to this case the policy arguments of the mine workers and amica at present -- ” This is Illinois brief -- questions of the hazards involved in coal mining and undoubtedly the possibility exists that the injured coal miners untutored in the intricacies of workmen's compensation law might accept wholly inadequate settlements -- benefit to the miner in that conversation, the counsel or the client here in fact is from the union treasury rather than the injured member or for his family is not to be easily disregarded. 
    Now we're talking about the compelling interest of the state, in some instances it could perhaps infringe to some extent on constitutional rights in the adjustments there, and I think it would be an apex in Your Honors question whether or not that the need as demonstrated so clearly as this court in Justice Black's opinion said in the Trainmen case that traditionally that the railroad people had an awful time securing their rights under the laws of the country.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4362.774" stopTime="4383.822">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well let's see, this record contained a series of interventions by the union in to these cases with reference to the attorney or a reservation of the contract to get the -- employer wants some thing in the direction of the union, would you say then that the state had made out a decent case?
speaker="harrison_combs" startTime="4383.822" stopTime="4401.791">
    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    That would make a different case Your Honor. 
    I think that if the daily tactics and the strategy and the trying of this lawsuit that the union interfered in to that -- anybody rather than the claimant without his consent, without his knowledge or engaging in it, I think we'd have a different case.

    To that extent because we don't believe that the state under the guides of regulating the practice of law can interfere with an act of Congress, is constitutionally right.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Combs may I ask you this question? 
    In some states I know that the legislature in its concern for the welfare of the workers themselves limit very greatly the fees that can be charged in these compensation cases. 
    In fact they discourage lawyers coming there at all and they have put the percentage of the award so low that it's impossible for -- almost impossible for a workman to go out who has to -- what the public might think was a minor injury, it would be impossible for him to go out and hire a competent lawyer because the lawyer wouldn't spend his time for that small amount. 
    Now I don't know whether that's exists in Illinois or not, but does it?

    Mr. Harrison Combs 
    I doubt that it would exist in Illinois for this reason and I think this a very pertinent observation. 
    For 54 years the union has been able to protect those member's rights down in there, and we've got a good situation not because of what they are arriving here, but in spite of it. 
    I think that they've been able to protect their members down there, just like this welfare fund -- the court was making the inquiries about. 
    They like to take great credit for it, but in getting that welfare fund every legal obstruction, there were other obstructions, but in the way of it, we feel that if this position taken the bar association in this instance prevails, that we'll have the same situation that developed and has existed in 1912 that led up to this situation and we think we've improved down here in situation.
