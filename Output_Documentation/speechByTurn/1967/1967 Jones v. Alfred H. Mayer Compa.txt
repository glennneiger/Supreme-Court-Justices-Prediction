Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Company

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Joseph Lee Jones et al., versus Alfred H. Mayer Company et al. 
    Mr. Treiman, you may continue with your argument.
speaker="israel_treiman" startTime="15.006" stopTime="393.947">
    Mr. Israel Treiman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I should like to pass now as quickly as possible to what I regard as the pivotal points of this case. 
    And I should like to consider those points in two categories corresponding to the two grounds on which the petitioners and the major briefs, that is the Government brief and the NCADH brief, and I must say two or three others, claimed that the District Court was wrong in dismissing the claim. 
    And that the petitioners are entitled to recover on the basis of the allegations set forth in their complaint. 
    Now, taking up the first claim, the first ground, which has to do with this Civil Rights Act of 1866 or rather that portion of it which appears today in Section 1982 of Title 42 of United States Code which incidentally the Government and its brief refers to by its revised statute designation of Section 1978. 
    Here, Your Honors, we deal with a question of pure statutory construction. 
    And I should like to emphasize that, particularly in view of the question that I believe Mr. Justice Fortas asked of counsel for the petitioners yesterday. 
    Mr. Justice Fortas, as I recall asked counsel who was then discussing, I believe the constitutionality of this Section under the Thirteenth Amendment whether one could not presume that the respondents would take the position that this Section owe its constitution of validity to the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Thirteenth. 
    And as I recall, Counsel for the petitioners and I'm sure there was no intention or whatsoever on his part to put the respondent in an incorrect position or mislead the Court. 
    Counsel for the petitioners said, yes, he would presume that our position would be, that this Section owes its life, owes its constitutional life, you might say to the Fourteenth rather than the Thirteenth Amendment. 
    It seems therefore that the repetition on the emphasis with which I thought, I had made it clear in my brief that we were not concerned with the constitutionality of this Section. 
    That therefore it mattered not to us whether it should be regarded as rooted in the Thirteenth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, escaped the attention of counsel for the petitioners. 
    But, as Your Honors will recall in connection with another question counsel for the petitioners did say that we had conceded the constitutionality of this Civil Rights Act which is true. 
    And it's for that reason that in our brief, we open up by saying that one of the three questions which the petitioners present as questions presented in this case maybe eliminated. 
    And that question in the petitioner's brief was whether the -- whether Section 1982 is constitutional. 
    We are not questioning the constitutionality of that Section. 
    What are we questioning then? 
    We're questioning the meaning of that Section. 
    It is no matter of congressional power. 
    But at the end of the Thirteenth or the Fourteenth or any other provision of the constitution, it isn't a question of whether had Congress in 1866 passed an Act which was directed against individual conduct whether Congress thereby was exercising a valid power either under the Thirteenth or the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    That incidentally maybe a question that will be raised if Congress should pass a fair Housing Bill, of course, because under your customary fair housing bill, it's the individual owner or seller who is prohibited from discriminating of that may raise a question as to whether under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment the enabling Section or Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment. 
    Congress has the power to enact legislation of this kind. 
    That is not the question here. 
    So, I come to what I think is the crucial question. 
    With respect to this statute that has been made so mush of that the honorable Attorney General relied so heavily on yesterday. 
    This statute has some very simple words, I think. 
    It's a question what those words mean. 
    And if you kept down to what I think are the key words, what are they? 
    It says, “Every person shall have the same right to buy property as is enjoyed by white citizens”. 
    What does that mean? 
    What does the word “right” in that sentence mean? 
    Does it mean right in the sense of legal ability, legal competence to buy, own, and incidentally inherit? 
    That word is also used in the statute; property and self property. 
    Or does it mean something more than that? 
    Doesn't mean something that is not so much related to the status of the -- or the position of the buyer as it is to the seller, to the conduct of a seller, something that is not just a matter of right but of matter of duty, a duty imposed upon the seller.

    1982 Your Honor.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    1982?
speaker="israel_treiman" startTime="398.600" stopTime="1111.330">
    Mr. Israel Treiman 
    1982 which is the Section involved here or 1978 of the revised statutes. 
    That is a portion by the way, a portion of the original Civil Rights Act. 
    You'll find that portion in the first Section of the original Act which had a number of Sections in it. 
    Well now the petitioners in this case claimed that this Section is directed and was intended to be directed against the seller. 
    That it didn't simply mean right in the sense of right by law legal competence. 
    And in order to prove -- we of course take the position that this Section should be construed as being in confined to laws or official action of some kind which say that a Negro shall not have the same right as a white citizen. 
    And it was -- it cannot be and should not be construed as being aimed, that individual, the individual behavior of a seller. 
    Now in order to prove that its construction is correct, the petitioners and the writers of the NCADH brief, NCADH brief and that particularly the Government, I say particularly the Government for a reason which I'll mention shortly, insist on taking us back to the year 1866, to the early part of the year 1866, on the 39th Congress enacted this Section. 
    And I must say, Your Honors, that when I saw in the Government's brief, the historical materials, the -- not secondary but primary source materials on which apparently the Government claimed its construction would be justified. 
    I shuddered a little bit because it meant that I would have to indulge in some historical research. 
    And I do not profess to be expert in delving into historical materials but I felt that as a lawyer, and especially since the Government gave me the specific leads, it blueprinted these sources specifically the materials which it said would prove that that was the intention of Congress in 1866, and so I went to these sources. 
    Now, what were they? 
    Now, I'll make this as brief as possible. 
    The Government claims that if you consult the statements, the speeches made in Congress, the 39th Congress, the speeches of the sponsors of this Section -- of this Act of 1866, the speeches of the opponents of the Act, and one other statement, the statement of President Andrew Johnson, when he vetoed this bill, the reasons that he gave for vetoing the bill. 
    You will find says the Government that the bill must have been intended to be directed against individual action. 
    I must say since I mentioned President Johnson's veto message in order that the Court may follow me in connection with another matter which I shall presently mention, a very important matter which does involved a matter of comparing dates. 
    This Act of 1866 was first enacted on March 13, 1866. 
    President Johnson vetoed. 
    It was then reenacted over the President's veto on April 9, which is a date usually given as a date of enactment of this Act of 1866. 
    Now, I went into the statements, the speeches made in the congressional record. 
    The references are all given in the Government's brief. 
    It was not known by the way as a congressional record that -- yes, they seemed congressional globe. 
    And I took the statements of the chairman of the judiciary committee of the House of the Senate. 
    And I took the statements, the speeches; I read them all, of the sponsors of the bill, the people who supported the bills in both bodies of Congress. 
    I then went to the opponents of the bill and I got their statements. 
    And I have set forth in my brief, department passages from the statements of all of those Congressmen. 
    And then I went to President Johnson's veto message. 
    And I have set forth in my brief the pertinent passage from his message. 
    All of which I submit Your Honors overwhelmingly, convincingly, proved that the bill was never intended. 
    This Civil Rights Act of 1866 was never intended to be directed at anything but laws, legislation. 
    And then I went to the other sources, the second source that the Government set, the second document on which it said it would be -- could be shown that this bill was intended not to be directed against discriminatory laws but individual conduct and what was that? 
    Now, this is quite interesting. 
    The Government says that there are two documents, a Senate executive document and a House executive document, which will prove that in all of the Black codes that were enacted after the Civil War, some of them maybe before. 
    By the time Congress got to deliberating on this Act, all disqualification of Negroes to own property had been removed. 
    Now, this is quite a statement. 
    It's in the Government's brief. 
    I think it reads -- it appears that in none of the Black codes in the early part of 1966 was there any disqualification left to the Negro from owning property? 
    I then went to these two documents and what were they? 
    Both of these documents contained, each contains a report. 
    A report prepared by the then Secretary of State Mr. Stewart under the direction of President Johnson for submission to Congress. 
    So that Congress would know what was going on so far as discriminatory legislation was concerned, discriminatory as against the Negro of course. 
    And what does the report say? 
    I must say I was dismayed of what I found in the light of what the Government asserts. 
    I found that according to that report which incidentally Your Honors adheres where that date becomes important in connection with the date of the passage of this bill. 
    This report is dated May 22, 1966, which was after the originally enactment of the bill as well as its reenactment following President Johnson's veto. 
    It says that in all -- it let -- it reviews a number of the Southern States. 
    And it says that in all of those states with two exceptions, the disqualifications of the Negroes still remain. 
    It points it out very clearly and I will presently show how. 
    Apparently, what happened was and in each of these states, a state convention was called, as this is of course familiar Post Civil War history. 
    A state convention was called by the provincial Governor of the state appointed by President Johnson, Andrew Johnson. 
    The convention was called and of course it was completely dominated by the Northerners and their Southern sympathizers. 
    And so, there was no difficulty whatsoever in getting resolutions adopted that would be in line with Northern feelings. 
    In each of these states says this report, in each of these states, first, there was a resolution adopted, proclaiming that there would be no more slavery in that state. 
    Then it was followed in -- I think every case by another resolution. 
    And that second resolution called upon the chairman of the convention to appoint a committee or a commission that would come in with a set of recommended laws, revisions of the then existing state laws in order to bring the state laws into conformity with the Thirteenth Amendment, with the emancipation situation. 
    And what happened? 
    According to this report, most of these cases such a committee was appointed. 
    In several of the cases, several of the states, the committee actually went to work. 
    And there is set forth in the report a set of statutes in which, of course, all disqualification of the Negro was eliminated. 
    But this was a set of statutes which the committee, the commission, and the convention resolved, should be recommended for enactment by the local legislature. 
    Except in two cases, Texas and Georgia as of the date of this report, no such legislation has yet been enacted. 
    And interestingly enough, even in Texas and Georgia which had changed their laws and had removed disqualification. 
    When did that take place? 
    Not before this bill was passed. 
    In one case it took place several weeks but in both cases, it took place after the first enactment of the bill. 
    And in one case, it took place before its reenactment but certainly after the originally enactment of this bill. 
    For the Government therefore to say that when Congress was debating, considering this bill, there was no need to do anything about discriminatory laws from these black codes to me is astonishing. 
    It's contradicted by the evidence I submit. 
    And furthermore, Your Honors, if you want what I say in my brief, it's probably the best succinct piece of evidence on that point that you would want. 
    It's that of Justice Wayne who in that very year was deciding the case sitting as a Circuit Justice. 
    He was deciding the case of U.S. versus Rhodes. 
    And in the course of his opinion, he makes the statement, I quote it in my brief, that as soon as the Thirteenth Amendment was passed, there begun a course of legislative oppression, legislative oppression through this Black codes of course. 
    And that this statute obviously, I don't know whether to use the word “obviously or undoubtedly”, was enacted to curve that course of legislative oppression. 
    There you have the real purpose of the statute. 
    Law, discriminatory law is not an individual conduct. 
    Now, passing from the context, the setting in which the Act was enacted, I'm looking at what's happened to this Act. 
    After all it's over a hundred years, this Act has been existence. 
    The natural question is, why hasn't it been used before in a situation of this kind? 
    Why hasn't it used before in a situation where a discriminatory law was not involved but discriminatory conduct?

    It isn't only a matter of legal right of right by law. 
    It's a matter of whether you can get somebody else, an unwilling seller whether you can compel him to sell to you because he is willing to sell it to somebody else who is not a Negro.

    We do get into a realm here that to some extent may depend upon semantics upon the objective one has in mind in trying to interpret this Section. 
    I can only go by what the Congressman said back on those days by what President Johnson said in his veto message when he said that in his opinion this would change the laws of the states. 
    And he didn't want Congress to meddle with local laws. 
    And I would say the same thing same conclusion must be reached in reading Justice Wayne's opinion.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Even though the private owner has a piece of property as large as a city of the fourth class with everything else that the city of the fourth class has nearly because it is “private” is out from under the Fourteenth Amendment.
speaker="israel_treiman" startTime="1876.123" stopTime="1893.604">
    Mr. Israel Treiman 
    Mr. Justice Marshall, you are now reaching the point which I think some of your question yesterday was directed to and that involves the case Marsh versus Alabama. 
    And I am most anxious to discuss that case. 
    I had deferred it because as I've said earlier, I want to deal with these questions under two categories and your question, I --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1893.604" stopTime="1895.575">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, whenever you're ready I'll be here.
speaker="israel_treiman" startTime="1895.575" stopTime="2101.643">
    Mr. Israel Treiman 
    No, I'll -- no, I -- I think I would just assume Mr. Justice Marshall since you are interested in that point and it's a tremendously important point and I must say when I read Marsh versus Alabama for the first time in connection with this case, I said well, this is on all fours, how can we get around that case? 
    Here is a big community, not in -- not a city, a company owned town. 
    And here was the United States Supreme Court Holding that the fact that it was all privately owned didn't settle the question. 
    I think that was the expression used by Mr. Justice Black in his opinion in that case. 
    Property rights do not settle the question. 
    Now what happened in that case? 
    It was a Jehovah's Witness by a name of Marsh who came under this company owned town, I think it was suburb of Mobile, Alabama and the -- want to distribute some religious literature. 
    And the company representatives told her, there was a regulation against it, warned her to -- not to do so. 
    Despite the warning, she continued to sell the literature. 
    She was arrested on a charged of violating the local in effect trespass statute. 
    She was convicted. 
    She took an appeal to this Court. 
    This Court held that she was protected by the constitutional provision. 
    This happened to be the First Amendment, but the same point of course would apply that was within constitutional prohibition. 
    And you might say therefore, “Well, doesn't this control this case?” 
    Not one bit for this reason. 
    And I think as I pointed out in my brief, the best way to meet that case is to consider a similar case that arose two years later, the Watchtower case also involving Jehovah's Witnesses. 
    Now what was the Watchtower? 
    It rose in New York. 
    It came however as I should presently point out to the Supreme Court on request for certiorari. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall since you are interested in size, I should like to describe this residential community. 
    It was involved in a Watchtower Case. 
    It was called Parkchester. 
    And it is described this way. 
    Parkchester is a residential community which is said to be the largest of its kind in the world covering 129 acres and housing 12,000 family units made up of some 35,000 people in 171 adjoining in interrelated apartment building. 
    And then he was on to say that it has streets, and shops, and it's a regular community, but all privately owned. 
    And the Jehovah's Witnesses came there, entered one of these apartment buildings and then in the hallways tried to distribute that literature. 
    Their attention was called to the fact that there was a regulation there by the landlord, the owner of this community. 
    No distribution of literature in the hallways of any department. 
    Where they're apparently relying on Marsh versus Alabama refused to abide instead of getting themselves arrested as I recall they challenged the validity of that regulation in the New York Courts, the New York Court of Appeals --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I do see a difference between an apartment house and this --

    The difference I think Mr. Justice Marshall is this. 
    What part of this subdivision that we're talking about? 
    If you're talking about the lot in the home that the Jones' here wanted to buy that in a language of Mr. Justice Black in Marsh versus Alabama was never intended to be open for general public used.

    This is --

    No, not necessarily, they have this wooden horse that at one end they close him up at one end, I'm sure the same is true, all of the county in order to keep him from becoming appropriated by the public and keep it private. 
    All that privacy means really in those cases is -- a subdivision has to maintain them.

    I think under the existing state of the law, in the absence of legislation pursuant to either as I say to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment or Section 2 of the Thirteenth, I don't know of any law at the present time that gives to the buyer the right to buy something from somebody who is unwilling to sell it to him under our existing law.

    Your Honor, it could of course. 
    And this is what shocked me a little bit yesterday when a question was asked to the Honorable Attorney General about Mr. Justice White I think. 
    I think Mr. Justice White asked the Attorney General, “Well, wouldn't our decision then make unnecessary a fair housing law?” 
    And the Honorable Attorney General said, “No”, he didn't think so because this decision would be broader than a fair housing law order. 
    To me, the whole is greater than of -- any of its parts. 
    If you go (Inaudible) as you might say why would you need? 
    Why would you need a narrower type of legislation? 
    It would -- would it not then -- and this -- since I started to say is what disturbs me a great deal. 
    And I hope this Court will also bear this in mind. 
    I was very much impressed yesterday by a reference of Mr. Justice Fortas made to align from Oscar Wilde.

    Now if Congress does implement the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by passing some appropriate legislation such as the housing law, then perhaps, we have a serious constitutional question. 
    I don't know. 
    I would think in view of some of the recent opinions of this Court that such legislation probably would be upheld.

    Because there was clearly -- according to the Court, state action involved to the extent of the property that had been opened up for public use. 
    This was the theory at Marsh.

    And it points out in its opinion --

    That we we're holding anything except the Fourteenth Amendment didn't forbid it because there was state action. 
    But we held was that there were state action. 
    It was a town treated by the state as to any other city in the state and with the streets open and everything else. 
    But we did not say that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed these people to have that right under any in all circumstances. 
    It's a private ownership.

    Mr. Israel Treiman 
    Right. 
    And as a matter of fact, the New York Court of Appeals points that out immediately. 
    It says Marsh's activities all took place on a sidewalk in Chickasaw Alabama, a company town. 
    Then it goes on a point out, made it plain that a municipal corporation cannot ban the distribution of literature on its streets, sidewalks and public places so as public areas. 
    And that is why I thought Mr. Justice Black, you kept saying in your opinion. 
    I don't -- whether you repeated it but I know your famous language which has been quoted very often, that private property does become circumscribed by constitutional and other legal rights the moment it has been opened up for general use.

    I don't know.

    Even the Government admits that that Section does not apply because it clearly says under color of law and it's a very distinction that Mr. Justice Fortas made in the Price case. 
    Section 1943 is like Section 242, which Mr. Justice Fortas so enlighteningly I thought, (Voice Overlap) --

    I suppose that this subdivision even if it wasn't so much so organized and so operated as to represent the state within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment in Marsh. 
    Even if it weren't that, I suppose that you -- it would be possible to find the color of a state statute for purposes of 1983 just because if the authority in the statutes to organize this town, or to organize this --

    That also is -- I think this particular subdivision is beyond the limits reached by the Saint Louis Metropolitan Sewer Agency. 
    And so it is, I think, handled by a private sewer agency. 
    And the subdevelop -- the subdivision developer has to build a trunk line to some sort of a treatment plant that is maintained by that sewer agency. 
    And I think they can use some facilities of that sewer agency.

    (Voice Overlap) just walk in under the general jurisdictional --
speaker="samuel_h_liberman" startTime="3242.102" stopTime="3299.735">
    Mr. Samuel H. Liberman 
    I have three answers. 
    And the first is that, I think that 1983 could cover under any customer usage of the state. 
    I think perhaps a better statute would be Section 1988 which is derived from Section 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and specifically says that civil actions may get the remedy from the state common law as modified by statutes. 
    Thirdly, I would say that regardless that there was any statute that Congress did not intend to create a right without a remedy in this situation. 
    That this legislation was a result going back to the civil war perhaps at that time the bloodiest war ever fought in the history of mankind. 
    And following the Thirteenth Amendment, (Inaudible) was enacted once, passed over the veto of President Johnson and then enacted the third time in 1870. 
    And I think it's difficult to argue that Congress contended to merely create hollow words --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3299.735" stopTime="3305.912">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what do you do, you come in and you just simply alleged jurisdiction and say this was within the equitable jurisdiction of the Court?

    Mr. Samuel H. Liberman

    Mr. Samuel H. Liberman 
    Yes, I really -- I wouldn't see what -- if any harder than somebody makes an illegal left turn and smacks in to me. 
    I can file a suit and say it was negligent of him to make that left turn and get a judicial remedy even though the (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3326.231" stopTime="3328.224">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it may not be quite that simple but --
speaker="samuel_h_liberman" startTime="3328.224" stopTime="3503.228">
    Mr. Samuel H. Liberman 
    Well, but in addition, I do think that there is a statutory authority for a civil remedy in the Court in this type of case. 
    As to the interpretation of the statute, I wanted to go back briefly to the passages quoted from Mr. Treiman's brief. 
    On page 15, you'll note that the quotation, the first both to laws barbaric and treatment inhumane are the words meted out by our white enemies to our colored friends, obviously referring to both state law and private action. 
    Across the page on page 14, I think the quote is obviously referring in Section 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which is limited, done or a color of state law. 
    But that limitation -- the Congress knew how to make and made it in much legislation and left it out in the Section 1 and Section 3. 
    So, that I think you can fairly interpret their intention as living it out intentionally when they didn't mean for it to be there. 
    This legislation unlike the prior Freedmen's Bureau Bill applied to all states not just to the states which had been in rebellion. 
    And I think that it was aimed at the results and the holding of this Court in Scott versus Sanford. 
    To some extent, it was not just to wipe out inimical state laws. 
    It was to grant the rights to which people were entitled regardless of whether the particular state they were in had a law that would've limited that right or not as applied everywhere. 
    So that -- so our contention that the law -- we don't argue that it would overwrite any state law to the contrary because it says right at the end, any law statute ordinance regulation accustomed to the contrary not withstanding. 
    But we think it had a broader purpose as well. 
    If it were only attempting to remove a certain disqualifications, I think this would've been accomplished by the constitutional amendments anyway. 
    But it also would've been accomplished by the other parts of Section 1 of that Act, which gave all persons the equal right to make enforced contracts, to sue and be parties, give evidence in Court. 
    And to the same -- fall on equal benefit of all laws and proceedings by the security of persons and properties. 
    So, I think that language alone would've remove any disqualification whether by state law or otherwise and that when they go on to say, shall have the same right to inherit, and to purchase and to lease. 
    That they meant that he would have the substantive right, the same right as is enjoyed by all other citizens. 
    And if this was the interpretation which Congress had and which is the only fair interpretation on the basis of the language of the statute.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3503.228" stopTime="3506.606">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
