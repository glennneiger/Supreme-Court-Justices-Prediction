    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No. 701, In The Matter of Buddy Lynn Whittington, Petitioner. 
    Mr. Supman.
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="37.019" stopTime="389.336">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Juvenile Court of Fairfield County, Ohio, finding the petitioner to be a delinquent child. 
    I will describe pertinent facts and my co-counsel, Mr. Rezneck, will present the legal arguments. 
    Petitioner, Buddy Lynn Whittington, was charged with juvenile delinquency on the basis of a single act, the murder of a neighbor and family friend, 63-year-old Mrs. Gladys Willard on July 29, 1966 in the small village in Baltimore, Ohio in violation of the Second Degree Murder Statute of Ohio. 
    He was one week past his 14th birthday when the case arose. 
    This boy has consistently denied this crime. 
    He had never been in trouble with the law. 
    The District Court of Appeals found that there was an abundance of evidence as to Buddy Lynn Whittington's good character and reputation prior to July 29. 
    He was regular in attendance at school, church, Sunday school, and youth groups. 
    He had been obedient at home and at school, and subjected himself to the reasonable control of both his parents and teachers. 
    Mrs. Willard was reported missing on July 29th. 
    Many persons in the village, including the petitioner, engaged in a search for her lasting many hours. 
    Her body was discovered that evening by the petitioner and his father under the bed in petitioner's bedroom. 
    He was interrogated that night by the principal of law enforcement officials of the village and county, including the juvenile probation officer. 
    The defendant was interrogated in his home, which was under the exclusive control of the law enforcement officials from approximately 8:20 p.m. at home. 
    Although the total duration of the questioning is not established precisely by the record, probation officer Rutherford was specifically called after 10 p.m. to participate in an interrogation of this boy. 
    Buddy was given no warning as to his right to remain silent or to have the advice of an attorney. 
    While denying the crime, certain of his statements under the interrogation were used against him by the state in his trial to try to support his guilt. 
    He was formally arrested under a Juvenile Court warrant issued on the basis of a complaint charging him with being a delinquent. 
    The Juvenile Court judge issued this warrant after consulting with the Juvenile Court probation officer about the case. 
    The probation officer who is appointed by the Juvenile Court judge and works under the direction of the judge had interrogated the petitioner on the night of the crime, had accused petitioner of committing it, had participated with the prosecuting attorney and the police chief in the decision to bring the charge, executed the arrest warrant, and appeared as a witness against the petitioner at the trial. 
    There is no doubt from the record that prior to the filing of the complaint and the issuance of the arrest warrant, probation officer Rutherford consulted ex parte with Judge Hastings about the case. 
    On a motion to dismiss because of the fact that the judge had discussed the case with Rutherford, the Court called Rutherford as a witness and Rutherford said he had reported on his investigation to the judge. 
    The judge himself not only did not explain or testify as to the extent of the consultations but foreclosed further inquiry by us into what Rutherford reported about the case prior to the filing of the complaint and subsequently. 
    After the arrest, petitioner was put into solitary confinement in a cell in the Fairfield County Jail at adult penal institution. 
    Fairfield County does not have a juvenile detention facility. 
    The small cage-like cell had no light bulb and it merely contained a bed and a toilet. 
    Everyone agreed, including the judge that this jail was not a proper place of confinement for a juvenile, but the state took the position that it was the only place they had. 
    Mr. Kistler and I as his attorneys tried on several occasions by several motions to have him released on bond or in his parents' custody, or at least transferred to a detention home in an adjoining county pending the trial.

    Has the grand jury taken any action?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="407.524" stopTime="458.206">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Yes, sir. 
    After the adjudication of the delinquency and the judgement of delinquency, and after we filed our appeals in the Court of Appeals and the State Supreme Court and after we filed our petition for certiorari, we attempted to obtain a stay of proceedings until this Court would have an opportunity to see if it would take the case. 
    Not having received it, the case then was remanded by the State Supreme Court down to the Juvenile Court, and it then did not retain the jurisdiction but bound him over to the grand jury which indicted him for murder. 
    This time first degree and the case is being held up subject to further order of this Court.

    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Yes, sir. 
    Subject only to however that in order for the first degree murder or the indictment to stand, there must be adjudication and a file of judgment of delinquency. 
    And of course, Mr. Rezneck will explain why we're asking to have this judgment set aside. 
    And if it is, then this other indictment cannot stand because it is an absolute prerequisite in Ohio that for there to be a binding over and an indictment that there must be a valid judgment of delinquency.

    But what is the jail? 
    Is it one where they house adult prisoners or is it a special kind of --

    Mr. Jack Supman 
    No sir, it was the same jail that he was returned to. 
    And after being there for 78 days, the Court of Appeals found this was an improper place. 
    But after -- and then, he was removed to the detention home in Columbus that we've been asking for previously. 
    Then after he was bound over, they've brought him back from the -- from the detention home and putting back in the same jail at solitary confinement. 
    However, in the last two or three months, the old jail which we maintained was in the records we show was improper has been torn down and there, he is in a -- again, in adult jail in Fairfield County but it's a newer jail, it's a different jail.

    What was that order?

    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Well, there were only two things the Court could have done. 
    They could have retained jurisdiction and for which he would have been subjected to imprisonment until he was 21 or within the sole discretion of the Juvenile Court, and this they did exercise. 
    They bound him over to the grand jury. 
    Does that answer your question, sir?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="654.249" stopTime="662.605">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Before that time, before the grand jury proceeding, what did the Juvenile Court -- what was the --

    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Disposition?

    -- disposition?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="665.235" stopTime="670.018">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    He did not retain the jurisdiction but then he bound him over to the grand jury. 
    Now, this was --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    When was that? 
    What date was that?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="673.776" stopTime="691.095">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    This does not appear in the record because we appealed from the determination of delinquency, from the judgment of delinquency for the sole act of having committed this murder, we appealed --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="691.095" stopTime="700.581">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But I thought the Court ordered him to report to some diagnostic facility and it was while that order was in effect that you appealed, is that right?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="700.581" stopTime="716.221">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    We appealed immediately from the finding or from the judgment of the delinquency. 
    And then the Court stated that he would be turned over to the Juvenile Center for examination, which the statute calls for in Ohio.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="716.221" stopTime="734.248">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What I want to know is for how long was he in that State and subject to that order before the grand jury indictments? 
    How long was this boy incarcerated prior to the time --
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="734.248" stopTime="734.874">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    The binding over?

    By the binding --

    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Over a year, sir, until the Supreme Court -- until -- they did not take him for custody --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="744.872" stopTime="761.266">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- over a year. 
    Now, at that time, there was no order of disposition directed to this boy by the Juvenile Court, except an order saying that he should go to the diagnostic center, is that right?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="761.266" stopTime="771.223">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Yes, sir. 
    He was at the diagnostic center for about six weeks, then he was returned to the same adult jail pending these appeals that we have had in the various Courts.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="771.223" stopTime="789.944">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And under what order of the Juvenile Court was he held after he was returned by the diagnostic center. 
    That's what I want to know because as I read this record, the only thing that happened here was that the Juvenile Court entered an order saying the boy was a delinquent, correct?

    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Yes, sir.

    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Yes, sir.

    Mr. Jack Supman 
    The Juvenile Court in this case as the record will show upon his being arrested, they retained jurisdiction and they kept him incarcerated, although we filed many, many motions asking for his release. 
    And we filed --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Where do we find the only order under which this boy was held in jail between the time that he got back from the mental observation period and the time he was indicted? 
    Now, where in the record or in the briefs do we find the order under which he was held?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="868.350" stopTime="871.856">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    We asked for a transcript of the entire proceedings --

    Mr. Jack Supman 
    At page 54 and there's no subsequent order which was filed on September 7th. 
    The cause has continued pending the investigation which Justice Fortas had referred to. 
    There's no subsequent order except that he is in jail, and I'm sure that there's no question as far as the prosecution is concerned.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="902.359" stopTime="914.449">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the state takes the position that in these circumstances, in these procedural circumstances, the boy was not entitled to bail, am I correct in that understanding?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="914.449" stopTime="942.867">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Yes, sir. 
    They maintained that even though he would -- if he had been 18 years old instead of 14, this is not a capital offense. 
    This would be second degree murder and if he had been 18, he would have been automatically entitled to bail. 
    But because he was under the age of 18 that it was completely discretionary with the judge. 
    He did not see fit to exercise it, and Mr. Rezneck again will go into the legal arguments as we have presented in our briefs.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="942.867" stopTime="948.645">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I misunderstood you there. 
    I thought it never dawned over to the grand jury on the charge of first degree murder.
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="948.645" stopTime="958.749">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    After he had been incarcerated for about 15 months without bond or bail when it was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court, all during that time --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="958.749" stopTime="962.716">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    First degree murder is not bailable, is it?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="962.716" stopTime="994.709">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Not as of right, no sir, but about the first 14 or 15 months, we were trying to get him out and we had a hearing, there were 10 witnesses. 
    There was no evidence to the contrary. 
    Without contradiction, these 10 witnesses consisting of the neighbors, the preacher, the superintendent of the Sunday school all stated that there was no fear, there was no danger in his being released. 
    And without any evidence to the contrary, the judge without any specific finding as to the reason for not putting him out on bail --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="994.709" stopTime="998.516">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    When do you say this was second degree, this would have been second degree murder?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="998.516" stopTime="1015.656">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    The statute specifically says in violation – as if he had -- that he is alleged to have been delinquent in that he committed the defensive murder which is in violation of the second degree murder statute. 
    It's very specific in the briefs and the complaints and there's no question about that.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1015.656" stopTime="1018.564">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's because he was a juvenile?

    Mr. Jack Supman

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Why? 
    If he was an adult, if this crime had been committed by an adult, why would that have been second degree murder?
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="1030.530" stopTime="1038.252">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Because it was not premeditated and I think that's our distinction in Ohio between premeditated -- between first and second.

    The real matter of fact in (voice overlap)
speaker="jack_supman" startTime="1129.689" stopTime="1232.240">
    Mr. Jack Supman 
    Excuse me sir, with the finding of the Court that appears in the record that the Court in effect stated that at the conclusion of the evidence, we move to dismiss this case because there was no evidence. 
    And the Court stated in the record that it finds probable cause to believe that the defendant may have committed this act. 
    And then, the Court in its entry of judgment found him to be a delinquent, it did not say murder, but the charge -- originally charged which appears states specifically that he is charged with having many delinquent and that he did kill Gladys Willard. 
    Prior to the trial, we made various motions on various constitutional grounds and these all will appear in the record. 
    So these were all overruled. 
    The case proceeded to trial. 
    At the conclusion of the case, even though the motion to dismiss was overruled, the Court of Appeals in their finding, they applied the civil standard of preponderance of the evidence. 
    They stated the evidence contained in the record fails to disclose any thorough investigation by officials toward eliminating the possibility that Mrs. Gladys Willard may have been killed by some other person.

    In answer to the question that's been raised here with respect to the specific charge against this boy, I would like to direct the Court's attention to page 12 of the record which contains the complaint that was filed in the Juvenile Court and it alleges that he is a delinquent child and that he unlawfully killed Mrs. Willard in violation of Section 2901.05 of the Code of Ohio, which is the Ohio Second Degree Murder Statute.

    Well, we think that you do have a final judgment here under the test that this Court has laid down for finality that the juvenile proceeding and the adult criminal preceding are separate proceedings under the law of Ohio. 
    That you had a juvenile delinquency proceeding which was a trial on the merits of the delinquency charge and it has resulted in a final judgment adjudicating the boy to be a delinquent.

    Under the Ohio statute, there is no criminal jurisdiction until there has been a valid certification of the boy by the Juvenile Court. 
    In other words, the Juvenile Court has exclusive criminal jurisdiction until it makes a transfer to the adult Court. 
    And we believe that if the judgment of delinquency, which is a prerequisite under Ohio law to a valid transfer falls that the indictment falls with it and it will be subject to a motion to dismiss in the Court of Common Pleas.

    The problem is the worrying I think of the Ohio statute, isn't it? 
    The 2151.26 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
    I'll read it all, that any case involving a delinquent child in the -- and in certain circumstances that gives the Juvenile Court the power to bind them over for trial on adult Court or to treat him as a juvenile. 
    But some of the juvenile judges in Ohio think that they are required to make a finding of delinquency before they can bind them over to the grand jury. 
    And in other counties, they don't feel obliged to make a finding of delinquency before they can bind them over to grand jury that Juvenile Court did. 
    And he made a finding of delinquency, and then he bound him over to the grand jury on the charge of first degree murder, is that right?

    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    The National Council so states, Your Honor. 
    But we think that statute is clear that he must be adjudicated a delinquent and that certification or binding over is simply another form of disposition, which is available to the Juvenile Court judge. 
    Once he's made a finding of delinquency so that this was in substance and to all intents and purposes a delinquency proceeding, which could have resulted in a variety of possible orders, among them certification, but there can be no question as to the finality of the judgment which was entered. 
    It had the immediate effect of adjudicating this boy a juvenile delinquent with all the attendant's stigma and it labeled him a murderer, had found that he had committed the crime of murder. 
    Will you call it delinquency or anything else?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1567.581" stopTime="1576.544">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, he hasn't been tried on the crime of murder yet.

    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    As an adult, he has not been found to be guilty of the crime of murder.

    -- to be a delinquent by reason of having committed the act of murder. 
    So to all intents and purposes, he has been labeled with the stigma of a murderer. 
    We would point out that the certification of whatever happens to him now isn't going to undo that. 
    You have a separate proceeding here; a juvenile proceeding which has resulted in a final judgment of delinquency. 
    And whatever happens to him in the subsequent adult proceeding, you were still going to have this judgment of delinquency. You had incarceration pursuant to the judgment which lasted for a substantial period of time before the binding over took place. 
    So that there can be no doubt that this judgment acted coercively on this boy, not the parents.

    Yes it does, Your Honor. 
    I cannot say any authority to you one way or another on that proposition, but I think that the statute is clear here. 
    That the whole framework requires that the adult Court receives jurisdiction only when the Juvenile Court has validly adjudicated someone as delinquent, and has validly transferred the case so as to enable the adult Court to act.

    Yes, on a double jeopardy basis perhaps, Your Honor. 
    This is an argument that we have raised in the motion to dismiss in the Court of Common Pleas because you have a state system here that seems to operate by adjudicating someone a delinquent after a trial, that provides for subsequent trial as an adult.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Rezneck, when was the transfer from juvenile to adult Court made in connection with the proceedings before this Court? 
    Was the transfer made before the petition for certiorari was filed here?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="1837.948" stopTime="1917.581">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    I believe that it was, Your Honor. 
    I believe that after the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed the appeal for one of a substantial question, substantial constitutional question that during that interim period before relief was sought in this Court that the Juvenile Court exercised authority to bind this boy over. 
    There was no stay at that point. 
    There had been a stay at Juvenile Court proceedings up until the Supreme Court of Ohio acted in it. 
    It was during that interim period that these further proceedings were able to take place. 
    We of course do take the position and we think it's clear on the record below that what you had here was a delinquency trial on the merits. 
    What took place here was agreed by everyone -- the lawyers, the judges, the reviewing Courts, everyone up to this point via delinquency trial on the merits. 
    It was not in the nature of a binding over proceeding or a preliminary hearing and this again was in accord with our view of the clear and unambiguous language of the Ohio statute as requiring an adjudication of delinquency after a trial on the merits before any further dispositional order can be entered. 
    And I would therefore like to address myself to the procedural issues than which we contend to arise with respect to a Court's power to adjudicate someone, a delinquent face on a charge of a law violation.

    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Yes, yes we do, Your Honor. 
    This has been held to be a final unappealable judgment by the State Courts of Ohio. 
    And furthermore, the consequences that attach to the judgment of delinquency under the law of the state meet to test for finality which this Court has laid down in determining its own jurisdiction under the jurisdictional statute. 
    In other words, you had immediate and enormous consequences on this boy from the delinquency adjudication itself, namely an order of commitment and the delinquency adjudication, which banned --

speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="2037.044" stopTime="2052.042">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Only until the Ohio Supreme Court acted. 
    The Juvenile Court proceedings were stayed but after the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, at that point, there was no further stay against Juvenile Court proceedings. 
    And it was thereafter that the transfer and the binding over ensued.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2052.042" stopTime="2076.940">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the question really in my mind, one of the many procedural questions here to my mind is whether the Juvenile Court intended initially that this finding of delinquency to be the prelude to a transfer to the adult Court. 
    I suppose there's nothing from which we can get any light on that is there?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="2076.940" stopTime="2117.552">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Well, the record is certainly ambiguous about that and due to the fact that the Juvenile Court in effect made conflicting statements on the point. 
    But we don't think that the subjective intent of the Juvenile Court, whatever that may have been, would be relevant because the point is, that this was a delinquency trial. 
    It was treated as a delinquency trial by everyone involved. 
    It resulted as it must in the Ohio Law in our view in a judgment of delinquency. 
    And therefore, for review purposes, it should be treated just as if he had made some other order of disposition such as sending the boy to the industrial school until he was 21, or entering a temporary order of commitment, which can be indefinitely renewed until 21, which is another power of the Court. 
    In other words, the Juvenile Court has a whole panoply of disposition orders.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2117.552" stopTime="2128.863">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, maybe. 
    But on the other hand, maybe somewhat like the verdict of guilty and no sentence being imposed. 
    And I'm considering a case at that juncture you see.
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="2128.863" stopTime="2166.596">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Well, we think that the adult criminal cases that are dealt with sentencing are distinguishable for several reasons. 
    One being that, it's simply as a matter of form, you don't have a judgment in a criminal case until you have the sentence entered and here we do have what is called the judgment which was reviewed as a judgment and healthier judgment by the Ohio Court of Appeals. 
    Furthermore, you have a difference in the way juvenile and adult Courts operate in the sense that a Juvenile Court, once it adjudicates someone a delinquent, it has a continuing supervisory jurisdiction over a juvenile and can make dispositional orders of a temporary nature and it may modify them from time to time. 
    In other words, it has a kind of continuing authority that an adult criminal Court does not have.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2166.596" stopTime="2204.161">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Rezneck, why is it the final order -- why do you say their final order is the delinquency finding? 
    You don't need to rest on that. 
    Why is the final order, the order of binding him over? 
    Once that's done, once that order is entered, the Juvenile Court loses its jurisdiction -- that's a disposition. 
    That is one of the dispositions possible in the Juvenile Court. 
    Are you suggesting that there's any problem with our reviewing? 
    It may be reviewing an order of a Juvenile Court binding over to the adult Court?

    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    That is true. 
    The questions, the constitutional issues raised would be precisely the same in our view. 
    And we think furthermore that there is an advantage, a distinct advantage from the standpoint of judicial administration. 
    In reviewing the case at this point because as this Court will recall in Kent versus United States, where you did not have a review of the transfer letter until after the adult criminal trial had taken place.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume that the standard in Ohio for binding over from the Juvenile Court to the Adult Court was -- it's certain that he's alleged to have committed a certain kind of crime and there's probable cause to believe that he committed it. 
    And orally in his oral announcement, it sounded like that's the way the judge was going in this case.

    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Well, I want to say Your Honor it isn't just my reading of it. 
    It's the reading of the Ohio Court of Appeals in this very case, which said this boy is alleged to be a juvenile delinquent. 
    This is an appeal from a judgment of juvenile delinquency. 
    We uphold it under preponderance of the evidence test. 
    We reject other constitutional claims because this is in the nature of a juvenile delinquency proceeding --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- I know, but if all that had to happen -- if the order in the review is the turnover order and if all that had to happen under the Ohio statutes was X but they happen to do X plus Y, and did X plus Y wrongly but did X correctly, I'm not so sure we should reverse the order.
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="2486.479" stopTime="2498.521">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Well, I think we should still have notice that they were proposing to do X. 
    And what we had noticed was -- what we had notice of it was this was a delinquency trial on the merits.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2498.521" stopTime="2505.297">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is there some certification procedure in the Ohio statutes from this Court to the Ohio Courts?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="2505.297" stopTime="2631.350">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    To get a ruling on -- from the state Court on the matter of state law, I'm not aware that there is a statute of Ohio that enables you to do that. 
    But again, we do submit that this particular question is really foreclosed by the decision of the Ohio Court in this very case, holding that this is a final judgment of delinquency. 
    I don't have very much time left to argue the merits here, but I would like to indicate what our views are on the assumption which we think is undeniable on the record and under the statutory framework here, that this was a trial of delinquency, no different from any other trial on the merits of a charge of delinquency. 
    And here, we would submit to the Court that first, this was a proceeding in which the charge of delinquency was based solely upon the violation of a state criminal statute and a serious state criminal statute at that of murder. 
    This was not a case in the Court below so held in which an adjudication of delinquency could have been upheld on any other ground. 
    And this was a proceeding which as I've already outlined carried various serious consequences for the juvenile, a possibility of seven years incarceration in a state institution, the stigma of being labeled a murderer and a juvenile delinquent, and the possibility of certification as an adult, which in fact came to pass here. 
    And we would submit that if you look at what happened below that you will see that this was a Court which although it purported to be a Juvenile Court was functioning with all the harshness and all the stringency of a criminal Court. 
    That this is a Court for example which has the power to commit juvenile delinquents in certain instances directly to the state reformatory, which is an adult penal institution. 
    And the whole pattern of the proceeding below is like a criminal trial that charge arraignment of plea, and a trial there is absolutely no indication on this record, that the Juvenile Court here was functioning as Juvenile Courts under their theory are intended to function, namely with therapeutic concern for the individual, with a view to his treatability, to his possible rehabilitation. 
    In other words, this Court acted upon this boy with all the harshness that a criminal Court would have acted but without some of the most important safeguards that any criminal defendant would have had, and --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2631.350" stopTime="2647.642">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, actually, that's kind of a modest statement, isn't it? 
    If I correctly understand your argument, that is to say that an adult -- it is argued and it's submitted here that an adult would have been entitled to bail and that was denied to this boy, is that right?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="2647.642" stopTime="2648.591">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2648.591" stopTime="2670.691">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if you regard this as a preliminary hearing prior to grand jury proceedings, for some reason there may have been the fault of the various stays that were obtained that this boy was incarcerated for 15 months before the matter was in and submitted on the grand jury, maybe 12 months, whatever it was, is that right?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="2670.691" stopTime="2674.876">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Yes. 
    He still should have had bail during that period. 
    He would be entitled to it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2674.876" stopTime="2679.359">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the finding here was the finding of probable cause, is that right?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="2679.359" stopTime="2696.226">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Well, I would hesitate to call that a finding, Your Honor. 
    The original statement by the Juvenile Court judge which is indicative of the standard of proof he was applying was probable cause, but his finding is one of delinquency. 
    And the case was reviewed by the Court of Appeals on the basis that this was a finding in a judgment of delinquency applying civil standard.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2696.226" stopTime="2705.355">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The judging of delinquency based upon a recital that there's probable cause to believe that the boy was delinquent, is that correctly recalled?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="2705.355" stopTime="2788.879">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    That's not in the journal entry. 
    The journal entry simply recites that the Court finds him a delinquent. 
    The probable cause language came at the conclusion of the adjudicative hearing, and it was adverted to by the trial judge at that point. 
    But the journal entry when it actually came out and that is the judgment, stated that the Court finds him to be a delinquent and the Court of Appeals below reviewed it specifically on that basis that you had a judgment of delinquency and they upheld it on the civil standard. 
    We would point out that if this boy had been one week over 18 instead of one week over 14 at the time when this case arose, he would have had the rights if he had been charged with the same offense, second degree murder, to a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, to an impartial triar of fact, including trial by jury if he desired it to the protections of Miranda versus Arizona, to right to bail in advance of trial, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. 
    But because he was a juvenile and he was charged with what the state chose to label juvenile delinquency in the Juvenile Court, he received none of these protections which have been deemed fundamental for persons accused of criminal offenses. 
    And we submit that as this Court made very clear in Gault Case, when you have that kind of gap between the procedures, particularly procedures which go to the reliability of the fact finding process, that wide a gap between juvenile and adult proceedings that requires more than mere verbiage to bridge the gap.

    They can come back to the Juvenile Court if they think he's rehabilitated for example and asked that he be released. 
    There are other types of temporary commitment orders which could be entered under the Ohio statute. 
    To address myself to the point Justice Brennan just raised -- well, I see that my time's up, but seven years incarceration on unfair fact finding procedures, it seems that would be a clear denial of due process even though he might have received a more substantial sentence as an adult. 
    We have raised here the -- as our first question for review by this Court, the standard of proof in juvenile delinquency proceedings, which we think clearly does raise an issue of constitutional magnitude because it goes to the very reliability of the guilt determining process to the prerequisite on which any further action rest, mainly an adjudication that the boy has committed the act charged and is in fact in law a delinquent. 
    And we maintain that the standard which was applied below both in the Juvenile Court and by the reviewing Court is unconstitutional, and attested by a proper permissible constitutional standard that this judgment of delinquency cannot stand. 
    We submit that the civil standard is not a tolerable constitutional standard where personal interests involve a possible loss of liberty and reputation are involved as they were in this case.

    The particular basis for the delinquency adjudication there was an act which would be criminal and it is argued that we're dealing with a law violation case in that sense. 
    An act which would be criminal and commitment by an adult, that is entirely appropriate to look to the safeguards for persons accused of crime in determining the constitutional procedures in the juvenile Courts. 
    I think when you get to this area of conduct which is unlawful only for juveniles such as truancy or incorrigibility. 
    You earn something of a gray area there.

    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I'm the prosecuting attorney of Fairfield County, Ohio and such represent the county and the state in this matter. 
    First, I would like to elaborate little on the facts of this case as I believe them to be. 
    It was on the 29th of July of 1966 that Gladys Willard disappeared. 
    She was, I think, 63 years of age at that time. 
    She was last seen at eight o'clock in the morning by the petitioner here, Buddy Lynn Whittington. 
    And from that time on, we have not been able to find anyone who saw Gladys Willard alive after that time. 
    At approximately sometime between 7:30 and 8:30 of that evening, she was found dead in the Whittington home under the bed of Buddy Lynn Whittington in his room. 
    And she was under that part of the bed which was nearest a window and away from the door. 
    Now, this was a small room and there was not much space between the head of the bed and the foot of the bed.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Who found her, Mr. Morehart?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="3276.690" stopTime="3324.932">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    Mr. Whittington, the father of the defendant. 
    That's true. 
    His son was with him at that time in the house. 
    He went in the house to look under the beds for her. 
    He had made a search of the house before and now he went back to look under the beds for this woman and he found her under the bed of the defendant Buddy Lynn Whittington. 
    She was lying on her back under the bed. 
    Her dress was pulled up around her waist and her pantie was pulled down part way over her body. 
    Her teeth -- her false teeth was lying beside her and her eyeglasses was lying beside of her. 
    Her hairnet was lying beside of her and her shoes were off. 
    The coroner --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3324.932" stopTime="3326.072">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What was the cause of death?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="3326.072" stopTime="3584.690">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    The cause of death was due to asphyxiation from strangulation. 
    And in addition to that, she suffered, I think, four or five broken ribs. 
    She had hematoma of the scalp indicating that she had been hit over the head, and the coroner estimated later that she had been dead approximately 12 hours. 
    He also said that she had been in this position for a length of time due to the livor mortis of the body that was apparent then. 
    An autopsy was made of this woman, and they gave us the cause of death as I have previously stated here. 
    In addition to that, the contents of her stomach revealed, according to the pathologist who performed the autopsy that she had died within one and a half to three hours after she had consumed the food that was then in her stomach. 
    Now prior to this time, we had ascertained the time when she had eaten this food. 
    So I mean this was learned later as to what the contents of the stomach disclosed. 
    We had learned that she had eaten breakfast at a quarter to six and that she had a dry wheat cereal for breakfast. 
    And that this food was consistent with what the pathologist found to have been nearly digested. 
    And that it was he said from one and a half to three hours after she had ingested this food -- after she had taken this food which would then place the cause of death or the time of death some place between probably 8:00 or 8:30 or a little after 8:30 within those limits -- this would also be in line with what the coroner found to have been the time of death. 
    Now, when she was -- of course the authorities recall. 
    And the chief of the police of the village of Baltimore which is a small village of approximately 2500 population, and there's only one policeman there and he is called the chief of police. 
    The sheriff's office was called and I was called as prosecuting attorney. 
    And later then the Juvenile Court officer was called a photographer was called to make pictures which is our usual procedure. 
    A number of questions were asked -- I think everybody around there was questioned including the neighbors who were there and there were a lot of people. 
    The folks were probably in a small town something like this happens you have quite a bit of difficulty keeping people out. 
    The neighbors were questioned. 
    Mr. Whittington and his -- not Mr. Whittington, but Mr. Willard and his son who was living with them were questioned. 
    Their families which lived next door to them were questioned. 
    Mr. and Mrs. Whittington and Whittington boy were questioned. 
    This is a question he was referred to here. 
    They were questioned that night concerning what had happened. 
    No one was accused of anything. 
    No one was arrested. 
    No one was taken into custody. 
    And the statement I think is in air when they said that the premises of the Whittington's were under control of the police. 
    They were in control again so far as they would not permit anyone else in the premises. 
    That's true. 
    But at no time Mr. Whittington was told they had to stay there or that they could not leave. 
    So I don't think there's any question that either any of the Whittington's or Buddy Whittington, the petitioner here, was not in custody. 
    He was not taken into custody and he was not taken into custody until almost a week later which would have been the 5th of August when a warrant --

    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    As near as I can tell you, the defendant said that -- you see, he was at home this day and his parents left to go to Canton to visit some relatives. 
    My understanding is, this was the first time he'd ever been left alone. 
    And he was left there because he was going to summer school. 
    And he was supposed to be at school at 8:30. 
    Now, he did not go to school that day. 
    And the reason he gave for not going to school was that he had contracted a stomach ache of some kind. 
    And he said that he spent the time in on his bed playing the record player. 
    I believe the statement was that he made. 
    He said that he was around the house all morning until sometime after 12 o'clock, when a lady who was Mrs. Willard's sister came to look for her because they had an appointment to go to town that day, and when she didn't show up after so long a time she came to look for her.

    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    That is what the chief of police testified to the day – I believe on the table or a chair. 
    I don't recall -- at the present time. 
    And after this time that when Mrs. Goodrich who was the sister, came to the home and she fixed the time at somewhat after 12 o'clock that day, she came to the home to inquire about her sister because she thought this is where the people lived that her sister frequently went berry picking with. 
    This was the time when blackberries arrived. 
    And she came there to inquire. 
    And after that, she went to another place, another neighbor of Mrs. Willard. 
    And Mrs. Goodrich and her husband and this neighbor went out the place to where they were known to have picked blackberries and they searched for Mrs. Willard. 
    In fact, the defendant here joined in that search later in the afternoon, through the brambles and places where they were known to pick blackberries in search of her. 
    And they kept up the search including some people from the Boy Scouts and so forth of the community there who came in to look for her, and they kept up the search until dusk. 
    And being at that time here that it was, of course, the days were raw. 
    And it was shortly after this that the Whittingtons' came home I think about 7:30 if my memory serves me correct. 
    And it was sometime after this that the search was made at the house and she was found. 
    Now, as I said before on the -- about seven days afterwards, this was the 29th of July. 
    And about seven days afterwards on the 5th of August, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Buddy Lynn Whittington. 
    This complaint, what we call a complaint in the State of Ohio where it involves a juvenile, was sworn to by the chief of police of the Village Baltimore and was filed with the Juvenile Court of our county. 
    On the basis of that complaint, a warrant was issued and he was taken into custody.

    And the law says that the juvenile judge may release into the parents.

    It's the same boy isn't it, 14-year-old boy. 
    The offense is the same regardless of its technical designation under the -- as a juvenile offense or an adult offense, the Act he is charged with is the same Act namely the murder of Mrs. Willard. 
    Now, how do you count for the fact that as a juvenile, he was kept in children's file and immediately, he is given the status of an adult and he is out on bail?

    Because the only thing I know is that that's what our statute serves, to judge.

    Now, if it was to be argued that the Court maybe abused its discretion and not releasing him to his parents or somebody else. 
    That's what's on the record but the judge you said that at the time and on these motions for bails, the judge said that this was not a popularity contest, and he had a duty to protect the people of the State of Ohio and he owed a duty to this boy.

speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4438.441" stopTime="4439.488">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    Yes it is.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4439.488" stopTime="4440.573">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is that a final order in your appeal?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4440.573" stopTime="4450.347">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    I think that it is and I maintain. 
    And I have maintained in my brief that the order appeal from here is not a final order. 
    And I argue that in the Court of Appeals.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4450.347" stopTime="4461.399">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume that an appeal had not been taken until Buddy can get back to the Diagnostic Center and he had been bound over. 
    And then there was an appeal.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4461.399" stopTime="4462.681">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4462.681" stopTime="4467.426">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the appeal was to challenge the order to bind over.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4467.426" stopTime="4468.423">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4468.423" stopTime="4479.168">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, would you suggest that what questions then would have been relevant or what questions could have been opened? 
    Wouldn't the same questions that had been opened that are now here?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4479.168" stopTime="4491.550">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    That's true. 
    I think the finding of under our statute it makes the finding of the juvenile judge that a person is delinquent. 
    It is an appealable order.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4491.550" stopTime="4516.993">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think that even though the finding that he committed this act and the finding that he is delinquent are made only as a preliminary to binding over? 
    Could it be that -- let's assume that some -- let's assume that he was not permitted cross-examination for example at that theory.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4516.993" stopTime="4519.333">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    All right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4519.333" stopTime="4537.603">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, if there was an appeal of the order to bind over after it was entered and it was challenged in the Ohio of course on the basis that they then proceed -- that the denial of procedure of due process in those proceedings. 
    Would that kind of a point be open in your Ohio court?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4537.603" stopTime="4539.786">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    Yes sir. 
    That is true.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4539.786" stopTime="4541.259">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And open here if they brought it up here.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4541.259" stopTime="4543.272">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    I think that is true.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4543.272" stopTime="4548.385">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So that -- is that really quite -- the order now has been entered, has it?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4548.385" stopTime="4556.161">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    That's true. 
    But it is not before this Court because the appeal was taken before, you see.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4556.161" stopTime="4558.261">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Taken before the entry of that binding?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4558.261" stopTime="4564.555">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    That is true that's why I say -- it was not fine order from the Court of Appeals but the Court of Appeals wouldn't listen.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4564.555" stopTime="4569.280">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, how long after the review was sought here was a bind of order --
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4569.280" stopTime="4570.733">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    After the review was sought here?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4570.733" stopTime="4571.138">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4571.138" stopTime="4580.915">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    Just as soon as this Court refused to issue a state of execution further, the Juvenile Court then had a hearing and bound him over.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4580.915" stopTime="4596.635">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well now, before we agreed to review this case, I forgot what date that was. 
    Could anyone tell us about this bind over order? 
    Could you tell us the opposition for the petition for review?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4596.635" stopTime="4600.835">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    I don't know where to -- I forget what was said there that -- I don't remember.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4600.835" stopTime="4604.278">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But in any event, no one sought to appeal the binding rule.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4604.278" stopTime="4608.185">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    Yes they did. 
    It's still pending in the Court of Appeals of our county.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4608.185" stopTime="4609.476">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So that order has been appealed.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4609.476" stopTime="4610.195">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    That is true.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4610.195" stopTime="4616.920">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And that's the one you say that if it were brought on that, we can review and get to the same questions that the petitioner now reads.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4616.920" stopTime="4619.629">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    In my opinion, that is a final order.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4619.629" stopTime="4630.883">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Except -- perhaps -- Maybe some of those questions might come up but at least we would have jurisdiction to review that order.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4630.883" stopTime="4632.039">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    I think that is true.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4632.039" stopTime="4635.878">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now let's see, you say that the appeal from the bind over order pending in what Court?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4635.878" stopTime="4639.907">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    In the Court of Appeals of our county, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, Fairfield County.

    What are they?
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="4654.780" stopTime="4671.675">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    One is an appeal from the bind over. 
    The second one is an appeal for the failure of the County's Court to dismiss the indictment. 
    And the third one is the refusal of the Common Pleas Court to fix bond on the first degree murder charge. 
    Those three appeals are pending in the Court of Appeals at the present time.

    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    There's nothing more after the bind over for the Juvenile Court to do. 
    You see, he is disposed off the manner. 
    He is bounded over to Common Pleas Court or he has made other disposition. 
    Suppose for instance that he had not bounded over to the Common Pleas Court which he did not have to do, he could then do number of other things. 
    He could place him on probation under our law or he could sentence him to the Youth Commission. 
    Now if he is sentencing to the Youth Commission, he loses jurisdiction. 
    Our Juvenile Court does under our law. 
    He loses jurisdiction. The Youth Commission, the Ohio Youth Commission can turn him absolutely scratch free within 30 days if they want to do that.

    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    That's true when he binds him over, to my opinion, that's a final order.

speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="5067.969" stopTime="5137.146">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    Under our statute, the Juvenile Court has original, exclusive jurisdiction over all juveniles. 
    And a juvenile in our State is defined as the person being under the age of 18 years. 
    Our statute also says that a child cannot be found guilty of a crime in the Juvenile Court because he can only be charged with being a delinquent child in the Juvenile Court. 
    That's all. 
    The statute also gives our Juvenile Court exclusive, original jurisdiction over neglected, crippled or dependent children as well as delinquent children. It's all covered under the same statute. 
    So that if a person is charged with a crime -- for instance, suppose a 17-year-old child would be charge with a crime like in a Municipal Court or Police Court and if you brought it to the attention of the authorities that he was under 18 years of age, that would have to be immediately transferred to the Juvenile Court of the residence of the dependent.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    As my understanding, what we're dealing with here maybe a finding and an order by the Juvenile Court which in effect deprives the child of a right given to him under Ohio Law namely, the right to be tried in the juvenile and not in the adult Court.
speaker="e_raymond_morehart" startTime="5163.034" stopTime="5174.093">
    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    No, no, it doesn't deprive the child of that right because the child or no one else has any as you say so except the Juvenile Court in cases of a felony.

    Mr. E. Raymond Morehart 
    My opinion is that it would vacate the indictment unless of course, the ruling of this Court will be such as to say that the juvenile court out of the state of Ohio were unconstitutional. 
    If that we're true then I suppose it would be the juvenile where he was before that time, which would be the same as any other individual.

    Yes sir. 
    I at this time -- now, we have said in our brief and we have argued here that the Juvenile Court -- that a person charged in a Juvenile Court that is a -- a juvenile is not entitled into a trial by jury. 
    Our statute in the State of Ohio provides that the juvenile judge shall hear the case informally against any child, not only delinquent but any neglected or crippled child. 
    He shall hear this informally as possible giving of course the defendant the right to be represented by counsel. 
    The right to summon witnesses of course and the right to cross-examination, and that statute now provides that an appeal shall be made. 
    And we have always assumed that that would include the right to make a transcript or a record of the proceedings.

    No, I don't think the discretion would have been the same to be fair with you and honest with you, because I think a person charged with only a second degree murder and our State Courts as an adult is entitled to bail. 
    Now, it's a question then whether or not he would be a lot better off as a juvenile because the Court could release him without bond if he wanted to. 
    He could release him to his parents. 
    He could release him to another custodian.

    The fact that he was now -- in this individual case, I suppose that you would have to say that it was disadvantage if he was being held when he could have been released to parents or probation officer or to someone else. 
    That's true and I suppose each individual case would have to depend entirely upon the merits and upon the judge as he saw fit.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Actually the turn of events here today is somewhat different that I had anticipated and I had intended I believe to pursue the line that I pursued when I was here in the Gault Case just to talk about the -- whether or not constitutionally, you can reasonably classify within the area of adults and minors. 
    And it's indicated to me by the Court's interest in this other factors that the philosophical problems that might be involved and the difference between children and adults may not be the thing that's foremost in your mind this time. 
    Aside from the particular facts in this case, I suppose that there is this overlaying questions as to -- role of the state the life of a child. 
    How much authority must or can the state have in the -- over the child's life. 
    In other words I have differences between children and adults such as to permit the procedures which are substantially different.

    Well Mr. Green, I have read your brief on behalf of the National Counsel of Juvenile Court judges. 
    I would like to ask you to address yourself to a question that I had put to Mr. Morehart. 
    Now, what did this boy, Buddy Lynn Whittington, get in terms of protection? 
    What if anything did he gets in terms of a protection of the state that he would not have gotten if he were tried in the adult Courts?

    Mr. Merritt W. Green 
    Well, we would have to assume at the outset because of the wide latitude given to the statute. 
    And almost universally followed that the judge is admonished almost the statute to release the child from custody to his parents or anybody else.

    Mr. Merritt W. Green 
    That's right but I would say that we would have to assume I believe that because of either of the climate in the area or the nature of the crime with which he was charged, the Court in its wisdom whether it was right or not, felt that it would be better for Buddy Whittington to be retained in the custody of the Court or one of its officers.

    Mr. Merritt W. Green 
    This particular boy had nothing accrued to him that I can see on this record. 
    Actually, one of the things and I must say this, that's happened and this case has spent too much lowing in the case.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6186.035" stopTime="6196.799">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Maybe too much lowing at the wrong time and maybe not enough lowing in terms of basic structure. 
    What would you say to that Mr. Green?
speaker="merritt_w_green" startTime="6196.799" stopTime="6231.720">
    Mr. Merritt W. Green 
    The first part, I would say it was true. 
    Now I don't believe the basic structure in it of itself is the fault of any mishandling or any injustices done to Buddy Lynn Whittington. 
    Because you would almost have to assume that this is a routine matter of denying release from the custody of the Court to any juvenile who comes before the Court. 
    And I don't think there's any justification. 
    All the statistics available to the Court or this record to say that this was a routine handling Mr. Justice Fortas.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6231.720" stopTime="6237.586">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Do you disagree with the constitutional principle that provides for a right to bail?
speaker="merritt_w_green" startTime="6237.586" stopTime="6328.883">
    Mr. Merritt W. Green 
    No, by all means, I do not of course the constitutional principle is I believe stated in that. 
    It's about that no person shall be required to give excessive bail. 
    But I say and I only say this that I'm not contending that there should be two set of rules on the constitution, one for youngsters and one for adults, or that the constitution doesn't apply to everybody. 
    But I am suggesting that you can't properly create classifications taking into consideration the people for whom you're established in the classification. 
    It's not on -- to all of those children in the law have always been considered in a different like in adults. 
    Contracts for instance. 
    Like if you could just go on and name all of those things where children for reasons emotionally, biologically, mentally or whatever the reason maybe are distinguished from the adults and the different -- the law applies differently to them. 
    After all, the theory of the Juvenile Court's Law -- the Juvenile Court's trying to do. 
    I think the philosophy is there. 
    They're trying to find out when somebody or some youngster becomes entangled in the law what caused them to be entangled with the law? 
    And what can we do to either prevent him from going on to life occurring or what can we do to rehabilitate him as if he started?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6328.883" stopTime="6333.864">

speaker="merritt_w_green" startTime="6333.864" stopTime="6336.423">
    Mr. Merritt W. Green 
    You mean as to this boy? 
    No. 
    Because he was prevented --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6336.423" stopTime="6337.923">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What happened here?
speaker="merritt_w_green" startTime="6337.923" stopTime="6338.447">

    Sir?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6338.447" stopTime="6372.167">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What happened here in effect was an effort by the Juvenile Court to find out whether this boy committed the offense. 
    This terrible crime with what he was charged in substance if not in words. 
    And when it had for that purpose and without any of these attempts that we all talk about in connection with the Juvenile Court, to find out what kind of boy he is, what makes him take and what's the best thing to do with him, isn't that so?
speaker="merritt_w_green" startTime="6372.167" stopTime="6373.446">
    Mr. Merritt W. Green 
    No, I don't think that's true Mr. Justice Fortas.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6373.446" stopTime="6377.534">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Where do you find that in -- where do you find anything else in the record?
speaker="merritt_w_green" startTime="6377.534" stopTime="6469.407">
    Mr. Merritt W. Green 
    Well, his finding at the start, saying that there has been a murder committed. 
    There has been a killing. 
    The Court made these findings and said that it maybe that Buddy Whittington may have done. 
    And then along came -- in that same finding, he ordered the boy to be sent to the Youth Commission in Columbus for the various tests. 
    Now, it wasn't until after that on the basis of all these tests and a complete investigation the statute says. 
    That then he makes his determination whether he wants to keep him in giving this treatment that I'm talking about, or whether he wants to having found that the boy committed that backwards committed by an adult would have been a felony. 
    Not necessarily it's a felony. 
    But then he makes a determination whether he should make the boy available to -- the resources of community or whether or not he should be tried as an adult. 
    So you see this part of it was cut off really by the State of this record. 
    I should point out that one statement of fact that it's apparently little different. 
    And that is that the time between the hearing in September and he was bound over because I really truly believe that this was a preliminary matter. 
    It was only about seven months. 
    I think it was from September.

    Mr. Merritt W. Green 
    That's right. 
    The point was that -- I don't believe that he followed the system. 
    You see because from the time this boy had a hearing one month after he was arrested. 
    And I think the record would show that that delay even, some of it is on at the request of the boy's lawyer. 
    And from that time on, the Court was stopped, prevented from acting. 
    Until after this Court in preparation for filing a petition refused to stay any longer than the Grand Jury.

    And the binding over order of the Juvenile Court was on April 24, 1967.

    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Well, it's not in the current record that I have here but it maybe in the file. 
    My understanding is that there was an order by this Court which denied the stay of further proceedings.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6601.951" stopTime="6603.371">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We denied a stay?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="6603.371" stopTime="6672.909">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Yes you did. 
    So you have this in the regular period when these proceedings were unable to go forth below. 
    With respect to the question of finality, I would like to direct the Court's attention to a decision by this Court in the case of New York Ex Rel Bryant v. Zimmerman, which we've decided on page 5 of our reply brief which involved a petition for writ of habeas corpus in advance with trial by someone who was under indictment. 
    And the petition for habeas corpus was denied at the State Courts and review was sought in the Supreme Court of United States while they were still depending indictment in the State Courts. 
    And this Court held that that was a final judgment. 
    That the habeas corpus proceeding is independent, adversary and both adapted, and directed to the enforcement of a most important personal right and to entertain that appeal. 
    And we think that the same situation prevails here with the juvenile proceeding which was an independent proceeding and which did end in the adjudication of delinquency with very serious consequences for the juvenile. 
    We think Mr. Morehart is simply asking this Court to reverse the decision of the Courts of Ohio as to the appealability of this order under state law. 
    With respect to the evidence --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6672.909" stopTime="6677.174">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But it is a separate question for finality with its final progress.
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="6677.174" stopTime="6680.854">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Yes and I believe in that question, you look at the incidents of the judge --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What would have happened in the Juvenile Court if the Court had decided when the -- when it was permitted to go forward that it wouldn't -- that the Court would not turnover. 
    What order would have been --?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="6692.507" stopTime="6695.678">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Well, it would have had a variety of dispositional orders open to it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6695.678" stopTime="6698.740">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But it's still a disposition order to be entered.
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="6698.740" stopTime="6713.441">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Well, there was a disposition order here, there would have been a further order which could have been still temporary in nature or which could have been a permanent commitment, which could have been probation, which could have been a fine. 
    They have this continuing jurisdiction and they could modify their orders even from time to time so that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6713.441" stopTime="6721.133">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But there are still in this case necessarily -- at least another order had to be entered one way or another.
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="6721.133" stopTime="6725.949">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    There's no specific provision of course requiring the Court to do that or even setting a time limit within which the Court --

    Once the diagnostic center send it back -– is that the statute there?
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="6731.736" stopTime="6737.255">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    Well a statute doesn't say to the contrary that there is no provision in the statute which is comparable to the provision of the federal criminal rule.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6737.255" stopTime="6740.592">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    A common sense would indicate that perhaps there was another order coming.
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="6740.592" stopTime="6792.781">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    I would have thought that the judge would have to do something or else it would be susceptible to habeas corpus. 
    On the evidentiary point which Mr. Morehart had talked about, I would like to just direct the Court's attention to page 271 of the record which is a critical passage in the Court of Appeals opinion. 
    The Court below affirm this judgment by the use of the civil standard but they also had at the statement which we submit must have been considered with great care that the evidence contained in the record fails to disclose any thorough investigation by officials toward eliminating the possibility that Mrs. Gladys Willard may have been killed by some other person. 
    Mr. Morehart says that he assumes that the boy did it and I submit that that is all you have here in assumption and not based on any tolerable standard of guilt when liberty and reputation are at stake. 
    And that is not a sufficient basis to impose the kind of sanctions that are available here.

speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="6877.615" stopTime="6906.369">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    I'd like to direct the Court's attention on the first point on the adult confinement to page 253 of the record which is the journal entry of the District Court of Appeals, which ordered Buddy released from the confinement, and in which he was then held in the adult jail. 
    After a personal view and I said from our view, we find that Buddy is confined in a portion of the jail used for adults and that an adult is now in fact confined in an adjoining cell in the same room.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6906.369" stopTime="6908.499">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That was after a personal viewing by the Court.
speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="6908.499" stopTime="6971.723">
    Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck 
    That was personal viewing by the Court of Appeals. 
    With respect to the solitary, it was repeatedly asserted and never denied in motions for release to the Court that he was being held in solitary. 
    There's no evidence that anyone else was confined with him and any other juvenile and I would direct the Court's attention to the testimony of his mother that's up here. 
    It's at page 99 of the record in which she was asked to have an opinion as to what continued and enforced incarceration in that cell as to whether it would affect Buddy's mental well being. 
    And she answered, “Yes sir. 
    I think anybody being penned up like that by themselves for as long as he has been – or as long as he might have to be. 
    I think even myself or even an adult that would work on your mind it couldn't help but do that just penned up there all day long.” 
    And then she said in response to a further question. 
    Well, when he sits there all day long, sometimes he doesn't say much when we go in. 
    I think his mind might be dulled by being there. 
    There's nothing for him to do, just sit there. 
    It would affect your mind to or anybody's. 
    So we think that there's an ample predicate.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well Mr. Rezneck, it has been urged before us in this case and it's been otherwise urged that the State has a burden of showing that the classification of children for purposes of various applications of its laws is a reasonable one and in terms of justification of denial of certain rights, certain constitutional rights. 
    And it's been urged that for the State to bear that first, it's got to show a wide range of factors to indicate that the classification is reasonable. 
    And among those factors is the question of what the State does with respect to the child. 
    It makes it reasonable for the State to classify the child separately and differently with respect to the administration of its law of offenses including their things of which juveniles are charged. 
    And from that point of view, it's urged that the question of facilities or no facilities available for special treatment of juveniles is relevant to the constitutional question. 
    The State that to you not to reflect my own view on it because I don't at the moment have a view on that but as making quite relevant, as an argument, that would if valid to make quite relevant to the question of what does the State do with respect to juveniles to justify the separate classification in this separate system of jurisprudence, that it can be so called.
