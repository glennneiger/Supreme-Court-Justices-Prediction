    Mr. Evan L. Schwab

    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    So a final order would have been entered, an appealable order and I believe an appeal could be taken from that. 
    Now, the question was raised as to whether this Court if it upholds the right to counsel in this case is then leading itself into finding other constitutional rights and probation revocation hearings, namely a right to a jury trial, the right of consultation, the right to an indictment. 
    I don't think this necessarily follows. 
    We're talking about deprivations of liberty and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment primarily. 
    The man has been either tried or he's pleaded guilty. 
    He has had his essential criminal trial with all of its historical safeguards. 
    This is a new type of proceeding. 
    Due process I think requires something less in this sort of a proceeding. 
    I see no reason why you would have to be indicted over a --

    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    It's part of a criminal prosecution but not a separate one, not to be carved out by itself. 
    He was indicted originally when he was arrested. 
    He was either indicted or proceeded against by information. 
    He had a right to a jury trial. 
    He either availed himself or he pleaded guilty or he waived it.

    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    In part Your Honor, yes I do.

    The judges I know received this in a mail by this Court and many of them are frivolous. 
    But if a hearing is to be held in Court, I would submit there should be a right to counsel. 
    I don't think a man should ever have to come in to a court of law without a lawyer.

    How many?
speaker="evan_l_schwab" startTime="251.333" stopTime="280.812">
    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    The figures we have on probation is that in the year 1965 in the state courts, I think it was a 146,000 persons were placed on probation and the average daily case load of persons actually serving on probation that year was about 230,000. 
    Revocation proceedings seem to run about a third of the average case load, roughly one third of this people violate. 
    So this would be around 40 -- 35 to 40, 45,000 people per year. 
    And of course, I assume it would go up each year, gets larger.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="280.812" stopTime="295.939">

speaker="evan_l_schwab" startTime="297.109" stopTime="299.258">

    This is something I would assume a lawyer would ask for.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="299.258" stopTime="323.817">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, and I would wonder if the judge couldn't say. 
    Well, now, I don't want to send you in the penitentiary. 
    This hadn't been a terribly serious violation of probation but I do think that you're ought to be punished for it, so I'm going to send you back to the county jail for six months again as a term of your probation. 
    I suppose he could do that.
speaker="evan_l_schwab" startTime="323.817" stopTime="344.924">
    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    I think you could. 
    And I found no authority on that and I'm sure there is no mistake but I'm quite sure he could because his lawyer will be arguing or at least he will be arguing to keep this down and hold this to a minimum. 
    The judge has the great deal of discretion in this area. 
    The judge could say I'm not going to revoke but here's a new condition, some period of time in the county jail up to a year, the statute only authorizes the year in jail.

    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    Well, the case will be remanded.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Actually, I suppose when his probation is revoked that a board that supervises how long he's got to stay in (Inaudible) proceeds thereafter on the assumption that he has committed the alleged crime for which -- upon the base of which probation was revoked.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Even though (Voice Overlap) -- there's been no trial and no judicial determination that he committed a second crime that is to say the one alleged by the probation officer and on the basis of which the probation was revoked. 
    I assume that the board would just take it for granted since the judge revoked his probation on that basis that he really committed it.
speaker="evan_l_schwab" startTime="427.869" stopTime="450.168">
    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    That's right. 
    Well in fact Your Honor is Walkling demonstrates very well the probation authority is usually the ones who initiate the violation proceedings. 
    The probation officer here is an employee of the State Board of Prison Terms and Paroles and he is the one who testified as to these 14 counts of forgery and 14 counts of larceny. 
    So he obviously believe that there was a merit to them and that the man should be revoked so I'm quite sure this would play a factor.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I understood you to say that this in effect punishing a man the guilt's of other crime. 
    That's in effect on what you said. 
    The judge takes him into consideration, decided that he is guilty and then puts on this punishment assuming that he did not confer to the board. 
    How can you start by just giving them a lawyer by -- he is entitled to a jury and an indictment in all the other petitions (Inaudible)?

    I know but this -- to make such report is required with the other supervisions of state parole officers during the period of his probation.

    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    Typically when the court enters an order like this, the lawyer and his client or the client if he is there, walk across the street in Seattle at least to the probation office and arrange an interview and he sits down, he's given a list of do's and don'ts and he has a -- he meets his probation officer --

    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    Oh, I don't know if they're in published form or not or if they're merely internal regulations for uses in the board. 
    I've had no contact with these regulations.

    But a lot of them it seems to me as a -- they've put conditions on them that fall far short of a committing criminal act.

    You're definitely correct.

    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    Well, I actually walked the client over that office one time and as I recall when I looked at the list, it had all sorts of things about hours that he had to keep, places to live. 
    He couldn't leave the county I believe without getting permission. 
    He couldn't own a car without getting permission from the board that sort of restrictions were placed upon him. 
    They gave him a little -- some kind of a mimeograph form they hand out to these people and they're required to report back at periodic intervals.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I believe we decided a case several years ago. 
    I don't think generally in the field of probation that we had a question that as the judge could use it if it had not been proceeded by cross-examination of witness.

    Yes, I'm --

    What was that based on, that holding?
speaker="evan_l_schwab" startTime="875.307" stopTime="887.144">
    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    It was as I recall, it was based on a concept that since the conviction had already been entered since the man is either been found guilty or entered a plea of guilty -- more technical due process rights ceased and --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="887.144" stopTime="890.410">

    More technical? 
    No, not more technical, was it?

    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    Well, the ones that apply more -- in a more technical sense to trial is what I mean.

    Mr. Evan L. Schwab 
    Well, I don't consider them technical either Your Honor but I -- what I'm trying to say was that some of them were deemed to apply only to trial up to the point of conviction that now since the man had been convicted, the judge could rely on a greater variety of material if this had been done historically. 
    The courts have tried to consider all the material they could get their hands on that might help them enter an informed decision in connection with the sentence.

    Mr. Schwab, before you sit down, I want you to know that the court is -- conscious to the fact that you assumed the burden of this case by assignment from this Court and that we consider that a real public service.

    So we appreciate it and we thank you for your service.
