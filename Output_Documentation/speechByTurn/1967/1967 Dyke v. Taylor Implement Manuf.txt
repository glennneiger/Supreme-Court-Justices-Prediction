    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 149, Wayne Dyke et al, petitioners versus Taylor Implement Manufacturing Company Incorporated. 
    Mr. Gottesman.
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="14.543" stopTime="203.036">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Tennessee's Supreme Court and it presents two issues. 
    Each of which has been discussed at some length already this week: First, the right to jury trial in at least certain criminal contempt cases and second, the validity of the search without warrant of an automobile. 
    The issues arise in this case however in quite a different context and since that context may shape the resolution, I'd like to describe it at least at some length. 
    We begin here with the strike being under taken by the employees of the respondent company against the company. 
    Petitioners were striking employees of the company. 
    At some point during the strike, the company went into the Tennessee Court of Equity. 
    They are still separate courts in Tennessee and it got an injunction against certain conduct by the striking employees. 
    The provisions of that injunction relevant here enjoined conduct which quite clearly was conduct already proscribed by the criminal law of the State of Tennessee specifically it enjoined the striking employees from injuring or harming those employees of the company who came to work or visitors or other people who may come to the company during the period of the strike. 
    Now, of course it's undisputed and the company acknowledges in its brief that this conduct which was enjoined and indeed for which the petitioners ultimately were tried in contempt is a felony under the state law of Tennessee. 
    Sometime after the injunction was issued and while the strike was continuing, a shot was fired into the home of one of the employees who was working during the strike. 
    This home was some 25 miles from the plant in the next county. 
    The shot was fired from an automobile as the automobile raced away the occupants of the house returned fire and manage to hit the car with one bode in the back. 
    Deputy Sheriff Powers who is a sheriff in the county where the plant is located and who was at the time the record doesn't quite clear about 15 or 20 miles from the scene of the shooting, received the report over his radio that a shooting had occurred that car was apparently headed in the direction of his county and that it was an old make model car. 
    He expressly testified that that is all that he received over his radio in terms of a description of the car and when asked, Did you get a specific description? 
    He said, No, that's all I got. 
    It was an old make model car. 
    As he was driving along, he saw an old make model car coming in the opposite direction that quite equipped and he turned around and followed it. 
    He testified that was going some 78-80 miles an hour, he couldn't catch up to it and so he radio the head to the police in the next town which happens to be the town the plant is located in, to stop the car. 
    They did so Sheriff Powers is then as they were stopped, caught up, pulled up along side.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="203.036" stopTime="207.431">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did he tell them what kind of a car it was?
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="207.431" stopTime="209.869">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    I'm sorry. 
    Did who saw?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="209.869" stopTime="213.999">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That the officer who radioed the head, tell what kind of a car it was?
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="213.999" stopTime="333.627">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Well, all the record shows Sheriff Powers says he radio the head and said I'm chasing an old car and I can't catch it please stop it. 
    That's all he recites having said. 
    He did testify that he didn't know at this time any more about the car except that it was an old car. 
    To that, I assume is all that he could've radio the head. 
    At any rate, the car was stopped and the car which was stopped we know is petitioner's car. 
    Sheriff Powers pulled up alongside. 
    Petitioners were still sitting in the car. 
    He came over, there was apparently a brief conversation not recorded. 
    At the end of which, Sheriff Powers told the occupants of the car petitioners, I'm going to take you down to the jail. 
    He did not tell them what the ground for taking them was he just said, I'm going to take you down to the jail. 
    The petitioners came out of their car and apparently we're taken in Sheriff Powers' car to the jail. 
    No search was conducted of the car at this point on the highway, but the car was separately brought to the jail and was parked right outside the front door of the jail. 
    Sheriff Powers then testifies, I took the defendants petitioners inside the jail and sat them down there. 
    I told petitioner McKinney who was the driver of the car that he was under arrest for reckless driving and I then went outside and I searched the car. 
    Now, there is no contention here, I think it's important to emphasize this at the outset. 
    There's no suggestion, this was an administrative search. 
    There's no suggestion that there were any regulations in McMinn County Tennessee for searching every car that was impounded. 
    Indeed, there's no suggestion in this record that this car was impounded. 
    All we know is that the car was brought to the jail as in Preston that was the case and as the Court suggested in Preston for all we know it may have been for the convenience of the petitioners. 
    Following the search of course uncovered a gun and so an ammunition.

    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Yes, he said that. 
    The witness testified that the petitioner McKinney seem very scared and he said I'll leave my car here tonight. 
    I'll leave my car. 
    And that was the testimony, but it's not clear on the record whether that was said before or after Sheriff Powers went out and searched the car. 
    In any rate, Sheriff Powers did testify that all three petitioners were under restraint inside the jail.

    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    I say, I don't think the record makes that clear, all Sheriff Powers says is, I went out to search the car. 
    He was purely -- this was a -- an indiscriminate or at least the complete search of a car that he was under taking. 
    And he said he found the gun under the front right seat. 
    I think those were the words and as I say it's not clear whether that meant physically under it or down on the floor right in front of it. 
    He also found some ammunition seating. 
    He said, near where the driver would sit on the front seat.

    Alright, he may have made that assumption but at the time and I think this is an important fact.

    Now, --

    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    No, the search that he made, he made at the jail at that time he had seen the hole in the car. 
    At that time, he may have known and again the record is unclear. 
    He may have known what to make a model of the car was at the time he made the search because the record does not reveal when that information was imparted to him. 
    He did not have that information when he stopped them on the highway.

    He didn't go out there and roll up the windows and happen to see a gun seating on the seat.

    Of what?
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="624.571" stopTime="636.443">

    It shoots a less powerful and a less damaging bullet but I -- there is no suggestion by the petitioners that assuming they were the ones who did it that this was not a serious offense that they would have committed.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="639.387" stopTime="678.679">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Right. 
    Now, following the discovery of the gun and the ammunition contempt proceedings were bought in the equity court of McMinn County, Tennessee by the company. 
    In Tennessee unlike the Illinois case you had yesterday, the state does not prosecute criminal contempt the party who got the injunction does in this case the company. 
    So, the company brought a contempt proceeding and they had a contempt citation which were cited that these people have gun and shot into a house and that because they had gun and shot into a house, they should be found guilty of contempt. 
    A trial was had --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="678.679" stopTime="683.140">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It wasn't the point that, was it? 
    It was because they disobeyed the court order, they should be found guilty.
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="683.140" stopTime="746.747">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Well, they disobeyed the court order which said don't hurt people or threaten to harm people by shooting into a house. 
    The citation was quite explicit to these people have shot into a house and that is the way in which they disobeyed the Court order. 
    Now, at the trial, petitioners asked for a jury trial. 
    It was denied, the gun and the ammunition were introduced into evidence over the objections of the petitioners. 
    The reason given by the chancellor for allowing the evidence in was that you might be in good shape in criminal court but this is not a criminal court. 
    In his summation, the prosecutor that is the company counsel relied very heavily on the gun and the ammunition in support of the proposition that these petitioners were indeed the people who done the shooting. 
    The chancellor found that they were found that they were in contempt of this injunction and gave them the maximum sentence permissible under Tennessee law for violation -- for one violation of an injunction which is 10 days in jail and a $50.00 fine.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="746.747" stopTime="748.693">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's absolute level of penalty.
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="748.693" stopTime="753.142">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    The absolute -- that's correct, for a single act of contempt which this clearly was.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="753.142" stopTime="764.814">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So this is a (Inaudible).
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="764.814" stopTime="800.279">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Well, I don't know, what you can conclude from the fact that they make that the maximum penalty. 
    This Court has said that there are serious offenses which because they're serious, I'm talking now on the criminal context not criminal contempt. 
    Even though the maximum penalty was 30 days, this was a serious offense within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment and that was District of Columbia versus Cohen. 
    Now, whether Tennessee thought this to be or not to be a serious offense, I would want to characterize that but they have a maximum penalty of 10 days and a $50.00 fine for each single act of contempt.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="800.279" stopTime="803.504">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Your argument would be somewhat stronger if it were two years?
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="803.504" stopTime="850.700">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    It would be stronger if we're two years but we submit that it would be nonetheless should reach the same result because under assuming there's a Sixth Amendment application to criminal contempt proceedings at all, the standard which the Sixth Amendment employs for determining what is a serious offense warning a jury trial is not primarily the severity of the potential sentence if one looks at the decisions of this Court the primary emphasis is on the nature of the offense. 
    This is repeatedly emphasized in Cohen, in Cox and in Cohen versus Wilson which was the first to these cases. 
    The Court said, where the nature of the offenses such that a common law it was indictable and that it is malum in se then regardless of the maximum penalty you're entitled to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I'm not sure there are misdemeanors under Tennessee law. 
    In any event whether it's indictable or it's considered in any offense, the actual powers you should engage in a man who's a criminal but that's a minor.
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="879.763" stopTime="909.683">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    If these were the type of crime which are prosecuted criminally would not entitle you to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment and we would concede that you're not entitled to a jury trial in a criminal contempt proceeding either. 
    What we are saying is that this is not the type of crime which a prosecuted as a crime would not under the Sixth Amendment entitle you to a jury trial. 
    Indeed, because it is malum in se indictable at common law under the holding of this Court regardless of the length of the potential sentence. 
    It is a crime for which you are entitled to a jury trial.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, what do you do about Cheff?
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="913.278" stopTime="993.538">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Well, Cheff raises another point and it really comes from and there's a lot of citation of District of Columbia versus Cohen. 
    In Cohen, which was also a criminal case, this Court said even where we have an offense which is not by nature indictable at the common law or malum in se, in other words, which is not a serious offense by its nature. 
    We are willing to take a look as an alternative basis for importing the right to a jury trial in the Sixth Amendment to the potential sentence. 
    In other words, the severity of the sentence which the legislature has announced, it's willing to impose for this may persuade us that something is indeed a serious offense even if by nature it was not a serious offense at the common law. 
    And since the maximum punishment there was 90 days, they said we're convinced, that's not enough to convert a non-serious offense into a serious one. 
    We might look differently upon six month. 
    Now, that led I think to Cheff which relies on District of Columbia versus Cohen and suggests that where the punishment is six months the severity of such that at the very least in the supervisory power of this Court. 
    This Court is going to say there should be a jury trial. 
    We submit that that holding really ought to be constitutionally derived. 
    We don't submit that Cheff in fact is constitutionally derived.

    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    I think the maximum is five years, if I'm correct. 
    The shooting into an occupied house and not hitting someone --

    Justice Abe Fortas

    That's correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1081.066" stopTime="1094.319">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But what you're saying here is that we ought to disregard the fact that this is a contempt that carries a quite a different much less severe penalty and look back to the nature of the Act itself?
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="1094.319" stopTime="1166.928">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    That's what we're submitting, yes. 
    And primarily for this reason, I think this case is different from Bloom because of the issuance of the injunction. 
    The problem we face here is that and I might say these are quite common in labor disputes. 
    I think in every labor dispute whenever there's any minor violence, it's quite customary to get an injunction against violence. 
    Well, the nature of that injunction and that is also inconsistent with the old common law rule that equity does not enjoin any crime. 
    There, has developed this major exception in labor disputes. 
    Every time an injunction of that nature issues and it's an injunction saying do not commit a crime and quite term is that. 
    I mean the act -- the conduct is already criminal. 
    All that's accomplished by getting an injunction against it is to provide a second way to prosecute the same conduct. 
    It's true the penalty is less. 
    It's also true that at least under Tennessee law, there's no double jeopardy. 
    That may not be correct under federal constitutional law but these defendants in fact even after they were convicted of contempt had an information issued against them for the crime. 
    They were indicted but information was issued. 
    It was ultimately nolle prosequi.

    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    That's correct. 
    But what I'm suggesting is that when an injunction enjoins a crime that unless this Court says that if the crime what entitles you to a jury trial the violation of the injunction entitles you to a jury trial. 
    We're going to have an anomalous situation where in effect simply by a judge showing you an injunction your right to jury trial goes out the window.

    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Yes, then you have to go right to the severity of the sentence because by its nature obviously this would not be something the sixth -- that's right, the Sixth Amendment would apply to. 
    I'd like to move if I may to the search and seizure point. 
    We traveled two roads to what we think is an inevitable result on search and seizure namely that this search was unlawful. 
    One road is to line up Preston and Cooper and to compare the factors relied upon by this Court in each in determining that a search and warrant was reasonable and then the other unreasonable and to show that the facts of this case the search was clearly unreasonable. 
    The facts are like Preston indeed they're hard to distinguish from Preston we think. 
    And let me deal with that first and then get in to our other approach. 
    In this case, like Preston, the search took place at a later time at another place. 
    The search was according to respondents and I think they're probably right. 
    The search was incident not to the crime for which they were arrested which is reckless driving but the search was a -- to be candid I think was in order to find evidence to link these people to the shooting but they had not be arrested for the shooting. 
    There was no need to conduct the search in order to prevent the defendants from getting access to weapons. 
    They were under detention inside the jail. 
    There was clearly time to get a warrant. 
    This is not an -- from what we can see in this record and impounding case. 
    This is not a Cooper case whereby law, the police are required to impound the car as evidence of the crime. 
    Certainly, Tennessee does not require the impounding of every car which has been involved in the reckless driving and that is all these petitioners have been arrested for the time of search was conducted. 
    Cooper relied very heavily we think set it on the proposition that the search was for evidence of the crime for which the defendants were arrested and that the police were required to impound the car in connection with the offense for which they were arrested and so none of those things are present here and we think this case therefore is Preston. 
    Assuming the governing standard for these types of cases is to line up and continue to lineup Preston and Cooper. 
    We think incidentally that Cooper --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1495.024" stopTime="1502.592">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you deny that the Tennessee law was improper? 
    That each of the appellant's car (Inaudible)?
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="1502.592" stopTime="1516.639">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Well, I don't want to deny it. 
    I just said they didn't do it. 
    I don't think Tennessee law provides for the impounding of cars involved in reckless driving and I don't think this car was in fact impounded. 
    At least there is no evidence in the record to suggest that it was. 
    It was brought along with the petitioner.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1516.639" stopTime="1520.292">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The reckless driving of car as I gather is the criminal offense?
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="1520.292" stopTime="1521.503">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Yes indeed.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1521.503" stopTime="1525.279">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And that's bailable.
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="1525.279" stopTime="1529.343">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    I suppose that's right. 
    I don't know that but I assume that it is a bailable offense.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1529.343" stopTime="1534.118">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="1534.118" stopTime="1627.157">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    I assume that's correct unless, they were going to deny in the court. 
    Now, we don't know that they did deny in the court from the record and I'm frank to say that I don't know whether in fact they denied it to them after he was released. 
    But at least there is no defense made in this case of the search that this was an impounded car and we think that clearly makes Cooper inapplicable. 
    Our other approach to this which we really think is the right approach to the Fourth Amendment though we confess this Court has sometimes seem denied evidence, sometime not is that searches without warrant are only reasonable or to put it in a words of Katz a per se unreasonable unless you have one of the already clearly enunciated, clearly established exceptions and we think the proper definition of all of those exceptions the proper way to characterize all of them, is the way they were characterized in the McDonald case and they have sometimes but not always been characterized since that the police may search without a warrant only where the exigencies of the situation preclude the delay necessary to obtain a warrant. 
    We think that clearly effectuates the purposes of the Fourth Amendment. 
    The purpose, one of the central purposes is to insist that police officers get warrants before they search. 
    The reason we insist upon that is to interpose a neutral magistrate who makes subjective decisions about whether there's enough evidence to search. 
    The exception is necessary because there are obviously circumstances where it is not convenient or possible to get a warrant before the search has to be conducted. 
    There are --

speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="1643.232" stopTime="1672.093">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Well, that's right although the answer to that I think is as this Court has often suggested all the police need have done was guard the car for the short period of time necessary to get the warrant. 
    Now, if they had released petitioner McMillan and he had headed for his car and said, Bye, I'm going to take my car home now. 
    At that point, I would say they no longer had to get the warrant because now their car was threatened. 
    Now, they would've lost because at that point the exigencies of the situation were such assuming they have probable cause to search.

speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="1691.058" stopTime="1703.680">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    The problem with the record is, it isn't clear whether there was probable cause or not. 
    It isn't clear what they knew at the time they conducted that search if they knew the car that involved in the robbery it had a bullet shot in the back and that it was a 1950 Dodge and they knew it was --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1703.680" stopTime="1706.162">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That is an issue up here, the probable cause --
speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="1706.162" stopTime="1822.696">
    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    I would say that it has not been made an issue in this case. 
    The principle issue in this case has been whether this search was proper, given that it was made without warrant. 
    And our principle argument is that any search without a warrant is per se improper unless the exigencies of the situation were such that it was not possible to obtain one. 
    We submit and I want to close with this that not only is the correct interpretation of the Fourth Amendment but it is the only interpretation that is going to make law enforcement in this area sensible. 
    As long as there are epicycles of rules of reasonableness which depend on the facts of each case which has Mr. Justice Black said earlier today require a question of judgment in each case. 
    Police are going to make mistakes and when they make mistakes they can be good faith mistakes. 
    A guilty man is going to go free because that evidence is going to be excluded. 
    The exclusionary rule is a rule of punishment and yet if the rules remain so fuzzy that a policeman doesn't know what his obligations are, he is going to be punished. 
    The guilty man is going to go free because he didn't understand the rules. 
    The McDonald rule, the rule that you must get a warrant unless the circumstances are such that there isn't time to get it is a rule that a policeman can understand and that it incorporates what are now six different rules and that all seem to stem from though they go a little further. 
    It incorporates them into one rule. 
    A policeman doesn't have to have a form book of the latest exceptions. 
    He doesn't have to know the Cooper versus California was decided last year and that maybe another exception. 
    Only he needs to know is that my guiding star, the issue for me to decide is do I have time the circumstances of this case to get a warrant if the answer is yes, I must get it, if the answer is no, then I may search without it assuming I have probable cause. 
    And that, we submit is the standard which should be adopted under the Fourth Amendment though as we say even if Preston and Cooper remain where they are and the rule is still reasonableness and all the facts and circumstances in this case we submit the search was unreasonable.

    Does the policeman have a reasonable basis the fear that if he stopped a speeder a gun will be pulled?

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I understand that but I think that if they suspected that they heard this an old car they suspected this might possible be the car that would not be cause for them to arrest the people for the previous crime but if they stopped them and arrested them for reckless driving, it wouldn't be unreasonable for them to concern themselves as to whether there might be a gun around which might be used against them.

    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    Well, I have a little trouble when you put in those terms because then you're saying they can search on suspicion, they can use reckless driving. 
    Suppose they weren't driving 70 miles an hour, suppose they were driving within the speed limit, should that deny the police search which Your Honor is suggesting they otherwise could make?

    Mr. Michael H. Gottesman 
    It might be different. 
    I would be worried -- if the policeman candidly said, I wasn't interested in searching pursuant to an arrest for reckless driving. 
    I use this as an excuse to search for evidence to verify my suspicion that they were involved in the shooting. 
    I would think that there would be serious problems under the Fourth Amendment were he to say that that was his motive.

   Argument of Allen H. Carter

    Mr. Carter.

    Mr. Allen H. Carter 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court and may it please the Court. 
    It's the position of the Taylor Manufacturing Company the respondent in this case that Mr. Loyd Powers did have probable cause to search the automobile which was at the McMinn County Jail immediately after the apprehension of these defendants. 
    Now, I might state that in addition to the evidence which Mr. Gottesman sets forth and to the statement of the case that the sheriff of Monroe County in whose county the shooting took place put a description of the automobile out or over his radio and our Sheriff Kirkpatrick testified that the automobile which he later saw in the adjoining county, McMinn County matched the description of the automobile that he put out over the radio.

    Mr. Allen H. Carter 
    Certainly, the record is not clear as to what Sheriff Kirkpatrick said that he put out. 
    This is what Sheriff Powers said that he received, yes sir. 
    And the questions which certainly are involved in the case are the question of the search of the automobile, the question of the jury trial in the criminal contempt proceeding and also the question we say as to whether or not the jury trial or the federal questions, the Sixth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution was properly brought to the attention of the Tennessee Supreme Court in the original appeal. 
    Now, in regard to the question whether or not the search was reasonable under the circumstances as the Court had held in Rabinowitz and other cases, the facts and circumstances of each case determined what is reasonable. 
    In this case, the petitioners relied primarily on the Preston case and then involved in the vagrancy charged where three men were sitting in their automobile and they were for long period of time and they were arrested charged with -- I mean, with vagrancy. 
    No crime they had been committed as such in Preston. 
    We say that this case and the present case is -- are distinguishable from the Preston case in that in this case a shooting had occurred and in a --

    Mr. Allen H. Carter 
    Well, Your Honor, in answer to that question if I might answer it in this way at the time they were stopped on the highway for reckless driving there was a conversation which took place at that time in involving the defendants and our Sheriff Powers.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Gottesman seems to indicate that that the issue of probable cause to search this car in connection with the shooting is not an issue here that apparently maybe he didn't mean to say this but apparently we are to decide this case on the assumption that there is probable cause to search the car next to the shooting and if that so, would you argue that the -- therefore, necessarily probable cause to arrest this man. 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="allen_h_carter" startTime="2515.003" stopTime="2582.271">
    Mr. Allen H. Carter 
    That was necessary to arrest these men for the shooting before the search. 
    Well, if I understand the question correctly, I think that in this case that the automobile which was being searched was being held as evidence in this shooting which was in this adjoining county. 
    This is the reason that we say that the officers had the right to the custody of this car because it was the instrumentality with which these gentlemen went to this adjoining county. 
    It was the way that they fled from the scene. 
    It contained a bullet hole in the rear of the automobile and it was the way in which they return. 
    There's a certainly this would give rise to an officer who had information concerning the shooting episode in this adjoining county. 
    I think that this would give -- I mean rise to probable cause for him to believe that these defendants were involved in that shooting episode.

    Mr. Allen H. Carter 
    Well, Your Honor, in the Harris case and also in the Cooper case, I have difficulty in saying where those statutes authorizing these searches merely -- I mean, merely because the statutes provides it, they can be impounded has anything to do with the Fourth Amendment guarantees of the search. 
    This, to me would seem to be that state's statute in conflict with the federal constitution would prevail but certainly it's not true and I have difficulty seeing how this makes any difference even in the Harris case or the Cooper case.

    I think the frank that these people when stopped said that it was an old bullet hole which was obviously contrary to the side of it as testified not only by Sheriff Powers but Sheriff Canon to the effect that it was fresh because it had absolutely no rust around it. 
    I think that this was in conflict with normal senses and so forth to this extent. 
    All of this evidence in this record stands uncontradicted concerning the fact that as to the opinion that Sheriff Canon had, he said that in his opinion that the shot have been made that very night. 
    All these stands uncontradicted and I think that the fact the bullet hole was in the rear of the automobile certainly gave rise to this matter of probable cause. 
    Not only was he stopped for reckless driving but he was stopped because the officer had reason to believe that this serious offense shooting in this home in this adjoining county had been committed.

    The Court says that so long as the State Tennessee there have been reasonable limits. 
    First, the police may search pursuant to a lawful arrest the person and the property of the person arrested for evidence of the crime for which he is arrested and for weapons which might be utilized for resistance in order to escape. 
    Now, if that is the -- if that's state correctly states the law applied here and if the correct states the limit of Tennessee law and I just one would have to conclude that the search here has to be justified in terms of the reckless driving arrest.

    In the petitioner's brief, they indicate that certainly that this issue is preposterous because throughout the proceedings that they were relying on a jury trial but nowhere in the assignments of error in the Supreme Court of Tennessee was a question of the Sixth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment ever raised, the only constitutional amendment, I'll say this, it was in the propositions of law in the brief which they presented they included it in the propositions of law. 
    But in the brief which followed it was not mentioned.

    Mr. Allen H. Carter 
    Yes sir. 
    Going further in the -- if I might, the matter goes as to whether or not these defendants were entitled to a jury trial in the state court. 
    For -- I mean, for the prosecution as such for contempt criminal contempt it's -- has long been the rule in that state and for many, many years is of course well knows was a law down to which you might call the Barnett case that under the criminal law that all courts have the right to -- I mean, punish some merely for violation of the court order or an order of its court. 
    Now, in the Sheriff case, the federal case why it provided of course that the six months was -- I mean was the ruling was of test. 
    In the case at bar the maximum penalty under Tennessee law was 10 days in jail and a $50.00 fine. 
    I mean, throughout the arguments presented by the petitioners they indicate that because what they did in the State of Tennessee was a felony that they were entitled to a jury trial but in effect what they were been tried for was the violation of the court order. 
    Now, there are some comment concerning the reason for the court order and so forth, I might point out that the injunction order which was handed down, which was issued in the case was an agreed order. 
    It was agreed on by the attorney's for the petitioners concerning the enjoinment of violence and so forth and this is a common practice in all states I think which have so-called right to work law so where the people who do not choose to strike continue to go to work then they're protected under the law from any harm that might come to them by people who are on the picket lines or elsewhere for that matter. 
    Now, in this case it -- I mean it goes back to a question as whether or not the Sixth Amendment applies to the states even in the jury trial through the Fourteenth Amendment and certainly it's our position that had this case a reason in the federal court system with the maximum penalty of 10 days in jail as provide by law and a $50.00 fine that in a federal system that this punishment would be -- I might say, this punishment would be proper under the Sheriff's case. 
    And to say that it would not be proper in the State of Tennessee where there is in some question is to whether or not the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendment apply to the jury trial question in state court. 
    It's somewhat difficult for me to comprehend in view of the fact that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment to the state court concerning jury questions are -- I mean is -- that is excuse me, questionable. 
    Now, --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3862.652" stopTime="3887.750">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you? 
    Assuming that in one of these cases I don't say there's any such thing possible or likely, assuming in one of the cases that's been argued this week, the Court should reach the conclusion the Fourteenth Amendment made this provision, jury trial provision applicable to the state, what would be your position then?
speaker="allen_h_carter" startTime="3887.750" stopTime="3972.945">
    Mr. Allen H. Carter 
    Well, I would say that under the Sheriff case where the -- it was permitted the six month since it was permitted they tried summarily without a jury. 
    I would say that that certain apply in this case where the maximum sentence is only 10 days and a $50.00 fine and I think that even if the Court did hold that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment were applicable to the states that under Sheriff -- I mean you would have the same result here they were not tried for jury trial. 
    Now, the cases goes back as concerning whether or not this car can be held as evidence and to whether or not the search under that question was -- I mean, was justified and it's the position of the respondent that under all the facts and circumstances of the case this search was reasonable and that the constitutional rights of the defendants were not or the petitioners were not violated by the search nor were they violated by the fact that they were not presented with the jury trial.

    Mr. Allen H. Carter 
    Yes sir. 
    They overrule as such concerning that testimony concerning this, the finding of this gun. 
    That's right. 
    They -- I mean the testimony was there that these officers had seen it that the ammunition which they found in the front seat of the automobile was comparative, I mean was the same type of ammunition which was found at the home into whose house the bullet was fired. 
    In other words, the same projectile and it was a different type projectile. 
    In other words, it was similar to attorney to a lawful projectile and that the sheriff testified that he had never seen anything like it but the one that was found at the home of where the shooting took place and the ones which were found in the front seat of the car were the same.
