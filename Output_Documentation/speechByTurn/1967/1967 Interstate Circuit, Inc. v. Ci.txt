    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    No sir. 
    The default judgment certainly should be taken but that leaves again free speech unprotected because a man takes one of these pictures and has a limited license a small fee --

    That is one that Mr. Nizer --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What seems to be what you're complaining about is some --
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="71.479" stopTime="104.633">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    No sir, what I'm complaining about if I may say is this that they talked about Freedman and they changed their position on Freedman. 
    Freedman's overall burden mentioned that prior Maryland case, that's the real thrust of this argument. 
    There, it mentioned Maryland versus United Artist and Board of Censors in 1956 and it admit -- it pointed out that the risk of delay was built into the only reported case in Maryland because it took six months from trial to final decision. 
    Now, six months was what mistaken there, the record of Viva Maria is eight-and-a-half months.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="104.633" stopTime="107.880">
    Justice Byron R. White

    That is correct, Justice.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, and what's your Freedman means then?

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What was it -- the interval from the time this picture was filed with this Board until the February 18th date when the trial court entered its judgment was how many days.
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="142.812" stopTime="149.506">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    February 18th, the picture was filed with the Board on the 9th of February, I believe.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="149.506" stopTime="157.007">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So that's nine days then from the time of filing with the Board until the trial court determination?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="157.007" stopTime="157.996">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Yes sir.

    Now, forgetting the other aspects on which you challenged --

    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Alright.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="161.251" stopTime="170.017">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- the Court, as a time interval, do you think that would come within Freedman in nine days?

    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    If the Court please, I would say, it would be close enough, I wouldn't argue.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="172.251" stopTime="182.972">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    So, on the time then your real complain I gather is that it then took upwards to better than eight months --
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="182.972" stopTime="183.606">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Yes sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="183.606" stopTime="185.795">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- before the appellate process was completed.
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="185.795" stopTime="186.667">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    That is true.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="186.667" stopTime="203.387">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now, do you find anything in Freedman that purports to say the states that they must so order their appellate processes as to give appellate review in these cases on a priority basis?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="203.387" stopTime="205.049">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    I would think so, if the Court please.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="205.049" stopTime="206.494">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Was there any thing in Freedman that says that?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="206.494" stopTime="211.592">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    I would think so. 
    Toward the end of the opinion, this Court did not only used words idly --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="211.592" stopTime="212.568">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I used it
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="212.568" stopTime="252.068">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    -- and I understand that. 
    But from final, the word “final” that came in here was expelled out. 
    Also, the opinion states to avoid the danger of an interim and possibly erroneous denial of a license. 
    Now, an interim is possibly erroneous denial of a license is exactly what may have happened to us here in Judge Taft's decision at the trial level. 
    But this term final judicial determination was understood by Maryland to advance and require an amendment of its statute which is done, that's reported in Trans-Lux that is cited in my brief. 
    Now, --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="252.068" stopTime="253.032">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what if --
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="253.032" stopTime="253.576">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    If I may --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="253.576" stopTime="261.035">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- would you say that -- could the Texas just say there will be no appeals at all under these cases from the trial court decision?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="261.035" stopTime="290.180">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Well, they could but we have the unique situation, Your Honor. 
    The legislature was in session in 1967, when Freedman came out, they did nothing. 
    But in 1967, they were in session again and on page 17 of my brief we have been managing general insurance agent site. 
    And that thing gives the priority to an insurance salesman's license. 
    The likes of which the First Amendment should get, it goes to the first docket at the trial court, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Supreme Court of Texas --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="290.180" stopTime="291.687">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I'm just wondering --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    If there is another -- if there isn't another problem involved here, on what can depend any order of this Court to the states that they must so order their appellate procedures in their highest courts as to determine appellate review in these cases before they determine anything else, capital cases or other cases that --
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="320.147" stopTime="320.316">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Well --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="320.316" stopTime="321.871">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- how do we do that?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="321.871" stopTime="333.670">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    -- I think it can leave Freedman as it was. 
    The Court there said it was not spending out the exact time but the spirit of Freedman was a prompt final judicial determination.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="333.670" stopTime="340.463">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And why does the City Council of Dallas doesn't have any power whatsoever to tell the Supreme Court of Texas --
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="340.463" stopTime="340.742">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="340.742" stopTime="342.568">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- as that you lack in any case, does it?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="342.568" stopTime="383.186">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    The exactly true if the Court please. 
    But if the State of Texas is what said about in Freedman and then Maryland how or whether Maryland is to incorporate the required procedural safeguards in the statutory scheme is of course for the State of Maryland to decide. 
    That's exactly true for Texas if they won't to avail themselves this. 
    The legislature could give these cases the priority equivalent to what it gave to the insurance agent. 
    That's all we're asking for from this -- when state policy gives the priority an insurance agent's license and it literally gives to the head of everything throughout the state.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="383.186" stopTime="389.858">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course the Freedman case involved, did it not, the denial of a license to exhibit the movie?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="389.858" stopTime="390.791">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="390.791" stopTime="406.008">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is not at all, is it? 
    (Voice Overlap) exhibit this movie and play it everyday for six months in Dallas ground out your projectors 24 hours a day as far as I know if you just put on it not suitable for children.
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="406.008" stopTime="435.898">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Well, if you put on it not suitable for children and we define a young person and define what they are in the broad principle as I mentioned earlier if the Court please. 
    In the broad principle, what is the difference between not suitable for 18 and not suitable for 16? 
    If I were to judge by standard or ask anyone else to how would I sensibly measure a difference and consider this book would pass for 18 but this book would not pass for 16.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="435.898" stopTime="450.070">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, there's some arbitrary about every age limit, how much differences there in voting between somebody who's 20 years and 11 months and 29 days and somebody who has a day older and yet that makes a four-year difference and when he can vote in a presidential election.
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="450.070" stopTime="456.982">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    That is true if the Court please. 
    I certainly agree with that but we're not called upon as we understand this is so restricted because --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="456.982" stopTime="464.015">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And this Court has never held that there was anything wrong about that 18-year-old evidence as ordinance, has it?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="464.015" stopTime="465.805">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    No. 
    They may --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="465.805" stopTime="469.640">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I don't quite see the relevance of your question, your hypothetical question.
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="469.640" stopTime="470.231">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Well, the relevance --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="470.231" stopTime="475.843">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In between in 18 and a 16-year-old cut off date. 
    This Court has never held that there's anything wrong with the 18.
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="475.843" stopTime="534.590">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    We say that relevance is this, if the Court please, we come to a relevant item because the City of Dallas set out to come under your clear-and-present-danger doctrine for 18 year olds, and obviously people who would be in a juvenile crime group would be at the senior part of this, they fell away from the 18 standard and went to 16. 
    16 is a little more appealing, but if we sustain this preset which they're holding for here, then we can immediately find 18, 19, or whatever age on up unto 21. 
    In the broad principle until there is some showing, we submit that it is time for -- enough to prove this before and to prove for example if there is such proof that this causes this crime way where there are some reason for restraint, but until that is done a presumption in favor of free speech. 
    That's what we're asking.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="534.590" stopTime="552.621">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, of course the First Amendment, I suppose, philosophically you would agree depends and grows from the concept of free choice. 
    Anybody is free to say or print what he wants and anybody is free to listen or to read what he wants.
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="552.621" stopTime="553.707">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="553.707" stopTime="569.415">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And free choice, I suppose, is that philosophy is on the premise of the capacity to make free choice to make choices. 
    And I suppose you and I would both agree that a child of 18 months doesn't have that capacity, wouldn't he?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="569.415" stopTime="570.776">
    Mr. Grover Hartt, Jr. 
    Certainly sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="570.776" stopTime="574.906">

    Why?
speaker="grover_hartt" startTime="620.304" stopTime="621.641">

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What is the final judicial determination? 
    Didn't you get a final judgment in the trial court?

    It was final in that sense. 
    But at the same time, when they spoke of the appellate judgment in the Maryland case of 1956, if the Court please, we understood that to mean both trial and appellate when they have said six months for trial in appellate --

    Well, anyway isn't that a difference in good sense between the way one would look at Freedman in terms of a total suppression or something, in a way one would look at Freedman in terms of an ordinance. 
    It says that children can't be allowed to view this. 
    Isn't there qualitative difference there? 
    Even if you assume, isn't it conceivable that you could have an arrangement that might offend Freedman if it were total suppression do you see?

    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Associate Justices, may I address myself to the latest question that was just raised. 
    This is about the right of the parent and the right of children. 
    This ordinance does provide, as we read it and as we interpret it and as the city council passed, that a parent, a guardian, a husband, or wife may take a child or a young person below the age of 16 years to a movie that is designated as not acceptable for young persons.

    It has the right to provide that they may take their children, why does a man have a right to provide that they shall not take their children?
speaker="n_alex_bickley" startTime="991.345" stopTime="1015.586">
    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    Mr. Justice Black, I believe Mr. Nizer stated yesterday that in his opinion they did have that right maybe to prohibit any of them from going any used as an example of pool halls which he likened to the right of assembly and he said you could prevent young persons from assembling in a pool hall.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1015.586" stopTime="1019.467">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You said, you could prevent them from attending any movie.
speaker="n_alex_bickley" startTime="1019.467" stopTime="1019.869">
    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    Yes, he said that.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1019.869" stopTime="1022.142">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Because you couldn't pick and choose the movie --
speaker="n_alex_bickley" startTime="1022.142" stopTime="1022.323">
    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    But you could not --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1022.323" stopTime="1023.432">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    -- that he can see?
speaker="n_alex_bickley" startTime="1023.432" stopTime="1024.555">
    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    -- pick and choose, this is correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1024.555" stopTime="1025.460">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That's what I understood you say.
speaker="n_alex_bickley" startTime="1025.460" stopTime="1121.698">
    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    Alright, yes, and I -- this is what I'd like to address myself to.He said but he likened it to the pool halls but he said that he would not accept the pool hall analogy because of the fact that this was based upon safety of the young person. 
    Now, it is with this argument that I would take disagreement because of the fact that preventing young persons from going in a pool hall is not a safety provision. 
    There is no danger of falling off a pool table or being injured in the pool hall. 
    It's the immorality that this is actually directed to because the YMCA's have pools in many cities and allow individuals to play young persons, to participate but under certain conditions. 
    Now, insofar as that applies here as to whether or not you can pick and choose, we think that actually it would be more unconstitutional not to pick and choose and it would to pick and choose for this simple reason, to prevent young persons under the age of 16 years from attending any movie would be the most blatant sort of the restriction on the freedom of speech.

    May a city attorney and may I answer you sir in an example which is a true example on the occasions in which I have before this Board actually fought with them and told them what this Court has held and what we think because of marginal situations they could not do and should not do and they have agreed to that and they have many instances, done things they did not want to do. 
    Personally, they disagreed with for this reason and we take this thing very seriously and for that reason we have attempted, it is true, we've got a situation here that may make some bad law because it is the marginal case. 
    But we have attempted to counsel with the Board and to work with them as officers of the Court and attempt to protect these First Amendment freedoms as best as we can but at the same time giving to the state the right to protect its young persons, if we can do that. 
    And we think that maybe this --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1512.852" stopTime="1547.832">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But particularly, in terms of the provisions of this ordinance, in terms of what it's aimed that preventing young people from seeing the way you describe the scene doesn't sound marginal in terms of the ordinance. 
    The ordinance supposedly attempts to keep young people from seeing precisely the kinds of things that you have said has earned this picture. 
    Now, what's marginal? 
    What so marginal about -- about these pictures because there's only one scene in the whole picture?

    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    No. 
    No, because there are only a very few scenes in the whole picture.

    Is this ordinance -- this ordinance, the way it's been applied or does it say on its face that a picture may be classified this way if it's in whole or in part.

    Mr. N. Alex Bickley

    Justice Byron R. White 
    If the picture -- if this picture were had a -- just a repetitious, just a whole of a lot of these sort of thing that you've been telling us about, you wouldn't think it would be marginal now?

    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    It's possible there would've been more sir, it's possible. 
    Insofar as the speedy remedy is concerned and the final judicial determination is concerned which was being discussed just a minute ago, I'd like to discuss it in a minute. 
    In these words, a careful reading of the ordinance of the City of Dallas will I think convince this Court of the very onerous burden that the city accepted upon itself in order that it might provide every remedy known and every opportunity for a speedy trial and speedy judicial determination. 
    Now, if final judicial determination as used in the Freedman case means by the highest court of the land and without appeal, then this body itself is the one the must give precedents to all these cases because this is the final bargain. 
    And so I think the case certainly did not mean that. 
    We get a final judgment before that trial court. 
    We get a judgment that is final and can be appealed from. 
    And that is a judicial determination. 
    Now, as to whether or not it's unconstitutional to require the movie industry, the exhibitors, as such to file a notice of nonacceptance before we go before that judicial tribunal. 
    I think this Court would not put upon us the burden of doing a vain fame because the movie industry itself does not walk the default judgment before the Court which --

    Did I understand it, do you say it's -- it's not certain as an abridgement if the government, state or municipal demands that somebody before they say something or show a picture, turn it over to the law to be looked at by Board? 
    Do you say that leaves the question of whether it's an abridgement of free speech?

    Well, no. 
    Not in that sense, sir. 
    Whether or not it means unfettered, unlicensed right to speak at any times under any circumstances under any condition and say what one thinks. 
    But I do not think that this is the interpretation that has been put upon that provision of the Constitution down through the years that there have been some abridgements that have been recognized as legal ones, as such. 
    Obscenity itself if the Constitution says --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2525.360" stopTime="2530.405">

    Mr. N. Alex Bickley

    The press is always present when they're discussing these movies, that the exhibitor and the producer or anyone else is requested and asked to come in, submit any evidence they want to, and present any ideas they might have about these movies. 
    And we think that this is the way it should be.

    Well, when the distributor submits a picture or an exhibitor does as the unsuitable for young persons as you say it that happened in 565 times, do they submit it as unsuitable in terms of the classification it has had in the distributor's private organization or do they submitted as unsuitable in terms of the Dallas ordinance?

    I can't -- I can't actually substantiate it one way or the other. 
    I would say this so, I'd say that the social opprobrium referred to by counsel does not attach to a label such as this. 
    It is not indirect censorship as he refers to in that particular manner and I would cite for an example, if I might, something that's well known to all of us and that is the bars where liquor is served and the fact that young people are not admitted to those, certainly does not prevent many people patronizing those bars.

    Well, the only punishment that can be given to a person of that age is to turn them over to move to juvenile authorities actually. 
    You cannot fine him. 
    You cannot put him in jail. 
    Really there's -- it's like many of our other juvenile halls, it's rather hard to enforce actually. 
    It would only be one of a number of things that would have to be proven maybe in a District Court later on to show that it was a delinquent or that maybe he was not properly taken care of by his parents and this sort of thing. 
    But this is about all you could do in a case like that.

    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    Knowingly permits him, that is correct and knowingly is a hard proposition but it must be proven. 
    It would have to be --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3715.973" stopTime="3719.064">

    (Voice Overlap) so suppose his father permitted him knowingly.

    Mr. N. Alex Bickley 
    No, there have not, Your Honor. 
    The one thing I think we need to keep in mind and I reiterate to the Court is the fact that we view this as a classification ordinance and not as a censorship ordinance because there is no restraint on the content of speech as such. 
    The only restraint is on the audience that may actually view this content.

    This Court would not be having to seat on, as many as it has to, at this particular time.

    And this is maybe -- this is maybe something that should be more closely drawn as you actually said in the Robel case when you're trying to decide between the validities of the two things, the legislative power on one hand and the individual rights on the other. 
    Maybe you draw a narrow line and maybe this is one of the lines we missed, we tried not to but it's possible. 
    And certainly we understand the intent of it.

    Mr. Bickley, I'm just wondering if it isn't -- but then the situation where neither the Board nor the Court makes any findings. 
    Now, I suppose you have four of your board members think that one scene in the picture takes it and the other five of it, don't think that one does but they do think another scene affects it, but they just put them together and say, “Well, it's bad”. 
    And then they go to the Court and the Court thinks well maybe the first one is alright, but the second one is wrong.

    Now, as to its application to this particular movie, I would assume that this Court as it has in some other situations I understand, may would want to see the movie itself to see whether or not it was properly applied because as I understand it, you must make that final decision.

    Thank you, sir. 
    The standards which this ordinance sets forth have in many areas already been rejected by this Court. 
    It might be worth the moment to look at the standards themselves. 
    In determining that a picture is not suitable for children, the Board must first determine whether the picture describes or portrays brutality, criminal violence or depravity or nudity or sexual promiscuity or extramarital or abnormal sex relations. 
    Second, if the picture describes any of these phenomena, the Board must determine whether the portrayal is such that it is likely “to insight or encourage” crime or delinquency or actual promiscuity in the part of the young persons. 
    Third, in determining whether it is likely to insight or encourage crime, delinquency and so on, the Board must determine whether there is in its judgment “a substantial probability that it will create an impression on young persons that such conduct is profitable, desirable, acceptable, respectable, trustworthy and commonly accepted.” 
    Now, identical of similar standards have been condemned by this Court and other courts as too vague to satisfy constitutional guarantees. 
    For example, “sexual immorality” People against Bookcase; “prejudicial to the best interest of the people”, the Gelling case; “Creating a harmful impression on the minds of children”, Paramount against Chicago stricken out; “Sexual immorality is desirable, acceptable, or improper patterns of behavior”, Kingsley stricken out, and some of these cases of course have dealt with the protection of children. 
    That doctrine that there may be variable obscenity has never been extended to mean that there can be variable vagueness and this statute is void and defective completely because of vagueness. 
    Just two or three other brief points, it has been suggested here for the first time that my client United Artist may protest and has standing before this Court. 
    That is not so at page 128 of the record without reading it subdivision 7, only in exhibitor may file a notice of nonacceptance, not a distributor and indeed the exhibitors as this Court has observed takes little to deter the exhibitor from going to this kind of a contest and that one occasion we've even had to threaten to sue the exhibitors so we've filed as nonacceptance so we could get an intervening application. 
    Second, with respect to the --

    Mr. Nizer, to what extent had distributors participated and submit in these voluntary submissions?
speaker="louis_nizer" startTime="5164.275" stopTime="5170.391">
    Mr. Louis Nizer 
    None at all. 
    And we have protested against them in many instances and we have no standing before the Board.

    Do you know how often the -- how often the -- let's say in the 565 submissions that unsuitable, how often those 565 correspondent with the distributor's classification of their own (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Louis Nizer 
    In very few, if any though I have not the statistics before me but I will go further Mr. Justice White. 
    The exhibitor has yielded against his will in these matters. 
    There is this matter of fighting the authorities of a community in which you live and depend upon the good will of it and this very existence of this ordinance is itself a suppression. 
    There would not have been 39 overrulings in the exhibitors who's finally saying this is alright with me when he submits a specific request for a suitable classification and it's overruled, and he says let's go along because he doesn't want to spend the money for counsel to come up here. 
    One other observation about the Freedman case which I think we owe to Your Honor, a candid statement about it. 
    We don't think that the Freedman case has been complied within consequently, this statute is void in any event in this application to the reasons I have given that you can have a complete final determination without any judicial participation here. 
    But I would -- I think we owe to this Court to be candid to say that the motion picture industry has never been able to adjust itself to the proposition that while other medias such as magazines, newspapers, television even comic books may not be restrained by prior consideration, prior submission that we cannot share that sunshine and that we stand in the shadow of a five to four decision which says that we alone, the motion picture industry comes into a special category. 
    We would therefore respectfully suggest now that this has demonstrated the ineffectualness of the Freedman case in attempting to modify the effects of the Times case that if we went on the cause --

    I think it was --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5314.333" stopTime="5316.127">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That -- that was not a five to four decision.
speaker="louis_nizer" startTime="5316.127" stopTime="5409.657">
    Mr. Louis Nizer 
    No, not that. 
    The Times case which puts the motion picture industry in the special category was and I merely observed that I think while the Freedman case was an admirable effort to avoid the abuse by these judicial requirements that nevertheless it hasn't worked. 
    Well, here we are on Viva Maria, if Your Honor if you see that picture you'll be shock that this picture could be caught in that kind of a net when it was intended for something else and next day it will be something else and then it will be as I've indicated a proliferation of these ordinances. 
    I wish to observe that while it is true that in this case there's no salary to these people, that in most of these proposals, they not only receives salaries but there is a fee for submitting the picture for their examination and you get the entire bureaucracy imposed upon this. 
    And I think that this will cause a great flood of this kind of case whereas if we -- if in dealing with this difficult question, if we subjected the restraint to at least to penal provisions or at most injunction and declaratory judgment with all the safeguards for a defendant with the presumption of innocence and beyond the reasonable doubt, then I think this perhaps might be held in control. 
    And the penal statute would get after the man that should get after some case where somebody is really trying to overstep the bounds of sensibilities of the American people. 
    This is not this case at all. 
    It doesn't even come up on obscenity.
