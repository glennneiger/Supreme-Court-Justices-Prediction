    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    33 and 34 on the docket, General Cox, you may continue with your argument.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="10.314" stopTime="837.605">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday, I thought the show that the classification made by the one year prior residence requirement. 
    Between old residence, on the one hand and new residence on the other, not only operates in relation to the fundamental necessities, rudiments of life. 
    But also, that it is utterly unrelated to any of the avowed purposes of the public assistance laws, because the favored and the disfavored are identically situated in relation to the kind or extended their need or the suitability of the ADC program for parallel programs as a remedy. 
    In the absence of relation to some irrational relation to some other state policy therefore, that is enough to make -- re-submit an equal protection case in the classic sense of the distinction between a redheaded man and brown headed man or any other capricious classification. 
    Now, I go on first this morning to point out that our case is stronger still because we have a situation in which the state has singled out for the purposes of this favor hospital treatment. 
    Those who exercise the fundamental liberty of moving to a new residence in pursuit of better opportunities, better life or what else they considered to be an advantage. 
    That discrimination we say, is not merely capricious but it is invidious in the same sense that discrimination on grounds of race or religion is invidious, and it also operates to deter the exercise of a right which underlies a number of the provisions of the constitution and of course, those provisions in turn, help to show that this is an invidious distinction. 
    That is one that our fundamental constitutional principles condemned. 
    I do want to emphasize that this line of thought brings me while it relies on the constitutional provisions dealing with freedom of migration. 
    It brings me back ultimately to the equal protection clause and to the Equal Protection Clause cases. 
    I stressed that because I think this analysis eases the Court's problem of decision and makes it unnecessary to break new constitutional ground in these cases. 
    For example, one does not have under these circumstances to face up to the question, what exact clause of the constitution do you find this in? 
    Equally, the fact that the District of Columbia's statute is involved is not relevant when one is talking about a classification as invidious as this. 
    Whereas, technically, it might be of significance, if one will rely on Article 4 Section 2 alone or on the privileges and immunities clause and the Fourteenth Amendment alone. 
    And again, one does not have to consider precisely how far Congress is entitled to define or limit of the privileges or immunities of United States citizens because certainly again, it is subject in its legislation to the Due Process Clause. 
    Now, we find the constitutional recognition or reflection of this basic liberty. 
    The constitutional condemnation -- underlying condemnation and discrimination between old -- discrimination between old and new residents in three or four familiar clauses of the constitution. 
    The first is Article 4, Section 2, which guarantees the citizens of any state should be entitled to the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several states. 
    In Blake and McClung this Court pointed out, that the underlying phases of that clause was that a citizen of one state should not be in a condition of alienage when he is within or when he removed to another state. 
    I suggest the old notion of the Elizabethan Settlement laws was precisely that one is in the condition of alienage when it comes to the new community. 
    The Commerce Clause as interpreted in Crandall and Nevada and the Edward's case incorporates or reflects at least to some extent this fundamental notion. 
    Indeed, it is interesting to recall that while in the Edward's case, the Court -- the majority opinion, did not consider how far a state was under an obligation to a Court the same benefits to immigrants that it accorded to all their residents because that was in front of it. 
    It did point out that the philosophy of the Elizabethan Settlement laws is the majority of opinions that is no longer in accordance with the facts. 
    Third, we find this basic notion again, reflected in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    There was considerable discussion when the 14th Amendment was under deliberation by the Congress about the right to move freely from place to place, freedom of locomotion. 
    I am not aware Justice Fortas although I haven't recently made a detailed search, I must confess. 
    I am not aware of any explicit mention of going from one state to another the discussion clearly did take place in terms of movement where you will and I should supposed that fairly interpreted that incorporated going from one state to another. 
    But I am not aware of any explicit mention of this before the Slaughter-House Case. 
    There, in the majority opinion, it is stated, it was referenced to the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment that one of the rights is this, it “is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State” and in the sense of course, this is history because the opinion was written within the memory event who had been alive and taking part in affairs at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was under consideration. 
    And finally, I recall that the Court -- that the guarantee of liberty in the Due Process Clause has been cited by such distinguished scholars as Zechariah Chafee or as a source of the right to move from state to state and as a limitation on the power of the Federal government to curtail that right. 
    Now in view of the fact that there is discrimination, not only is capricious in the sense that I argued yesterday, but operates to the disadvantage of those who are exercising a constitutional liberty, I suggest that a decision condemning that discrimination would be in accordance with settled constitutional principles. 
    Unless of course, and I now come to the last point, unless it can be shown to bear a rational relationship to some state objective other than that set forth in the legislation, because its perfectly clear that this discrimination does not fulfill any of the objectives set forth in the legislation. 
    In considering the various justifications that have been advanced, I would like to start by clearing the under branch, there are numbers that seemed to me, to one can dispose of very quickly, while there are others that perhaps requires somewhat further discussion. 
    First, it is said that this one year is delay; this discrimination is an aid in budgeting for a subsequent year. 
    No one has suggested how this aid's budgeting. 
    And I must confess although, I maybe wrong because I have never made up a welfare budget, I can't see how it would aid budgeting. 
    No one has a census of the people who come in during a year, who may go on welfare which they can later use as a basis for knowing who will be added to the roads for next year. 
    Indeed it is my impression that no one has a census of the number of people who move in to a state in any particular year even in (Inaudible) at least not ordinarily. 
    But so that the figures that might make the projection somewhat easier simply aren't available. 
    Second, there are other elements that enter into the prediction of the sides of the welfare roads such as the value of employment and other things of that kind. 
    It would overwhelm the significance of this relatively small figure of the number of people who have become bona fide residents who haven't been there a year and finally, I suggest that under Carrington and Rash and similar decisions of this Court, the slight administrative aid in convenience in budgeting even if it existed would not be adequate to justify discrimination as severe and hostile as this. 
    Second that is said, that this discrimination is justified because it will prevent people from presenting fraudulent claims to two or more states. 
    There's absolutely no showing of any likelihood of this kind of fraud. 
    The total errors checks indicate in the ADC payments for all kinds of eligibility run around 3% while a number of errors in fraud by making paid claims onto a state would be fantastically small and I may add that there other -- other checks and sources of money of course are made and this could be checked along with that. 
    A weight of deal, I think, to illustrate how farfetched this argument is, is to suppose that a state where to make it crime, I guess it is to seek welfare in two jurisdictions. 
    And in order to enact the subsection saying, whoever applies for aid within one year of moving into the state shall be presumed to be committing fraud by seeking payments from two states. 
    Even a prima facie rebuttable presumption of that kind without unquestionably be struck down as arbitrary and capricious the same way as in thought against the United States and other cases of that kind. 
    And finally on this point, I suggest to you that this is in principle squarely the kind of thing that Oyama forbids, that there that was created in arbitrary presumption that one was circumventing the California laws but with respect to who may hold agriculture premises and the Court said that California could not create an invidious discrimination against the American citizens of Japanese decent. 
    In order to deal with the few cases of fraud, that might otherwise be involved. 
    Third, it is suggesting that this rule provides an objective test of residence over this in the District of Columbia brief and it was suggested by Judge Holtzoff. 
    I think at this point one has to be very careful about what he means when he says that the requirement of one year residence provides an objective test of residency. 
    Residence under the Social Security Laws means residence means presence in the state, living there, not for a temporary purpose. 
    In other words, without the intention of going somewhere else.

    And to make sure that there's a case that falls suitable to the kind of aid that is being talked about. 
    But once those facts appeared as Justice Black's states them, although, I think that will be the most extraordinary. 
    I don't mean to shriek from answering you but they would be entitled to aid in both states.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="957.719" stopTime="963.683">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I know some who do and who might become objects of the public (Inaudible) --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="963.683" stopTime="1251.309">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I hope not Mr. Justice. 
    The part that I want to emphasize with respect to this test of residence is that one must ask what is it that you are trying to test. 
    I think that it lurks behind that expression and it seemed to me that this came out in Mr. Barton's argument yesterday. 
    The notion that we are really asking more permanency than being in the state voluntarily with no intention of living and if to the extent that something more lurks there but then our answer is simply that requiring to something more is itself an arbitrary and capricious classification. 
    To the extent that this is meant, the justification is alleged as being and just providing a test of who is a resident in the sense of which the HEW uses the term and the welfare laws use the term, that is voluntary presence with no intention to go. 
    Then we say, again this is -- it isn't a good test. 
    It's utterly -- arbitrary and capricious to say that whoever has lived in the state must be presumed to have an intention of presently living in the state. 
    We just know that isn't so and of course, there is no better proof that isn't so in many, many instances than these records. 
    Certainly little Shawn Brown, the baby, who haven't been born for more than a year ago had no greater intention to live the District of Columbia than his mother and the oldest member of the family, who qualified for the aid. 
    Certainly, Juanita Smith, the young woman who had -- who's family for generations had lived in Pennsylvania got away for a few years and then came back to rejoin her own family, which she'd promise to look out for can't, be said to have been likely to be planning to leave Pennsylvania just because she'd been away for a short time. 
    I mentioned in one other case, because it seems to me that not only bear out this point but illustrate some others. 
    The other plaintiff from the Pennsylvania case was Jose Foster. 
    She had four children, had been on aid in Pennsylvania. 
    The reason she left to go to South Carolina was to take care of some old aged and sick parents, and as long as she, which incidentally involved to cut in any welfare benefits. 
    After they reached the point where she could no longer help them, she went back to Pennsylvania, were now to presume because she hadn't been back a year that she intended to live again is I submit to you, utterly absurd. 
    Again, I think if this was stated in the form of a presumption, it should be presumed that any person who hasn't been a resident for a year intends to live or is a drifter. 
    That one would say, of course, that is arbitrary and capricious and it's equally arbitrary and capricious when it's advanced as a test. 
    I would add two more points although, I think they're unnecessary. 
    It must be remembered that we are dealing with the statute where there is an elaborate process of verification with respect to other conditions of eligibility involving not only elaborate questionnaires or visits to the home, surveillance in many jurisdictions, checking on references. 
    If that can be done with the respect to other conditions of eligibility but it certainly can be done with equal ease with respect to this better, of whether the signs of the person intends to live, and so again I suggest that the cases like Carrington and yet Rash and Oyama and California, Harman and Forssenius, all sustain our position that this won't do as a justification.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1251.309" stopTime="1282.340">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Cox, perhaps some other clearity and at least so it seems to me is that in these circumstances a state's payment ceased when the person goes ahead with this -- by hypothesis, surreptitious and concealed intention to leave the state so that the state's interest perhaps in continuation of residence, maybe less than it is and some other circumstances.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1282.340" stopTime="1373.492">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That's the point I confess Your Honor, I hadn't thought of, but it seems to me and to be entirely valid, it also does recall to my mind another point and that is of course the person who does the leave the former state. 
    If this rule can stand, it's likely to fall into a gap, and not get welfare anyway. 
    This isn't a matter of retaining your rights in the place that you have left. 
    The last of the arguments that I regard is very easily brushed aside is the suggestion that the purpose is to limit assistance to those who have made a contribution to the community or who have some investment in the community. 
    Well I don't how we measure the matter of contribution or investment in the community. 
    I suggest that this is really a euphemistic way of expressing the same discrimination against strangers or outsiders. 
    I don't see how in the Brown family, anybody can say that one of the children and the mother had an investment in Washington or had made a contribution to the Washington and the others haven't. 
    But remember, we're talking basically here about the aid to dependent children and the whole notion of investment in the community. 
    It seems to me as I said before to be simply euphemism.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1415.424" stopTime="1431.251">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I have thought that that was at least of the supports purportedly asserted about forward for voting residence requirements, a knowledge of the community and knowledge of the people -- (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1431.251" stopTime="1431.777">

    Oh, a knowledge --

speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1435.950" stopTime="1499.274">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, I think we're using -- I was using investment in more in the sense of what one had contributed to the community and was not focusing as you suggest on concern for the community, interest in the character of the community. 
    I would certainly agree that in the latter case this might well be justifying consideration. 
    But I suggest it is not relevant here, because there is no -- I don't think one can use this kind of benefit any more than one may use schools or fire or police protection, as a reward for what people have been supposed to contribute. 
    I would say that the emphasis was on the knowledge and familiarity with the problems in -- that you do express opinion on and choose candidates to deal with that was relevant if voting the residence requirement is to be justified.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, except that the constitution itself introduces that distinction that it occurred to and perhaps will occur to Your Honor that this rather like the arguments that were made in connection with the apportionment cases about the senate of the United States. 
    The fact is, that the constitution itself says that qualification to vote for local people shall be the standard of qualification to vote for the president. 
    Now whether the Congress could change that or not, I'm not prepared to say.

    No, but the constitution -- (Voice Overlap)--
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1658.150" stopTime="1668.146">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But you stressed in your argument on the fact that this is discrimination because they don't like people and because they're -- they're not of their own --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1668.146" stopTime="1836.915">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, but I don't that I can argue that the Equal Protection Clause repeals the provision of the constitution, dealing with the qualifications of electives for the presidency and the constitution itself says, that those who should be qualified to vote for president, shall be those qualified to vote for the most numerous branch of the state legislature. 
    And in terms of that consideration, as suggested in the colloquy with Justice Stewart, it does seem to me that there is an argument, I don't have to either espouse or reject it, but there is an argument not present here that goes to justify the rationality of the classification for that purpose and then the other clause about qualifications for president operates on it automatically. 
    So that -- I think Your Honor's case, Mr. Chief Justice, would be a very analogous one if it weren't for perhaps, what today seems like an odd constitutional query and my answer, were it not for that quirk, I suspect would have to be very different although, I don't want to pin myself to it. 
    Now there's a group of (Inaudible) that I want to lump together because once again, I think it's very important to be exact about in our terminology. 
    It is said in this group of (Inaudible) that the state might protect its financial possession that it may deter the poor from entering the state and that it may prevent the movement of indigents into the states for the purpose of securing welfare payments. 
    Again, I think one has to be exact about what it means to the extent that this is simply an argument that it would cost us traditional money to give welfare to residents for less than a year. 
    But the answer is that the cause won't excuse a classification which otherwise violates the constitution. 
    A state could say that discrimination against black mothers and children would save us money, but nobody would think of advancing that as a justification for the invidious and hostile classification or discrimination on grounds of religion that might save money, probably save South Carolina a little bit of money in Sherbert and Verner.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Yes, yes. 
    Except again, I point out that ours isn't barely capricious, it's invidious or hostile. 
    But the point Your Honor (Inaudible), of course true. 
    I do think in view of the figures that have been cited to the Court however, it might be pertinent for me to take just a minute to say something about the matter of cost here. 
    Although, I don't want to retreat from my position, that it's constitutionally irrelevant. 
    I think in view of the arguments, the Court might be concerned. 
    The effect of the deletion of the residence requirements obviously will differ very greatly from state to state because of the current trends of migration. 
    And I must also make it very clear that in my judgment of figures on this are hard to come by and are not all together reliable. 
    I don't want to seem to be saying to the Court anything more than here's the best indication we have. 
    In Pennsylvania, the welfare authorities estimated that the elimination of the requirement would add one half of one percent in public assistance, chiefly ADC. 
    A point of fact during the period in which the injunction was operating and therefore the requirement couldn't be applied. 
    The increase I am told will grant only half of that, one quarter or one percent. 
    In Connecticut, the figures is somewhat more, that's a state where -- what they and other concerns advertise very widely all over New England that looking for people to work there, and people who are coming into Connecticut to getting jobs and then encountering misfortune. 
    There, the figures seemed to be slightly less than two percent, 1.7 on one period of time when Connecticut had no residence requirement and 1.9 on another set of figures. 
    Illinois, our information is that during two months in which the operation of the residence requirement of the state that it was something less than 3% of the applications, not the people on the roles of the applications which would be a much lesser figure that came from people who haven't been resident for a year. 
    In the District of Columbia, the applications of people who haven't been in the District a year during the past nine months have run in the neighborhood of 8%, a little over 8%.

    I think Your Honor would find that in terms of people who end up with ADC care, that it's the District of Columbia and New York City that would be the highest states or because there the flow of migration of the people who end up with ADC care is for the most part from the rural areas and very largely from the South into those areas.

    Well, I suggest to you the explanation is that the general movement of population is not the same as the movement of the population that ends up or as I put it, on the ADC role that these had indeed -- I can't help suggesting that this has something to do with the character of this discrimination against new residents. 
    The story from the New York Times, it was distributed by counsel for the appellees yesterday, has as its headline, South Fostering Relief Rise Here and I think the implication, the effect of South Fostering Relief Rise Here and in fact the connection between this and the residence requirement in many jurisdictions is quite clear.

    But the state's resources and keeping the state's natural resources within the state it seems to me to be a somewhat different problem. 
    I think our case is more like the case put by Justice Douglas yesterday of saying, “We're going to exclude the children of new comers from the schools.”

    No, I think the out-of-state tuition differs in a number of respects. 
    In the first place, you are dealing not with one of the basic necessities in life, college education, important as it is, isn't quite in that classification yet. 
    But second, you're dealing with a group of people --

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Yes, well I suggest that that is one possible distinction and it entirely tenable, I think as tenable one, I think the constitution is concerned with differences of degree. 
    I think a second possible distinction is that when you're talking of college students, you're talking of people who go into the state. 
    It's rather likely non-resident hunter that Justice White and I would describe. 
    The student goes in simply for the purpose of picking up this education.

    If he has such a case, and there are students who have such case, then I think, he may well be able to attack successfully the discrimination against him and there are cases cited in our brief including a case in Iowa which hold that that kind of discrimination is unconstitutional.

    But there, I think another factor comes into play and that is, that the -- in that case, where the payment may be regarded -- or as and this is another application of the college case, may be regarded as roughly related to the amount of contribution that I and my family would make directly or indirectly in Texas to the schools in Wayland and I ought to do something roughly equal if I'm going to send my child to (Inaudible)

    We argue two more things with respect to this poor people moving into the state. 
    First, that there is no evidence that people move in the states for the purpose of taking advantage of welfare requirements. 
    And if, Your Honors as we look at this newspaper story that was given to you by our counsel through appellees. 
    You'll see that the main points it stresses is that there is no evidence that people do not move for that purpose

    Is that the only evidence you have general?

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    We had -- I had hoped to have time to develop the figures. 
    All the evidence we have tends to show that there has been very little movement for this purpose, but the point I think, the important point to emphasize is that the appellees who invoke this justification have nothing to support and I suggest that in dealing with a discrimination or with respect to the fundamental necessities of life and it runs against the stranger who is likely to be the victim of invidious treatment and in dealing with a discrimination against those who are outside the state and who are because of their poverty are not fully represented in the political process. 
    It's something more than common assertion is necessary to show that people go into the state for this purpose.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    The additional point that I would make that while I think no discrimination can be justified on the assumption that the higher relief payment operates has a magnet and I would stick on that ground. 
    I do suggest to the Court that even if it'd be assumed for the purposes of argument that a state might deal with this problem in an appropriate way, that this way of dealing with it is unconstitutional or because it is excessively broad and not to measure, at least, restrictive of the exercise of a constitutional liberty. 
    I point out that it's excessively broad in a number of respects. 
    First, it applies the one year residence requirement even to people who have come from states with lower or equal benefit levels. 
    Even to people who have come from states with higher or equal benefit levels and indeed that what finds the residence requirement more uniformly in the states that have the lowest benefit levels. 
    Second, it applies to people who come for reasons that demonstrably are unrelated to the benefit level and the facts to these cases are the best illustration of that. 
    Well, five out of seven were coming back where they've lived before, another five out of seven were coming to join families and of course, most people moved for hope for jobs (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well of course that itself, in itself, would eliminate any problem with this kind. 
    The third respect in which I suggest that this particular requirement is to demonstratively too broad is that, in addition to the other two, is it if when really we're concerned with this, it could be cured by saying that the new comer shall be entitled to receive only the benefits of the state from which he came.

    I'll take advantage of the five minutes just to call the Court's attention to one other fact but also, I have really completed my argument. 
    There was a talk yesterday about the welfare freeze that takes effect with respect to ADC aid of July 1, 1969 unless it's put off again as it has been before. 
    Without going into all the complexities, the Congress made two exceptions to that. 
    One was to cover -- people added to the roles because the decision of this Court in Smith and King, King against Smith. 
    And second, it provided an exception to take care of the resident's cases in the event that the judgments of the district court should be affirmed, but so that there is no problem of the operation of the freeze and the decision in these cases of creating a need for new legislation. 
    Also, I don't think really that would justify a violation of the constitution.

    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    If I understand correctly the entire meaning and scope of the argument which has been presented on behalf of the appellees in this case, it is to end finally and completely for all purposes really, residency as a distinction capacity whereby the states can determine who can and who cannot qualify in certain areas. 
    And I think that what has been suggested to this Court is that residency, for purposes perhaps of voting, residency as a condition before a person may file a complaint for divorce, residency as a condition and whereby, certain students pay tuition to public schools, universities and certain do not, perhaps even residency requirements to the extent that a state has legitimate interest in knowing who is going to be a hunter and who can operate an automobile in the state or to be now ended because that certainly is the logical conclusion of the argument which has here been presented. 
    And it does I suggest --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    When you're talking about residence, are you talking about duration?
speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3351.750" stopTime="3373.363">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    That's right and durational residency has been and historic basis whereby, the states have been able to determine who can and who cannot participate in the extent that they can participate in activities within the state.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well Mr. Attorney General, I gather you say that it doesn't -- in Pennsylvania, the residency, so-called residency requirement, when it says that since it may be granted only if a person has resided there for one year, it means that that person has to become a resident in the sense of arriving and not intending to leave. 
    Then he has to remain in that condition for a year. 
    Isn't that the meaning of the Pennsylvania law?
speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3404.851" stopTime="3419.379">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    I think that the Pennsylvania law as the federal statute suggests that there is residency and there also is a year requirement. 
    I believe that's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3419.379" stopTime="3423.419">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you could be there a year and still not get benefits?

    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    I suppose if under certain circumstances, it --

    Well, do you have to be a resident?

    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    It will determine that you were not a resident. 
    But I would say this, that certainly, the administrators of the federal and the estate programs would be justified in coming to the conclusion that a person who had been there a year, almost in all circumstances that was a resident (Voice Overlap) --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- under your law, a person could prove that he is a resident and he still is entitled to benefits.

    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    If that person has not resided within the commonwealth for a year, that's correct.

    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    Oh I think that --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Has it anything to do with checking residency or things like that?
speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3482.305" stopTime="3538.197">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    I think that that the primary purpose for which the law was passed and I think this is one of the things that the argument which has been presented by the appellee has not mentioned at all, actually. 
    What is the purpose? 
    What -- what was the legislative purpose for enacting these welfare statutes in the first place? 
    Was the legislative purpose simply to give out money? 
    And it is not. 
    The legislative purpose as it's spelled out in the Pennsylvania law is of course to encourage self-respect, self-dependency and the desire to motivate the individual to be a good and useful citizen in society. 
    It is to encourage him to go work and not simply --

    That is the judgment which both the Congress and the legislatures of the states have made that one year is an adequate time in order to determine this --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    General, really in terms of the legislative history of the Pennsylvania law, would you say that the dominant and the primary purpose of the one year requirement in Pennsylvania was to avoid the burden that -- in migration of indigence created on the treasury of the state?
speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3584.187" stopTime="3587.251">
    Mr. William C. Sennett

speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3593.530" stopTime="3606.789">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    I suggest to the Court that the primary purpose is what I have just indicated that the legislature has determined that there should be this welfare program.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Yes.

    What's the purpose of the one year limitation?
speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3613.785" stopTime="3633.154">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    The purpose is to encourage the individual who comes into Pennsylvania to be a citizen and contribute to the society of the state, to contribute to the economy of the state and to become a permanent part of that state's economy and social life.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3633.154" stopTime="3635.926">

speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3635.926" stopTime="3685.098">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    Yes, that -- that is what the legislature has determined. 
    Now on the one hand, it is admitted that the State's apparently could adopt the past legislation which would allow them a reasonable time to determine whether or not a person is a resident. 
    Reasonable time -- what is a reasonable time? 
    Is this Court now going to say that a state could have a reasonable time to determine residency? 
    And that that reasonable time might be three or four months but not one year in the face of the almost unanimous judgment of the legislature of 40 states and of the Congress that one year (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3685.098" stopTime="3709.250">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is there anything, anywhere in the literature that indicates that it takes a year to take a check the bona fides of a claim of residence? 
    This is a new way to put the argument, first time I've heard this one. 
    Are you suggesting that it does that the justification for legislation is that it takes a year to check the bona fide's residence?
speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3709.250" stopTime="3750.741">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    What I was saying is that on the one hand, it is admitted apparently that the states should have a reasonable time within which to determine whether or not a person is a resident and they admit that. 
    But on the other hand, it is unreasonable, capricious and arbitrary for the states to say, “Because a person hasn't been in a year, that welfare -- that these payments can be denied.” 
    And I think that that is an inconsistent position and that inconsistency should not be the basis for this Court's determination that the statute is unconstitutional.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3750.741" stopTime="3767.431">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    (Inaudible) assume the possibility of determining your residency before you're there a year because you've got to know when it starts. 
    You don't only have to reside (Inaudible) be a resident, but then you have to stay there a year.
speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3767.431" stopTime="3768.106">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3768.106" stopTime="3772.865">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And so this assumes that before the time ever starts to run, you determined that you're a resident.
speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3772.865" stopTime="3774.671">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    I'm not -- I'm not indicating to the Court.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3774.671" stopTime="3789.707">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I thought you've indicated that this year's residence requirement was not for the purpose of some administrative aid in determining resident, but really was aimed and had a substantive purpose of encouraging people to go to work.
speaker="william_c_sennett" startTime="3789.707" stopTime="3842.364">
    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    That's -- that's exactly right. 
    The only reason that I'm mentioning that is to show that in my judgment, it is inconsistent on the one hand, this side of the state should have a reasonable time and on the other hand to say that a one year is completely arbitration or arbitrary and capricious. 
    But -- but I do think it is important to emphasize that the states do have a legitimate purpose in encouraging people to participate in the community and certainly, the legislatures have -- in furthering that determined that an individual should be in the society for a year in order to fulfill that particular purpose. 
    That is a purpose, in my judgment, which goes beyond the other purposes which have been mentioned here today.

    Might I also suggest to the Court that in order to strike down the statutory determination of the legislatures in these cases. 
    It is going to be necessary as I indicated to strike down Section 402(b) of the Social Security Act and I refer the Court to Simkins versus Moses Cone Memorial Hospital in which the circuit court, this Court denied sir, in which the circuit court had under consideration stayed regulations in a federal statute. 
    And the federal statute had to do with the providing by the federal government of Hill-Burton funds for hospitals in the states. 
    And the federal statute, together with the state statute and the regulations, authorized separate but equal hospital services and the Court declared the federal statute unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment citing Bolling versus Sharpe and the course declared the state statute and regulations unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    But again, that was a discrimination case based upon race. 
    And I mentioned the case because I submit it is authority for the proposition that where we have as in this case, a federal statute which directly authorizes residency requirements, that it would be necessary for this Court, not only to strike down the legislation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but also of the Federal Congress.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    A federal statute contains this kind of a judgment. 
    You could still say whether it's an issue in the case or not that Congress has made a judgment.

    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    Yes, that's correct Justice White and I think you can make that but I also think that it is a support to our case to say that for this Court, first of all, this Court historically has said it will give greater deference to acts of the Congress. 
    And secondly, I think that test as to discrimination rises higher in a Fifth Amendment situation than it does in a Fourteenth Amendment case. 
    Finally, it just let me say that as we point out in the very last two pages of our brief that the logical result of what appellees asked this Court to do is to end all type of discrimination and all of type of welfare statutes. 
    Remember, all of the statutes that we mentioned yesterday with regard to all types of welfare programs have residency requirements therein. 
    In addition, is this Court now prepared to establish that welfare really is a right and that in making a program to carry out the distribution of that right to citizens that there can be no discrimination at all that persons under 65 who are not blind or disabled, who do not belong in families with dependent children, but are frequently in dire need must -- the states now provide a welfare for them? 
    What is the result of ending this type of discrimination and I suggest that the entire welfare program which has been adopted by the states and the federal congress does have discrimination included therein. 
    We don't give welfare except if you happen to meet the particular requirements, if you happen to be blind or disabled or over 65, but what about the people who are not? 
    Is this Court now prepared to say that the welfare right must be extended to everyone without any discrimination whatsoever? 
    I don't that the Court has ever gone that far. 
    I'm sure it hasn't and I suggest it will do so in this case. 
    And finally, I direct the Court's attention to Katzenbach versus the Morgan in which this Court upheld Section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act and struck down the New York statute. 
    But at the same time admitted that Section 4(e) which referred to American Flag Schools was in itself discriminatory, nevertheless, a valid exercise of legislative prerogative.

    Mr. William C. Sennett 
    I think it rest on both grounds. 
    In other words, we have spelled out that one of the legitimate purposes of the Pennsylvania statute is a budgetary requirement that limited resources are available and these can only be distributed, should only be distributed in a certain way that that is a legitimate purpose, that the budgetary requirements of the Commonwealth, in order for us to determine how much money is going to be available for welfare. 
    That is also legitimate purpose. 
    Thank you.
