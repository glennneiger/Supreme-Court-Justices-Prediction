    Number 410, Gary Duncan, appellant versus Louisiana. 
    Mr. Sobol.
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="22.893" stopTime="120.440">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Louisiana. 
    And it raises the issue that was to a logic stand assumed in the case immediately preceding, namely whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment secures the right to trial by jury in state criminal proceedings. 
    The appellant in this case was charged in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana with the crime of simple battery, which is defined in the Louisiana Code, as the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another without a dangerous weapon. 
    This offense in Louisiana includes all batteries other than those committed with a dangerous weapon and is punishable by two years imprisonment without hard labor and a $300.00 fine. 
    In Louisiana, there are four categories of crimes for purposes of trial by jury. 
    In capital cases only, a jury of 12 all of whom must concur in a verdict is provided, that is the common law constitutional jury. 
    In cases in which imprisonment must be at hard labor, a 12-man jury is provided, but nine jurors are sufficient to return a verdict. 
    In cases in which imprisonment may be at hard labor, a five-man jury is provided and included in that category are such serious crimes as aggravated criminal damage to property which is punishable by 15 years, aggravated battery punishable by 10 years in forgery punishable --

    Must the five-man jury be unanimous?
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="122.613" stopTime="127.223">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Yes it must. 
    The fourth category and that in to which this case falls --

speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="137.319" stopTime="177.995">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Yes sir. 
    And whether it says may be at hard labor or must be at hard labor would determine whether it's a five-man jury unanimous or a 12-man jury, nine of whom must concur. 
    The fourth category of crimes in Louisiana, and that in to which this case falls, the cases in which no provision is made in the statute for hard labor and the Constitution of Louisiana and Article 779 of the Criminal Code expressly provides that there shall be no jury in such cases. 
    And that category includes such serious crimes as aggravated battery resulting from the breach of the peace which is punishable by 10 years, simple battery, the crime in this case punishable by two years, and aggravated assault punishable two years.

    Would it be possible to send a man to jail for 10 years without a jury of trial?
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="188.638" stopTime="194.446">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Yes sir, under a charge of aggravated battery resulting from a breach of the peace, I should make clear that's not this case. 
    But that is --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="194.446" stopTime="195.533">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, I understand that.
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="195.533" stopTime="261.170">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Yes sir, because that is a misdemeanor in Louisiana because there's no provision in the statute for hard labor. 
    That is the division and I want to call that point of the Court's attention because there's a good deal of use of the word “misdemeanor” in a federal constitutional sense as if it means something when of course, I think it's clear in light of this record that it does not. 
    That the inquiry of the Court must be to the essential elements of the crime and the potential maximum imposed. 
    Because of the condition of Louisiana Law, therefore, there was no right to trial by jury under Louisiana Law on the charge against the appellant. 
    But not withstanding Louisiana Law, he filed a demand for trial by jury before trial basing his contention on the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to United States Constitution. 
    This demand was rejected by the trial judge expressly on the ground of state law and the case was tried to a judge. 
    Witnesses were presented on both sides; four witnesses for the prosecution and three witnesses for the defense. 
    There was a factual dispute as to whether a battery had been committed. 
    The judge resolved the factual dispute in favor of the state and found the appellant guilty.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="261.170" stopTime="263.999">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What's the maximum sentence to this crime?
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="263.999" stopTime="494.933">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    The maximum potential sentence is two years and a $300.00 fine. 
    He got two months and a $150.00 fine with a provision that if the fine was not paid, 20 additional days would be added. 
    The appellant was released on $1500.00 bond pending appellant procedures in the Supreme Court of Louisiana and in this Court. 
    An application for a writ of certiorari was made to the Supreme Court of Louisiana which refused to hear the case holding in a memorandum opinion appearing on page 14 of the record, that there was no error of law in the ruling complained of. 
    Now it is, of course, the premise of appellant's position in this Court that simple battery as defined under Louisiana Law is a crime and not a petty offense within the meaning of the petty offense exception to the Sixth Amendment jury trial right. 
    We think this point is quite clear but appellee takes exception and argues extensively to the contrary, and I would like briefly to deal with that question. 
    The court has it seems to me fashioned three independent tests for the determination of whether a charge constitutes a crime or a petty offense. 
    And there are clear indications in the cases specifically D.C. against Colts, and D.C. against Clawans that anyone of these tests being satisfied would take an offense into the crime rather than the petty offense category. 
    The three tests alright, it seems to me the potential maximum sentence and I think Cheff against Schnackenberg, and D.C. against Clawans and Cheff's reliance on 18 U.S.C. 1 makes clear that the Court has at least adapted the six-month rule on that question and has indicated that any offense regardless of other factors where the potential maximum is over six months would be considered a crime for the purpose of interpretation of a Sixth Amendment jury guarantee. 
    In fact I think the question is left open by D.C. against Clawans as to whether that maximum may not be somewhere beneath that. 
    In Clawans, the Court held that three months for an offense that was clearly otherwise a petty offense which was selling unstamped (Inaudible), that they said three months is not free from doubt as to whether three months is too much and reserved the question as to whether any more than that, but I think the very least Cheff makes clear that six months is the upper most maximum. 
    Secondly, the Court has referred particularly in D.C. against Colts to the test of whether the crime was in diabolic common law and in our brief, we discussed the common law authorities and our main brief and reply brief which we think clearly indicates that battery was an indictable offensive at common law. 
    And the third test is the test of Malum in se interesting for malum prohibitum and I think there can be a little doubt that the charge of intentionally using force and violence upon the person of another is malum is a crime which is malum in se within the meaning of that term. 
    Now in order to avoid the logic and I think the inevitable thrust of the Court's decision in this area, the appellee has argued that Cheff against Schnachenberg has abrogated these tests and instead, has created a test which looks to the sentence actually imposed. 
    The argument essentially is the appellant's right to a jury trial at the beginning of the trial depends on the sentence imposed by the Court at the end of the trial. 
    In response to that let me say that Cheff was an expansion of the jury trial right without meaning to get into the controversy of the preceding cases to whether that was a constitutional expansion or a supervisory power expansion. 
    It was an expansion and it applied to jury trial right to an area where it had not previously been applied by the Court. 
    I think in that background, it is hard to interpret Cheff as severely contracting the jury trial right, narrowing the jury trial right in all non-contempt cases which the Court would certainly be doing if it substituted the prior existing test for one that looks to actual sentence. 
    But more important than that, I think there was a practical problem in Cheff that induced the Court to look to the --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="494.933" stopTime="497.671">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What's that last thing you said Mr. Sobol?
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="497.671" stopTime="523.034">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    I said I think it would be odd to interpret Cheff where the Court went further and applied the jury trial right in an area where it had not been applied before. 
    To mean that in the non-contempt area, the right would be radically constricted because a test that looks to actual sentence imposed is one which would provide even if it could be implemented, jury trial in thought fewer cases than a test based on the maximum potential.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="523.034" stopTime="544.691">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And that I gather you mean, Mr. Sobol, that would have to be in the federal system. 
    That in fact that argument would mean what you say that in the federal system no matter how much of a sentence that the statute has permitted a maximum, if in fact the sentence imposed was something less than six months and then there was no right to jury trial.
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="544.691" stopTime="546.293">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Your Honor, I believe that is the argument of the appellee.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="546.293" stopTime="549.282">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="549.282" stopTime="626.177">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Secondly, the Court was faced with a practical problem in Cheff and that there is no potential maximum sentence in contempt in federal courts. 
    And that if the rule was based on potential maximum sentence, the Court would be faced with a situation where it would be applying the jury trial the right to every contempt no matter how minor. 
    Now that was the position contended for by some members of the Court, but one could understand why the Court would want to not reach that position in Cheff. 
    I think the practical problem is very important there. 
    But I think the most important consideration about Cheff is mechanically the rule is workable in the contempt situation, because the trial judge is required to issue the rule to show cause with a citation, before the contempt, the criminal contempt proceeding begins and therefore, has occasion to determine based on his analysis of the facts presented to him whether there is a likelihood of an imposition of sentence in excess of six months. 
    Of course in a non-contempt regular criminal trial area, there is no occasion. 
    We think the rule in Cheff, if that is a rule that could not possibly work in any other area. 
    And we think for those reasons, Cheff is not applicable to the determination of the petty offense crime question in this case. 
    In sum we think that on the basis for the Court's decision, this case is clearly a crime.

speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="667.346" stopTime="703.338">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    There is a constitutional category of petty offenses carved out by this Court. 
    I think it's clear that that category is as not as clear cut and plain as it might be. 
    And I think if the Court is going to apply the jury trial rights to the states, the Court is obligated to make plain what the line would be. 
    And I would propose as a rule to adopt the rule of the Court seems to be moving to in Cheff, which is to take the definition in 18 U.S.C. 1. 
    And it perhaps except in extraordinary circumstance where an offense with a potential less than six months might for some reason be considered a crime, say that anything over six months would definitely be considered a crime.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="703.338" stopTime="714.063">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well now, let's see where we are then. 
    What you're suggesting is that, we say that the Sixth Amendment guarantee of jury trials applies to the states.

    Yes sir.

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    If we can assume --

speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="733.285" stopTime="737.563">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    In Cheff, the Court was talking about the actual, but it was referring to the petty offense definition of the U.S.C.

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="746.688" stopTime="767.338">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In other words, we are to lay down a rule that's applicable to all of the states in which we say that if a potential sentence exceeds six months, then the jury trial requirement of the Sixth Amendment has to be observed by each state?

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Your Honor, that's the position we're contending for. 
    But I would like to make this reservation in the right to counsel area, which I think presents similar practical problems. 
    The Court in Gideon did not choose to make plain at the time Gideon was decided, the lower most reach of the right and indeed, the Court has declined on subsequent occasions to make that determination clear. 
    I'm referring to the denial of certiorari in Winters against Beck. 
    I think there is a certain advantage to that procedure in an area where the Court is not fully aware, or may not be fully aware of the practical problems it may be reaching. 
    Judge Jones in the Connell v. Moore in the Fifth Circuit said that he sees the logic of applying the right to counsel on --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now I want to ask you another question. 
    Does your analysis mean that the states would have to adopt a 12-man jury system and unanimous verdict?
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="840.265" stopTime="842.247">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol

    It does?
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="843.088" stopTime="844.043">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Yes sir, on that point --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="844.043" stopTime="852.974">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In other words the Louisiana System, jury system, would have to give way to the federal system?
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="852.974" stopTime="894.564">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Yes sir. 
    I look at the issue of scope of the decision really in two ways, if I may pursue this for a moment. 
    One is the question as to when there is a case to which the Court holds the Sixth Amendment jury right applies whether it earmarks the jury and I think the Court has so often held that when the Constitution uses the word jury, it means a certain thing. 
    In Patten against the United States, the Court said “An 11-man jury is not a jury. 
    It's just the same as no jury at all.” 
    And there is a great deal of authority which we have cited in our brief for the proposition that a jury within the meaning of the federal Constitution and we are asking that that meaning be applied to the states mean 12-man and an unanimous verdict.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="894.564" stopTime="899.180">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well the rational is to overrule precedents, black precedents in this Court?
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="899.180" stopTime="1003.770">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Yes sir. 
    Yes sir, I was about to reach that, that's true. 
    If I may just presume it to Mr. Justice Fortas' point one step further. 
    I think there is a room based on Gideon and the lower court treatment of Gideon, for the Court to wait until a misdemeanor, by that I mean a federal misdemeanor, less than a year comes before it and perhaps at that time, there will be information before the Court which -- on which it could base a determination as to whether this can be handled. 
    I think I was persuaded, for example, by a comment of Judge Jones of the Fifth Circuit in McDonald v. Moore where he held that the right to counsel rule applies to a misdemeanor. 
    But just in a passing observation, he said frankly he doesn't know how it's going to work because in his hometown of Jacksonville, there are more JP courts than attorneys. 
    And they all sit on Monday morning, but he said that because of the earmarks of that particular offense, the right was applied. 
    I think those are problems the Court obviously has to think about. 
    If in New York City for example has an amicus brief before the Court in this case on this point, if in some sense mathematically, a jury could not be made available for the 12,000 cases that were tried that Mr. Leftwood refers to, I would think the Court would want to consider that in reaching a judgment. 
    In sum, I'm saying that I think to the extent there is room to -- for caution and to wait, I think the room has to be on the depths or how farther right goes. 
    I don't think based on the history of the interpretation of the jury trial right in this case and the court's history whenever a right isn't going to be applied to the state that it's not the water down right but it is a full right. 
    That it means whatever the federal right means, I don't think this rule applies.

    I'm not certain about that date it maybe 1880. 
    But for a good substantial period after Louisiana was admitted to the Union, we made that presentation to dispel whatever weight there may be and the idea that this is an unbroken history in Louisiana of reliance on the civil law tradition.

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Well, I'm referring to the opinion of the Court in Washington v. Texas and to the opinion of the Court where in discussing the incorporation of the compulsory process provision, the Court did say that without implying, I don't believe that every provision of the Bill of Rights applies to the states that we are -- that the Court will look to the question of fundamentalness and essentiality and I think in those cases, the Court has put special weight on the criminal trial. 
    I think that while there is great weight to idea that what the Court has done so far in the criminal procedure area in incorporating due process -- the Bill of Rights protections may well lead you to the conclusion that all the criminal procedures are incorporated, which is not necessarily our position in this case. 
    I think that the rule in civil cases could well be different.

    I certainly think there is a distinction between the Seventh and the Sixth.

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    The court needn't have reached it, but the Court --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1493.598" stopTime="1497.140">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    As a matter of fact it relied on the words that you said both?
speaker="richard_b_sobol" startTime="1497.140" stopTime="1552.377">
    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    The court said both. 
    But the point is that because there had been so many of these decisions relating to the impartiality of a jury without referring to the Sixth Amendment right. 
    The use of that language I think could be interpreted and we have suggested it maybe interpreted to have applied the right. 
    I'd like to just pursue a matter one second more as to what is before the Court. 
    I do think the question of a 12-man jury in this case is before the Court, because of the condition of the Louisiana law. 
    If the Court would have to say there is a federal jury trial right in this case, but not made clear what right the Court is referring to in terms of the scope, the 12-man, under Louisiana law. 
    The next step up is a five-man jury and the case will be coming back up again. 
    And I think that if the appellant were to be convicted again, the Court in terms of a remand as to this case, I think should make clear what this case calls for. 
    And in that sense I think the question of --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1552.377" stopTime="1561.910">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And what about all the other men that are being tried today in Louisiana under the five-man jury, would that be all set aside too while we are at it?

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    I don't think you have to set them aside. 
    No sir. 
    I think the retroactivity cases of this -- the Court has handed down or in several recent areas would indicate that there is a good deal of room not to apply the case retroactively. 
    I think that --

    On what basis?

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Well the Court in Stovell and in the Johnson v. New Jersey has said that -- as I understand those decisions that because the right that it's being defined does not go to the central core of the fact finding process the right need not be applied. 
    I do want to say I --

    I was answering Mr. Justice Marshall in a manner which I said precedence in the Court that I think could be used, I believe that like the Gideon case that the lack of jury trial is central to the fact finding process. 
    Our position before the Court, Mr. Justice White would be, that because it is central to the fact finding process and because some practical considerations go into the reach of the rule where I think that it could be developed before the Court that the question would not involve the release of many good long sentence prison.

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Yes sir and I think that one of the considerations here is certainly after the cases in which there have been no jury, the penalties have been on the low side of the scale and you don't have men who've been tried many, many years ago or men convicted of what the Court would consider very heinous crime and it would have to be retried. 
    But I do think and in response to Mr. Justice White and can I clear my answer to Mr. Justice Marshall, I do believe that the logic of the central fact finding function would apply here. 
    There are practical considerations which I think the Court should meet on a record where those questions are fully briefed and presented to the Court as it has in the --

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    Because I think the question of the Court has struggled with in the contempt cases is a different question and that is whether a contempt is a crime. 
    And without expressing any opinion on that and I think it's a close question, I don't think anything we're talking about involves getting into that question. 
    What we have here is a crime. 
    If the Court should determine in the Bloom Case that contempt is a crime and that I think these cases have to be fit together.

    Mr. Richard B. Sobol 
    The thrust of my argument is that it does not reach criminal contempt, because the Court has not determined whether a criminal contempt is a crime within the meaning of the constitutional standard.

    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    May it please the Court. 
    The facts of this case are exceedingly simple. 
    The simple facts as shown by the record make it clear that appellant who was 19 years old, even according to his own testimony, made an intentional bodily contact on the victim who was 14 years old without his consent. 
    The simple facts of this case show that the appellant committed a simple battery of misdemeanor. 
    That he was given a fair trial and that he was sentenced to 60 days in the Parish Jail, and a $150.00 fine. 
    The 60-day sentence for a simple battery brings this case squarely under this Court's decision in Cheff versus Schnackenberg, if the Sixth Amendment jury trial right applies to the states. 
    Cheff held that the imposition of an actual sentence of six months or less is constitutionally permissible under Article III and the Sixth Amendment without a trial by jury if the inherent nature of the offense charged is that of a petty offense and Mr. Justice Brennan, that answers your question about the federal system. 
    It would have to be a serious, I mean, it would have to be a petty -- the nature of the offense would have to be petty. 
    Therefore, it could not involve any crime in a federal system with more than a year penalty because if you have more than a year penalty, you go to the federal -- you may go to the federal penitentiary and this Court has held that that is an infamous offense in the federal system.

    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    Now under Cheff, the test recognized for determining of petty offense are one, the actual sentence imposed is six months or less and two, the character of the offense charged must be petty. 
    This prosecution meets both tests of Cheff because the sentence actually imposed was 60 days and the offense charged simple battery as defined in Louisiana is a petty offense. 
    Simple battery in Louisiana is the intentional use of force of violence upon the person of another without the consent of the victim, and without a dangerous weapon. 
    Intent to injure, actual bodily injury and the use of a dangerous weapon are not elements of simple battery. 
    Consent to the victim is a defense so that the identical conduct with the victim's consent is not a crime in Louisiana.

    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    Nothing, nothing.[Laughter] 
    Your party said you don't wear one on Mardi Gras. 
    Your Honor, we say that simple battery is a trivial offense enacted under the state's police power. 
    It's not too offensive to the community's moral purposes. 
    It's not too close to society's dangers and these are tests which have been used by this Court in determining what is a minor offense. 
    We say that there is a substantial difference between simple battery or misdemeanor in Louisiana, and aggravated battery which is a felony. 
    Aggravated battery in Louisiana involves serious conduct and as a felony, it is triable by jury. 
    It's punishable in the penitentiary, and it necessarily involves the laws of important Civil Rights such as the right to vote. 
    Simple battery involves minor conduct and of course, it's a misdemeanor. 
    And the conviction of a misdemeanor does not involve the laws of any Civil Rights at all and it is not punishable in the penitentiary. 
    Historically, conduct constituting simple battery has been treated as a petty offense, not only in Louisiana, but also throughout the United States and in England as authorities in our brief show. 
    The Frankfurter &amp; Corcoran Article which was cited, in the District of Columbia versus Clawans mentions assault and battery as a petty offense triable without a jury. 
    Throughout the United States, simple battery is a typical petty offense as our brief shows. 
    In England, when the Sixth Amendment was adopted, simple battery was a minor offense triable without indictment and without a jury, as our brief demonstrates.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes ma'am.

    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    Well I tried to answer you but you said that that wasn't the answer.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3163.047" stopTime="3165.049">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But if that's your answer to it, then that's alright.
speaker="dorothy_d_wolbrette" startTime="3165.049" stopTime="3276.713">
    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    I said that the test is a fair trial. 
    Now, can a judge give a fair trial in a murder case? 
    Then I say, of course a judge can give a fair trial in a murder case. 
    Now of course, if you want to look at history, I don't believe there is any precedent for a capital crime being tried or not much precedent for a capital crime being tried without a jury. 
    So on the basis of history it is quite possible that we could say that it would not be proper to try without a jury. 
    But I'm saying that a state has the right to modify the scope of jury trial as Louisiana has done in this case. 
    I'm also saying that because the decision of the decision in Cheff, this Court need not reach the constitutional question and hopefully will decide this case on the narrower ground that appellant's prosecution was for a petty offense, which is exempted from the Sixth Amendment jury trial under the Cheff decision. 
    But in the alternative, if this Court deems it necessary to reach the constitutional question of applicability to the states of the Sixth Amendment jury trial right, then we maintain that the Sixth Amendment does not apply directly to the states. 
    In deciding this issue, we call this Court's attention to Patton versus the United States and the consequences Mr. Justice Brennan, of requiring all the states to try crimes by 12-man unanimous jurors. 
    This would be a necessary incident of a crime with Sixth Amendment directly to the states. 
    Since the Barron decision in 1833, this Court has held in an unbroken line of decisions that the Bill of Rights applies only against the federal government and not against states.

    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    Are those changed -- are those?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3292.828" stopTime="3300.757">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well the courts also held in a line of cases that the jury trial provision doesn't apply to the states at all.
speaker="dorothy_d_wolbrette" startTime="3300.757" stopTime="3403.411">
    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    That's right. 
    But what I'm pointing at, I'm going from general to specific if you will allow me. 
    The fact that certain rights have been found fundamental and applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment does not mean that all are. 
    The fact that certain restrictions are placed on the federal courts does not mean that the same restrictions must be imposed on state courts. 
    Unlike the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment jury trial right is not an abstract declaration of the rights of man based on fundamental fairness. 
    The Sixth Amendment jury trial right deals only with the preservation of a concrete institution, the common law 12-man jury as it existed in 1787. 
    Under the Sixth Amendment change in the common law jury is impossible. 
    It isn't reasonable to argue that such a rigid unchangeable institution as the 18th Century common law jury in which procedural reform is impossible represents a fundamental right which is necessary to a fair trial in state court. 
    Jury trial exists in federal court by reason of Article III and the Sixth Amendment. 
    Jury trial exists in state court by reason of state law. 
    The only vehicle for applying the federal jury trial right to the states is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and due process does not demand trial by jury. 
    The test under due process is whether a jury is essential to a fair trial. 
    Contrary to appellant's arguments, recent decisions of this Court --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3403.411" stopTime="3411.959">

    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You say it's only applicable to cases where a fair trial would be -- would --
speaker="dorothy_d_wolbrette" startTime="3421.716" stopTime="3422.382">
    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    No, no I'm saying that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3422.382" stopTime="3423.672">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- would require a jury.
speaker="dorothy_d_wolbrette" startTime="3423.672" stopTime="3431.669">
    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    No sir, I'm saying that the only test under due process is whether a jury trial is essential to a fair trial.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3431.669" stopTime="3434.805">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    When would that be?
speaker="dorothy_d_wolbrette" startTime="3434.805" stopTime="3540.592">
    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    Oh, you mean in any -- I don't think it would be necessary in any case as far as a fair trial is concerned, I believe that a judge certainly can try any defendant fairly. 
    Contrary to appellant's argument, recent decisions of this Court have not undermined the validity of Maxwell versus Dow. 
    In following the rationale of Hurtado versus California, Maxwell versus Dow applied the test of fundamental fairness to determine that due process required neither an indictment nor a jury trial in state prosecutions for robbery. 
    This is the same test which is applied by this Court today, and that is, is the right which has been denied essential to a fair trial which is inherent in due process. 
    In the case at bar, it would be necessary to find that failure to a court appellant a jury trial necessarily deprived him of a fair trial. 
    Neither logic nor history supports a holding that failure to a court appellant a jury trial deprived him of a fair trial. 
    There is no rational basis for declaring that a judge cannot dispense with the same fairness and impartiality which could be expected of a jury acting under a judge's instructions both as to the law and the facts. 
    Certainly, it can't be logically argued that it was fair in District of Columbia versus Clawans for federal judge without a jury to impose a 60-day sentence on the accused for selling property without a license, but that it was not fair in the case at bar for a state judge without a jury to impose a 60-day sentence for simple battery. 
    Certainly it can not be --

    We just say that it may be variable, but it is not essential.

    Maybe I misunderstood the thrust from your argument.

    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    Oh no, indeed! 
    After all, we provide for more serious offenses. 
    So we couldn't deny the value. 
    We just say the value and desirability is not constitutional mandate. 
    Now --

    But you're still prepared as a theoretical matter to say that the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantees would permit a state to try a capital offense and sentence a person to execution without a jury?

    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    That is not essential to the holding of this case, Your Honor.

    I know that, but isn't that the thrust of your argument?

    Ms. Dorothy D. Wolbrette 
    I'm saying that possibly history could give you an apt, because as a practical matter, I mean as a matter of history, I can't think of many capital crimes that have ever been tried without jury. 
    But this is not so in offenses of a less serious nature like simple battery. 
    And as I'm trying to explain to you, the English tradition under the Magna Carta of the general right of jury trial existing side by side with legislative power to provide summary, non-jury process for a specific offenses was brought from England and adopted by the colonies, and used whenever the circumstances called for it. 
    In the years before the adoption of the Sixth Amendment, almost on more than half the colonies had constitutions of the Magna Carta type. 
    And they interpreted this language as allowing legislative diminution of the right to jury trial. 
    Moreover, the 1780 constitution of Massachusetts and the 1784 constitution of New Hampshire allowed a trial by jury to capital or infamous offense. 
    I see the red light is on, Thank you.

    Very well.
