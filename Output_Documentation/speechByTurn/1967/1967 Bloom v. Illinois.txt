   Argument of Edward J. Hladis

    Mr. Hladis.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="24.803" stopTime="91.984">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    During the course yesterday afternoon's argument by counsel for the petitioner, he made two observations with which we must take issue. 
    One relates to the factual aspect of this case and the second relates to the law on the issue as it has been announced by this Court. 
    We address ourselves first to the factual aspect. 
    The key or the simple facts in this case are not many. 
    The decedent died on the 6th of July 1964. 
    On the 14th of July 1964, this petitioner drafted and caused the execution of a will of this dead person dated June 21, 1964 and on the 11th of August 1964, he presented his will for admission to probate in a probate division in Cook County and in this petition stated that the decedent had died on the 6th of July.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is he beneficiary?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="93.761" stopTime="210.829">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    No sir, he was not. 
    The record will show and our statement of facts indicates that it had actually began with a practical nurse by the name of Pauline Owens would increase her legacy in this fraudulent will from $20,000 and a valid will to $40,000 in this will. 
    Now the important consideration for the purposes of this case is this, yesterday the counsel referred to the alleged filing of a spurious will and two other alleged contemptuous acts. 
    We submit gentlemen that on the basis of the record at this time and on the basis of the record as it was made in the Courts of Review in the State of Illinois it is improper for a counsel to refer to alleged contemptuous conduct because this petitioner has not only failed to challenge the sufficiency of the finding of guilt but he affirmatively conceded in the Supreme Court of Illinois that the findings of guilt were amply supported by the evidence. 
    Now we understand that the briefs filed by all parties are a part of the certiorari filed in this Court. 
    That concession is found at page 15 of the petitioner's brief and the concession is also noted in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    Now what we are getting at is this, the case is here before this Court on the issue as to whether or not he was entitled to a jury trial. 
    But the very issue, the very point which a jury could give him to wit the finding of guilt or non-guilt, the finding of guilt or innocence is not challenged and has never been challenged. 
    The second observation --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="210.829" stopTime="212.962">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    There was a challenge at the trial, wasn't it?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="212.962" stopTime="213.513">

    Beg pardon sir?

    There was a challenge at the trial, wasn't it?

    Pleaded not --

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    He pleaded not guilty, yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="224.251" stopTime="225.342">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, isn't that a challenge?

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    That is a challenge, yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="226.672" stopTime="228.476">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well then he did at some time challenge it.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="228.476" stopTime="240.831">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    He did it at the trial but the point is that after the finding of guilty was in, he did not challenge, not only did not challenge but he did concede that the findings were supported by the evidence.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="240.831" stopTime="251.244">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, but aren't there issues here of alleged trial errors in respect to the psychiatric testimonies --

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    He makes no --

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    You're talking about the amicus curiae report.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, yes is that -- no, I'm not -- in addition to that am I wrong?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="260.516" stopTime="278.894">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    And then the third observation he makes as the remark of the assistant state's attorney who have made reference to the fact that the petitioner did not take the stand. 
    Now as to the first, the amicus curiae report that is a practice that has been approved by the Supreme Court of Illinois.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="278.894" stopTime="297.871">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    No I think the reference maybe to your adversary's statement yesterday that testimony of the psychiatrist was abused to show that the petitioner could not possibly have committed this crime assuming to that effect.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="297.871" stopTime="299.894">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="299.894" stopTime="305.732">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So that -- that would indicate that there was some sort of a contest at the trial level.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="305.732" stopTime="308.939">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Oh, we're not quarrelling the fact that there was a contest at the trial level.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="308.939" stopTime="310.172">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well what is your point then, (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="310.172" stopTime="311.987">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    The point is this that once the finding --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="311.987" stopTime="315.354">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Not prejudicial error, what is it? 
    What is your point?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="315.354" stopTime="347.310">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    The point is that what he wants today, it would seem to me that if I were in the petitioner's position and I were asking this Court to formulate a constitutional doctrine whereby I'd be guaranteed a jury trial in a criminal contempt case pursuant to the Sixth Amendment as it would be imposed upon our course by the Fourteenth Amendment that I would at least come up here where the bona fide contest on the findings of guilt. 
    But he didn't even do that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="347.310" stopTime="347.402">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I don't (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="347.402" stopTime="349.427">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    -- in the Courts of Review in the State of Illinois sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="349.427" stopTime="358.176">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I confess that I still don't follow you. 
    Are you saying that there was a contest on the issue of guilt but not a substantial one, is that your point?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="358.176" stopTime="368.299">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    What I am saying is that after the finding was made, he not only did not challenge the sufficiency but he actually conceded that the evidence was sufficient to support the findings.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="368.299" stopTime="398.480">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I know but I thought you said yesterday and as I read his brief, it's an issue he thought of malevolent intent, is that the language which he says is important and that psychiatric test to only bears on it and that he could not have been guilty of the offense because the psychiatric testimony might have persuaded the jury, indicated that he did not have the necessary malevolent intent which -- as I understood your argument.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="398.480" stopTime="401.292">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    That is correct. 
    That was advanced sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="401.292" stopTime="419.456">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But even if he raise no question -- any square attack on the findings, your argument would apply to any other trial error. 
    And you want to raise a trial error you better accompany it with a challenge to the facts.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="419.456" stopTime="421.097">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    I would think so.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="421.097" stopTime="421.374">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that --
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="421.374" stopTime="423.007">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Because I think --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="423.007" stopTime="425.046">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That just doesn't --
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="425.046" stopTime="448.913">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Gentlemen, I think he'd -- if he has a case, I don't think it's a Sixth Amendment case. 
    I think what he's actually complaining about is the extent of the punishment and that would be our solution to the problem, it's a Fourteenth Amendment problem. 
    The issue on the case as we have it here is not whether he should have been given a jury trial.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="448.913" stopTime="477.790">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well let's just assume that if -- let's just assume that in the federal system for example, a man demands a jury trial in a criminal case and is denied. 
    And the judge finds him guilty and he comes up solely on the refusal of the jury trial. 
    Would you say to him that -- would you say to him, “No, your challenge can't be sustained because you don't challenge the finding of guilt”?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="477.790" stopTime="489.178">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    No, I would not Mr. Justice White for a different reason though, because it's clearly established under the Sixth Amendment and under Article III that any criminal case, he is entitled to a jury trial.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="489.178" stopTime="492.090">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's exactly what he's claim is here that under the Sixth Amendment --
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="492.090" stopTime="495.745">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    No. 
    Well, what he's doing here is asking this Court --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="495.745" stopTime="496.382">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Surely --
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="496.382" stopTime="498.329">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    -- to formulate a new doctrine --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="498.329" stopTime="499.000">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's right.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="499.000" stopTime="517.311">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    -- one which has never been formulated before which even in Cheff has contrary to his representation has no constitutional basis at all and is asking this Court to say now under the Sixth Amendment criminal contempt cases shall have jury trials and will impose it on the state by virtue --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="517.311" stopTime="536.268">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What you're really saying is a kind of an (Inaudible) argument. 
    The case is (Inaudible) as unappealing to this from your standing problem. 
    This Court should not ceasefire to (Inaudible) basic constitution doctrine, isn't that what you're saying?

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    That is correct, that is correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="546.224" stopTime="555.934">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What do you have to say about the fact that this is also a felony under the laws of Illinois, forgery?

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Yes it is. 
    I don't see any inconsistency between the two at all. 
    We have here --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="564.254" stopTime="574.766">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Wouldn't it be inconsistent if you had a choice of trying the man for the same act, one with the jury and one without?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="574.766" stopTime="580.661">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    No, by the very nature of the two proceedings. 
    And the one you have contempt which is --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="580.661" stopTime="584.644">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But do you take the position they could also be charged with forgery?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="584.644" stopTime="610.113">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    It is possible, but I say that as far as Cook County is concerned that will not happen and as a matter of fact, the statute has run in this particular case. 
    But we have had rare instances where contempts have been committed usually in a probate level which are also felonies. 
    And in all cases where the probate judge has gone to the way of contempt, the state has not prosecuted criminally and we did not do it here and we don't -- certainly don't intend to do it.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="610.113" stopTime="612.995">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Who's -- makes the choice?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="612.995" stopTime="631.464">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    In this case the errors themselves made the choice. 
    They are the ones that began. 
    They asked for the appointment of the amicus curiae and they filed a first petition or rule to show a cause and then the judge determined that there was probable cause after he had received the amicus curiae report and the contempt proceeding began.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="631.464" stopTime="638.568">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well isn't the contempt proceeding easier than going to a grand jury and trying the case before a jury?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="638.568" stopTime="689.765">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    I would think it's easier and I would think it is much more effective and that is undoubtedly what the probate judge wanted to achieve in this particular case. 
    Because you're talking about a court in a large metropolitan area and as we all know much of the practice in a probate division is done what I might call on an ex parte basis because many times the interested party do not have counsel, they rely upon counsel for the personal representative. 
    And the Court must rely upon the integrity, upon the honesty of the attorneys presenting matters to them. 
    And whereas in this case, you have a situation where a fraudulent will was presented for admission and sought to be processed while the Court has a real problem as far as discipline is concerned.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="689.765" stopTime="693.328">

    Do you have a double jeopardy provision in your state constitution?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose there is an uproar in the Court then, someone was murdered and the judge determined instead of having him indicted -- a person indicted for murder, he charge him with criminal contempt, could he try him for the murder and contempt?

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    I imagine possibly he might -- well, that's not a probability actually Your Honor, I --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="751.811" stopTime="759.285">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, why is it? 
    This -- what's the difference between forgery and murder if they're both statutory crimes and they are felonies?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="759.285" stopTime="784.820">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Because of the gravity between the two. 
    I mean one is -- that the forgery in this particular instance have to do with the very operation of the Court whereas certainly the murder would cause a disturbance in the Court but I just cannot visualize that the -- a probate Judge would move by way of contempt rather than have it in turn, the matter over the state for prosecution under the murder statute.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="784.820" stopTime="805.061">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, that's why we're here today. 
    Some people think that forgery is a pretty important case and particularly when a man goes to jail for -- goes to penitentiary for years and they think they can't understand why it should be done in this way rather than give a man a jury after an indictment.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="805.061" stopTime="813.381">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I gave what we submit as a good practical sound reason in this particular context and that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="813.381" stopTime="818.132">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But we're not dealing with practical reasons, particularly we're dealing with the law in this case.
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="818.132" stopTime="829.845">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    I understand but by the same token, that probate judge down there has to serve a notice upon the bar that he cannot tolerate practices such as we had here.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="829.845" stopTime="846.425">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well do you think it wouldn't be serving a notice on them if he called it detention of the grand jury and the grand jury indict him and he was convicted of forgery and sent to the penitentiary on what you say is absolutely conclusive evidence, wouldn't he trust a jury?
speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="846.425" stopTime="850.673">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis

speaker="edward_j_hladis" startTime="852.072" stopTime="859.166">
    Mr. Edward J. Hladis

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="859.166" stopTime="868.988">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    Mr. Edward J. Hladis 
    Well, whether we want to call it feelings or what or convictions but those are his views.

    And now if that is true why wouldn't the bar move there when he was convicted in the court below and when he was convicted by your Supreme Court just as they did in the Steel Workers case where there wasn't any charge of fraud at all, it was just illegal practice of law.

    This Court will recall that the majority in both Green and the Barnett is held at criminal contempts are not crimes, and as such, they do not fall within the purview of the -- either the Sixth Amendment or the Third Article of the Federal Constitution. 
    Then counsel moves on to the Cheff decision and suggest to this Court that an important modification was made therein by the majority and that the requirement of a jury trial in federal cases wherein sentences exceed six months has been raised to a constitutional level. 
    We have read that that is an argument that is made by the petitioner in his brief and was repeated yesterday. 
    We have disagreed with that argument and we still adhere to our position that at no time as the majority of this Court ever said either that criminal contempt was a crime and that as such it fell within the purview of the Sixth Amendment and the Third Article of the Federal Constitution.

    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In response to Chief Justice's last question we have set forth the exact constitutional provisions of the Illinois statute on page 2 of our original brief in this Court. 
    There are two Sections really which covered in Illinois. 
    Article II, Section 5 provides that the right of trial by jury as here before enjoined shall remain in (Inaudible). 
    Article II, Section 9 says, “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to a speedy public trial by an impartial jury. 
    Nevertheless in Illinois over the years, there has grown up a body of law which I frankly concedes to the Court which has consistently withheld from criminal contender's a right to trial by a jury which I analyzed incidentally in my brief before the Supreme Court of the State to show that it grew as somewhat in topsy like fashion and was based upon a forced premise which originated in a pure civil contempt case where of course it's quite proper to deny trials by jury. 
    And based upon that fragile basis, they grew with Illinois the body of law to which I have just referred and to which the Illinois Supreme Court still adheres in this case dismissing the holding of this Court in Cheff v. Schnackenberg with -- I use to word advisedly to stay in almost making only passing reference to it.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1961.010" stopTime="1981.673">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, Cheff and Schnackenberg is a federal case and so far at least, so far the Illinois practice has been identical to the practice through and through both the federal cases and state cases by this Court and (Inaudilbe).
speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="1981.673" stopTime="1982.830">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    Yes, I would say --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1982.830" stopTime="1985.304">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Nothing unusual about what Illinois has done.
speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="1985.304" stopTime="2309.910">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    You're quite right Mr. Justice Harlan. 
    Up until now, they have adhere to Green and Barnett and in fact rely upon it again in their decision in this case, the case at bar. 
    And we're critical of that of course when we say that they have failed to recognize the important modifications in Green and Barnett as now written by this Court in Cheff. 
    Incidentally, I revisited Green after the colloquy I had with the Court yesterday and I am able to say that the Court that there was no criminal statute involved in Green in effect at the time of the alleged contemptuous acts. 
    The defendant there had been convicted of a crime and jumped and he refused to obey an order. 
    As he jumped down, he refused to obey an order to surrender and he was tried on contempt for disobedience of that order. 
    And as Mr. Justice Harlan wrote in the majority opinion of that case, he observed that the bail jumping statute had not yet been enacted. 
    It had been enacted in 1990 -- in 1954 whereas the contemptuous acts -- the acts complained off occurred in 1951 and passed it on to the Court because I received the impression probably incorrectly yesterday that there was a contention that there was a criminal statute at to time.One other thing, counsel refers to the fact that in the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois we conceded guilt. 
    And Mr. Justice White's observation on it of course I thought was quite correct. 
    That is that we contested right from the very beginning of course by reason of our plea of not guilty. 
    But when we got to the Supreme Court of the State upon the record, I did not plan to engage in a long argument based upon the sufficiency of the evidence since the trial judge waived the evidence. 
    He was the trier of the fact, he waived the evidence, he judged the credibility of the witnesses and so on. 
    Oh, I did not, however concede in the Supreme Court of the State that there was just no other side to it. 
    I said incidentally in brief that the page referred to by Mr. Hladis, in a footnote that the defendant concedes that the people's evidence when viewed on appeal as it must be viewed on appeal in the light most favorable to the people that the evidence was sufficient to support the Court's judgment because it's quite true. 
    And I also said in our brief here on page 2, I said the petitioner did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence of the Illinois Supreme Court in view of the rule prevailing in that state that a verdict will not be disturbed on appeal when there is any evidence which when taken with its intendments most favorable to an appellee tends to prove the essential allegations of the complaint. 
    I would, I submit most respectfully to the Court that a complete waste of time to me on this record to go up and say that our psychiatrist should have been believed, the psychiatric evidence established. 
    As Mr. Justice Brennan says that the malevolent intent necessary to a criminal contempt was not shown but we had an attorney who represented an adversary party in the trial court proceedings testified in the trial. 
    A cross-examination that when he thought with the petitioner prior to the time that he would open or present the spurious will, he was convinced and this is in the record that the petitioner did not realize the involvements he was getting into. 
    It did not have the mind, my own language to understand his predicament at that time. 
    All of which within, but this was disregarded of course by the trial court. 
    And I point out although it -- only been touched on briefly by Mr. Hladis that one of the complications in this case is this amicus curiae secret report which we have referred to as the fink report since the amicus curiae was a Mr. Fink. 
    I like to think that the word is descriptive incidentally by the card here but in any event, the -- that report found its way into the trial court's chambers. 
    It was viewed there in camera and he has refused to make it part of the record here in this case although we asked for an order on it. 
    So it still remains secret. 
    We don't know what's in it. 
    And it compounds the fact that we would deny the jury. 
    Had we had a jury would be bad enough for the trial court to have such a report anyway if you can visualize a Federal District Court judge with FBI reports at his chambers before he proceeds to a trial -- a case if it's so much similar to this. 
    But where the trier of the fact is that person and I think additional emphasis should be given to (Inaudible) and that is one of the errors we complained about.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2309.910" stopTime="2315.461">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Would you mind telling us how this amicus report came into being please.
speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="2315.461" stopTime="2466.108">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    Yes sir. 
    The proceeding originally began in the probate court of Cook County upon the presentation of a petition to the Court by -- as under a prior will who would have been out under the spurious will. 
    In it, they alleged and it's in the record incidentally with -- and you can refer to it at the proper time. 
    In it, they alleged that they sought fraud was being perpetrated upon the Court by the presentation of this other will and they specifically asked the trial court for the appointment of an amicus curiae for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting if necessary the fraud involved. 
    The trial court read at that motion and appointed Mr. Fink. 
    Thereafter, I think within approximately 60 or 90 days, the trial court entered an order upon the amicus curiae requiring him to file his report with the trial court and such a report was filed and was held in camera by the Court. 
    Now the record incidentally on that shows when we made a demand for it prior to trial and then again at trial, now the Court, page 81 of the record said, “It is not a part of the record, it belongs to the Court itself and the Court will turn it over to you and you will be at liberty to read it as concerns any witnesses testimony. 
    The Court wants to get at the truth or falsity at the proceeding so I will turn it over to you and you may use it for cross-examination”. 
    And it was, portions of it were turned over to me somewhat in Jenks style, that is where a witness took the stand who was referred to in the fink report then I was entitled to cross-examine there on the basis of that. 
    But that was not the entire report. 
    There is no way that we can show it to the Court where -- there is no way that we can indicate to the Court whether or not we are prejudiced which was the grounds relied upon by the Illinois Supreme Court for denying us a relief in that -- in connection with this particular point but I submit to the Court that it was impossible under the circumstances here for us to get such a report to determine whether or not we had been prejudiced since the trial judge himself to which (Inaudible) significance, refused to give it to us and refused to put it in the record.

    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    My case depends upon if I understood Your Honor correctly, the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to state courts in a long line of decisions. 
    I think I counted 23 of this Court in the last few years as well as an application of recently written by the Court in which you for the first time so far as I know, reach out to define what criminal proceedings are for the purpose of imposing constitutional rights at the Bar Association disciplinary proceedings. 
    The juvenile proceedings, the Colorado Sex Offenses if you remember which were regarded as civil there, I know its three or four others which you -- this Court now regards as criminal in the sense that they require the application of certain constitutional rights. 
    And I say of course if in a disbarment proceeding or even a proceeding where a man loses his license under a municipal ordinance which this Court has decided if that is to be considered criminal providing for the application of constitutional rights then certainly conduct which is labeled right at the name criminal contempt and which of itself constitutes the violation of the state statute is felony should certainly be considered a criminal proceeding.
