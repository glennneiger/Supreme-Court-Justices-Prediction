    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 639, Minnie Brade Glona, Petitioner, versus American Guarantee of Liability Insurance Company, et al. 
    Mr. Normann, I think you were conducting your argument, were you not? 
    You may proceed now.
speaker="david_r_normann" startTime="21.931" stopTime="424.172">
    Mr. David R. Normann 
    May it please the Court. 
    Subsequent to yesterday's adjournment, I realized that while in our case and in the previous case, we have been discussing Article 2315 of the Louisiana Civil Code which is our Tort Law and provides for our wrongful death statute that we had not as yet read it to the Court and I think it might be helpful, it's not very long, if I read it. 
    It provides as follows; every act whatever of man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it. 
    The right to recover damages to property caused by an offense or quasi-offense is a property right which on the death of the obligees inherited by his legal instituted or irregular as subject to the community rights of the surviving spouse. 
    The right to recover all other damages caused by an offense or quasi-offense, if the injured person dies, shall survive for a period of one year from the death of the deceased in favor of one, the surviving spouse and child or children of the deceased or either such spouse or such child or children; Two, the surviving father and mother of the deceased or either of them if he left no spouse or child surviving; And three, the surviving brothers and sisters of the deceased or any of them if he left no spouse child or parents survived. 
    The survivors in whose favor this right of action survives may also recover for damages which they sustained through the wrongful death of the deceased. 
    A right to recover damages under the provisions of this paragraph is a property right which on the death of the survivor in whose favor the right of action survive is inherited by his legal instituted or irregular as whether suit has been instituted thereon by the survivor or not. 
    As used in this Article, the words “child, brother, sister, father, and mother” include a child, brother, sister, father and mother by adoption respectively. 
    As I say, that is the basis for all Louisiana Tort Law as well as our wrongful death statute. 
    I feel satisfied that the Court recognizes that this case does not in any way involved the racial issue notwithstanding the fact that it was mentioned in my opponent's brief. 
    Consequently, it seems that the question with which the Court is presented is this, has Louisiana in classifying legitimates and illegitimates acted reasonably and in accord with the -- a legitimate purpose of its statutes so as not to offend the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    First, I submit of course that we have acted reasonably for these four reasons. 
    One, Louisiana has exercised its legal right to legislate in areas which affect the health, morals and general welfare of its citizens. 
    Two, most certainly the state has an interest in maintaining the sanctity of legitimate relationships as produced through lawful marriage. 
    Third, Louisiana exercises its right to legislate so as to preserve the family unit. 
    And fourth, Louisiana has enacted specific and very liberal legislation to permit the legitimation of illegitimates. 
    Thereby conferring on them all rights enjoyed by legitimates.Discussing this briefly in the order mentioned that is first, the right to legislate in areas affecting health, morals and general welfare. 
    This Court has recognized in sanction the right of a state to enact such laws including the right to legislate of the area of sexual conduct. 
    It was so stated in McLaughlin versus State of Florida. 
    The Federal Government in all of the states had exercised a right. 
    Hence, the Department of Public Welfare of United States Government and the ordinance is the smallest township regulating and seeking to control such things as tuberculosis, venereal decease. 
    All operate in the same area and all of these we submit are entirely constitutional. 
    The criminal statutes punishing illicit and unnatural sexual conduct are also proper examples. 
    The sanctity of maintaining legitimate relationships through lawful marriage while bearing from State to State, every State in the union exercises his right. 
    And I don't believe anyone would seriously question the right or indeed the duty of the State to do so.Legislation designed to preserve a family unit. 
    Perhaps this Court's holding in the case of Murphy versus Ramsey, states it most delinquently. 
    The Court held certainly no legislation can be supposed more wholesome and necessary in the founding of a free, self-governing commonwealth, and that would seeks to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family has consisting in and springing from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy state of matrimony, the sure foundation of all that it is stable and noble in our civilization; and finally, the legislation by the State of Louisiana to allow the legitimation of illegitimates. 
    Here, we respectfully submit Louisiana has gone quite far and perhaps has excelled. 
    The history of our state's law has been one of constinent -- constant broadening of this concept. 
    Thus, Article 198 of our Civil Code provides children born out of marriage except those who are born from his ancestors' connection are legitimated by the subsequent marriage of the father and mother. 
    Whenever the latter have formally or informally acknowledge them for their children either before or after the marriage. 
    As I mentioned yesterday by 1948 Amendment, this Article includes adulterous bastards. 
    Article 200 of our Civil Code, provides an unnatural father or mother may legitimate his or her natural children by a Notarial Act signed by two witnesses declaring the intention of a parent to legitimate such child or children. 
    Article 214 --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Either one as a single parent can do that?
speaker="david_r_normann" startTime="426.345" stopTime="426.361">
    Mr. David R. Normann 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="426.361" stopTime="427.293">
    Justice Potter Stewart

speaker="david_r_normann" startTime="428.409" stopTime="468.561">
    Mr. David R. Normann 
    Either the father or the mother. 
    Article 214, provides for adoption and the rights pursuant that too, and puts adopted children on the same basis as legitimates. 
    Adopted children are included as forced as under Louisiana succession laws, in the Levy case. 
    The Louisiana doctrine of forced heirship I believe was explained to the Court. 
    Louisiana revised statute 9391 provides the authority for natural mothers and fathers to adopt their natural children by notarial acts. 
    We thus submit that Louisiana has acted more than reasonably in the classification which is here under attack.

    Mr. David R. Normann 
    Well, I think that leads though to what was the purpose of the statute, as I say, I don't consider that the purpose of the statute is to protect the tortfeasor.

    I might say, Your Honor, that with respect to protecting the idea of protecting the rights of the wrong doer -- protecting the wrong doing not the rights but from his culpable act. 
    It seems to me that -- I mentioned this just briefly yesterday before we adjourned, it seems to me that if the statute is unconstitutional in its classification coed legitimates and illegitimates then it must also be unconstitutional in its classification coed children and spouse first, parents next, brothers and sisters third. 
    Now, if I am killed wrongfully, my parents are denied a cause of action for my death because of the existence of my children.

    Mr. David R. Normann 
    No, not really, Your Honor. 
    What I am trying to do is illustrate to the Court the fact that Louisiana's wrongful death statute is tied in with Louisiana's laws of inheritance.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1130.270" stopTime="1132.868">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, where did -- now, what specific act do you --
speaker="david_r_normann" startTime="1132.868" stopTime="1133.688">
    Mr. David R. Normann 
    Alright, and the reason --

    -- come to (Voice Overlap)?
speaker="david_r_normann" startTime="1134.481" stopTime="1174.182">
    Mr. David R. Normann 
    And may I say this, the reason that I do that is because as I understand the law so as not to offend the Fourteenth Amendment and the right to classify under the Fourteenth Amendment, we must show a reasonable purpose in doing this, in denying this right to illegitimates. 
    Now, I say this is tied up with the law of inheritance in Louisiana. 
    Hence, the illustration I gave a moment ago. 
    Louisiana also classifies in its hierarchy who has the cause of action even among legitimates. 
    My children exclude my parents for my wrongful death.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1174.182" stopTime="1177.851">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, if you know make any distinction as among your children.
speaker="david_r_normann" startTime="1177.851" stopTime="1178.473">
    Mr. David R. Normann 
    True.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1178.473" stopTime="1307.891">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And that's a problem here. 
    As a matter of fact, I haven't -- it's occurred that and it's perfectly possible to suggest that the purpose of these statutes making this distinction against illegitimate children is profoundly immoral, at least choosing the conventional terminology, because what they do is to insolate the male member or head of the household from the consequences of immoral conduct outside of the family structure that is to say the father of the household can create another set of children without any danger that the other set of children will have competing claims on the family estate. 
    The morality of this -- these statutes particularly when viewed in light of their history and as I understand it there is not quite as simple and clear as perhaps appears on the circus, would you disagree with that? 
    That is to say you take and originally these statutes were passed to protect the legitimate family, protect the property interest of the legitimate family. 
    And to some extent, they encourage if one wants to indulge in that kind of reasoning the head of the household to go out and establish another family elsewhere. 
    And he didn't have to have any fear at all that the children of the -- to use a Spanish expression the “casa media” with the assert competing claims as against the children of the original -- of the legitimate family.
speaker="david_r_normann" startTime="1307.891" stopTime="1353.914">
    Mr. David R. Normann 
    Well, I would say, Your Honor that it's most difficult it seems to me for the law to cover every conceivable circumstance. 
    I think -- I personally believe that the Louisiana law is sound in this area. 
    Incidentally, under our law, he is not entirely free of all responsibility. 
    I didn't go into these code or articles because I don't really feel that they're really relevant to the issues but for example, the culpable man in that instance, in that example would owe support to these illegitimate children but it is true that our law would protect the rights of the legitimates against the claim of the illegitimates. 
    But I --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1353.914" stopTime="1363.671">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, it is relevant. 
    What we're talking about here it's maybe irrelevant because what you have to do as you have said is to defend this as a reasonable classification.

    Mr. David R. Normann 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1364.050" stopTime="1376.009">

    Mr. David R. Normann 
    Yes, and that is why I am trying to persuade the Court that this is so intrinsically tied in with our laws of inheritance and that is why I use the example of the classifications within Article 2315 themselves. 
    Why does the law so classify? 
    Obviously, because our law recognizes the obligation in the example I used to myself to support my children and Louisiana's wrongful death statute follows right along and does the same thing.

    As far as 2315, I don't think the case has been decided on that question but insofar as it would be analogized to the forced heirship that is the position on legitimation not on adoption. 
    Adoption can be done of course. 
    The -- to answer the question further, the Civil Code is broken up into three books. 
    The first book treats the persons. 
    The second book treats of things and the mode of acquiring thing or the different modifications of ownership. 
    The third book treats of the modes of acquiring things. 
    The first book on persons does not contain 2315. 
    The second book on the modifications of ownership does not contain 2315 it is in the acquisition of things and conventional obligations in quasi-contract and offenses. 
    The third book which sets up the 2315. 
    The first title carries the whole Succession Law of Louisiana. 
    The second title of the book three contains the whole Donation Law of Louisiana. 
    The third title of the book three contains all of the Obligation Law of Louisiana. 
    The fourth title is the Conventional Obligations. 
    And the fifth title is the Quasi-Contract and the Offenses Law in the Louisiana. 
    Successions, is in Title 1 and it starts with Article 871 to 1466 and that is the end of the Law of Successions. 
    Article 2315 is in the fifth title and does not purport to be an inheritance statute. 
    It does not purport to regulate forced heir or forced heirship and I submit has no relation at all to forced heirship.

    Mr. William F. Wessel 
    Yes, that's by the same token, the reason for classifying out or fencing out illegitimates in 2315 is not the forced heirship argument. 
    No Court has said that that was the reason. 
    Only one Court mentioned the reason for fencing out illegitimates and that was the Levy Court of Appeals and Louisiana Court of Appeals and it said it was general morals and it discourages bringing children in the world out of wedlock and that was a hundred years --

    Mr. William F. Wessel 
    The Court there in Lynch v. Knoop considered the case as -- considered the statute as sui generis. 
    It was in derogation of common right, common law and therefore it had to be strictly construed the idea that what was contained in the statute automatically excluded everything else. 
    And no reference was made to the definitional article on children. 
    But there is no definition in the definitional article on parents or father or mother in Article 3556. 
    There is a definition of children where children are considered to be legitimate children were used in the Code but no definition of mother or father or parents. 
    But the Lynch v. Knoop case was decided strictly on the idea of sui generis of the case being -- of the statute being sui generis.

    What's that mean in appellant?

    Mr. William F. Wessel 
    Being in derogation of common right that it was not -- the right of recovery for wrongful death was not afforded to the population or the citizenry of Louisiana as part of its general law and it had to be enacted by statute, and therefore the statute was in derogation of common law had to be construed as of itself in some class. 
    That's my understanding, Your Honor.

    Would you say that things now we're going to use relation law of forced heirship?

    Mr. William F. Wessel 
    I submit that -- yes, Your Honor. 
    I submit that. 
    The -- I think -- it's pointed out on my brief that all wrongful death statutes would pass for compensatory purposes. 
    And to treat a compensatory act in a retrogressive fashion rather than look to other compensatory acts in the state is to treat the legislation as if in a frustrating manner. 
    Thank you, Your Honors.
