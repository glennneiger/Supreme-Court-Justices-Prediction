    Mr. Davis.
speaker="tom_davis" startTime="64.878" stopTime="243.932">
    Mr. Tom Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The question presented by this appeal is whether the conviction of a chronic alcoholic while being found in a state of intoxication at a public place is prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States constitution. 
    The case comes to the Court in this posture. 
    On December 19, 1966 the appellant was charged in the corporation of court of the city of Austin, Texas with the offense of being intoxicated in a public place. 
    He was tried and found guilty and he appealed the conviction to the county court at law of Travis County before following a trial de novo, he was again convicted and fined $50. 
    At the conclusion of the trial, the county judge -- the county court under these circumstances and in this particular case being the court of last resort in Texas, entered findings of fact with conclusions of law and the appellant perfected a direct appeal to this Court. 
    I would like to point out the outset that appellant does not here contend that Article 477 is unconstitutional on its face. 
    What we do contend is that as applied to appellant, Article 477 is unconstitutional in that application. 
    Appellant being a chronic alcoholic, afflicted with the disease of chronic alcoholism who can not resist the constant excessive consumption of alcohol and whose appearance in the public is involuntary. 
    Appellant's story is typical of the stories of many Americans afflicted with this disease, and I might add many indigent Americans. 
    At the time of the trial, he was 66 years old, and he had a history of drinking dating back till 1925. 
    He was injured on the job in the middle of 50's, injured his back. 
    He's been unable to do heavy physical labor since. 
    He drinks everyday namely wine and beer. 
    He gets drunk to the point where he passes out only once a week. 
    In short, his drinking is limited only by his financial resources. 
    His financial resources are derived wholly from the money he can pick up shining shoes -- excuse me -- in a local bar. 
    This averages approximately $12 a week. 
    In fact, in 1966, the fines imposed on him for punishing him for this disease exceeded 20% of his total income. 
    The arrest records in Travis County alone reflect 73 arrests since 1949. 
    This is only part of the story.

    Mr. Tom Davis 
    All except for one. 
    Back in 1951 or 1952, there was one for disorderly conduct, but all of the arrest are merely for public drunkenness, excuse me. 
    He estimates that in Travis County and in Bastrop County together, he's been arrested approximately a hundred times. 
    But again let me emphasize that this is only a token expression of evidence of the degree to which this man drinks.The number of times he's intoxicated as he says “I've been very lucky in avoiding police arrest.”

    The morning before this trial began, he had had a drink. 
    He had no more money to buy any more liquor. 
    But the record shows he drinks each and every day. 
    I would not represent to the Court that he becomes totally intoxicated everyday. 
    Plus I don't think I can justify it unless there's some very benevolent alcoholic on his team. 
    He doesn't have the money to get drunk everyday, but I think I can represent to the Court that his man's alcoholism and his alcoholic content was kept at a very high level each and every day, it doesn't take --

    No, Travis County is the county where the state capital sits without -- Travis County is the county where the state capital sits Austin, Texas.

    To my knowledge it has not, and let me be quick here to add that I would hesitate and be very reluctant to recommend wholesale civil commitment of these indigent alcoholics. 
    And I say that for a number of reasons. 
    First of all, the people that have been charged with the duty of studying alcoholism and its facets, the people who are expert in the area and as reflected in the D.C. Crimes Commission and the U.S. Crime Commission report. 
    These people recommend voluntary treatment. 
    They say it will work. 
    Also, before the Court and cited in my reply brief is a study in the late issue of the FBI bullet, reflecting a pilot project in the City of St.Louis where on a voluntary basis, 97% of the chronic alcoholic stayed for the entire period prescribed by the medical profession. 
    So what -- there is evidence that voluntary treatment will work, so I hesitate to suggest to the Court that a wholesale program of civil commitment is desirable.

    Mr. Davis, I don't want to anticipate of course your argument, but I would like to know at some point just what you think should be done, or what you should would happen if the police came on the petitioner here on the public street and he was dead drunk. 
    Just what do you think should happen in that event?
speaker="tom_davis" startTime="619.360" stopTime="638.709">
    Mr. Tom Davis 
    Should be taken to a medical facility. 
    The man is laying on a street suffering from an epileptic seizure, the police don't pick him up and take to the jail. 
    He's suffering from a disease. 
    Now maybe under some mistake, the police might, but if a drunk is laying on the street --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well let's suppose he's not, let's suppose he's walking around. 
    He's navigating but he's obviously intoxicated, and then you think the police can come up to him and say “Come along with us.” 
    And what is that? 
    Is that an arrest or is it a --

    Mr. Tom Davis 
    Police have two duties. 
    Of course they have a duty to enforce the crimes, but they also have a charge with the duty to protect the health and welfare of the citizen of the community. 
    Now certainly there's no false arrest by pick up a -- assuming I'm a police officer. 
    If I pick up a heart attack victim and took him to a medical facility for treatment, neither can every false arrest if I picked up a chronic alcoholic who is in a drunken stupor wondering down the street.

    Mr. Tom Davis 
    Well excuse me. 
    I think was overstating my case to you -- a more narrower question that I had anticipated. 
    No, unless a chronic alcoholic is in such a condition that he's a danger to somebody, I see no purpose in picking him up, unless it's just to take him as you would for any one suffering to some place where he could get help. 
    But here again let me emphasize, it's the medical facility where he should be taken not the police station.

    Constitutionally, I don't believe it would be a false arrest, because as I stated a moment ago to the answer Justice Fortas' question, they have a power not only to enforce the rules, but also to protect the health of the citizens. 
    Now certainly when they pick up a person if he is of a danger to himself and takes him to a health facility, surely that could not be constitutionally attacked.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I think I agree with that Mr. Davis, but the policeman takes a risk that he may be prosecuted in that instance. 
    Where that police authority comes from other than the doctrine of public and private necessity has always interested me and I'm not sure what its origin is. 
    But if somebody -- if some member of the family has a psychotic episode in the house, let's say.
speaker="tom_davis" startTime="1327.044" stopTime="1327.565">
    Mr. Tom Davis 
    Yes sir.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And the, is -- sister or brother or mother or father calls the police, the police come out then and they see that this person is obviously having a psychotic episode. 
    Then the policeman if he's being a good public servant will take the person and call an ambulance to take the person, transport him, kicking and screaming if necessary, to a hospital. 
    Now, let's say socially -- I've always thought that that was socially necessary function of the police.
speaker="tom_davis" startTime="1366.132" stopTime="1366.527">
    Mr. Tom Davis 
    I do too.

    I do too.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1370.060" stopTime="1425.755">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well isn't that about what you're talking about here, that is to say. 
    And I'm a little surprised that you made the concession that the police would be perfectly justified in taking a person over to the precinct, because if they've justified the taking an alcoholic to the precinct and necessarily follows a sergeant at the desk is no more confident than the policeman is to make judgment as to his medical condition. 
    So the next thing to do is to toss him into drunk tank then when he comes up for trial, if he's lucky enough to have a public spirited lawyer then the defense can be made, medical testimony adduced and would be proved to be a medical case. 
    That's not what you're after him. 
    That's not the problem is it?
speaker="tom_davis" startTime="1425.755" stopTime="1437.075">
    Mr. Tom Davis 
    No, it's not. 
    It goes too far. 
    What we're trying to do here basically is to transfer what is a medical problem to the public health facilities. 
    Get it out in a way that the criminal courts --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1437.075" stopTime="1491.894">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    The time to put this on the same basis as in the person who has a psychotic episode and he's taken off to the hospital. 
    In that kind of case, I suppose a policeman in theory at any rate takes a risk when he picks up somebody on the street for public drunkenness, he takes a risk. 
    May be the person is having a, or is just recovering from an epileptic fit or as in attack of amnesia or something else, a patient. 
    And the policeman takes a risk. 
    Now what you're suggesting here if it's unconstitutional to prosecute a person who is an alcoholic in the medical sense then I would think that it's unconstitutional to arrest him. 
    Now do you disagree with that? 
    Do you think that's --
speaker="tom_davis" startTime="1491.894" stopTime="1492.550">
    Mr. Tom Davis 
    Yes I --

    Mr. Tom Davis 
    -- I do. 
    I don't think the conclusion is compelled by the analysis. 
    I do believe that what we're after and I don't say to the Court that it's the police should take all drunks to the police station, I do not say that. 
    And I didn't mean to concede that they can and should take chronic alcoholics to the police station. 
    What I was saying was that if they know a man is chronic alcoholic take him to the medical facility. 
    If it comes to light placed at the booking desk that he's got a history of 500 arrests which is common in this country, immediately transfer him to a medical facility.

   Rebuttal of Jutice Stewart
speaker="jutice_stewart" startTime="1545.072" stopTime="1596.287">
    Mr. Jutice Stewart 
    I had thought that your point was considerably narrower. 
    As I understand the question as verbalized on page 3 of your brief that it is that it's a violation of the United States constitution to convict a chronic alcoholic upon the offense of public intoxication. 
    Not that it's unconstitutional to arrest somebody who is publicly drunk nor is it a constitutional violation to prosecute somebody who's publicly drunk, but simply that it's not constitutional to convict a chronic alcoholic of that offense. 
    And that I would presume would be an affirmative defense to be yet opposed in a prosecution of somebody for public drunkenness. 
    He would have a defense by saying “Well I'm a chronic alcoholic.” 
    At that I understood with your case but I'm quite confused now with your colloquy.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I must say Mr. Davis, I don't have any statistics, but I would imagine that there's more public drunkenness of non-alcoholics than there is of alcoholics in the sense that you're talking about.
speaker="tom_davis" startTime="1618.143" stopTime="1627.442">
    Mr. Tom Davis 
    I think that's correct, but here is the point. 
    There is no justification for criminally punish a chronic alcoholic.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1627.442" stopTime="1663.355">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well I'm just wondering though in terms of the ultimate of a -- what in effect you're urging is that society ought to come around to the view that the chronic -- the alcoholic who was in that sense has the disease ought be treated medically and -- society ought to provide facilities and it has to be a public -- a burden because largely the instance of this disease is with people who can't themselves afford the expense of the treatment, isn't that right?

    Right.
speaker="tom_davis" startTime="1696.707" stopTime="1745.316">
    Mr. Tom Davis 
    Let's focus on the issues. 
    If a person were proved to be an addict, he was proved to that he was suffering from the disease if his use of narcotics was involuntary and if he was picked up for using narcotics in a situation where the fact showed he was not peddling it or he was not involved in any other social behavior, then I think the Court could conclude under those circumstances that the law is punishing him for a symptom of his disease. 
    I don't think it's compelled. 
    I think the Court may very well draw a terrible distinction between conduct where the social consequences are so great as in narcotics use, and in conduct such as this where it's chronic alcoholism. 
    These people are typically harmless. 
    They're non-belligerent and passive --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And yes, are they always typically harmless?

    Mr. Tom Davis 
    Your Honor, all I can do is cite the authorities to the Court which I'm familiar with. 
    The president commission on law enforcement and justice concluded and I cite in my brief, there are as yet no data that demonstrate that alcoholism is a significant factor in the commission of crimes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1789.067" stopTime="1803.375">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    Mr. Tom Davis

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well then as I understand it, there is in your argument, there is no question as to the right of a policeman to arrest a man for being drunk in public, that there's no question about his right to put him in jail for that offense. 
    There is no objection to his being tried for the offense of public drunkenness, but that when it comes to his trial he has a right to interpose the defense of being a chronic alcoholic. 
    And if the court finds or the jury finds that he is a chronic alcoholic then he must be treated medically instead of criminally. 
    Now is that a fair statement of your position?

    Mr. Peter Barton Hutt 
    I would pose one qualification, Your Honor. 
    There have been times where a given individual was arrested as the U.S. Crime Commission found on one occasion, some 31 times in four months largely by the same police officer. 
    I think there may arise on occasion where there is an abuse of the arresting officer's discretion where he obviously has no probable cause for the arrest. 
    I'm not saying that this would necessarily be to --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2043.841" stopTime="2046.251">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean because he's a chronic alcoholic?
speaker="peter_barton_hutt" startTime="2046.251" stopTime="2074.987">
    Mr. Peter Barton Hutt 
    Because he is a known chronic alcoholic, for example, a man in the District of Columbia where that incident took place who had been adjudicated by court to be a chronic alcoholic and had been acquitted on 31 prior occasions. 
    The -- I think at that point the arresting officer if he knows that would -- well he may have not probable cause for the arrest, but certainly if he did not know that the man was an alcoholic, I would agree 100%.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2074.987" stopTime="2097.669">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well does a police officer when he's charged with the administration of law of that kind, have a right to judge the man's defense and either convict him of in his own mind and take him to jail, or acquit him on the street even though he is publicly drunk in violation of an ordinance?

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I suppose if it's unconstitutional to convict a person who is an alcoholic in the medical sense, then it is unconstitutional to arrest a person who is an alcoholic in the medical sense. 
    Now when you come to appraising whether the policeman did or did not do something for which he is legally liable then you get into a set of very different considerations. 
    If he knew that the person whom he arrested was a medically alcoholic then he has done something that maybe capable. 
    If he did not know that and had no reason to know it then he is not, he has not done something that is medically capable. 
    But if it's unconstitutional to convict a person who is medically alcoholic, then I suggest for your comment that it is unconstitutional for the police to arrest such a person.

    Mr. Peter Barton Hutt 
    Well, Mr. Justice Fortas I am troubled by your analysis a little bit, and I'd like to use the analogy to the insane. 
    I would suggest that it would be unconstitutional in this day and age to convict an insane person for a product caused by his insanity. 
    I would not suggest it would be unconstitutional to arrest him and charge him with a crime. 
    Therefore, I would be inclined to agree with the Chief Justice in that analysis.

    They're deeply interested, all of them, in improving both law enforcement and the standard of healthcare in our society. 
    The Chief Justice raised the question just before we adjourned, about the lack of facilities to handle the public inebriate alcoholic in our population. 
    I can't speak specifically for the state of the argue in Texas, but certainly around the country, the amici represent the people who would have to take up the slack and who must provide that treatment. 
    The American Medical Association, the state programs in alcoholism. 
    These are the people who will be dealing with the problem. 
    They're prepared to undertake the treatment. 
    One of the things that has been found throughout the country is that in areas where the jails have hidden the problem up to now, the situation is very poor. 
    There is a lack of treatment, but as soon as the jails are not used to hide the problem, treatment becomes available largely to a better use of existing resources.

    I would think, the way I would analyze it and this is my personal view point, is that the state is justified in intervening in a parens patriae view or rather role anytime that the individual is incapacitated for any reason, whether it's drunkenness and whether he's an alcoholic or not.

    We believe that a statute which does not purport to offer treatment that will rehabilitate people that will prevent the type of recidivism that is so clearly shown in this case by appellant Powell, has no logic, has no humanity and is manifestly cruel.

    I would say that I would be willing to concede that a state could make a legislative determination and that it might be reviewable in court and it might be sufficient and in my view probably would be sufficient evidence medically to overturn. 
    That issue isn't in this case because the Texas State Legislature has specifically found as a legislative fact that alcoholism is an illness and that an alcoholic drinks involuntarily. 
    He has lost self control over the use of alcohol. 
    That is true in at least 40 states. 
    And as a matter of fact, one of the amici curiae in this case is the North American Association of Alcoholism programs, which represents all of the state tax supported agencies that have been set up by the state legislatures to deal with this problem under state statutes.

    Alcoholism is defined as a condition in which the individual has lost control over his alcohol intake in the sense that he is consistently unable to refrain from drinking or to stop drinking before getting intoxicated. 
    He can't --

    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    We believe that the issue presented by this appeal is a more narrow one and in view of the last statements of counsel for amici, I'm not sure that this case raises the constitutional question they wish to raise at all. 
    We believe that the issue is whether an excessive drinker who has the ability to abstain may be convicted of public intoxication consistently with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    Now if indeed it is conceded that a person who has the power to abstain would not be subject to this constitutional immunity, we feel that this case does not raise the question sought at all. 
    The record is very short. 
    The critical witness on the question of the appellant's ability to abstain was the only psychiatrist called, he was called by the defendant. 
    The psychiatrist, the Dr.David Wade who was amply qualified as an expert in the field of diagnosis and treatment of alcoholics for a period of over 25 years, did testify on direct examination that the appellant has an uncontrollable compulsion to drink and that his going in public is involuntary. 
    However, on cross-examination this general assertion was substantially qualified and clarified, and I'm reading form the record on page 26, referring to the appellant. 
    Question “But at the time that he takes the first drink from a sober condition, would you say that it is a voluntary exercise of his will?” 
    Answer “Yes. 
    I would like to answer that question yes, but I would like to say that we must take into account” --

    But our position is that there's no substantial evidence in this record to support the conclusion that the defendant lack power to abstain from drinking entirely.

    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    There's no doubt that this person frequently drank to excess. 
    There's no doubt about that at all, but the astonishing thing is that some people do want to drink to excess occasionally and sometimes even frequently, that some people do want to adopt a way of life involving excessive use of alcohol. 
    Now it is quite common to characterize that as loss of control because the person doing the characterizing is ordinarily evaluating them from quite a different set of values. 
    The expert says “Well if I were that guy, I would not continue to drink in view of the consequences on his total life, but I don't think that means that the man's behavior is involuntary.” 
    As a matter of fact, studies by interview of these people, indicate that many of them say “I like to drink” and many of them say “I've never tried to stop” but ought that to immunize them. 
    Now the record in this case also includes a statement of Dr.Wade in terms of his taking the history of the appellant that the appellant had never been referred to Alcoholics Anonymous. 
    He didn't go beyond that, but I assume by that, that he was being polite in saying that the defendant had not sought the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
    Well why not? 
    I assume that the defendant for whatever reason had a desire to continue his present way of life.

speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="4060.040" stopTime="4068.791">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Well, it seems to me that the medical witness was being extremely careful on cross-examination and he explained himself --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4068.791" stopTime="4075.365">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And extremely careless on direct examination.
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="4075.365" stopTime="4165.287">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    The direct examination was primarily conducted by leading questions. 
    I think he was trying -- I assume he was trying to give honest answers to both counsel Your Honor, but I think that I do think that the cross-examination is significant. 
    I think it's also significant that during the redirect examination, there was no attempt the physician's statement on cross-examination. 
    Now the defendant, at one time, was asked “Can you stop drinking” and he said “No.” 
    That's the only other evidence in the record, but I would say that that is an ambiguous question because it doesn't indicate whether that means stop after you start or stop in the sense of completely abstaining. 
    Now it's my understanding that typical members of Alcoholics Anonymous for example characterize loss of control as loss of control after they take their first drink. 
    And Dr.Wade was making this statement not only with respect to the appellant but with respect -- he said the appellant was fairly typical of alcoholics. 
    And we have other authorities who also indicate that the dominant form of American alcoholism contains this phenomenon, namely an inability to drink moderately but an ability to completely abstain.

    No.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    That alcoholism just isn't a defense to some other act?
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="4210.353" stopTime="4281.229">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    The defendant's -- the appellant's argument seems to us to be this, that there exists a disease and I get the impression that is looked upon almost a unitary disease called chronic alcoholism. 
    And that this destroyed his will to abstain, his will to drink moderately, his will to avoid appearing in public in a condition of intoxication and therefore he ought to be treated not as a responsible human being but rather as an ill person who is acting without volition. 
    At the outset, it ought to be noted that this argument, if accepted by the Court, would have revolutionary implications for the criminal law. 
    For example, the alcoholic driver who drives to another bar or to a liquor store to get a bottle of liquor would presumably have a defense of chronic alcoholism to a charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or even perhaps to negligent homicide.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Volitional? 
    I understood it was not -- it was un-volitional criteria.
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="4422.425" stopTime="4563.548">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Well, volitional criteria, by that I meant requiring volition in some sense independent of his drive to obtain liquor. 
    I'm not disputing it here Your Honor. 
    It seems to us also that the principle which they urge would also a fortiori be applicable to crimes by a narcotic cabinet. 
    Immediately go on presumably would be the possession of narcotic statute to which under the Uniform Narcotics Act is fairly general throughout the nation. 
    If the person accused were a narcotics addict and presumably sale of narcotics by an addict in order to support his habit would also be exculpated. 
    And theft and prostitution and robbery by an addict in order to support his habit would presumably also, under the principle urged here, be exculpated. 
    Now with respect to the relationship between alcoholism and other crimes, we have not -- we have presented some information in our brief on page 17 and 18 a long study in Columbus, Ohio indicated 64 persons who were arrested for felonies were intoxicated. 
    Now that was not necessarily chronic alcoholics. 
    It would include presumably some chronic alcoholics and undetermined member. 
    In the study in Sing Sing prison indicated that 22% of their prisoners were habitually tampered. 
    Well there is a strong relationship between alcohol and other crimes because as is well known it does relax one's inhibitions. 
    And I don't think it can be said that we're only talking about harmless passive skid row derelicts because the range of chronic alcoholics or people diagnosed chronic alcoholics extends through all types of personalities; sociopaths, passive aggressive personality, schizophrenics, etcetera. 
    We're not dealing here with the homogenous group.

    Must be in bars, do they stay at home or somewhere else? 
    But I think -- do you understand the key to this -- the basis for this statement is that what they really mean is the person has lost his control, not that his alcohol simply drives him to go out on the street rather than to stay at home, because he just losses his control and he's appearing everywhere.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I asked you before, before you get to what you think would be the result that if we held that alcoholism was a disease and that man could not be convicted and punished for being drunk in public. 
    What would be the situation if he was tried at such a time for another offense that required a specific intent to proved, would it follow that because he didn't have control of himself to prevent his public drunkenness that he would be incapable of mens rea?
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="4761.028" stopTime="4785.979">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    I'm not sure that that would follow Your Honor, as I understand existing law being intoxicated is if indeed the evidence suggest a intoxication produced a lack of specific intent. 
    As I understand existing law, he could not be convicted of a crime requiring specific intent. 
    In other words his intoxication at present has evidentiary significance.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4785.979" stopTime="4829.451">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, well let us just take a specific case. 
    Say that the man was a known alcoholic such as this man. 
    He'd been arrested a hundred times, so this time he was obviously drunk and the ample testimony to show that he was. 
    And he was charged also with commission of a robbery at that time, but if we adopted the rule that's presented for us, would that mean that he couldn't be convicted of robbery because he would be incapable of performing the specific intent?
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="4829.451" stopTime="4880.358">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Well as I understand the appellant's position, it would depend upon the facts of the case, whether the robbery was in some sense a product of his chronic alcoholism. 
    Now what that might mean, I suppose would depend upon further decisions of the court. 
    But under the Carter case in the District of Columbia where similar matter was litigated, they said that the crime would be a product of a mental disease if it would not have occurred but for the mental disease, which is to say a very little cause or relationship was required. 
    And indeed the cause or relationship had to be negative by the prosecution beyond the reasonable doubt in order for the man to be convicted. 
    So I would think it would be quite possible to exculpate a robbery in your hypothetical.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well that one be because at anything that's argued here, would it? 
    That is, as I understand it, and I think you stated the doctrine correctly. 
    There's a lot of difficulty, there's a lot of inconsistencies in the cases in various jurisdictions, but then there are some types of crimes in which being under the influence of alcohol is a defense. 
    It's very restricted category. 
    By an large, as I understand it, in state law and state criminal law and administration it's not. 
    But where does this particular argument fit into that? 
    I don't gather your adversary's argument to be that we are to hold this unconstitutional because it results in a mental disease or defect or anything it would fit within category. 
    What's your connection between a holding to the effect that convicting a person who, suffering from the disease by alcoholism, that such conviction under a public intoxication statute is unconstitutional? 
    And the question of whether you can apply state criminal law to a person who's drunk.

    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Pardon me? 
    Oh! 
    I think that in other words I think that this statute has a prophylactic function in the sense that even though this man at present may not be staggering out in front of a car. 
    Or even though at present may not be cursing pedestrians or walking by, he can be removed from the street before these things occur. 
    And I think too there are aesthetic aspects to this type of prohibition which are of importance to many Americans. 
    In other words, I think that being in a sort of bowery type of atmosphere is extremely disturbing to many people. 
    I think many people would prefer to have their communities not be this way. 
    But I think there's a substantial aesthetic element in this specific crime which we're involved with here. 
    With respect to the statement that chronic alcoholism is a disease, we've made some sort of attempt in our brief to state our position and I won't say much more except this, that when we use disease in this context, we're not using it in the context of something which is capable of scientific verification that it is or is not a disease. 
    The American Psychiatric Association has -- my note on that escapes me for the moment, but the American Psychiatric Association calls alcoholism a personality disorder. 
    A class which includes disorders of psychogenic origin or without clearly defined tangible cause or structural chain. 
    Academic psychiatrists who are the only people I gather frequently ask themselves seriously what do psychiatrists mean by disease, although occasionally it's required now in medical – in legal contexts as well, indicate that what we mean by disease is disorderly behavior or deviant behavior I should say. 
    That the classification of disease within which it maybe asserted that chronic alcoholism is a disease, in other words, is not a category which precludes criminality. 
    It's a category which overlaps criminality because the psychiatrists are also concerned with deviant behavior. 
    Well why then is there so much concern whether it's a disease or it isn't a disease? 
    Well we suggest there's concern because disease has so much emotional force. 
    You find various groups interested in achieving with respect to alcoholic saying alcoholism is a disease, alcoholism a disease. 
    The reason they're doing this is not because this is a descriptively meaningful statement, but because they realize it has this emotional force. 
    Now as to chronic alcoholism as itself, as the court -- as some members of the Court have noted, there are a whole variety of different types of definitions frequently framed in terms of social deviancy. 
    For example endangering public moral, safety and welfare, or altering his -- interfering with his mental health etcetera. 
    Now it is quite true that there is commonly in a definition, although not always, an indication that the criterion is whether a man can control, whether he can control his behavior with respect to drinking. 
    However, how can we determine whether a person can control his behavior? 
    It is said “Well you can't ask him because alcoholics are can not frequently to be depended upon to give away --“

speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="5389.215" stopTime="5630.644">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    No, I'm trying to understand what the findings mean Your Honor. 
    In other words, assuming a person is said to lack ability to control what is meant by this. 
    It's not something which can be observed and scientifically demonstrated. 
    As far as I can see what it really means is that the expert from the standpoint of his values or for what -- or from the standpoint of what he assumes to be community values is believing that the individual is acting unwisely. 
    Now I that Judge Bazelon was coming to that point in the Washington case which we just decided at the end of last year. 
    That when the psychiatrist was talking in terms of behavior controls, he said this was largely merely a façade with respect to the moral judgments of the psychiatrist. 
    If you say in the ultimate sense on the basis of this person's whole life history that you can -- that it seems likely that he will continue to drink. 
    It seems to me that that is a sort of thing that can be said with respect to criminality in general if you assume, as psychiatrists tend to assume, that people are controlled by their prior histories and their genetic equivalent. 
    We attempted to make our position clear with respect to the defendant's assertion that the criminal law only ought to apply to people who act because of freewill. 
    We believe that this is a controversy that is not essential to constitutional adjudication of who is to be criminally responsible and who is not to be criminally responsible. 
    It is clear to us that the criminal law traditionally has not required free will. 
    For example, typical insanity test have not required freewill and even the Durham Rule does not necessarily require freewill if mental disease is thought to have some significance beyond volitional criteria. 
    Furthermore, the criminal law hasn't said to a person who is uncontrollably angry and who's charged with homicide that you were to be exculpated because you didn't have freewill. 
    We believe that the criminal law is rational as applied to even a chronic alcoholic for it includes givig him an opportunity for food, clothing, shelter or period of compulsory continence. 
    The D.C.crime report indicated that the health of chronic alcoholics in the district had markedly deteriorated following the Easter decision. 
    Now, it may be as additional facilities are brought to bear that things will get better, but it seems that that is a completely or is a largely unpredictable matter because we don't have very much experience with alternative facilities in this country. 
    Now we don't have very much experience as to how much for example cooperation alcoholics would give if voluntary facilities are made available to them. 
    Counsel for the appellants cited the experience recently in Saint Louis in which he indicated that 95% of the alcoholics referred to their detoxification center, had stayed there as long as the doctors wanted them to. 
    Actually the figure was 97%, however the maximum stay there was only seven days. 
    And we don't -- and these were alcoholics who were threatened with criminal prosecution if they left. 
    Presumably, that would not be allowed if the court decides as appellant requests here.

    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    I read the article to which they referred and it was an article by a person that has some responsibility for the program and I assume that he would not do it injustice and he indicated that if they didn't cooperate with the seven-day detoxification that they were subject to criminal prosecution in the Saint Louis. 
    Well under those circumstances he indicated 97% did stay there as long as the doctors wanted. 
    Now it may be also that the doctors said “Well if you want to leave I'll let you leave” so some left earlier anyway. 
    Our experience with respect to voluntary clinics does not provide a particular basis for optimism. 
    With respect to people who voluntarily seek help, according to one recent study, 50% of alcoholic patients after one contact with voluntary clinic did not reappear. 
    I don't believe that I have the study which I want to refer to. 
    I think was stated slightly too strongly. 
    The study I had indicated I think about 33% left after their initial visit and about 75% after a relatively short period of time. 
    There're some other statitics indicated in the appellant's brief that I would like to address myself to. 
    In both the opening appellant's brief and the reply appellant's brief figures in the neighborhood of 50% of cured, or aided, or arrested alcoholics are cited. 
    However, if you will examine the context of these figures, you will find that these do not refer to populations of skid row alcoholics the sort of person who we are primarily concerned with in this case. 
    The one congressional record citation which is given was changed in the edited version of the congressional version, I assume, because it made it clear that it was referring to a hospital population and not to a population to persons who are being arrested for public intoxication. 
    United States Public Health Service came up with quite different figures in a recent study, which is cited in our brief, namely that it was thought unlikely that more than 10-12% could be even aided, even aided and aided may only mean that a person decided to stay sober a little bit more often. 
    Well it may be that things would be much better than that, it may be, but we do not yet have the data to know. 
    We have just the beginnings of various programs which do not provide the basis. 
    It seems to us, for constitutional adjudication which would have the effect of terminating existing program. 
    With respect to the Robinson's case itself, we've attempted to deal with it in our brief.

    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    With respect to the Robinson case and the Driver case and the Easter case, we will rely on what we've said in our brief. 
    There are some cases on the other side which are also referred to in the briefs. 
    The Hoyt case in intermediate appellate courts in Michigan held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment did not require a result of the sort argued for here. 
    In the narcotics area, the cases seem to be unanimous and not extending Robinson beyond its limitations to include behavior with respect to narcotics. 
    It seems to me they're all against the principle which is urged here. 
    With respect to the -- with -- the Presidential Crime Commission did as appellant states recommend that public drunkenness not itself be a crime that the principle that they espouse is far more limited than the one here because for example they recommended the disorderly conduct continue to be a crime. 
    But on a purely involitional principle which we're talking about here, it would seem that the disorderly conduct would also fall and indeed Mr. Hutt has made that argument on other occasions. 
    With respect to the possibilities of achieving youthful social reform by forbidding a continuation of the present system, it seems to us a number of questions ought to be asked. 
    One question we've already addressed ourselves to and that's the question of what are the chances of improvement. 
    If indeed we are not likely to get substantial improvement with respect of a lot of alcoholics by referring them either to the streets or to alternative facilities, it seems that that would be a reason not to force this sort of a program across the nation. 
    One thing that would be helpful to know for example is how many chronic alcoholics change their way of life under present practice. 
    We don't really know this. 
    We know that there are an awful lot that don't that we don't have studies that indicate what the incidence is of those who do. 
    And we don't have studies indicating what the comparative results are between a detoxification approach of a few days detoxification as in a medical facility compared to a few days detoxification in a jail. 
    Somehow, detoxification has a much more pleasant sound, but essentially detoxification is an opportunity for a person to sober up I assume. 
    I would be very interested in studies which are now for example being undertaken with respect to the Saint Louis experiment. 
    I understand that since studies are being done by Washington University at Saint Louis, however we don't have the results of those studies yet. 
    Mr. Hutt says there's a bowery project that's been inaugurated, be interesting to find out what the success of that program is, but we don't have any information yet, and there's some studies in other cities as well. 
    Well, ultimately we submit, society is faced with a series of possible choices in terms of what ought to be done with respect to skid row alcoholic. 
    We feel that there are three essential alternatives which are before society. 
    Now one is that the present procedures continued to be allowed that criminal or civil processes be allowed with respect to alcoholics and in some communities essentially leaving them alone would continue to be allowed. 
    And this would include probation programs and various other types of programs which are tied to the criminal process. 
    However, the appellant urges that well the criminal process itself ought to be forbidden in part because jails are frequently badly ran institutions. 
    Well we feel that here is a real opportunity for the notion of cruel and unusual punishment in its traditional sense. 
    If indeed jails in some communities are badly run institutions then it would seem to us appropriate that those jails be thought to be cruel and unusual punishment, and in a historically sanctioned sense. 
    And that those facilities would not be continued to be used not only by habitual alcoholics but by any other people who are subject to penal confinement. 
    A second alternative is to permit civil commitment only and I gather this is commonly in approach which is appealing to the medical profession. 
    It is frequently thought that people who are heavily committed to drugs or to alcohol can not be cured under that patient basis. 
    They have to be taken to an environment where there's more control that the environment ought to be continued until the processes of attempted pretreatment can be continued. 
    The model for this approach to the treatment of alcoholics would be the State Mental Hospital or the juvenile detention facility. 
    Objectives of treatment and isolation would indeed be served. 
    However, in spite of the eagerness of some people to funnel people to civil facilities and indeed of course this has been the approaches of the States of New York and California following the decision of the Robinson case with respect to narcotics addict. 
    It seems to us that there are some real problems with respect to that. 
    We feel that the criminal process has great advantages in terms of the specificity of the charge which must be levied, the specificity of the statutory proscription that a person can not merely be confined on the basis of some person feeling that he is ill under the Vega's criteria and that he requires treatment. 
    And we feel that the specificity of sentence also has an advantage. 
    There's an advantage in the fact the defendant after four days in jail would get out of jail. 
    His disturbance of Austin society was not so great as to justify indefinite incarceration and the criminal process had the advantages compared to the civil process, it seems to us, in not permitting for his own good and under a theory of benevolence, indefinite in incarceration is as frequently the case with respect to civil commitment approaches to treatment. 
    It seems to us, in other words that the experience in the Galt case where we had probably, I suppose by and large a much more tractable population that we were dealing with in terms of juvenile delinquents than we do with respect to people whose long time drinking habits have caused them to be characterized as chronic alcoholics by and large, should make us very wary of saying to the medical profession “Well you take these people over and treat them if you will.”

    What's the Galt case got to do with that? 
    Do you mean --
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="6610.507" stopTime="6635.901">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Well the Galt case, it seems to us, to involve an inquiry into what has happened in another area of deviant behavior where there's been an effort to terminate the criminal process and replace it by a therapeutic approach with long term treatment available without specific criteria as to the amount of social damage which is been caused.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6635.901" stopTime="6648.672">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So I suppose people read opinion very differently. 
    I didn't -- don't read it quite that way.
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="6648.672" stopTime="6749.462">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Well the third approach is the approach which I gather is essentially urged here by the appellant and by the ACLU, although not by the Philadelphia amicus and that is terminate the possibilities of compulsory criminal control, terminate the possibilities of compulsory civil control and allow chronic alcoholics if they wish to remain on the street. 
    Now this is largely the approach which has been followed in the City of New York for many, many years and there it led to the bowery. 
    We believe that this would have unfortunate consequences both as a quality of American urban life and also unfortunate consequences in terms of protecting the health and safety of chronic alcoholics themselves. 
    In summary, our position is that we ought not now in terms of the information available, and in terms of to be prepared descript. 
    The devices for social control and the criminal processes with respect to chronic alcoholics, and we ought not now to devote to adopt the principle which would clearly apply not only to alcoholic offenders but also to narcotic offenders, and indeed to many other types of offenders. 
    Sociopaths, for example, are frequently defined in terms of lack of behavior control and their crimes ran the whole gamut as the court knows of --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6749.462" stopTime="6755.687">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But nobody suggested that they be arrested for being sociopaths.

    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    No Your Honor and we do not suggest that he appellant be arrested for being a chronic alcoholic.

    What do you suggest?

    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Well I would suppose it would depend upon what is deviant behavior it was. 
    If it was covered by a criminal proscription, I assume that he would be -- I would hope that he would be subject to the criminal process, if it weren't -- if that weren't the case and I would just hope that he would not be subject to criminal process.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6808.027" stopTime="6843.715">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You know we're not -- as I understand it, this statute does not talk about public intoxication involving a public nuisance as a difference between public intoxication. 
    As I understand it in being a public nuisance, you talk about public intoxication as if there were legal implicit in that phrase, the notion of a public nuisance. 
    And I think it -- that's not the necessary reading of the statute in any event.
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="6843.715" stopTime="6871.673">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Well I would agree Your Honor. 
    I would -- my point is that the principle urged here and I -- that in terms of a principle decision, the principle here would immediately reach the sort of substantial public nuisances that I've been talking about. 
    Now it's possible to adopt a different principle namely that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6871.673" stopTime="6885.110">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    No but you're talking about public nuisances and the statute talks about public intoxication.I thought you said a minute ago you agreed that they're not the same thing?
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="6885.110" stopTime="6897.110">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Well I -- what I meant to say was that I could -- I agreed to the statute would apply to people whose behavior was not markedly disorderly.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6897.110" stopTime="6913.044">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well that's what we're talking about in this case. 
    We're not talking about disorderly conduct. 
    We're talking about public intoxication, period. 
    That's what the statute is that's what the findings of the Court are in this particular case.
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="6913.044" stopTime="6913.278">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    Well the --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6913.278" stopTime="6936.364">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    They very well be that, and I happen to believe that it is very different matter if you're dealing with disorderly conduct or being a public nuisance for whether it is or is not a different matter, it's not the issue before this Court at the present time.
speaker="david_robinson_jr" startTime="6936.364" stopTime="7097.057">
    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    We believe that the principle which is urged as a basis for the constitutional adjudication by this Court does indeed reach disorderly conduct. 
    Now, I can agree that there are possibilities through other principles of limiting the reach of the sort of decision which the appellant seek. 
    For example, I could imagine that it could be thought that the social objective with respect to removing chronic alcoholics themselves did not justify their incarceration, but the social objectives with respect to chronics alcoholics who for example were uttering obscenities might indeed justify subjecting them to the criminal process. 
    But the difference between those two cases seems to us not to be in terms of their analysis of the principle they suggest whether one is more volitional than the other. 
    It seems so us in -- that the case goes not only to the alcoholic, to the addict, to the sociopath etcetera but that the case essentially asks this Court to adopt standards for criminal insanity which would be of a constitutional dimension would be applicable throughout the nation. 
    Because again the principle they urge is one which requires a volitional insanity test, it seems to us, namely they urge that a person whose behavior is the product of something denominated in mental illness that this person be exculpated. 
    In other words, it seems to me they're also asking for the abolition of the insanity test currently prevalent in most of the states. 
    Now, without arguing the pros or cons of that, it seems to us that the very evanescence sort of standards referring to behavior controls which are proposed here, at least we don't know enough about them and we're not sufficiently confident of our ability to give them operational significance so that they can be utilized in the courtrooms throughout the land without merely being a façade for the particular views of the particular psychiatrist, that this Court ought not yet to adopt such insanity standards. 
    In any event, if the constitutional issue which the appellant seeks to raise is indeed reached in this case, we would agree that the cases of the most vital interest not only to the minority of chronic alcoholics but to the entire American society. 
    And we believe that we plead on their behalf. 
    Thank you.

    Yes, but is it voluntary commitment or compulsory?

    Mr. David Robinson, Jr. 
    I don't have personal knowledge of that. 
    I asked my associate here who is an executive assistant to the attorney general of Texas that question and he was uncertain. 
    He knew that there was a compulsory commitment provision and he knew that it was possible for an alcoholic to request commitment and receive commitment to a Texas state hospital.

    I'm informed that the states have statutes with relating to civil commitment of alcoholics to quite generally and that they typically limit the term of permissible commitment between 30 -- between I think either 30 or I think between 90 days and three years.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7177.951" stopTime="7240.612">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The reason I was asking, I suppose there're a lot of these people who are in the condition of this man whose case is here today who would much rather be in and out of jail the way he is than to be committed to a mental hospital for a long period of time. 
    And I just wondering what would happen if he couldn't be convicted and a state had no compulsory incarceration in a mental hospital before he comes before the court and say “Well, I'm an alcoholic and I can't” -- no “I'm not an alcoholic. 
    I can restrain myself alright but I just didn't do it this time." 
    And what could the Court do if would it try him and find out that he was an alcoholic, and if they found he was an alcoholic they say “Well we can't do anything one way or the other to you.”
