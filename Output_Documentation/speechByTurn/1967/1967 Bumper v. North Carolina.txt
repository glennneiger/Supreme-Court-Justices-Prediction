Bumper v. North Carolina

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 1016, Wayne Darnell Bumper, Petitioner, versus North Carolina. 
    Mr. Smith, you may continue with your argument.
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="12.584" stopTime="41.840">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday afternoon, at closing time I think I had made the proposition that the challenge for a cause should be limited only to people who say they cannot give either the state or the defendant a fair trial. 
    That only those people should be kept off the jury. 
    Now I'd like to state my reasons for this proposition.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="41.840" stopTime="75.489">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Before you begin, I want to be sure I understood correctly what I -- I thought I understood you to acknowledge and concede yesterday and that is that in this case, there was sufficient opportunity for interrogation of the venary of the respective jurors so that the challenges for cause were allowed only for those respective jurors who said that in this case they could not return a verdict of death, is that --
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="75.489" stopTime="75.556">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Your Honor that's --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="75.556" stopTime="76.343">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- do you concede that?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="76.343" stopTime="84.986">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    That is my opinion and I really -- I don't attempt to make the question any broader than --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="84.986" stopTime="85.339">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right. 
    So --
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="85.339" stopTime="87.015">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    -- what I've just stated.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="87.015" stopTime="93.030">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So this is a different case in that respect from the Illinois case here?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="93.030" stopTime="96.448">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Of course, that issue, I suppose could be reached in the Illinois case --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="96.448" stopTime="97.453">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yet --
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="97.453" stopTime="117.668">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    -- but this is really, I think a -- were confronted of, I believe here with the collision course really between the right of the state to seek the death penalty and what we contend to be the right of the defendant to seek a fair trial. 
    Now --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="117.668" stopTime="119.938">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    May I ask you a question to --
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="119.938" stopTime="120.299">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="120.299" stopTime="123.280">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Here, there is no statute, is there?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="123.280" stopTime="148.101">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    No, sir. 
    There's a long line of cases in North Carolina and beginning, I believe about 1870 the earliest one of which is cited in petitioner's brief and we're concerned only with the common law disqualification. 
    A really common law is not the right word either because I contend there was no disqualification of the common law but it is a court-made rule enforced in North Carolina.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="148.101" stopTime="150.117">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And --
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="150.117" stopTime="151.032">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    And --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="151.032" stopTime="173.710">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is there -- are you suggesting to us that there is a pattern here of which the pattern here -- or which this -- disqualification as a pattern, a pattern of disqualification for this particular reason?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="173.710" stopTime="239.047">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, Your Honor, I certainly think so. 
    The first point, I believe, is it -- that it's numerically significant. 
    Now, the Attorney General of North Carolina stipulated or conceded in the case of Crawford v. (Inaudible) that 30% of our citizens in North Carolina would be challengeable for a cause on this ground, on the ground of conscientious subjection to the death penalty. 
    I presume that elsewhere in the United States, the statistics are pretty much the same. 
    Certainly from the (Inaudible) post and the other indices available to us are -- this is not an unreasonable figure keeping in mind that some of those who at the outset say they are opposed which is something like half of our population may as the study cited by Mr. Jenner (ph) yesterday made by Professor Zeisel indicates, these people when really put to the test of a heinous or atrocious crime might back down and be willing to invoke the death penalty. 
    But I think that 30% figure is a fair figure for North Carolina since it's conceded by my adversary.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="239.047" stopTime="256.778">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, forgive me. 
    Let me ask you another question. 
    Is that the position here that the state has a right to have persons in this category disqualified for a cause?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="256.778" stopTime="258.055">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Well, I think --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="258.055" stopTime="296.742">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose a judge said, “Alright, this respective witness says that he has a conscientious scruple against returning -- imposing the death penalty in this case” but nevertheless, I think he is taking all and all, he is qualified to serve. 
    Would that be error under your law or with it be -- regardless of whether you -- there's anything in the District Prosecuting Attorney could do about it. 
    Would it be error as you understand your law or would it merely be a permissible exercise of discretion by the judge?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="296.742" stopTime="307.077">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Well, if -- I'm not sure I understand the question, Your Honor. 
    Is it -- you mean if a prospective juror says that he could do it in some cases but not in all cases --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="307.077" stopTime="319.414">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    No, prospective jurors says that to his conscientious scruple, he could not -- against imposing the death penalty. 
    He couldn't do it generally. 
    He can't do it in this case, in any particular case.
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="319.414" stopTime="320.186">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="320.186" stopTime="329.475">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And the judge nevertheless says, “Well, taking it all and all I'm going to overrule the challenge for cause."
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="329.475" stopTime="362.032">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Oh, I think that would be error. 
    And although I haven't researched the question, my often opinion would be that the state could have the error reversed by the Supreme Court although appeals by the state are very nearly limited in North Carolina in criminal cases not -- without researching the point, I'd hesitate to say. 
    But if he recognize this error whether or not the state could procure a reversal is something I noted Mr. McGalliard could answer more correctly than I can.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="362.032" stopTime="371.653">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you to be answering -- is it clear but your -- does the North Carolina have a death sentence imposed? 
    Does it authorize the death sentence?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="371.653" stopTime="372.962">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="372.962" stopTime="374.652">

    For crimes like this?

    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="376.083" stopTime="400.773">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And what you're insisting, as I understand it, is that it is a constitutional error for people to be taken off the jury because they tell the jury the -- under no circumstances, would convict and impose the death sentence. 
    Is that your position?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="400.773" stopTime="402.691">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes Your Honor, it is.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="402.691" stopTime="404.844">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's the question that you brought to us?

    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, sir. 
    Well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="406.765" stopTime="419.876">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now it's not that -- I must say I misunderstand you. 
    It's not that they tell the judge that they would not convict. 
    They should tell the judge that they would not impose the death sentence, isn't that --
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="419.876" stopTime="420.475">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, Your Honor, that's --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="420.475" stopTime="421.528">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Oh, that's what I mean. 
    I did --
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="421.528" stopTime="422.024">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    That second --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="422.024" stopTime="423.580">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's what I thought you've said it.
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="423.580" stopTime="429.524">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    The second question is not asked under our practice and it's my contention that that second question is the vital question --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="429.524" stopTime="430.544">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That was your point, yeah?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="430.544" stopTime="431.648">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Now --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="431.648" stopTime="434.544">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Would you -- I'm sorry, would you state that again?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="434.544" stopTime="466.978">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    My contention is that the vital question is the second question of whether or not in spite or your scruples you could go on and give both the state and the defendant a fair trial on the issue of guilt or innocence. 
    If you can do that in spite of your scruples we contend the juror should be ceded and no challenge for cause should be allowed because we believe that the right of a fair trail attaches on this primary issue of guilt or innocence and the state's right to seek the death penalty must be subordinated to that. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="466.978" stopTime="496.774">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I under -- I didn't understand that to be Justice Black's question. 
    Justice Black, I thought, asked you if a juror said that he could not bring in a capital verdict in this or any other case because of his conscientious subjections, and you said that you thought in those circumstances that there would be error for the court to excuse him that.
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="496.774" stopTime="505.285">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    By capital verdict, I understood Mr. Justice Black to mean a verdict of guilty without recommendation of mercy.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="505.285" stopTime="505.593">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I meant --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="505.593" stopTime="509.431">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, that means it's a capital verdict, isn't it?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="509.431" stopTime="547.999">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    But I'm trying to distinguish between the jury's function in recommending or not recommending mercy. 
    That is determining whether or not there will be like imprisonment and its function of adjudicating guilt or innocence. 
    And if this juror, this prospective juror said that he could give the state and the defendant a fair trial on the issue of guilt or innocence, in spite of his scruples against death -- the death penalty, then he should be ceded. 
    Even though he says in no case can I impose the death penalty and --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="547.999" stopTime="554.969">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I don't understand that. 
    Do you say, “Even though he said there's no case would he impose a death penalty”?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="554.969" stopTime="576.346">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I think it's been demonstrated that in many instances, a juror who has opposed to the death penalty would nevertheless be willing to vote on the guilt or innocence issue where the -- with a free and impartial mind in accordance with the instructions given by the judge.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="576.346" stopTime="576.687">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What if -- what if --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="576.687" stopTime="577.464">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Just take up the question --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="577.464" stopTime="578.347">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Excuse me.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="578.347" stopTime="605.310">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- as I had it before. 
    Let's take a juror. 
    He comes in. 
    They asked him if he has scruples against the death penalty, he says, “Yes”. 
    The judge has a long colloquy with you in which he insists that he is qualified because he believes he might impose a death penalty. 
    The juror continuous to say, “I would not". 
    What do you say about excusing him as a matter of right?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="605.310" stopTime="614.734">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Then, at that point, Your Honor, a second question must be asked to the juror. 
    He must be asked, “In spite of your scruples against the death penalty, can you, on the issue --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="614.734" stopTime="619.747">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    That he could not give the state --

speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="626.518" stopTime="630.986">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Well, Your Honor, I still think that's a different question because --

    Is that not what you have here?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="634.174" stopTime="636.971">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, sir, but I think they have to ask them another question.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, but did you think that when you prepared your certiorari up here or did you cons -- determined that yesterday after you heard this argument?

    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Well, it's been my feeling all along Your Honor.

    Why is it in your brief?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="651.222" stopTime="674.296">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Well, it's set out very clearly in my reply brief, Your Honor. 
    The entire Section 4 beginning on page 10 is directed to that exact problem. 
    I think I have some reasons that would support this position and I'd like to --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="674.296" stopTime="699.113">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And that provision is that there has to be -- even though he had said, "I had never under any circumstances vote to impose the death penalty". 
    Nevertheless he should then be asked as I understand your position? 
    But on the issue of guilt or innocence, can you not withstanding those scruples against the death penalty fairly determine whether or not this man is guilty or innocent?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="699.113" stopTime="699.692">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Mr. Norman B. Smith

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="707.003" stopTime="727.789">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That arises in your jurisdiction because unlike some jurisdictions where a finding of guilt of certain offenses results automatically in the imposition of the death penalty, in your jurisdiction, it's up to the jury to select the penalty to be imposed with this --

    In your state, for a juror to qualify, must he say that he would be willing to set aside any preconceived ideas that he might have of the law and follow the instructions of the court as to the law not withstanding?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="919.391" stopTime="921.850">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Yes. 
    Yes Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="921.850" stopTime="937.778">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How could a man who said, “I will under no circumstances bring in a capital verdict” if the judge instructs him that this is a proper case in which such a verdict can be brought in under the law?
speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="937.778" stopTime="1000.227">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Well, I would suggest, Your Honor that he would still feel himself free to join with the other jurors and find the defendant guilty. 
    And then when it comes to the penalty phase of the deliberations, he would refuse to join the other jurors in failing to recommend mercy and he would come back in and possibly hung the jury. 
    On the other hand, it's possible that he could be talked out of this position. 
    And I -- of course, if the mechanics of the jury, the deliberation process are still I suppose quite much of a mystery, I don't think we know a lot about it. 
    But it appears from the results in cases that hung jurors are relatively few when it -- it's either some kind of a compromise that's worked out such as a lesser included offense possibly or the moral persuasion of the majority and finally bends the will of the minority on the jury. 
    I think this is a usual thing. 
    It happens all the time.

speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="1155.073" stopTime="1335.773">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    Well, I think it does. 
    I think these are related arguments. 
    I think that's what the Fourth Circuit ultimately determined. 
    I guess I better talk about the search and seizure for in the moment. 
    The defendant was arrested on the day after the search. 
    I made a misstatement of that fact in the brief. 
    I said the -- vice-versa but the search was before the arrest. 
    The defendant lives with his grandmother who was a 66 years old Negro widow who lived at the end of a one mile dirt road in the rural section of Alamance County, North Carolina. 
    I've been down that road and it's quite generous to call it a road because it's a pretty rough track. 
    The point I suppose, is it is an isolated place and at the time the officers came, four of them and four sheriffs in a sheriff's car, all white, the grandmother was -- at the house along with some of her infant grandchildren not including the defendant who was 18 but some younger children and her adult son was away from the house. 
    These officers came up to the door. 
    This woman is elderly and I think that if -- from reading the record, you can indicate -- the record indicates she's deficient in education. 
    And the officers pulled out some kind of a paper and presented it to her instead they had a warrant or a notice or something. 
    She called it a warrant on one occasion, notice on the other for searching her premises. 
    They didn't explain why they were searching or on what connection and she acquiescently opened the door and stepped aside and said, “Alright, come in, you may search” and they did. 
    And they looked around in the house and found in the kitchen, which was a common room of the house, a rifle, which was a common article of the household. 
    I suggest owned and possessed among all the individuals in the household including the defendant. 
    This rifle was seized and taken and it later became material evidence in the case. 
    They also stripped some of the clothing of one of the 14 year old grandson who was present. 
    His clothing, however, was later returned and not used in the trial. 
    Incidentally, it didn't match the kind of clothing that the defendant supposedly wore on the occasion in question anyway. 
    This matter was brought up to trial by a motion to suppress and I tendered an affidavit by the grandmother explaining these things which I have just set out, this one. 
    And then attended to her as a witness and she was cross-examined by the Solicitor and in -- on a redirect and I supposed, would say I examined her again and she testified to me the essential --

speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="1338.795" stopTime="1355.233">
    Mr. Norman B. Smith 
    No, sir. 
    The piece of paper is nowhere in the record and what the Solicitor did, and it could be found on page 43 of the appendix of the -- the Solicitor said to the judge -- I see my time is --

    The Solicitor said that the court of the state is not relying on the search warrant and the court said, “Are you so stating for the record” and the Solicitor said, “Yes, sir”. 
    And then I said, “Then we're concerned only with consent” and the court indicated we were. 
    So the warrant was never introduced, not part of the record. 
    And the Solicitor never at any time relied on it. 
    Yet, I contend that the officers relied on it at the time they made the search. 
    This woman thought she was yielding to a search by warrant, an official warrant, brought by officers of the law.

    I think semi illiterate, Your Honor, although again unfortunately, that doesn't appear from the record. 
    I can say that that reading, the dialogue, reading the testimony would indicate that she was not an educated person. 
    She clearly didn't have any conception of constitutional law or political science or matters of that nature. 
    I'm suggesting to the court that Mapp versus Ohio is being evaded and detoured perhaps by the excessive use of this device of the consensual search. 
    And if the exclusionary rule which this Court put -- lay down in Mapp is to be preserved that the case is such as Amos and Johnson versus United States must be declared Fourteenth Amendment law, a Fourteenth Amendment law and made applicable to the states. 
    Taking a phrase from the case of Johnson v. United States granted in submission to authority rather than as an understanding in the intentional waiver of the constitutional right. 
    Clearly, I think you -- epitomizes the behavior of the woman under these circumstances. 
    And I don't think her testimony, which is somewhat confused and earning a heat of the courtroom proceedings and under a rather stiff cross-examination. 
    It was a crowded courtroom of a controversial case. 
    It takes a lot of pressure. 
    I don't think that this can be deemed conclusive. 
    So for these reasons, the petitioner respectfully prays that the court to set aside the conviction of the petitioner and order that he be granted a new trial. 
    On behalf of the petitioner, I thank the court for hearing the case.

    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In view of all the discussions in the Witherspoon case yesterday unless before I certainly don't want to be repetitious on the jury question. 
    But I'd like to emphasize one or two points that might help clarify. 
    In North Carolina we have four capital crimes, first degree murder, arson, first degree burglary, rape. 
    The punishment as the statute reads is death unless the jury shall make a recommendation of life imprisonment. 
    In which case, it shall be mandatory that the judge impose by --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1723.886" stopTime="1726.563">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I thought the jury's recommendation was of mercy?
speaker="harry_w_mcgalliard" startTime="1726.563" stopTime="1737.277">
    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    Well, that's the newspaper phrase casually used down there often but our statute does not use the word “mercy” and our judges have continued the harping on the, it's a recommendation of life imprisonment --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1737.277" stopTime="1740.070">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So it's an explicit recommendation by the jury of life imprisonment?
speaker="harry_w_mcgalliard" startTime="1740.070" stopTime="1745.403">
    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    That's correct. 
    In which case, it is mandatory that a judge impose life imprisonment and nothing else.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1745.403" stopTime="1747.917">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And otherwise, it's mandatory that he impose the death sentence, (Voice Overlap)?
speaker="harry_w_mcgalliard" startTime="1747.917" stopTime="1749.091">
    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1749.091" stopTime="1749.913">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="harry_w_mcgalliard" startTime="1749.913" stopTime="1995.035">
    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    In other words, if they are silent, the death penalty is mandatory. 
    If they make a recommendation of life imprisonment, that is mandatory. 
    Now, I think the principle to be decided in this jury case has a great deal more significance for North Carolina in the future of its criminal procedure practices than perhaps the mere question of a single new trial of the man because of a possible error of this -- the search and seizure. 
    So I'd like to say a little more about this. 
    As mentioned before, North Carolina does not by statute control the matter of challenge of a juror for cause. 
    Whether you call it common law or whether it's been judicial practice over the years, certainly by court holding, the first general principle recognized is that a person who has biased may on the challenge be excused for cause which of course in no ways effects his right to take his full number for preemptory challenges which affixed by statute. 
    Now, in our court, I -- but I'd like to say this, not only does the statute not cover it but actually our Supreme Court in North Carolina has not had squarely presented to it the question of how far must you prove the man who originally says he has opposed the capital punishment. 
    In order to reach a point where he may be disqualified by challenged for bias. 
    But the assumption, underlying assumption as I read it in our court decisions, is that they assume he has been examined to the point that he could not in this particular case under any circumstances imposed the death penalty. 
    Now the judge writing the case in the opinion below uses this sentence: Where a juror states in advance that under no circumstances would he accept the contentions or positions of a party which in this case would be the imposition of the death penalty. 
    He is not impartial to that party but as a corollary, he must necessary be partial to the adversary. 
    And in this opinion below in the Bumper case, the judge did not discuss at much length to this but made great reference to a case a few months or few years earlier. 
    The Charles case in which Chief Justice Parker wrote at length on the disqualification of the juror by reason of bias that he was opposed to capital punishment and Judge Parker there again assumed also apparently that we are talking about situation where the man has said, “I cannot in this case” under any circumstances. 
    Not just a general -- I'm opposed to capital punishment attitude. 
    And there again, the judge below holding Judge, the Chief Justice Parker, who in terms quoting ALR "upon the theory, the conscientious scrupulous against infliction of the death penalty under any circumstances or equivalent beliefs equally disqualify a jury for cause of prosecution for a corrupted crime for so long. 
    So I think we can fairly say that although the question hasn't been presented in exactly that fashion our court has adopted the position that it does not make this test, that it was much discussed in the Witherspoon case. 
    Now as -- going a little further to the practice, defense counsel, I suggested that every juror was questioned to that point in this case. 
    I think in all fairness to him of the 16 excluded, perhaps two of them were questioned quite that far. 
    Two of them, one of them merely said, “I do not believe in capital punishment”. 
    It's Ms. (Inaudible) record page 19 and Ms. Fuller record page 16. 
    I have conscientious or religious group was against the imposition of the capital punishment. 
    That they all --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Were they all present when the others were questioned?

    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    Yes, sir. 
    They were all -- (Inaudible) I don't know. 
    I assumed they were, one of the large group. 
    They were, counsel said. 
    Now I take it, if there's error, it would be in a systematic exclusion of a group. 
    And I think, in the light of what our Supreme Court has said, the court practice in this case of 14 of the 16 were excluded only when they did make this proper test that we could not well say that an error as to two indicated in a systematic exclusion on the part of the state or the court system. 
    Certainly, the trial judges, as far as I know, the prosecuting attorneys --

    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    I -- of course, I'd be willing to -- although it's necessary, I don't think North Carolina's point of view, I'd be willing to go much farther. 
    Yesterday -- I mean not yesterday, in line with the arguments yesterday and take the view, there's enough bias perhaps just in those expressions. 
    But I'm saying that for the sake of argument even if we should say that is error as to those two. 
    I don't think it's a type of error that shows a systematic exclusion of a nature which should result in sending the case back.

    And that the constitutional error or the fault with a state system in jury exclusion is because of the states proceeding to -- in a wholesale fashion exclude a group because of national original or race or religion or economic situation and that having those such systematic exclusion and none being argued for, the mere fact that one or two instances, the judge may have wrongly excused a particular person is not the type of situation that would invoke the protection of this Court would be my argument on that.

    I -- as I understand Mr. Smith's argument, it is to the effect that a state has a very little interest as compared with the interest of defendants because of -- you've had only two executions in the last ten years. 
    And I supposed that it would be arguable that the state's real interest, really substantial interest here may not be so much in obtaining capital punishment as it is in selecting jurors who have a kind of a predisposition towards bringing in a verdict of guilty regardless of the penalty. 
    Now, what do you say to that? 
    Is this a question in your judgment and experience? 
    Does this question with respect to scruples about conscientious -- about the attitude towards capital punishment? 
    Does that question in your judgment in fact served to get into the jury box more people who are disposed to bring in a verdict of guilty?
speaker="harry_w_mcgalliard" startTime="2444.710" stopTime="2492.008">
    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    I have a run down on all of those access, what happened on this other -- there were about five or six, maybe eight new trials resulting in life sentences at the second trial. 
    One instance, one man was committed to life. 
    There might have been ten cases where new trials -- one, the Elmer Davis case which was up here resulted in nothing because the principal evidence was a confession which was held improper. 
    Now to come back to your question, I suppose what's your aiming at now is what the petitioner's counsel has described as a conviction prone attitude of people who are not opposed to capital punishment as against the opposite.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2492.008" stopTime="2507.527">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes, and I take it that implicit in his argument as a suggestion that that's the real objective or one of the real objectives of the question about conscientious or religious scruples.

    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard

    And I don't think the studies have been made are adequate to draw conclusions as to whether people who are the ones I'm familiar with, the ones petitioner to counsel has cited in his brief and referred to do not go far toward convincing me. 
    I think they are taken from small, selected, unrepresentives group -- unrepresented groups. 
    The numbers involved are numerically small. 
    There are conclusions, to me, would be about it, a petty thing upon which to base such a broad conclusion as to the psychological attitudes and predilections of what, 80 million people (Inaudible) make the 120 might be subject to jury service.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. McGalliard, before we get to that, may I ask you just one question in the procedure. 
    As I understood Mr. Smith, it is his belief that if the jury could not agree on whether there should be the death penalty or life imprisonment should be imposed that the defendant would be entitled to a new trial. 
    I understood him say that for instance if one juror held out against capital punishment that that would have to result in a new trial. 
    Is that the situation?
speaker="harry_w_mcgalliard" startTime="2725.867" stopTime="2774.886">
    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    I understood defense counsel to say he believed that to be true on the basis of a dictum. 
    I have no current recollection of the dictum. 
    The situation, so far as I know, has not arisen but I rather think and I have nothing here to cite, I rather think that the situation is this: the jury is instructed first to consider guilt or innocence. 
    If they return a verdict of guilty, then they're instructed to consider whether they will recommend life imprisonment or not. 
    I think once they voted guilty, they have a verdict of guilty and would come out with that and could only come out with a recommendation of mercy or life imprisonment rather if they all agree. 
    I'd rather think that might be but I don't think either if it would say that North Carolina has decided that.

    No, I find everyday -- I think -- more things I don't know. 
    Now, coming very quickly and I gathered from Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Marshall's question, I frankly was a little annoyed upset when I picked up the record and saw just two things. 
    First, the officers went into the lady's house and said, ”We want to search. 
    We have a warrant”, that's as far as the officers went and then I saw: Solicitor says, "Whether you rely on consent, judge by consent. 
    I didn't even look at that again till the next day because I know this general principle is rather hard to overcome the presumption that the consent was merely acquiescence to the authority of the law under such circumstances. 
    However that may be, that is what they did and the question is, under those circumstances, is it still possible to consent? 
    You cannot volunteer a consent to be shown. 
    The only way I know would be to try to determine the frame of mind of this person, the attitude with which she did or did not consent. 
    She said, I would pay him much attention. 
    I told Mr. Stockard, that's the sheriff, that's on page 47 of the appendix, to go ahead and look them -- look all over the house. 
    I had no objection them making a search on my house. 
    I was willing to let them look in any room or drawer in my house they wanted to.

    Now I was curious enough, as Mr. Justice Harlan has asked, was there a piece of paper? 
    Now I did not know whether you meant me to answer that by going out of the record or not.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    (Inaudible) My understanding of this case was that there is a misrepresentation by the officers that they have a certain search warrant, it wasn't a search warrant at all, maybe I got that outside of the record but that's (Inaudible).
speaker="harry_w_mcgalliard" startTime="2991.228" stopTime="3065.585">
    Mr. Harry W. McGalliard 
    Well, I was curious enough finally after certiorari was granted. 
    I called the Solicitor asked him, “What was going on?” 
    I said, “Why -- what's wrong with your search warrant I seem to have what I didn't think they are also rely on but I'm seeing -- do something wrong with the warrant. 
    He said, “Well, that's months ago. 
    I don't remember now why I don't use it” said the lady consented. 
    If you could've seen the way she talked, how open, cooperative she was in the courtroom with -- not thinking about they had any question about his being a genuine consent. 
    I said, there was something wrong with the warrant. 
    He said, “Well, I have to look it up”. 
    He said, “I'll send your copy”. 
    So the next morning in the mail, I get an -- Xerox, I guess it is copy of the search warrant. 
    With this note from the Solicitor enclosed by (Inaudible) search warrant in the case State against Bumper about which you called today. 
    I remember now why I elect you to go on a consent to search basis. 
    After Mrs.Leath, told the officers they didn't need a search warrant, they didn't serve it. 
    Please pardon the informality and without (Inaudible). 
    There -- at the place where the officers returned with ordinarily be filled in that we own this day search, a such a place and found such argument. 
    There is nothing. 
    I would argue, I don't know how far it would get on --

    Of course the Solicitor's notion and my notion of service are two different things. 
    I take it once you have a search warrant, announced you have it and proceeds search with it, and that's an adequate service unless the person they're in charged demands that it would be read. 
    I would argue under Ms.Leath's testimony that they served -- that they served this at a -- in a subsequent trial, they wanted to show the validity of the search.

    I would always use one. 
    If we're ever to get by the consent question, I have raised in my brief, my time is about up, considerable question as to whether this defendant has any standing to challenge this on the ground that it was his grandmother's premises, his grandmother's rifle, he was not present, as far as I could gather, at the time of the search and the only theory I can think of would be whether we have invaded an area of his privacy in that he was also domicile in the same home. 
    But we must remember it was grandmother's rifle and even as suggested here, there's no evidence, members of the family had a free right to use grandmother's rifle and she said it was her rifle. 
    I don't believe there's any implied permission to take the rifle and go after to commit two capital offenses of rape and two attempted murders. 
    And we don't think his area of privacy was invaded.
