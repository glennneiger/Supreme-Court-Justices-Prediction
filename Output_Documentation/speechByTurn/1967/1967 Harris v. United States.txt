    Number 92, James H. Harris, Petitioner, versus United States. 
    Mr. Weinstein.

    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reviewing judgment -- the decision of that court. 
    The issue presented before the Court today is may a property which was seized from the petitioner's automobile during a general administrative search at a time subsequent to petitioner's arrest after his automobile had been impounded by the police and towed where police -- precinct lot some four or five miles from the place of arrest while the petitioner was in custody and under lawful arrest at the police station be received in evidence against the petitioner consistent with the Fourth Amendment with the search of the automobile and the seizure of the property as performed without a warrant. 
    The regulation promulgated by the Metropolitan Police Department in this case is cited on page 3 of my brief. 
    During the late evening hours of August 29th, 1964 at approximately 11:45 PM that evening, a York robbery occurred in the 5500 Block of 13th Street, Northwest Washington DC. 
    Among one of the articles taken from the victim that evening was a registration card to his automobile bearing his name and identification of that automobile. 
    An off-duty police officer at approximately at the time of the robbery observed three colored males running North on 13th Street and enter a Ford automobile. 
    The officer wrote down a description of the automobile and the tag number. 
    He phoned this description in to the sixth precinct approximately five to 10 minutes after he observed the three males running North on 13th Street. 
    The next day another police officer was assigned to investigate this robbery. 
    And at that time was given a description of the automobile and the tag number. 
    The police officer at that time checked with the Motor Vehicle Department of the District of Columbia and ascertain that the petitioner in this case was the owner of that automobile and also that the car was registered to a premises in the vicinity of the 2500 Block of M Street, Northwest. 
    The police officer preceded to the area the 2500 Block of M Street Northwest, at which time, he saw the petitioner in this case attempt to enter his automobile. 
    The officer testified that the petitioner had opened the door to his car when he approached him, asked him his name, placed him under arrest for robbery. 
    The petitioner was placed in a police cruiser at that point. 
    The arresting officer conducted a cursory search of the automobile to see whether or not there were any weapons in the automobile. 
    He found none. 
    He then called for a police crane to come and tow the vehicle to the sixth precinct. 
    The car was left on the M street --at 1M Street unlocked and unattended to await the arrival of the police crane. 
    The arresting officer and his partner transported the petitioner via a police cruiser to the sixth precinct which was a ride of 10 to 20 minutes and was approximately six or seven miles from the place of arrest. 
    The time of arrest without any warrant was estimated to be at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. 
    At approximately 3:00 PM the same day, the operator of the crane arrived at the sixth precinct and informed the arresting officer that the car was on the lot inside of the precinct. 
    He notified the officer that there was a light rain falling, and that he did not roll up the windows because he did not want to disturb any finger prints which may have been found on the automobile. 
    Officer Baker who was the arresting officer went out to the automobile to make an inventory search pursuant to the police regulation which is cited again on page 3 of my brief. 
    Officer Baker first went and put a property tag on the steering wheel. 
    He then proceeded into the car. 
    He searched the glove compartment, the rear of the car and he also testified that he looked behind the sun visor. 
    He found nothing to remove from the car. 
    He got out of the car, walked around to the passenger side. 
    He opened up the right front door to roll up the window to protect it from the rain. 
    At this point, lying on the door well with the automobile was a registration card belonging to the victim of the robbery that occurred the night before.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How is the door well or the window that he (Inaudible)?
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="374.037" stopTime="374.832">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    I beg your pardon.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="374.832" stopTime="378.539">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is that the door well or the window that the officer closed?
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="378.539" stopTime="518.470">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    Yes, it was. 
    It was the right door well on the right front door. 
    After the officer discovered the registration card, he left the door opened. 
    He left the registration card lying in the well. 
    He went into the precinct and brought the petitioner back and confronted him with the evidence which he found. 
    He then took the evidence, turned it over to the police property clerk. 
    The next day he went down to the Court and obtained a search warrant directed to the police property clerk to seize the registration card which he had found the day before. 
    Officer Baker testified that the sole purpose of the search was to find and protect property which may have been in the car pursuant to the police regulation which was in effect at that time. 
    On a motion to suppress this evidence, it was denied. 
    However the District Court found that the police officer had more than one thing in mind when he went out to look at this car. 
    At page 118 of the record, the district judge stated that not only did he go out to protect the automobile from the elements or to remove property, but in fact he did conduct a search of that automobile for that he eventually opened up the trunk of the car which was locked. 
    The Fourth Amendment to the constitution has laid down procedures to be followed where police officers want to search areas protected by the Fourth Amendment. 
    Most recently, this doctrine was reaffirmed in Katz versus the United States in which the Court said that searches conducted outside the judicial process without prior approval by judge of magistrate are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, subject only to a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if a -- would you be making the same argument if the police property clerk could have the duty of examining automobiles that have been impounded legally and had gone and searched the car in a routine search or to pick up -- to inventory personal property and to put it in the lock box or in a check room or something and had discovered the same statement and had to call somebody's attention to him.

    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    I would say this, Your Honor, that the police have administrative problem.

    That is perfectly proper.

    And so the thing the police ought to do.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you -- would you think that though that the rule of admissibility is -- had been admissibility is certainly based on unreasonable search and a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="615.374" stopTime="616.452">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="616.452" stopTime="646.531">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if the officers -- if it's quite proper and legal for the police to make a -- examine a car and -- with the purpose of safe keeping articles at that point, you wouldn't say there's any violation of anybody's rights. 
    This isn't a Fifth Amendment problem or anything like that. 
    This is a question of inadmissibility of evidence to enforce some subsidy violation of the constitution.
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="646.531" stopTime="647.370">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    In answer to that Mr. Justice --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, tell me what the unreasonable police conduct is if it has been the administrative -- if it would've been the property clerk making a routine check of the articles?
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="659.525" stopTime="671.543">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    First, it doesn't fall with any of the -- within any of the exceptions as announced by this Court previously. 
    That is the two exceptions announced in Preston nor the forfeiture statute that was a -- in proof.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="671.543" stopTime="678.645">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but you've just told Mr. Justice Brennan and that's perfectly all right for the police to make these examinations.
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="678.645" stopTime="701.795">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    I'm going to answer your question this way. 
    The intent of the police department in protecting the property is not determinative whether or not there's a violation of the Fourth Amend -- or a persons Fourth Amendment's rights. 
    The motive or intent maybe perfectly alright but they're encroaching on an area protected by the Fourth Amendment when they go into the petitioner's automobile --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="701.795" stopTime="712.571">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you say there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment at the time the property clerk inventories these evidence and picks it up and puts it in a box in -- for safekeeping.
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="712.571" stopTime="716.080">

    There is no indication that he was ever asked whether or not the officer could inventory the car.

    And if the search was not unlawful, what is the justification for excluding the evidence? 
    That is to say here we have a situation in which neither the general search, the entry into the automobile was unlawful nor was the particular action. 
    I take it, your submission is the -- that particular action of opening the door was not unlawful and then in plain view there was this registration card.

    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="874.030" stopTime="905.263">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, perhaps I misunderstood you. 
    I thought a moment ago you said that there was -- you agree that the examine -- what the policeman did with respect to the car that is to say putting the tag on the steering wheel, examining it to remove personal property which might get lost or to be stolen, opening the doors with the purpose of running up -- and want to protect the car against the rain. 
    I thought you agreed that all of that was lawful.
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="905.263" stopTime="916.274">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    I did admit that that conduct was lawful because of the administrative problem that the police have. 
    I think they have a right to protect themselves against a lawsuit --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="916.274" stopTime="916.705">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Right.
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="916.705" stopTime="919.486">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    -- for stole -- for articles being stolen or for negligence.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="919.486" stopTime="957.092">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Right. 
    Now my question to you that if you assume that all of that was lawful, that is to say, the entry into the automobile, the opening of the door to turn up the windows, then on -- how do you -- how can we get from there to the proposition that the Fourth Amendment will not permit the use of the -- this card that was obtained in the course of what you agree was an unlawful activity.
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="957.092" stopTime="972.205">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    That is correct. 
    I'll get to it this way. 
    The search being conducted by the Metropolitan Police Department is one in administrative search which was struck down by camera and see. 
    Second, it gets around the particularity --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="972.205" stopTime="977.838">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    How can you say that when you say that this was lawful activity where the car is (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="977.838" stopTime="1022.461">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    Well, it strikes it down in this respect that he can't use the administrative search without a warrant to secure evidence. 
    And this is what we're getting at. 
    The administrative search here was not designed only to protect the -- it wasn't limited only to the protection of the valuables or the petitioner's automobile, but it also allowed then to seize any evidence which they may have found in the automobile -- in the car. 
    You have a general and exploratory search without particularly describing the things to be seized in the vehicle at the time that they seized it. 
    So, it violates the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment when they seized the incriminating evidence pursuant to this general search.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1022.461" stopTime="1055.926">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You mean that the fact that the policeman found something that was evidentiary. 
    So it relates back and invalidates what you would otherwise have said, it was a lawful entry into the automobile, is that your position? 
    I mean, I don't -- it seem to be you're saying both that the search was a -- so-called a search, the entry into the automobile or it seems to me you're saying that is both lawful and unlawful.
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="1055.926" stopTime="1175.051">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    Well, I am saying that Your Honor, I am saying that it was lawful on one side and unlawful for the reason that he seized the evidence. 
    That is -- there is the -- the problem here is that they have to inventory these cars and yet I'm asking this Court that were there searching or inventorying a car pursuant to that police regulation and they find incriminating evidence, they should be restricted. 
    They should not be allowed to use this incriminating evidence although they should be allowed to remove the valuables from the car. 
    Applying the exceptions in Preston versus United States that is that the police have a right to search incident to a lawful arrest and contemporaneous thereto, the facts in this case certainly don't justify a search of this vehicle an hour and a half later and at the police station, five or six miles away. 
    There were no exigent circumstances existing at the time that police officer conducted the inventory search at the police precinct. 
    And the third exception is announced in Cooper versus California where in the state legislature had passed the statute forfeiting the automobile to the state in certain types of crimes. 
    There is no such statute in the District of Columbia, therefore the search pursuant to -- that statute would not be lawful in this instance. 
    The administrative search in my opinion is also violated from the Fourth Amendment because it was a part of a general practice of making general searches of all automobiles that came into police custody. 
    If this general --

    How do you draw a distinction between the administrative search and other kinds of searches?
speaker="paul_h_weinstein" startTime="1179.988" stopTime="1205.842">
    Mr. Paul H. Weinstein 
    The administrative search Mr. Justice Black is a regulation promulgated here by the Metropolitan Police Department. 
    They were or able to promulgate regulations directing the police officers without either legislative authority or judicial authority to do certain things which they may not otherwise have been able to do.

    That is I understand your submission here you agree that what they -- you know, make you any such point you agree that this was a proper activity for custodial purposes.

    Well, I suppose a search warrant, if it was really a search warrant issued on probable cause to search a car might authorize the officers to search parts of the car that no custodial purpose would ever permit them to search.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I think that before we get to any Fourth Amendment questions in this case, the first thing to do is to figure out whether are any are presented. 
    And we submit that under the circumstances here and as found by both of the courts below, the evidence that was sought to be suppressed was not obtained as a result of a search at all. 
    We have in this case concurrent findings of fact by two lower courts in this regard. 
    We have 10 judges that have looked at this question. 
    Eight of them have concluded that this card was found incident not to a search but incident to the officer seeking to roll up the windows to prevent the car from being damage by the rain.

    I understand that but I mean to say what is the objective factual difference? 
    Why do you say this was not a search or you can say and I understand your point that -- to be that the Fourth Amendment does not -- that Fourth Amendment was not violated by this particular search, and why wasn't it a search? 
    Don't you have a search every time you open the door and see what's -- what your eyes behold?

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    It gets to the matter of a terminology. 
    This Court had recognized in a number of cases what has come to be called an open viewer, full view doctrine. 
    The district judge here found that the situation was quite analogous to that but for the fact that the door had to be opened before this car was in full view.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2015.610" stopTime="2093.170">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Weinstein has put to us very squarely and fairly the following preposition as I understand it that where in the course of an administrative search for proper reasons, a custodial search, something is found which has an evidentiary or incriminating effect can that later be used, that crime against the defendant. 
    Now that's the proposition here. 
    And so -- and that's the question with which I suggest we have to struggle in this case because as far I'm concern, the search is a search. 
    Then you have a next question as to whether it does or does not violate the Fourth Amendment. 
    And then the further question is to whether something transpires or something is done by the police, and of course of it that may violate that may result in exclusion on the Fourth Amendment grounds.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="2093.170" stopTime="2136.214">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, it seems to me to say a search is a search requires one to reject the findings that were made by both the courts below. 
    That maybe right. 
    And a proper way to proceed what it seems to me that the first question is much like the one posed by Mr. Justice Harlan. 
    If all that had going on here was that the officer went out to close the window and there had been no other -- then no regulation relating to an inventory search, no other circumstances that showed some kind of searching activity was engaged in. 
    Then would that be a search, I'm not sure that it --

    That it may or may not be a violation of the Fourth Amendment but it's a search right there which sets in motion a legal inquiry.

    And it seems to us then the question its posed is whether -- assuming that there was a search and rejecting the findings below that there wasn't. 
    The search was reasonable. 
    Now, as I take a petitioner concedes that the -- it's a reasonable thing for the police to conduct searches for the purpose of safeguarding property which is found in impounded cars. 
    And he says that here the impounding was proper. 
    What he says --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The Fourth Amendment is written in terms of making the three different things unconstitutional, at least three different things, an unreasonable search, unreasonable seizure, and of things and on the reasonable seizure of persons. 
    So that even Mr. Weinstein's argument it occurs to me might parse down into the proposition that violates may not have been an unreasonable search. 
    Nonetheless, it may still have been an unreasonable seizure. 
    And for that reason was an admissible in evidence.

    Justification for this was it -- was the administrative search of the car to be sure that no property was going to be lost or stolen and to roll up the windows of the car to be sure that there it -- it wouldn't rain in the upholstery. 
    And if that was the only justification for it, shouldn't the Government be confined to doing only that rather than finding evidence in there to use against this man at his trial.

    Well, of course here the officer did what -- it seems to be conceded the police can do in a sense they looked in the car or maybe administrative purposes. 
    And they found the card and they didn't -- they then gave it to the property clerk which is where personal property found on the car should go. 
    Then they got a search warrant. 
    They got a -- they went to a judge and said, "We have a probable cause to seize this card", and they get the warrant and seized it.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Because in the context to none of this Court's decisions talking about automobile searches and seizures, the Cooper case which is the last authority on the point, speaks in terms of the relationship of the search to the crime for which the person was suspected here. 
    The only thing that the individual is suspected of is leaving his car in the wrong place.

    In light of Cooper, I think that the efforts have been made by courts subsequent to Cooper to put them together.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I think the situation here is distinguishable from Preston. 
    As the Court pointed out in Cooper there was no connection in the Preston situation between the crime for which the people were arrested and in the automobile. 
    Whereas in Cooper, the automobile was -- it was conceded as it is here was lawfully impounded because it had been used to transport the narcotics there.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    That element was in the Cooper Case but the Cooper opinion itself said that the forfeiture cannot resolve until a conviction have been obtained. 
    And the dissenting opinion there pointed out that it was difficult to understand how the fact that a forfeiture may result in the future to justify a different kind of activity and approaches to the car during the time it was held. 
    When it was held, it's still was the car of the owner until the forfeiture had occurred. 
    The forfeiture couldn't occur until the individual have been found guilty. 
    We think that on the facts here the situation is a much closer one than a -- to Cooper than it is to Preston.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well in Preston as you pointed out in Cooper, the major effort was to justify the search on the ground it was incidental to an arrest.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    As I was saying, we view the situation presented here assuming again we've reached the question of a search and a reasonableness of a search under the facts as one that it is closer to Cooper than to Preston. 
    Here as the Court pointed out in Cooper, the reason for in the nature of police custody of an automobile may constitutionally justify a search as a reasonable one. 
    And also as the Court pointed out in Cooper, the crime for which the individual is arrested is relevant. 
    And in Cooper the search was one that was closely related to the reason for the arrest, the reason the car was impounded etcetera.

    Mr. Beytagh, I think the -- and there's another possibility, first, I'd tell you, what you're saying now is that the custody, police custody of the automobile here should be assimilated to the impoundment situation in Cooper.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    By now this -- alright, I think I understand your position on that but there's still another approach here, isn't there? 
    Which is that, assuming that the police had custody of the car lawfully as Mr. Weinstein seems to concede, the -- what they did, their search of the car, their entry into the car was lawful in the exercise of their custodial responsibilities, is that a separate and distinct approach to the analysis of the problem from your point of view?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="3362.680" stopTime="3372.004">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I don't think it's separate and distinct. 
    I think that it -- that again is a factor as Mr. Justice Black was pointing out that relates to the overall reasonableness.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3372.004" stopTime="3393.223">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, if you assume though that Cooper placed special emphasis upon the forfeiture aspect, the second analysis that I have suggested here would get away from what maybe the difficulty of analogizing this situation to a forfeiture situation.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="3393.223" stopTime="3474.987">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Right, I agree with you. 
    Several things that I would like to point out here, the regulation does draw a distinction between the entry of locked areas of automobiles. 
    And says that when a glove compartment or a trunk is locked and it appears that the car won't be held for a significant period of time, there's no need to enter those parts. 
    It also says that where they are locked and there is a need to enter them they should not be broken but the officer should go to the property clerk and seek instructions. 
    I take it that the basic purpose of this is to avoid insofar as possible unnecessary disruption of individual's automobile. 
    Finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about the -- our views on automobile search is generally. 
    We're -- of course, the country that has made the automobile, the thing that everybody has. 
    We have millions of them on our highways. 
    And as it's been pointed out, large numbers of them are impounded. 
    Indeed I should point out that in 1966 over 14,000 cars were impounded in the District of Columbia.

    Most of those are returned as soon as the --

    Yes.

speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="3489.390" stopTime="3594.626">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    And get them. 
    There is a significant problem not only in the District of Columbia but in all urban areas with automobiles. 
    And there are problems with safeguarding that the property that exists there. 
    Furthermore, we don't think that it's an unnecessary thing to analogize automobiles to homes or houses in all respects with respect to the applicability of the Fourth Amendment. 
    Even in the Preston case, the Court pointed out that the Fourth Amendment has never been applied and precisely the same way as to automobiles as it has to homes. 
    If the basic thrust of it was to maintain privacy in the house, every man's castle that sort of approach. 
    It seems to us that these considerations are irrelevant in assessing the overall reasonableness of a search of an automobile. 
    An automobile is an effect. 
    And the Fourth Amendment talks in terms of effects. 
    And it's also a container. 
    Now, the Government below argued what the -- has been termed instrumentality theory that once you can seize the instruments, you can seize and search all of the contents. 
    It seems to us that it's not necessary to go that far in the abstract here because we do have this inventory search procedure that's more related to the particular facts here. 
    But I should point out that a lot of effects or containers as well; briefcases are, suitcases are, handbags are, wallets are. 
    Now, as to most of these items, it has never been thought that --

    And envelopes?

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    That's right. 
    I don't think it's been thought that because such items are -- have a capacity of containing things that when you take them lawfully into custody or seize them or whatever, the term might be in the circumstances that you can't thereupon do with them what is proper and reasonable under the circumstances. 
    Cars are different, they're bigger. 
    We understand that and we appreciate that. 
    We also point out that cars are not homes and that the basic thrust and or the office is and the basic thrust of most to the Court's Fourth Amendment decisions have related to the protection of the privacy in those circumstances.

    Let's say I understand you. 
    Do you mean that if the police lawfully enter a house let's say with permission and they see a sealed envelope lying on the table or a package in brown paper with a plan around it. 
    That they may then proceed to open the envelop or to open the package without more?

    But what if your -- what if somebody starts to ask him questions just as a witness here, just to investigate him, asks him some questions to see a brown paper sack on the table. 
    And you asked him what's in it, and he says, “It's none of your business”. 
    And so you go over and tear open the sack and you find two guns in it. 
    You had no -- and it's admitted you had no probable cause to believe no -- that there wasn't anything in the sack for that matter. 
    You hadn't intended to arrest him or anything else when you went there. 
    I don't suppose you could do any -- do that and even more, you can go look in the closet, would you?

    I suppose your answer about the envelope is that you're not saying unless there should be a per se rule that an envelope could never be opened even though there had been number of things stolen, they were looking for stolen (Inaudible), you're not going to say its -- never be -- not be a rule that should never opened or that it can be opened.
