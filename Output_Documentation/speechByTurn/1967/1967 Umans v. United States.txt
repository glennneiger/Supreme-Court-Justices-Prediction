Umans v. United States

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 41, Sam Umans, petitioner, versus United States. 
    Mr. Brodsky.
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="9.543" stopTime="266.287">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    If the Court please. 
    Petitioner is a Certified Public Accountant who was convicted in the court below of giving money to Internal Revenue Service agents. 
    He was named in 24 counts of an indictment for 12 separate transactions with respect to each transaction there were two separate counts in the indictment. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed three of the counts of the indictments so there were 21 counts remaining. 
    The evidence very briefly consisted of testimony from seven Internal Revenue Service agents who testified generally that they received money from the petitioner in connection with their audit of various tax returns. 
    The amount of money that they received varied from a low of $25.00 according to them to a high of $75.00 most of the payments were $50.00. 
    With that very brief statement of the facts, because we’re not complaining that the evidence in the trial court was insufficient, I will go immediately to my first point which is that the evidence before the grand jury in this case was insufficient to support the indictment. 
    Now the entire evidence before the grand jury in this case consisted according to the government’s characterization of an Internal Revenue Service agent’s brief summary of portions of affidavits relating to the alleged illegal payments made by petitioner. 
    The man who testified before the grand jury, I don’t know who he was, but from the record in this case he could not have had any personal knowledge about more than just a few of these affidavits. 
    In other words, the government puts a man before the grand jury who has no personal knowledge of most, if not all, of these pieces of paper that he’s summarizing, and then he briefly summarizes this hearsay, and that is the entire testimony to support this indictment. 
    Now the grand jury testimony itself is not a part of the record. 
    I know what it was because the government stated what it was in its brief in the Court of Appeals and the Solicitor General agrees that this is what the grand jury testimony was. 
    Now, I am arguing here that that evidence was insufficient on alternative grounds, either under petitioner’s Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury, I think that right includes some kind of substance behind the grand jury indictment, or if this case does not reach constitutional dimensions then I would ask this Court under its rule making power to so hold. 
    Now it seems to me that I have two hurdles to overcome in this Court. 
    First, I must convince the Court that there should be some kind of a standard of evidence in these grand jury situations, a standard of evidence which is enforceable by this Court and by other courts. 
    Second, once I get beyond that hurdle, the question becomes what should that standard of evidence be. 
    Addressing myself to the first question, I think that the analysis can be made in this way. 
    Surely, I would think that everyone would agree that if an indictment is based upon no evidence, if for an example the prosecutor walks into the grand jury and says “Ladies and gentlemen, John Doe committed a crime, return an indictment.” 
    And it does inconceivably it could. 
    I think that all would agree that such an indictment would not be supported by this or any other court.

    That the cases have held that that is a matter entirely for the grand jury as to on what bases they’re going to bring in on that.
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="290.709" stopTime="295.824">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    I think the Costello case in this Court certainly says that. 
    There is no question about that.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="295.824" stopTime="303.055">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But there are some decisions by various Courts of Appeals that would sustain what you have just said.
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="303.055" stopTime="304.250">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    Before Costello, Your Honor?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="304.250" stopTime="305.019">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Before Costello.
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="305.019" stopTime="406.607">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    There’s no decision after Costello which would sustain what I said. 
    And I think to be perfectly frank that what I’m asking this Court to do is not to overrule Costello because I think this case is far distinguishable from Costello, but at least to change some of the broad sweeping language in Costello. 
    Costello says that if an indictment is valid on its face, and if it was returned by a legally constituted grand jury that’s enough. 
    And I’m saying that that is not enough under many circumstances and particularly under the circumstances of this case. 
    And I think that what’s happened since Costello, I cite a number of cases in my brief where this has happened, is that prosecutors had been reading Costello in its broadest sense and have been returning indictments based upon less and less evidence. 
    And I think that, and I charge in my brief, that one of the reasons that they’re doing this is because when they don’t put a person with personal knowledge before the grand jury then they don’t create another record by a person who is going to testify a trial, a record which would have to be turned over to defense counsel. 
    So that prosecutors are motivated to get further and further away from presenting to grand juries any evidence which is based upon personal knowledge. 
    And the further away from that which you get, the closer you get to a situation of no evidence at all, and I think --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="406.607" stopTime="415.597">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But some of these people, whose affidavits were rather summarized to the grand jury testified here at trial, did they not?

    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    All of them did Your Honor.

    All of them?
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="417.158" stopTime="417.460">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    Yes sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="417.460" stopTime="420.304">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And you did obtain their affidavits, did you not?
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="420.304" stopTime="434.470">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    We obtained portions of their affidavits and the Solicitor General says and I have no reason to dispute it that the affidavits which they gave us at trial are the very same affidavits which were summarized before the grand jury, yes Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="434.470" stopTime="447.488">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So that in that sense and to that extent you could obtain something that is substitute for the testimony of these persons before the grand jury.
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="447.488" stopTime="473.954">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    We did indeed. 
    We would’ve obtained that Your Honor under the Jencks Act in any event. 
    I think what the government avoids here if they would’ve had these same witnesses testify before this grand jury, we would’ve had not only their Jencks Act statements, these affidavits that were summarized, but in addition their grand jury testimony which might have been inconsistent with their Jencks Act statements. 
    I’d like to pursue that for a minute.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="473.954" stopTime="480.900">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Was there any reason to think that these affidavits were not prepared specifically for the grand jury?
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="480.900" stopTime="482.643">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    I have no evidence one way or the other on that.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="482.643" stopTime="494.656">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So it is possible that the affidavits might not have existed if these persons have testified personally before the grand jury?
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="494.656" stopTime="640.100">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    I doubt that for this reason. 
    These very same persons testified before a previous grand jury in this case and six out of seven of them, when they were asked in substance to name the persons from whom they received money, failed to mention petitioner’s name. 
    They did, when the prosecutor said “Are there other people from whom you have taken money whose names you don’t remember?” 
    They said “Yes.” 
    But when they were asked this specific question “Tell me the names of those persons from whom you received money,” six out of seven failed to mention petitioner’s name. 
    Now when they come to get an indictment against petitioner, instead of using the same grand jury which knew about these prior, what I would call inconsistent statements, they go to a new grand jury and they don’t tell the new grand jury that these people have previously testified and failed to mention petitioner’s name. 
    They merely have an agent who is isolated, from firsthand testimony, summarize these affidavits. 
    And I think that’s very far away from any kind of substantive evidence. 
    I should say also that the scope of this problem is indicated by a letter which is annexed to the government’s brief, a letter from the United States attorney for the southern district of New York to the Solicitor General, where the United States attorney says, in answer to my charge that in most cases, indictments are being returned on less and less evidence, he says himself that his policy has been up until this very case in the, and this is his language, in the so called cut and dried cases to have an agent summarize his interviews or his investigations of the case, mostly his interviews in the cases the way the United States attorney puts it. 
    So that we have a situation where the United States attorneys throughout the country, unless the law is changed, unless this Court says something about it to make a change, the United States attorneys in this country have the discretion now to present second or third or fifth or sixth hand evidence to grand juries.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="640.100" stopTime="648.807">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Do you have any knowledge Mr. Brodsky whether this is a policy of the Department of Justice or is this something developed by the United States attorneys in their respect --
speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="648.807" stopTime="788.200">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    I have no knowledge on that one way or another Your Honor. 
    The only information is a letter from the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
    The Department of Justice does not say in this record any place what their policy is throughout country. 
    Now assuming for a moment that, and I might say this before I get to the next point, that if the kind of evidence in this case is upheld by this Court and this indictment is sustained, then this is an effect a notification to the United States attorneys across the country that this kind of flimsy evidence at least will be sustained and there’s no reason, there’s no motivation on their part to present any stronger evidence, and as far as the grand jury is concerned as a practical matter, when a prosecutor says to the grand jury after summarizing affidavits, well if the grand jury does say “Shouldn’t we have something more?” 
    When he says to the grand jury “Well you know the Supreme Court of the United States has sustained this procedure,” that I believe would be sufficient for most grand jurors not to probe any further. 
    Now assuming for a moment that I’m over the first hurdle and that or might that there should be some kind of a standard that I get to the next question which is what should that standard be. 
    And I’m arguing that at least for purposes of this case, the standard of evidence before the grand jury should at the very least be the same standard of evidence as one needs to get a search warrant or an arrest warrant. 
    It seems to me to be anomalous that you can indict a person on something less than you can arrest a person on. 
    After all the consequences of an indictment, the humiliation to say nothing of the expense of going through a complicated or even a non-complicated trial. 
    A much more severe when a person is indicted then when he’s arrested yet as this very case shows a person can be indicted on substantially less evidence than a person can be arrested. 
    I would like to --

    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    I try to address myself to that question in the brief and I ask this Court to look out for reference to what’s done in the State of New York. 
    Now in the State of New York the constitutional language is almost identical to the federal constitution on this point and my interpretation in that state and by statute only legal evidence, what they call legal evidence can be introduced before the grand jury and they go this far, and I’m not arguing that this is necessary for purposes of this case, in New York they say that you must make out a prima facie case as you would at trial before the grand jury. 
    Now addressing myself to that question, don’t you need a hearing in every case, the answer in New York has been no. 
    A person must first establish some kind of a showing that there may indeed be insufficient evidence before the grand jury. 
    You don’t automatically get a hearing just because you ask for it. 
    It might be similar to an illegal search question where the question is “Was there an illegal trespass by federal agents?” 
    A person must first make a showing of some kind of evidence that there was indeed an illegal trespass before he’s entitled to a hearing.

speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="1364.952" stopTime="1637.123">
    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    They have indeed, during the pro tanto. 
    I would like to get to my Jencks Act point in the time remaining. 
    After the direct testimony of the witnesses, they were, counsel asked the government to produce all of the statements of the witnesses which came within the Jencks statute. 
    Now there are a large number of statements which were not furnished to us, which were sealed in the court below, sent up to the Court of Appeals and I understand that they are still sealed and now they are lodged with this Court. 
    Now the Court of Appeals and the government in its brief in the Court of Appeals tells us that these statements are statements by these witnesses who testified at trial in which they admit the receipt of money from other people, not from petitioner, and therefore the government has said that does not relate to their direct testimony since they didn’t testify about other people on direct testimony and that therefore the statements do not fall within the Jencks statute. 
    I want to put the Jencks Act in what I think it’s it proper context before I argue how these statements do indeed relate to the direct testimony. I’d like to talk about the Jencks Act in terms of the Rosenberg case in this Court in which this Court said that Jencks should be interpreted in the light of its purpose which is to provide defense counsel with material which might be useful for impeachment purposes. 
    So trying to answer that question, was this material useful for impeachment purposes, of course I haven’t seen it, but knowing what it is from the statement in the -- by the Court of Appeals, I think that it was indeed valuable for impeachment purposes in this way. 
    The witnesses apparently gave a lot of affidavits to the government in which they fail to mention petitioner’s name. 
    Now I think that it would have been extremely useful for us at trial to be able to show that, for example, on January 1, on January 15, on January 20, and that’s the way it is in this case. 
    I’m referring to dates with respect to one of the particular witnesses, on each of those dates, the witness filled out an affidavit in which he purported to name, the names of those people from whom he received money and he failed to mention petitioner’s name on each of those dates. 
    And it wasn’t until for example April 17 in the particular case that I’m talking about, that he first mentioned petitioner’s name. 
    Now I think that would’ve been extremely useful for cross examination purposes and we were denied that in the court below. 
    In addition, I think that there was another value for impeachment purposes here and that is this. 
    In the statements, the witnesses admitted taking money from other people. 
    They admitted in effect crimes involving moral turpitude, and I think that on cross-examination, it would’ve been useful and valuable for impeachment purposes to be able to show each specific crime that these witnesses admitted in the affidavits which were denied to us. 
    Now the government claims with regard to this point that we did on cross-examination asked these witnesses whether or not they received money from other people aside from petitioner, and indeed we did. 
    But the record shows that in answer to our questions on cross-examination, the witnesses were somewhat vague. 
    They said “Well, yes I took money, but I don’t remember how many people that I took money from or the years or the amounts” and yet when they were filling out these affidavits in the privacy of their rooms with the government officials, they were quite precise I am sure these affidavits will show. 
    They were quite precise in saying “On July 5, 1965, I took $25.00 from John Doe” and I think that these statements would’ve been extremely useful for impeachment purposes.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It would seem to me, just as a matter practical trial strategy that the answers you got were more useful to you, if they couldn’t remember from whom and when and how much they took the money from.

    Mr. Edward Brodsky 
    I don’t think so Your Honor because as a matter of trial strategy, what we might have been able to argue to the jury was that these people were actually memorizing what they said in this case. 
    And indeed filling out precise affidavits and only by minimizing these affidavits could they remember what their actual testimony was. 
    They really couldn’t remember it unless they were sitting down with government agents and writing with government agents precisely what they were recreating happened in this case.

   Argument of Sidney M. Glazer
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1706.359" stopTime="1711.293">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Glazer.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="1711.293" stopTime="2003.031">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    May it please the Court. 
    First, before turning to the argument of the two principle issues raised in this case, I want to point out one fact omitted by the petitioner and pulling out all of the circumstances under which the two main issues in this case developed. 
    The seven Internal Revenue employees involved who are witnesses in the case, six were indicted along with petitioner and the seventh was indicted in a separate indictment. 
    So these seven witnesses were in a sense different than the normal witness you have in a normal situation, in a normal case. 
    Now, what happened is, they -- each of these witnesses testified on direct examination that they accepted bribes from petitioner. 
    Their direct examination was only concerned with their transactions with petitioner. 
    They didn’t, in their direct examination -- they didn’t go into any other bribes with any other accountants. 
    After the direct examine -- after the first witness testified on direct examination, petitioner made a blank at the man for all statements made by the witness. 
    After this blank at the man, the government turned over statements, affidavits of the witnesses and some of the affidavits were turned over directly to defense counsel. 
    Other affidavits, the government told the court that had matters in them which did not relate to the direct examination. 
    So the court examined those affidavits in-camera, and as result of its examination what was actually turned over the government, the government had prepared it in advance were affidavits with certain portions excised -- would have -- with certain portions of it with material excised from it. 
    And what wasn’t turned over were statements concerning the petitioner’s transactions with other accountants. 
    Now each of the -- included in the material turned over were grand jury testimony of these witnesses. 
    These witnesses, each of these witnesses had testified before a previous grand jury. 
    This was in the initial stage of investigation which involved widespread corruption in the New York Internal Revenue office and at this previous, in the initial stage before this first grand jury, only one of the witnesses had named petitioner as a person who had paid him bribes. 
    The testimony before the previous grand jury however somewhat the -- the previous grand jury didn’t try to develop all the names of all of the accountants who had received bribes from petitioner. 
    Now, at the conclusion of the case, defendant -- as each witness testified, found out that none of these witnesses had testified before the grand jury which had indicted petitioner. 
    At the conclusion of the case, he moved the court to dismiss the indictment on the ground that none of the witnesses had testified before the grand jury and asked the court to examine the grand jury testimony. 
    At this point the court overruled his motion to dismiss and refused to examine the grand jury testimony. 
    As I read the record, at no time did petitioner ask to have this grand jury testimony. 
    The grand jury testimony involved in this case turned over to him. 
    Now his first contention is that Costello versus United States should either be reexamined or overruled. 
    We see nothing in this case to warrant the reexamination or overruling Costello.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    MWhat is the practice in this respect? 
    Is there any general departmental policy or instructions with respect to the use of live witnesses before a grand jury?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2015.822" stopTime="2064.616">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    No Your Honor, as far as I know the practice varies with the individual U.S. attorney. 
    Now of course now in the Second Circuit as a result of this case and as a result of another case, it’ll be prudent for the U.S. attorney – any U.S. attorney in the Second Circuit to offer firsthand testimony of the witnesses because in this case the court said unless there are some unusual reasons whenever possible, firsthand witnesses should be used before the grand jury, So as far as the practice which will be followed in the Second Circuit any prudent prosecutor will offer some firsthand testimony unless he has some reason not to.

    No, as far as I know there’s no Justice Department policy. 
    It all depends on the individual U.S. attorney. 
    What I did say was that as a result of the decision in this case that the U.S. attorney in New York is adopting a policy which the opinion says that wherever possible firsthand -- witnesses with firsthand information should be used before the grand jury. 
    I said its prudent being in the Second Circuit for him to do it --

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    From the U.S. attorney’s letter of the Second Circuit, I would assume that it was common for -- to put on an agent and not offer firsthand information in cases which originated through the investigation agencies.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    I have no idea, no. 
    Now one suggestion which we have made, it’s in a footnote in our brief, if a particular district judge is dissatisfied with the quality of test -- of evidence being presented before the grand jury. 
    We suggest a simple solution and that’s on empaneling a grand jury the district judge can instruct the grand jury as to the quality of evidence. 
    And so instead of waiting until after the grand jury has heard the case and adopting a drastic remedy dismissing indictments, it seems you can adopt as prophylactic measure and that solves the problem. 
    I mean if the particular district is using what the judge can --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2299.385" stopTime="2307.802">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well may I suggest I should think a more practical way would be for the Department of Justice to announce a policy in this regard and bind the U.S. attorneys too.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2307.802" stopTime="2312.386">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    I think that also be a solution to the problem. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2312.386" stopTime="2316.489">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think that he could do that if the law provides otherwise?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2316.489" stopTime="2417.029">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well we certainly couldn’t bind the grand jury. 
    In other words, if the grand jury wanted to return an indictment on its own, on the basis of other evidence the U.S. attorney couldn’t bind the grand jury. 
    The grand jury after all is an independent body. 
    And traditionally it has been considered to be the protection a defendant has against arbitrary indictment. 
    Instead of having an elected official, the constitution has provided for these lay people to hear the case unhampered by technical rules. 
    My suggestion when I was -- if district judges do not like or the judges in the Court of Appeals prefer better testimony before the grand jury, certainly the department would on its own, would try to offer firsthand testimony and suggest it to the grand jury. 
    But the grand jury, we submit, has the power to act on hearsay evidence. 
    After all its function is only to determine the probable cause and the probable cause -- you take a situation like this particular case. 
    In this particular case you have six people who are indicted as co-defendants. 
    Now, it so happened that they were cooperating with the government, but if they hadn’t been cooperating with the government or the government wasn’t sure of the cooperation, it seems to me that it’d be adequate --

    But you’re never really sure, are you?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2418.964" stopTime="2452.228">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    No, because they sometimes change their mind. 
    It seems to me to be adequate for the government to present the affidavits of the six people, indicating that they had committed a crime. 
    This is certainly reliable information. 
    After all a -- people don’t ordinarily put their -- subject themselves to punishment or to loss of jobs by admitting they have committed an offense. 
    And so the grand jury as far as we’re concerned had very reliable evidence and they had sufficient evidence to determine probable cause.

    Suppose if he agrees that legal and constitution to a grand jury to proceed on the basis if they ever and the Court of Appeals judge decides he doesn’t like this. 
    I understood you they hadn’t made to the Court of Appeals judge or district judge but in some way bar the grand jury from proceeding on that basis.

    All I’m suggesting is if the Court of Appeals like the Second Circuit is done in this case has said that where practical the U.S. attorney should offer the grand jury first hand evidence. 
    I say it’s prudent for the U.S. attorney to do this because if you’re going to -- why get yourself involved in a situation where you have a trial long involved lawsuit, and at the very tail end, the Court of Appeals is going to say there’s something wrong with the grand jury procedure.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    I think the right may -- I think the suggestion may have come from a case, an earlier case which they had where there was a dispute between, in the Court of Appeals as to whether there had been a witness -- an agent who testified they had deceived the grand jury. 
    And in order -- and I think it was in response and that was in the Payton case and it was a two to one decision on the Second Circuit. 
    And now I think in this case – because this case followed that up, and I think what they wanted to do is avoid a situation where somebody could say the agent who’s testifying before the grand jury in that particular case, there was a dispute as to whether the agent testified before the grand jury indicated the grand jury had personal knowledge with certain fact when he didn’t. 
    And the court -- I think that was the response of the -- that’s what the Court of Appeals responded to it. 
    Well, I agree with you that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2668.649" stopTime="2679.033">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I was just asking the question because I hadn’t -- the thought hadn’t occurred to me that anybody would think of this judge to have that power.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2679.033" stopTime="3009.865">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Let me get to the second issue in this case. 
    The Jencks Act or Statute provides that after a witness testifies on direct examination, upon motion of the defendant, the government shall turn over all statements of the witness which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. 
    And if material doesn’t relate to the subject matter, the court shall examine the statement in-camera and shall excise the portion of the statements which do not relate to the subject matter of the testimony. 
    Now in this particular case, the court, the trial judge we believe did turn over the material which should have been turned over and the material which was not turned over was properly kept from the defendant. 
    Now the trial judge in determining what related in this to the subject matter upon which the witness has testified didn’t adopt any narrow rule. 
    He gave them -- the defense got the affidavits which concerned the activities to which witnesses testified on direct examination. 
    In addition, the defense obtained earlier grand jury testimony of the witnesses even though only one of the witnesses as mentioned petitioner, and even as to the statements. 
    Even statements which didn’t mention petitioner in two instances were turned over to petitioner and these statements mentioned acts of other accountants. 
    The full record and not just the printed appendix in this case shows the basis upon which the court -- initially the grand jury testimony of the third witness, a former employee named Diche (ph) was not turned over. 
    The court after reading the exhibit noticed a question in this grand jury’s act testimony which said “Did anybody else give you any money?” 
    And the witness at that time didn’t name Umans. 
    The court said “This material should be turned over.” 
    And what the court says “At least the defendant could argue that at that particular time in the grand jury, the witness either did not remember or could not remember or did not want to remember Umans’ name.” 
    So we have a situation where what the court was trying to do was, was trying to turn over -- is turning over any material which related to Umans while at the same time protecting from disclosure a material which related to other accountants individuals who hadn’t been -- who had been indicted and which were -- and who were awaiting trial. 
    Now the issue thus, is whether this peripheral matter has to be turned over. 
    We submit that this is an area in which the court has discretion. 
    In other words, the court has discretion at trial to cut off all examination as to other acts of bribery. 
    The court doesn’t have to allow a defense counsel to get into the -- to allow him to cross-examine upon -- and try to impeach a witness with other acts of misconduct not amounting to criminal conviction. 
    But here the court, the court did allow this -- did allow these witnesses to be examined concerning these other bribes, but what the court didn’t turn over and properly didn’t turn over was the particulars. 
    In other words, he didn’t turn over the defense's statements which said that on a particular day involving a particular tax return, the particular accountant who may have been awaiting trial on a separate indictment paid the agent a particular sum of money. 
    We don’t think that -- we think the Jencks Act -- this is a type of a material which the Jencks Act meant to keep confidential, especially since it involves what we say is needless disclosure of other people. 
    Petitioner’s cross-examination wasn’t hampered. 
    He was allowed to question each of the witnesses as to the various amounts of money they received from other people.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, if there’s absolutely no evidence, I would say that perhaps the indictment should be dismissed, but it seems to me if there’s some evidence and especially in a case -- and of course in this case, I think there’s clear evidence of probable cause. 
    I don’t think that requires an examination by the court. 
    But my problem with the no evidence situation is if the grand jury on its own would go ahead and indict and it was an unbiased grand jury and did it on the basis of its own knowledge, I would say it’s a valid indictment. 
    Where I have trouble is the situation where the U.S. attorney knowing, with knowledge of the law has some evidence, I think the U.S. attorney has a duty to come forward with some evidence and not just say indict so and so. 
    That’s why it’s a -- in connection with the no evidence case, I think that may not be -- that is basically a problem where I think the U.S. attorney has sort of overreached or perhaps deceived the grand jury. 
    I don’t think the U.S. attorney should do that. 
    I think the U.S. attorney should try to give some evidence to grand jury. 
    However, I think the grand jury on its own decides to indict somebody on its own knowledge, and I think it’s a valid indictment.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Just like the preliminary held in many of the states before you can arrest a man and hold them over to the grand jury --

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Correct, correct.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- hold them over to see if it’s probable cause --

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3830.872" stopTime="3843.335">

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    They have in some of the states to view, as I recall it, one or two hasn’t it?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3859.538" stopTime="3860.700">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Sure, that’s correct.
