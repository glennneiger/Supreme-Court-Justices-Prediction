Smith v. Illinois

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 158, Fleming Smith, Petitioner, versus Illinois. 
    Mr. Getty, I think you may proceed now.
speaker="gerald_w_getty" startTime="61.476" stopTime="467.601">
    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is the case of Fleming Smith that originated in Illinois and has taken on appeal from the Illinois Appellate Court. 
    The question involved here is the constitutional provision namely the Sixth Amendment and that part which states in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. 
    We are also concerned about the Fourteenth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The question as we see it presented for review is, should the informer's privilege be permitted to encroach upon the accused Sixth Amendment right to be confronted by witnesses against him. 
    The facts of this particular case are -- as the normal case in a narcotic case where an addict is induced or the addict tells a police where he can supposedly make a purchase and this particular addict was searched and then escorted by two policemen to a restaurant on the South Side of Chicago, and there, this person by the name of James Jordan, and we do find from the record that this is not his correct name, did enter the restaurant and it is alleged and he did testify that he made a purchase of narcotics from one Fleming Smith in that restaurant. 
    The two policemen are outside of the restaurant and certainly could not observed whether he did or did not make a purchase and they never testified to such things in the record. 
    The person, James Jordan, testified on the stand that he made the purchase from Fleming Smith. 
    But when he was cross-examined and asked whether his name was James Jordan, there was an objection and further it was elicited finally that his name was not James Jordan. 
    And when it was asked whether -- what his name was, there was an objection and his name was never disclosed. 
    At that point, though they had produced this witness on the issue of guilt, it was denied, denied the facts and the defendant to know the person that was accusing him. 
    They took -- attempted to elicit the address of James Jordan and there was an objection and that was never disclosed. 
    When Fleming Smith took the stand, he denied any of the pur -- of the sale of narcotics to James Jordan. 
    Fleming Smith admitted that he was an addict and when he was arrested, sometime after James Jordan left the restaurant on February 28th, 1964, he did have a packet of narcotics on him. 
    He also had four single dollar bill on him that had been marked money. 
    The police at the time that James Jordan or just prior thereto entered -- that James Jordan entered the restaurant, did give him six $1 bills that were marked and four quarters. 
    The purchase according to James Jordan was for $4 and 75 cents, a $5-bag. 
    The four quarters were never found on Fleming Smith. 
    Fleming Smith explains in the trial the reason and why he had the four $1 bill is that he had just prior thereto paid for a restaurant bill and received them in change. 
    So that Fleming Smith at all times denied the sale.He said that James Jordan did approach him, he said he had no narcotics for sale but referred him to one Herbert Simpson in the rear of this restaurant. 
    Now the state in their brief presents the question, does the constitution require that the true identity and present address of a governmental informant be disclosed on cross-examination? 
    And our answer to that is yes, when it is on the issue of guilt. 
    This is not the case of the type of informer that merely points the finger of suspicion that the police depend upon for information, that type of person gives information to the police and there is a flow of information and we realized that this is probably one of the great scientific detection apparatus that law enforcement does have, the informant.

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    There is some evidence that --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Page 78, he says he knew him and he represented him.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Yes, the counsel. 
    There was a statement that counsel did know but there was never a finding of fact that he knew him by any other name or what name he knew him by. 
    It might very well have been that he knew him by James Jordan, but at the same time when this man is testifying, he does state that this is not his right name, never a finding of fact that Mr. Pride who represented him knew who this man was by his correct name, never finding a fact.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="520.986" stopTime="527.828">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, Mr. Pride says that he had represented Jordan at one time, not merely knew him, but he had represented him as a lawyer.

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    Yes, he did represent him but never -- it might have been as James Jordan. 
    We have a right to assume that. 
    We know -- no, there is nothing in the record here that shows that he represented him by any other name.

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    Now it is our position that where there is an issue of guilt as distinguished from that type of informer that informs but never actually testifies against the defendant. 
    That type of informer that merely informs, merely gives information in order to keep this flow of information, in order to protect as the state always wants them protected, this informant under the case is we believe there -- they do not have to disclose their name and address or if you please their identity. 
    However we have a different problem where on a question of guilt and the man is produced, don't we have the right to know who this witness is that is presented against the defendant? 
    The right to know who our accusers are, and that is the issue because this person then becomes a material witness and we should not be prevented from having a full cross-examination, because to have a full cross-examination, we must know who we are cross-examining.

    Yes, he knew him quite well. 
    He also knew -- all the other times he testified.

    He knew the other person that this man had testified against.

    He knew --

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    No, I mean the lawyer knew that before this point.

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    I don't think so Your Honor.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="730.404" stopTime="735.081">

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    If there is -- there's a possibility that he did. 
    I never in this record was firmly convinced that Mr. Pride actually knew this man, knew his correct name. 
    I think Mr. Pride was astonished when he found out that his name wasn't James Jordan because we don't --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="758.672" stopTime="759.277">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, why didn't he asked --

    -- find him with the next name, “Isn't your name John Jones?”

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, no. 
    My point Mr. Getty is -- I'm not asserting -- you are that he was so surprised because he's the one who asked the question, that this is not your real name, is it? 
    I don't think he was too surprised.
speaker="gerald_w_getty" startTime="779.063" stopTime="783.719">
    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    Well, it was never a finding of fact that he knew him by any other name, that's --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="783.719" stopTime="784.146">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But there isn't --

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    And I --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="785.132" stopTime="787.700">

    He says, I knew him and I represent him.
speaker="gerald_w_getty" startTime="787.700" stopTime="788.472">
    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    I think the real issue --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="788.472" stopTime="797.193">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And I would assume from that that he knew the man, and he knew where he lived, and he knew something about him --
speaker="gerald_w_getty" startTime="797.193" stopTime="797.600">
    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    Well --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="797.600" stopTime="799.431">

    -- because he represents him.
speaker="gerald_w_getty" startTime="799.431" stopTime="817.151">
    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    I would say this that he probably knew something about him because there is evidence or indication here they represented him. 
    Whether he knew him by his right name, whether he knew where he actually lived, there's nothing in the record that would indicate that.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="817.151" stopTime="830.454">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Wouldn't you think the fact that counsel asked this, a rather an unusual question out of the blue, is that to some indication that he knew that the man was giving a name different from the one that he -- the lawyer knew was -- he had as his client?
speaker="gerald_w_getty" startTime="830.454" stopTime="875.911">
    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    Well, there is still isn't any evidence that he actually did know his name and confront him with his correct name. 
    I think he was at the end of the line that he didn't know his right name and he didn't know where this man lived. 
    And these narcotic addicts always go by incorrect names, not their real true given names. 
    That's been the experiences that I have witnessed and been involved with.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="875.911" stopTime="950.889">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But on the cross-examination, it was brought out was it not? 
    The defendant counsel was allowed to bring out and did bring out that this man going by the name of James Jordan, was an addict at that time, that he had prior convictions. 
    That he was -- that he had a criminal charge then pending against him. 
    That he was being paid for his services as an informer and that James Jordan was an assumed name, all those things presumably damaging to his credibility. 
    What more do you suggest to -- if they found, “Well, he also went by name of Fishbait,” that was brought out, and let's say it's also been brought out, “Well, I also go out by the name of John Smith, Tom Brown, and Alfred Green, what would that of help? 
    I mean why -- it was shown that he went -- that he had another name that this was an assumed name, his criminal record were shown, his addiction of narcotics were shown. 
    In fact, he was a paid informer were shown. 
    And as Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Marshall have suggested, it was also shown that the lawyer in fact knew who he was having serviced as his employer, what more could have been brought out?
speaker="gerald_w_getty" startTime="950.889" stopTime="985.916">
    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    By that cross-examination, it was superficial. 
    Here, he brought all it up, but everything he said was what James Jordan wanted him to know. 
    James Jordan said that he had been in the penitentiary. 
    But with his correct name and an address, we might have found out that he had been in the penitentiary or in several penitentiaries.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="985.916" stopTime="993.687">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, he said he had been convicted for larceny, and he'd been convicted of burglary, and he said there was a -- then a charge pending against him.
speaker="gerald_w_getty" startTime="993.687" stopTime="1054.934">
    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    And we might have found out that there was more charges pending against him such as he had a charge -- that probably he would be a witness in the case of Herbert Simpson, the man that Fleming Smith directed him to. 
    We might have found out that he had been in the mental institution before. 
    We might have found out that he was in custody of the police. 
    We might have found out that he was testifying because he was going to receive immunity. 
    We might have found out -- those things that are very important that might have tipped the scales in favor of Fleming Smith before the trier of fact in this case. 
    It's not just that he was an addict, not just that he had been in the penitentiary before, but all those other things that could have been brought by knowing his true name and his true address.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1054.934" stopTime="1065.241">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I thought they -- you represented to us that its typical for these people not to use their true name.

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    I found --

    Yes.

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    Yes. 
    Now it has been indicated in some of the following cases which is the reasoning and we feel is the correct reasoning that we have approached this case in, and it's the Roviaro versus the U.S. , 1957 case, 353 U.S. and there where there was a witness and it was on the issue of guilt. 
    It was determined that this was a material witness and that this witness should be disclosed. 
    And there it was distinguished also that the -- on the -- where there's an informant on probable cause as to whether there was a good arrest. 
    There the police officer, if has received information from this informant, then he would not have to disclose the name, the address, the identity of his informant. 
    There we find a distinction between probable cause and where there is a question of the -- on the issue of guilt or innocence. 
    Or there is an issue of guilt or innocence then the identity of this informer must be disclosed. 
    Also in a recent case, the same distinction in the case of McCray versus Illinois decided March of 1967. 
    There, that case was affirmed because it was found by this Court that it was on the issue of probable clause but that if it had been an issue where there -- an issue of guilt and this informer had been a material witness, then there should be disclosure of that informant. 
    Also in the Alford versus the U.S. , 1931 282 Illinois, in that case where it was refused to disclose the address of a material witness. 
    On that particular point alone, the case was reversed.

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    Yes, I state it. 
    I thought it was a day and a day and a half, two-day trial.

    It's a question of -- on a question of guilt that the identity, not only the production but the identity of the witness should be disclosed, where it's only on probable cause then it would not be necessary and that is the law, we know that, that the informer may not be disclosed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John J. O'Toole
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1571.279" stopTime="1573.277">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. O'Toole.
speaker="john_j_otoole" startTime="1573.277" stopTime="1753.416">
    Mr. John J. O'Toole 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The issue that's presented in this case is actually revolves or is a takeoff from Rovario. 
    The Rovario this Court held that where the testimony of an informant -- the merits of the case is necessary for the defense, that the informant must be disclosed. 
    However, we don't think that this is a -- and I don't believe that the Court intended this to be a blanket, unfettered disclosure of all informants. 
    I believe that it's needless to go into the importance of informants in the law enforcement field where necessity, actual necessity that we have this Court has recognized at that time and time again. 
    But the fact remains that we fully admit that if the testimony, the identity of an informant is necessary to allow a defendant to properly defend themselves, we agree that his name and identity should be revealed. 
    However, in this situation that we feel, and as the Court said in Rovario, each case should be considered on its own and the rights of the people balanced against the rights of the defendant. 
    Now in this situation, the defendant took the stand was subjected to a full cross-examination, the majority of this transcript as a cross-examination of James Jordan, the only thing that his name and true address could have possibly brought out with facts relating to his credibility. 
    And as Mr. Justice Stewart aptly put it, how could his credibility been more destroyed than that to say that I was convicted on larceny, spent a year Vandalia, I was in (Inaudible) for burglary, I am an addict, presently an addict, I had a shot last week, (Inaudible) even rolled up the man's sleeve and pointed out the pinhole marks in his arm in front of the judge. 
    The judge observed this. 
    He stated, “I am presently under indictment. 
    I come up in one month for trial,” what more could you say? 
    This man's credibility is already destroyed as far as it's possible. 
    But the thing that the petitioner doesn't mention is that with the exception of the actual passage of the narcotics from Fleming Smith to James Jordan, every bit of a testimony of Fleming Smith was corroborated by two police officers.

    Mr. John J. O'Toole 
    Let me say this that as far as the informant's situation goes, that once an individual does expose himself in court, he is open for retaliation. 
    Now, the interest the state has is that if we don't do everything we possibly can within the constitutional guideline to protect the informant, we are not going to be able to get an informant. 
    Now, let's just give the one example, at least, sure they know who he is.

    A situation that is similarly akin to this is a situation of where a person might invoke the right of self-incrimination in a trial. 
    And the Federal Courts of Appeals have consistently held that where a witness, a governmental witness, invokes self-incrimination, and his testimony which is -- which he invokes the privilege, only goes to credibility that the error created is only harmless. 
    Now this is the Cardillo case in a -- spells this out, has been followed consistently by nearly every Circuit Court.

    Mr. John J. O'Toole 
    No. 
    I think that on the facts in this individual case, we are really asking two things. 
    One, let's not have a blanket rule. 
    Let's not have a universal principle that where we have a participating informant that he must in all situations divulge his name and his present address. 
    But rather, that in keeping with the language of this Court in Rovario, each case should fall -- arise on its own merits. 
    I think it would --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2657.608" stopTime="2658.692">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if --
speaker="john_j_otoole" startTime="2658.692" stopTime="2711.821">
    Mr. John J. O'Toole 
    The Court said this, “We believe that no fixed rule with respect to disclosure is justifiable”. 
    The problem is when it calls for balancing of the public interest and protecting the flow of information against the individual's right to prepare his defense. 
    We ask two things. 
    Truthfully, if you reverse this case on the basis of the fact situation, that would be a loss. 
    But it would not be damaging. 
    What we want, and what we want to take back in Illinois and I think for the benefits of all the states is the fact that where no -- we don't want a universal rule in such where we have a participating informant, there must just be complete unfettered cross-examination even where it will not be beneficial to the defendant. 
    In this situation, what could they have learned really? 
    They could affect his credibility. 
    And --

    Well, I'm -- excuse me for going beyond the realm.

    Where on a (Inaudible), if we can protect the name and the present whereabouts of an informant, we are bolstering the whole system because we are showing these people that we are going to do everything we possibly can to protect them.

    Very well.

    Mr. Gerald W. Getty 
    Briefly to answer Mr. O'Toole, it's our position and has been our position in the brief that once the state has produced a witness that they lose any governmental privilege. 
    And that to make the Sixth Amendment meaningful and that we have a right to know the witnesses that are presented against the accused, to make it meaningful, then we -- it is basic that we should at least know the name and address of the witness presented against the defendant as to who is to decide whether what to do with the name and the address, what to investigate should lie with the defense so that we can properly defend the man that is accused.
