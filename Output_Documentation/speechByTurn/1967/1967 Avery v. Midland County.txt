    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This action is before the Court by writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Texas. 
    The question before the Court is whether the principle of one man, one vote as established in Reynolds versus Sims applies to the governing body of Midland County, Texas. 
    We respectfully submit that the function of the County Government in Texas and the facts in this case suggest that the question be answered in the affirmative. 
    Midland County, Texas is located in West Central Texas. 
    It's approximately square in size, contains 900 acres, has 70,000 people --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="92.693" stopTime="94.073">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    900 acres?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="94.073" stopTime="509.282">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    900 square miles, I'm sorry, Your Honor, 900 square miles. 
    And it's governed by a governing body that's established by Article V, Section 18 of the Constitution of Texas. 
    This provision of the Constitution provides that the governing body shall consist of a county commissioners court composed of a county judge and four county commissioners, each county commissioner to be elected from a commissioners precinct and to be elected for a term of four years. 
    The county commissioner's precincts are boundaries to the county commissioners precinct or established by the Commissioners Court. 
    The original county commissioners precincts were established in 1885 and in the late 1800s and the early 1900s, there we're two or three minor changes made and no further changes were made in the boundaries of the county commissioners court until 1963. 
    Now in 1952, Mr. Hank Avery, the petitioner here and the plaintiff below, appeared before the county commissioners court of Midland County and pointed out to the Court at this time the disparity of population between the commissioner's precincts and the county. 
    Mr. Avery pointed out that commissioner's precinct won of which he was a resident, contained over 95% of the population of Midland County and elected only one member to the Commissioners Court. 
    That commissioners precincts numbers two, three, and four, contained less than 5% of the population of the county, and elected three members of the commissioners court. 
    And therefore, he did not have -- the citizen did not have an equal voice in the Government, governing body of Midland County, and asked that county be redistributed in accordance with the population. 
    His request was denied. 
    In 1963, Mr. Avery filed a lawsuit in Midland County, Texas against the Commissioners Court to require the entry to District Midland County in accordance with substantial numerical quantity. 
    After this lawsuit was filed, the Commissioners Court held what they designate as public hearings in an attempt to resolve this issue and Mr. Avery appeared at these public hearings and presented a plan to the Commissioners Court whereby the county could be divided so that it would be equal in population. 
    Substantially equal insofar as miles of county roads, areas, taxable values, and so forth. 
    The proposition of Mr. Avery was rejected. 
    The Commissioners Court made only very slight changes in the commissioners precincts. 
    No substantial changes in an area or in population. 
    These changes were made in August 1963 effective January 1, 1964. 
    We filed an amended pleading after this action of the commissioners court and the case was tried in the spring of 1964. 
    Now, in the amended pleading, the amended pleading showed and proof substantiated in this case that Mr. Avery was a resident citizen of Precinct Number 1 of Midland County, a qualified voter and taxpayer. 
    It further showed that the county, Midland County, were divided into four commissioners precincts numbered one, two, three, and four, and at each elected one member to the Commissioners Court. 
    The pleadings and the proof further showed that over 95% of the population of Midland County elected one member of the Commissioners Court. 
    And that precincts number two, three, and four, which contained less than 5% of the population of the county, elected three members to the Commissioners Court. 
    It further showed that county judge even though elected by the citizens throughout the county, and was a presiding officer voted only in the event of the time. 
    The pleadings further set forth that this constituted invidious discrimination and denied to the petitioner here equal protection under the laws as guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment to United States Constitution. 
    The trial court in Midland found the above facts to be true and further found that the county knew this, the county governing body knew these facts to be true and if they could divide Midland County in accordance with population so that each commissioners precinct would have substantially the same number of people. 
    Then the Court order -- the Court further found that its failure to do so constitute invidious discrimination, and ordered the County Commissioners Court of Midland County to redistrict Midland County in the commissioners precincts, so that each commissioners precinct would have substantially the same number of people. 
    After this order was entered by the trial court, an appeal was taken to the Court of Civil -- by the respondents here in the appendix below to the Court of Civil Appeals at El Paso. 
    The Court of Civil Appeals at El Paso held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was not applicable to the governing body of Midland County and reversed and rendered the case. 
    We filed an application for a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Texas which was granted. 
    The Supreme Court of Texas reverse the Court of Civil Appeals and held that the action of the Commissioners Court of Midland County was arbitrary unreasonable and capricious. 
    It further held -- it further reversed the trial court in part and held that there was no invidious discrimination. 
    It held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the United States Constitution was not applicable to the County Government of Midland County, Texas. 
    The basis for this apparently was there was a variance between the condition of the people that live in rural areas and urban areas.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I didn't understand the -- or maybe I misunderstood but I -- it is not been my misunderstanding that the Supreme Court of Texas had held that that provision of the Federal Constitution is not applicable to Midland County, Texas but that provision of Constitution required was not what you said it required.

    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    -- an effort to cover background. 
    Supreme Court did not told if it was not applicable but said that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require that the Midland County be divided equally insofar population is concerned. 
    The Supreme Court of Texas further held that this Court, the Supreme Court, did not have authority to redistrict Midland County that the trial court did not have authority to redistrict Midland County but that this authority was vested solely in the Commissioners Court and entered an order directing the trial court to enter an order based upon this judgment of the Supreme Court of Texas.

speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="591.035" stopTime="649.190">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    They held, Your Honor, specifically in regard to this matter of population that we disagree with the judgment of the trial court and its requirement that Midland County be redistricted in the commissioners precinct solely upon the basis of population. 
    Now, they held in that case that the Supreme Court of Texas be held that the rural residence of Midland County Texas had a different -- stood in a different place in the county government than the urban residence of Midland County Texas. 
    And held that if the one vote -- one man, one vote principle of Reynolds versus Sims were -- was applied to Midland County Texas, the voice of the rural area would be lost. 
    And therefore, they held that they disagreed with the trial court in its finding that the one man, one vote principle applies.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Olson, what part do you think in the Supreme Court's conclusion was played by what it says speaking of the commissioner and the body, its legislative functions are negligible and county government is not otherwise comparable with the legislature of the State or the Federal Congress. 
    And then later, that theoretically the Commissioners Court is the governing body, it represents all the residents both urban and suburban that developments during the year have greatly narrowed the scope of the functions of the Commissioners Court and limited major responsibilities in non-urban areas. 
    It has come to pass that the city government with its legislative executive and judicial branches is the major concern. 
    Would you believe that?

    That was my understanding of it --

    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Yes, sir. 
    It certainly is. 
    I think under the two issues decided by this Court at the last term, the Sailors case and the Dusch case that it's a very significant. 
    I think under those cases is that they were not elected. 
    That this doctrine would not apply.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2071.983" stopTime="2079.672">

    Do you think the state that provide for the appointment by the governor, the members of this Court?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2079.672" stopTime="2137.062">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    They could by constitutional amendment but it would take the constitutional amendment and of course -- well we never have constitutional amendment in Texas is by two-thirds vote of both houses submitted the vote of people but I think that they could, yes, sir. 
    I don't want to be repetitious on this pointed out some of the duties and responsibilities of the Commissioners Court but I think for the continuity of this, I'd like to go hardly over this. 
    Article V, Section 18 of the Constitution provides that the Commissioners Court shall have such powers and duties overall county business as it's established by the Constitution in the states. 
    Now, I would point out that this time, Mr. Justice Stewart made a mention about the designation of this body as a Court, this is a misnomer and the Supreme Court of Texas so held in its opinion --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2137.062" stopTime="2139.594">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You mean on my part or on the part of your Texas Constitution.
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2139.594" stopTime="2141.736">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    No, sir. 
    Not on your part, Your Honor. 
    On the part --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2141.736" stopTime="2143.256">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If that is what is called exactly.
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2143.256" stopTime="2155.866">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Yes, sir. 
    It's what's called but it's a misnomer according to the Supreme Court of Texas and that it provides no judicial functions as such. 
    It's a misnomer that was placed by the Texas Constitution.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2155.866" stopTime="2158.356">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Chairman is also called the county judge, isn't it?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2158.356" stopTime="2177.670">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And of course, the county judge does perform some judicial functions. 
    We have a jurisdiction governed by the county judge, probate manners, and then within $200 to $500. 
    And $500 and $1000 have concurrent jurisdiction with that.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2177.670" stopTime="2180.152">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    If the judge would believe it must be a lawyer?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2180.152" stopTime="2222.755">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    No, sir. 
    Not in Texas. 
    The county judge does not have to be a lawyer. 
    Now, the County Commissioners Court is a sole governing body in Midland County. 
    There is no other governing body of Midland County. 
    Now, the authority of the setup in this Board is both setup by the Constitution and setup by the statute but the Constitution says it -- it says it shall have control of all of the county government. 
    As I pointed out, it has the authority of taxation to set tax rates set as a Board of Equalization to adjust the ad valorem values offered then. 
    It has the authority to establish a budget which in the trial of this case in 1963 was something under $2 million.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2222.755" stopTime="2225.567">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Does it have anything to do with the schools, public schools?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2225.567" stopTime="2231.106">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    No, sir. 
    It does not. 
    We have two independent school districts in Midland County, Midland Independent and Great --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2231.106" stopTime="2233.646">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which will not connect within the city or the county government?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2233.646" stopTime="2258.506">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    That's correct. 
    Yes. 
    Now, in regards to this budget, there's some very significant factors. 
    The Supreme Court of Texas in its opinion said that there were some case countywide of officers that were elected by all of the people. 
    That's true in the county there -- that perform ministerial functions such as the sheriff. 
    The county tax assessor and collector, the district clerk in the county survey. 
    But --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2258.506" stopTime="2259.368">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Was that judged?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2259.368" stopTime="2259.932">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Sir?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2259.932" stopTime="2261.204">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Were they judged, all of those?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2261.204" stopTime="2304.027">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Yes, sir. 
    In a probate judge. 
    I think it's very significant in this regard that the salaries of these officials are set by the Commissioners Court, the governing body of Midland County, and the salary of all of their employees, if any, set by the Commissioners Court. 
    So if the Commissioners Court doesn't feel like that they want anything other than a sheriff in the county, they can just not approve a budget for any deputies. 
    And of course, the same thing can apply to tax assessor and collector's office, and so forth so on. 
    In fact, they established a budget that runs all of the Government. 
    They even insofar as these elected officials who perform ministerial duties.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2304.027" stopTime="2320.382">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How much in fact -- how much a function do these county officers have inside the city limits? 
    I'm talking now about the sheriff and the deputy as distinguished from a city police force inside the city.
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2320.382" stopTime="2322.815">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    They have the same authority --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2322.815" stopTime="2325.819">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Will they in fact exercise it?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2325.819" stopTime="2327.923">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    On occasion they do, yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2327.923" stopTime="2332.205">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or do they spend most of their time to perform most of their duties that are outside the city limits.
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2332.205" stopTime="2335.157">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Yes sir, they perform most of the duties outside the city.

    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Well, except for the constable, and of course, they do have the designated function of serving all judicial papers. 
    The city police force has no authority to serve any judicial papers --

    The testimony in this case show that approximately 65% was received from what do we have in Precinct Number 1, which is the City of Midland.

    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Well, it would be hard to do, Your Honor. 
    However, there is a connected with this record, the budget of the City of Midland County for the years up to 1964 which would show that where the expenditures were made, now of course, the budget would not disclose what portion of it was used within the corporate limits of the City of Midland.

    It's not exactly right, Your Honor. 
    There is a small portion, I think, they have this in this case show about 400 people live inside the corporate limits of the City of Midland and are located in Commissioners Precinct Number 4, I believe it is. 
    This is the airport when the City of Midland took in its airport it run a land, it took in the airport and it's out from town.

    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    No, sir. 
    This is the only one. 
    The City of Midland is the only incorporated city, town and village in Midland County. 
    Now, in addition to these authorities of taxation and physical -- fiscal matters, now the county has authority to create a hospital, medical care for the indigent, garbage collection, bearing it offers these various similar functions. 
    They have numerous safety functions such as we pointed out the deputy sheriff, constables, fire protection. 
    They have the authority to create a public facility such as public libraries, which they have in Midland. 
    They have the authority to create airports, public housing, waterworks, park, and recreation areas, auditoriums, coliseums, and the sole authority to either create these or not to create these in the governing body of Midland County Texas. 
    They have the authority to construct bridges and roads either within or without the corporate limits of the City of Midland and they have the general authority of eminent domain. 
    They have authority to issue in both -- to issue and sell bonds, and to control the subdivision of land throughout the county.

    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Yes, sir.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Would you explain that just a little because as I thought -- I understood you say that they didn't have the power to zone but now you say they have the power to control subdivision --

    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Yes, sir.

    -- in what way, Mr. Olson?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2749.126" stopTime="2788.160">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    That's a -- it may be construed as zoning in the sense, Your Honor. 
    The statute provides that before land can be sold according now as lot and block rather than the general type field note descriptions, the plan must be filed of record with the county clerk. 
    Now, the plan cannot be file a record with the county clerk if it's located outside in the incorporated city town or village or within five miles unless it's approved by the County Commissioners Court. 
    They, in this, can require such thing --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2788.160" stopTime="2791.189">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You said it's located inside the city?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2791.189" stopTime="2900.919">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    No, sir. 
    Out -- if it's located inside the city, it does not have to be approved by the County Commissioners Court. 
    But it's located outside the city and not within five miles to the city, it must be approved by the County Commissioners Court and they can require a certain portion of this area to be set aside for park and recreation purposes, a certain portion to be set aside for roads, and that sort of thing before they would approve the plan. 
    Now, there are several significant facts that are firmly established in this case. 
    One is that the governing body of Midland County is important in the lives of all of the citizens of the county. 
    The governing body of Midland County performs legislative and administrative functions that daily affect the lives and welfare of all the citizens. 
    The governing body of Midland County is controlled by less than 5% of the people who elect three members to the governing body. 
    There is no effective way for the voice of over 95% of the citizens of Midland County to be heard insofar as our county governing body is concerned since they can elect only one member to the Commissioners Court. 
    And we feel that this condition will remain unless it's changed by this Court. 
    Now, it's the position of the petitioner here that each citizen of Midland County is entitled to an equal vote in the election of the county governing body. 
    How else can we have representative government? 
    We earnestly submit that each man regardless of the color of his skin or the cut of his coat or the place of his residence is entitled to an equal vote.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2900.919" stopTime="2916.007">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But Mr. Olson, if you turn this around and apply what you have just said. 
    That means that the 95% of the votes would be cast by people within Precinct Number 1, mostly by the Senate, isn't that right?
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="2916.007" stopTime="2918.024">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    Yes, sir. 
    Actually 97% of the qualified --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2918.024" stopTime="3028.127">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    97%. 
    Now, if one would put possibly the worst construction on this, it might lead to the inability of people in the county to get roads and schools, and libraries, and restaurants. 
    In other words, isn't it conceivable, I suppose that the system deliberately designed so as to promote the development of the entire county even though the people within the city after subsidizing a bit. 
    Just as the people of the United States, I suppose, people of New York State let's say do subsidize somewhat federal payments that go to the development of the -- of a less developed states and some of the sovereign states. 
    Now, I suppose that this is -- could be said to be conscious policy and I guess the question which you are pointing out to us is whether constitutional principle requires that this system for the subsidization, if you wish, of the rural areas at the expense both voting and financial perhaps, the city wether that system, when the Constitution forbids that kind of system. 
    Do you have a comment on what I've just said?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3028.127" stopTime="3036.134">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I suppose you answer that after we have the recess.
speaker="lyndon_l_olson" startTime="3036.134" stopTime="3183.812">
    Mr. Lyndon L. Olson 
    May it please the Court. 
    Mr. Justice Fortas prior to the luncheon recess have asked me a question in regard to the -- whether or not there were some rationale for providing the governing body for Midland County in regard insofar as the rural population is concerned. 
    In answer sir to that question, my statement would be that Article V, Section 18 the Texas Constitution provides that the commissioners precinct line shall be changed from time to time for the convenience of the people. 
    It doesn't say rural people and it doesn't say urban people. 
    I feel that the governing body of Midland County affects all of the people of county and it should be divided accordingly. 
    I would point out that apparently this same question was raised before the Court in Reynolds versus Sims that if the “one man, one vote” principle were applied and the voice of the rural area would be heard. 
    The Court in that case provided that we are advised that states can rationally considers the facts other than population in apportioning legislation representation. 
    Our answer is this, a denial of the constitutionally protected rights demand judicial protection. 
    Our oath in our office require no less to the extent that the citizen's right to vote is the base, he is that much less a citizen. 
    The fact that a citizen lives here or there is not a legitimate reason for overweighting or deluding his vote. 
    A citizen, a qualified voter is no more or no less so because he lives in the city or on a farm. 
    This is a clear and strong command of our Constitution of the Equal Protection Clause. 
    If it please the Court, we respectfully submit that the logic as so clearly set forth in Reynolds versus Sims is applicable to the county government of Midland County Texas.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Beytagh?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="3192.692" stopTime="3326.437">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I suppose there's a little need to remind the Court that the issue involved here is the same one that was before the Court in four local government cases last term. 
    The Government participated amicus in those cases and we continue our participation here because we feel that the case involves the question that's of fundamental importance to our democratic society. 
    Essentially the question of ensuring fair and full participation at all levels of Government for all people. 
    Initially and just in passing, I'd like to mention a jurisdictional issue that was raised at one point in this case. 
    As we understand it, the respondents at the petition stage question whether there was a final judgment in this case. 
    We developed some pages in our brief to this question. 
    We think that it's clear that the Texas Supreme Court's judgment was a final one both under Texas law and under this Court's precedence. 
    And that therefore, the Court's certiorari jurisdiction was invoked, properly invoked. 
    Now, it's clear that the Texas Supreme Court did remand case to the trial court but the remand was very limited one. 
    It was for entry of a judgment in accordance with the opinion. 
    And we feel that it's also clear that the Texas Supreme Court did pass on the federal constitutional issue that was raised and then of course, is essential that this Court exercise of jurisdiction because the Texas Supreme Court stated and held that the Equal Protection Clause did not require population-based districting in Midland County, Texas. 
    That was in the face of a trial court judgment which had ordered the commissioners to redistrict on a basis of population. 
    So, we think it's clear that this Court's jurisdiction is properly invoked and that there was a final judgment despite the limited remand.

    And so far as we know, the commissioners may now go ahead and effectuate and putting the operation a planned depended, a precinct division plan depended entirely upon population.

    All -- all of the Texas I have in mind this that all of the Texas Supreme Court said was that in its opinion, the Equal Protection Clause does not require in all cases, it does not -- do not require a commissioners precinct division of Texas county on this basis in all cases dependent of course, in each case upon the existence and effect of other relevant factors such as those that we have mentioned. 
    And the commissioners may now go ahead and come to conclusion that those other relevant factors adding them all up on that bounds come out so that they're going to now put it on a plan dependent entirely on population. 
    That certainly is well within the realm of possibility as a practical manner, is it not?

    First, they spend an awful lot of time in their brief upon the merits arguing that that was not the kind of plan that was suitable in Midland County. 
    And second, it seems to me that if anything is clear from the Texas Supreme Court's opinion, it is that the equal population principle of Reynolds should not be applied at least in this county.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3432.265" stopTime="3474.916">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Not that -- I thought that what it held was that because the Federal Constitution does not require in every single case of each of the 254 Texas counties that Reynolds against Sims be slavishly followed. 
    And but if -- and then it remanded the case to the trial court which in turn is going to enter a judgment consistent without opinion which will simply leave them with the commissioners the job now of coming up with the new plan and until or in less there's a new plan, what do we -- how do we know what the new plan can contain? 
    Now, this is quite a part from any technical concept of jurisdiction. 
    I'm just addressing my question to the practical problem.

    But I don't think that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3570.205" stopTime="3701.238">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I don't think that we understand saying. 
    I think the point is that, we are in the business of forecasting what they're going to do. 
    The question is what did the Supreme Court of Texas tell them to do? 
    And I'm impressed rather than surprised if I know this correctly understood your characterization of the Court's opinion because as I read it, the Supreme Court of Texas said that and I think the clearest place is at the bottom of page 149 of the record that the convenience of the people and the particular circumstances of a county may require and constitutionally justify a rational variance from the quality and population of commissioners precinct from the basis of additional relevant factors which the Court then enumerates. 
    As I read this, the Texas Supreme Court has held, Number one, that -- that's in the first full paragraph on page 150, it is held that there is obvious arbitrariness of the current districting order because of the great malapportionment of the commissioners precincts in Midland County. 
    And it's held that this is malapportioned. 
    It is also held, as I understand it, that the correct way to go about this is to start with the one man, one vote principle and then to make a rational variance when it calls rational variance were indicated by the -- were required by particular circumstances in county on factors have that are numerous. 
    Do you agree with my characterization of this opinion or do you think that the Court rejected the one man, one vote principle totally as applied here?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="3701.238" stopTime="3707.316">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I think -- I have to frankly say to you that I can read it that way. 
    I don't say any total out loud rejection of that principle, although I do think, I think it presents a sharp issue that is why that which is whether there can be a departure from that principle taking into account the other factors. 
    That's a different thing in my mind in what you've said.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="3737.341" stopTime="3763.561">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    But -- but this is against the background of a trial court decision in order requiring that the district can be on a population basis. 
    We pointed out on our brief that the factors that Texas Supreme Court enumerates to be taken into account either cut in favor of the people that live in the city or they're the kind of factors that the Court in Reynolds versus Sims held were not properly to be taken into account.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3763.561" stopTime="3789.705">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    But you see, the second full paragraph on page 150 in the record is a court statement that they disagreed with the judgment of the trial court in its requirement that the county be redistricting the commissioners precinct solely on the basis of population. 
    I suppose that they came back with a new plan solely on the basis of population, that they would be reversed again?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="3789.705" stopTime="4882.936">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I think it's pretty clear that they would be reversed again. 
    And I think it's also pretty clear that commissioners aren't going to do anything like that anyhow. 
    I think in the main that we should leave the question of the powers and the functions and the duties of this Board of the parties who are in a position to know far better than the Government exactly how this particular body functions. 
    We do point out that the body does have a general taxing authority overall the people in the county whether they live in the city or out in the rural areas, and that they have a power of equalizing tax assessment, determining what value is to be placed on property and that there is some indication in the record that this particular power has been used and certainly at least can be used in the future of use. 
    Should point out I think that the argument and the discussion this morning, I think, points out to our way of thinking the basic utility of pursuing some kind of distinction based upon whether the body is legislative or administrative or something else. 
    I just don't think that that's a meaningful way to pursue the inquiry. 
    As a matter of constitutional law, we don't think that Reynolds versus Sims and the other cases were grounded on anything that was peculiar to State legislatures as distinguished from other kinds of representative bodies. 
    Gray versus Sanders was mentioned this morning. 
    That case didn't involve legislative officers and yet the Court applied the Equal Protection Clause there. 
    For practical reasons, however, we think that the distinction is just an illusory one. 
    What this kind of bodies and this is a typical one. 
    Some have more extensive powers, some have less. 
    I suppose that -- and we mentioned that perhaps a de minimis rule could be evolved as to some of these bodies that they don't do important or significant things. 
    And that they would be said not to be within the principle. 
    But when a body has a general taxing authority over the people and it has a number of other important functions, the matter in which they're exercised and what kind of label or characterization might be placed on them whether legislative or administrative, or what, it seems to us to introduce into our courts and almost never ending inquiry as to how to do this? 
    What attributes do you focus upon? 
    And finally, I'm not convinced that even if the judiciary spends the time in this inquiry, the results will be meaningful or coherent and of course, this Court will be in a position of trying to give some consistency and some coherence to these distinctions. 
    And therefore, we developed that greater length in our brief that we don't think a legislative administrative line distinction is a feasible one or a justifiable one. 
    One might say, “Well, let's just find out how the Board functions. 
    Does it enact to ordinances? 
    And if it does then, that's a lawmaking kind of function. 
    Why don't we say that's the test?” 
    Well, we think that whether a body, the local level has a power to enact to ordinances or not, it depends so much on the vagaries of state law that you had -- if you focus on this, you would have attached to own that would not produce sensible or meaningful results. 
    And therefore, we feel that the power to enact ordinance is the form through which the body acts is not a -- should not be a determined one. 
    We also should point out that in suggesting that a legislative, administrative line of distinction not be drawn as to the applicability of Reynolds at the local level. 
    We don't mean that all distinction should be cast aside. 
    It seems to us, first, that if some such line is going to be drawn, perhaps a better focus would be on whether the body is a policy making body or whether it is essentially is ministerial in character. 
    This is a line of distinction that has been worked out to some extent in some state as the municipal law matter. 
    We don't think that that would be -- that's much easier to apply but at least I think it might focus on the importance and the independence and whatever of the particular body. 
    We also suggest and develop at some length what we consider to be a significant and important consideration that stems from Reynolds versus Sims. 
    And that is this, that Reynolds versus Sims assumes since it's grounded on the Equal Protection Clause and grounded on the protection of the individual's right to cast an equally weighted vote that all citizens are situated in a substantially similar way, insofar as their state legislature is concerned. 
    Now, this is a traditional except that Equal Protection Clause concept that classifications are valid if people are situated in a substantially different way but classifications are not valid if people are not and discrimination comes in. 
    Now, we suggest that at least just to some so-called special districts and by this Act mean sewage and drainage and conservancy districts, bodies that in the main are set up to perform a single function and yet under the laws of some states are -- have a body that is elected by the people from districts. 
    That it may be that the Equal Protection Clause and Reynolds versus Sims do not require equal districting because the nature and the function of what this particular body does, does not relate generally to all of the people. 
    It relates to this certain discrete identifiable classes of people. 
    Now, it may be difficult to apply this in some cases, we refer to in passing a couple of Arizona statutes that relates to drainage districts several. 
    They even point out there that the drainage district governing board is elected from districts but those districts are based on land area instead on people. 
    But it seems to us that that may be a sensible line of distinction because the functions that those bodies apparently perform relate directly and specifically to only those people in their own land to be drained. 
    It seems to us though that you can push this too far. 
    If the body nevertheless has a general taxing power and can affect importantly the lives of all the people in the area, then I don't think that we would carry this line of distinction and that before we but suggest then the people are basically situated in a similar way. 
    This is a tough line of distinction. 
    It seems to us that it's a pertinent consideration in deciding, how and when, and where, and why Reynolds versus Sims should be applied at the local level. 
    Now, this immediately raises the question and I think that it's fairly presented by the Texas Supreme Court's opinion. 
    Why shouldn't this apply to general function units, this line of distinction? 
    You say that people are not similarly situated whether the rural and the urban people here are similarly situated. 
    And our answer would be, yes, that they are in this situation would apply almost across the board to all general function units. 
    Here, we suggest they're similarly situated because this body does have powers and does exercise functions that affect all of them in an important way. 
    It seems to us that the rather hoary motto “No Taxation without Representation” is not to be so likely cast aside. 
    If the body can tax these people and can use this money in ways that it sees fit, and it seems to me that those people wherever they live in the area, whether they live in the city or out in the rural areas, have an important and substantial interest. 
    One might say, okay, they have an important and substantial interest but it is -- it is so important and so substantial that they have to be given equality in the weight of their vote. 
    Well, I don't think that that is unnecessary and indispensable constitutional requisite but as a practical matter, I don't think that it can be worked out in any other way. 
    Now, this sounds harsh but it seems to us at some states have adjusted to this situation. 
    Our own experience right across the river in Virginia indicates that independent cities can be created and established. 
    And in there, if the particular state feels that this problem that we refer to is overlapped in jurisdiction, it's a difficult one their ways available in the political and legislative process to deal with it. 
    But, we think that it's quite clear that as to this kind of body whether you call it legislative or whatever, it does things that affect the people that live in Midland in an important way. 
    Now, I'd like to discuss in passing at least some of the arguments that are made against defining Reynolds versus Sims at the local level. 
    Some people say states have a plenary power over local bodies. 
    They can create them or do a way with them or do whatever they want. 
    Well, that's -- that's true but that doesn't carry today. 
    All that we suggest here, is that whether the state creates local bodies whose members are to be elected from districts, those districts are required under the Equal Protection Clause to be substantially put in population. 
    Some people say they just so many of these bodies that the thing is unmanageable. 
    We pointed out that the Bureau of Census indicates there's somewhere in the neighborhood of 90,000 of these bodies. 
    A recent publication, they put this out every five years, indicates that the number has been reduced to somewhere in the neighborhood of 80,000. 
    As you've pointed out, that almost all of the reduction indeed more than the difference in the reduction is in consolidated school districts. 
    We suggested last term that is insofar as the principle, we suggest to be applied that it would affect somewhere in the neighborhood of 20,000 of these bodies. 
    We think, however, that while there are a large number of these, the principle is manageable. 
    The Court is not writing on a blank sheet here. 
    We pointed out and discussed at length that seven state courts of last resort have already applied the population principle to local bodies. 
    And this includes states like New York and California, the two largest states in our country. 
    These states of this State Court of last resort have found that these are full and practicable to handle this. 
    Indeed in one of the cases, the Wisconsin case, there was a State statute that was involved and the Wisconsin Supreme Court pointed out that its decision would have of course affect in one stroke all of the counties in the state rather than to have litigation as to each and everyone. 
    Now, we feel that for the reasons developed more fully and what we refer to this is our Sailors brief of last term that the matter is a manageable one. 
    We think that this is confirmed by this Court's decisions in Bianchi and Moody cases last term which the Court held that three-judge courts would not be required in the federal system in most of these situations since the involved statutes of limited applicability. 
    We also note that the Court in the opinions written last term express to concern with innovation and experimentation at the local level and of the state for interfering with that. 
    We think that is well-advised if we don't think that the rule of applying Reynolds at the local level will do a way with innovation and experimentation. 
    Most of these malapportioned situations have not come about through experimentation or innovation. 
    They've come about through a resistance to change. 
    The trial court here pointed out that and made a finding that the purpose behind this scheme was political expediency to maintain the status quo. 
    That was true in the state cases and that's true at the local level. 
    And we think that it would be a rather plural irony of experimentation and innovation were used to uphold the schemes on the hope that someday this would develop. 
    We think also that it's quite clear that the Court hasn't resolved the question presented here and yet, we keep running into Tedesco and cases like that. 
    We've explained in our brief the limited significance in our view of pre-Baker decisions. 
    We also pointed out that the several per curiam decisions not on the merits involving local government are certainly not controlling either otherwise a lot of us would have been wasting a lot of time. 
    Last term's decisions it seems to me deserve comment but to it we handle on jurisdictional grounds, we think that has absolutely no effect. 
    The other two cases Sailors and Dusch, the Virginia Beach case, you indicate that in the particular and peculiar circumstances involved there, the Court didn't feel that the Equal Protection Clause apply to require equally populated districts. 
    But in Sailors, the Court pointed out that there wasn't even elective scheme. 
    The Court focused on the system for determining County School Board members and said that that was in an appointive system and also pointed out that at least to non-legislative offices such an appointive system was valid. 
    But here we have an election system, so no question can be raised about that decision controlling. 
    Also in the Virginia Beach case, we had a large election scheme, here we don't. 
    We have an election from districts. 
    I think it's clear also that whatever else might be said about the Virginia Beach decision, we pointed out at some length our concern for that decision being applied sweepingly and across the board. 
    But whatever might be said about it, it doesn't have any bearing here. 
    I'd like, in conclusion, to refer just in passing to what we consider apart from a legal argument some policy considerations that are quite important here. 
    We, of course, don't need to be told that this is a time of crisis in our governmental institution as the demands on government have never been as great and this includes the local level. 
    And it seems to us if our society, our system, is to meet the demands or urbanization and population growth, we need responsive and viable local instruments of government. 
    Now, it's also clear that malapportionment impairs the effectiveness of the bodies to operate in a responsive way and to a deal with the problems and the needs of the citizens. 
    We think that this is particularly so as to local bodies. 
    They touch and involve people in the most direct way. 
    For many people they are the government because they deal with those problems that people are most concerned about, local taxation and zoning, and the condemnation, and things like that. 
    And we think it's also quite clear that if malapportionment at the local level continues, some of the bright promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 might well be deemed. 
    Therefore, in our view, these policy considerations combine with what we feel to be logical and sound constitutional principles to argue in favor of applying the equal population principle of Reynolds at the local level. 
    We submit, therefore, that since Texas Supreme Court under our reading of its opinion rejected the application of the equal population principle that its decision was wrong, and therefore, ought to be reversed.

    I think it is of some significance, Your Honor. 
    This Court has consistently paid attention to the state law determinations and statements of state courts. 
    But on the other hand, it seems to us as Mr. Olson pointed out that that statement was made in passing and it was made in the face of a vast array of statutes which confer on this body --

    That's the way they operate. 
    And that the city government takes care of its own concern. 
    Now, let's assume that were true as a matter of fact in Texas, would you still -- what would you say that has no -- should had no impact on the apportionment of the standards?

    Do you say that it's enough that as long as the county board actually taxes city people that that in itself is enough to say that the equal population principle applies to the local even if 99% of its functions are concerned with the rural areas alone?

   Argument of W. B. Browder, Jr.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Browder.

    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    This case has in it certain drawn issues, narrow issues, if you please. 
    This involves Midland County Texas and the question as to what Midland County can be subdivided as directed by the Texas Supreme Court without considering solely equal population. 
    This case is not what might be called a one man, one vote case. 
    In fact, Your Honors, we do not find one man, one vote as a rule of Reynolds versus Sims. 
    We tried to say that the rule of Reynolds versus Sims is what is said by this Court in the Dusch versus Davis case. 
    When this Court said on the assumption that Reynolds versus Sims controls the constitutional test under the Equal Protection Clause is whether there has been invidious discrimination. 
    We believe that the question here is and first to be decided is whether the Court has jurisdiction, possibly that has been decided finally against respondent. 
    In any event, it is a question because this case has been sent back to the trial court. 
    In Texas, that's a District Court and the Commissioners Court for division of this county without discrimination. 
    The Texas Supreme Court has said that under the United States Constitution and the Texas Constitution, there cannot be division of the counties in a discriminatory manner. 
    That is invidious discrimination or as we read the opinions the vision without reason. 
    The Texas Supreme Court has followed what we believe is the law and ordered a remand of the course for division of the county into four precincts; population and other factors, in other words, division with population in mind and without discrimination.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5204.388" stopTime="5230.961">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I gather that the -- I gather that you think that if the -- that part of that the Supreme Court remanded to let the County Commissioners Court redistrict and that the -- they came back with a population-based plan with the -- is it possible the Supreme Court will approve it?
speaker="w_b_browder_jr" startTime="5230.961" stopTime="5286.823">
    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr. 
    Certainly. 
    If the county commissioners divide Midland County into four precincts, considering the convenience of the people, considering population, and reasonable consideration, reasonable factors, then the District Court would first decide whether there had been invidious discrimination. 
    Then if the District Court passed upon the matter then on the appellate courts in Texas. 
    In other words, as Mr. Justice Stewart asked, what is the status of this course now? 
    We believe that's the first question for the Court. 
    I don't want to dissect the question because the question here is, “Does this Supreme Court of the United States wish to say “We will not permit this matter to be decided by the Texas courts on the basis outlined by the Texas Supreme Court?”
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5286.823" stopTime="5295.630">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if the court below did say that there were other factors which you would testify deviation from the population principle.

    Predominantly?
speaker="w_b_browder_jr" startTime="5431.302" stopTime="5494.652">
    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr. 
    I believe so. 
    But I do not believe solely and only. 
    I want to get to Mr. Justice Fortas' question because I think that's the narrow issue here that he has asked. 
    The Texas Supreme Court disagreed with the trial court. 
    The Texas Supreme Court says that this Court's opinions do not require that the county in every case, those words are used, Your Honor, by the Texas Supreme Court, that the 254 Texas counties do not have to be divided in every case solely on equal population basis. 
    Now, if Your Honor please, this is important, we believe, for this reason. 
    The petitioner has squarely joined issue with respondent on this question. 
    Petitioner realizes that the Texas Supreme Court has reversed and remanded this course to be divided without discrimination, divided on a rational basis. 
    Petitioner brought the case here --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5494.652" stopTime="5507.183">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's substituting -- is that not substituting the idea of reasonable basis, a non-arbitrary basis for the test that we put in our cases that the first consideration must be population?
speaker="w_b_browder_jr" startTime="5507.183" stopTime="5527.941">
    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr. 
    I do not believe so, Your Honor. 
    I believe there's a big difference, reasonable difference. 
    When this Court says that the question, as we understand the Court in Dusch to Sailors, the question is not one man, one vote, the question is whether there is invidious discrimination. 
    Let me --

    I think that as far as these arguments, and I understand this that the Supreme Court not entirely clear. 
    And you -- I don't mind the opinion the way you do. 
    You say now up to this that the opinion of the Texas Supreme Court merely present sends the case back for redistricting and it says, the only inescapable requirement is unless being discrimination, fraud, arbitrariness or due to some discretion, is that right?
speaker="w_b_browder_jr" startTime="5568.205" stopTime="5569.127">
    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr. 
    I believe so as I understand your --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5569.127" stopTime="5679.692">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, that's not the way I read it because that's the last sentence in the opinion on page 150 of the record. 
    And what the Court says is the following, in no event is a population disparity sustainable against a showing of discrimination for arbitrariness or abuse of discretions. 
    And then on preceding tangible record, the Court says that, “equal rights and equal protection of laws require equality and political rights. 
    And there may be circumstances under which the quality and population is essential to equality and voting rights.” 
    So that the Court had mention there are situations, I read this and it's not entirely clear. 
    There are situations in which there has to be mathematical equation, one man, one vote. 
    Then it goes on and it says, I see it, on the other hand, the convenience on the people in a particular circumstances they encountered may require and constitutionally justify a rational variance, a rational variance from the equality and population and the commissioners precincts, upon the basis of additional, relevant factors such as numbers of qualified voters, land areas, geography, etcetera. 
    And as I read this, it seems to me and perhaps you're speaking for Texas, aren't you for the county, aren't you?
speaker="w_b_browder_jr" startTime="5679.692" stopTime="5687.625">
    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr.

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5687.625" stopTime="5722.800">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But as I read this it meant that the basic standard was population, one man, one vote variations are possible in the particular circumstances of the county and that the Constitution is justifiable. 
    Then we go down to the last sentence, “but in no event is a population disparity sustainable against the showing of discrimination, fraud and fairness and so on, that you think it means something different than you write?
speaker="w_b_browder_jr" startTime="5722.800" stopTime="5771.517">
    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr. 
    I think that's exactly what it means, Your Honor. 
    Your Honor please, I did not want to equivocate in answering Mr. Justice Black. 
    I think there's only one question before this Court. 
    If Your Honor, I believe you phrased it in prior argument, the only ruling made by the Texas Supreme Court which is the law of this case. 
    And if that be a final judgment, then so it be. 
    And that is the one question for decision here and we believe the only question. 
    The one holding that's the law of this case. 
    We disagree with the judgment of the trial court in its requirement that Midland County be redistricted into commissioners precincts solely upon the basis on population. 
    That is what I've tried to get over. 
    That's --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What you're saying then and what goes by that order that is with this testimony procedure would made this and he gave him undue credit for and perhaps what the issue before us is whether the Supreme Court's ruling that there may be a variation from a strict population of standard --
speaker="w_b_browder_jr" startTime="5797.744" stopTime="5798.526">
    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr. 
    That is the issue.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- you tell me permissible, I think that is the issue here.
speaker="w_b_browder_jr" startTime="5800.927" stopTime="5928.284">
    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr. 
    Your Honor, let me first say as I've tried to say before as I understood Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    I think the first question that must be decided, will this Court say, the Texas Courts will not follow the law? 
    The Texas trial court or Commissioners Court and the District Court will not follow the Texas Supreme Court. 
    The trial court will permit discrimination. 
    The Texas appellate courts will permit discrimination. 
    Is this Court going to say that first, because you have before you now, not an appeal from any final judgment? 
    You do have before you an appeal from a Texas Supreme Court which we must admit. 
    Thus, make the law of this particular case. 
    So that if the Court wishes to step into this case at this time, which apparently it does having granted the petition. 
    Then the question arises, are we to hold that in every substate government in Texas, every one of the counties in Texas there must be a division solely on equal population? 
    Your Honor, this in Texas in West Texas, we were in the middle of West Texas. 
    We have county after county. 
    We have counties larger than any state. 
    We have counties Brewster County with Alpine as its county seat. 
    The Big Bend Country with their Presidio, the county seat, one town in a county with thousands of miles of ranches and farms. 
    Are we going to say that every one of these counties must be divided with precincts centering in the town, centering in the city because you cannot otherwise divide these counties? 
    Midland County cannot be divided into four precincts of equal population unless you put the center of that division in the City of Midland and let the city, and let everyone of the commissioners. 
    That is what the Texas Supreme Court was talking about, we believe. 
    Your Honor please, let me for just a few remarks --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5928.284" stopTime="5938.715">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    On the other hand, might you not have the situation where one of your billion-acre ranches down there controls the entire county?

    Mr. W. B. Browder, Jr. 
    If you permitted precincts to some extent, yes. 
    But this is safeguard against that and that hasn't been called at this Court's attention. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, you asked the question here earlier, who levies the taxes for the county's business? 
    You we're told that the Commissioners Court had the authority. 
    That is true. 
    You asked, who are handles these salaries finally? 
    I know in the particular at work, this is a Commissioners Court and a system of government of courts, of judicial bodies. 
    Anything the Commissioners Court thus is subject to supervision and control of the District Court. 
    May I elaborate upon that for just a minute? 
    In Texas, we have the Texas Supreme Court and equal with it, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Texas Supreme Court under it, our Courts of Civil Appeals, 16 or 18 of them. 
    Under that, we have the District Court such as a trial court or the Circuit Court in so many States. 
    But under Article V, Section 8 of the Texas Constitution, the District Court is given supervision and control over the Commissioners Court. 
    The same article of our Constitution sets up the Commissioners Court which has many judicial functions, many judicial functions.

    But the Court said this day that this is not a legislative board, if that makes the difference. 
    We believe it does. 
    Let me go to one other point. 
    You were told that this Court had legislative functions because it divided the county or could divide the county into four precincts. 
    To me this is a judicial function. 
    No better proofs of the control of the people have than this very redistricting or districting of the county. 
    This county was redistricted and a direct appeal to the District Court, the district judge elected by the people throughout the county. 
    These are set up in Texas is for all the people of the county. 
    The city runs nine-tenths of the election votes now. 
    Under the Texas law, you have as the arm of the state the county and its officers. 
    You have the district judge, elected countywide.

    But more important, Your Honor, in a county where you have a city such as Midland, where there are 60,000 people, 50,000, 40,000 votes. 
    There is a great weight on any of these Commissioners.

    You talk about the Commissioners Court having authority.

    I meant that he has failed to show discrimination and that this case is ordered back to the trial court to divide without discrimination. 
    That's where it is but, I added this. 
    And we must admit this opinion by the Texas Supreme Court will be the law of the case in the trial court. 
    So the law of the case as made by the Texas Supreme Court is you will consider this population. 
    You will consider the states -- the United States Constitution. 
    But you do not have to be confined to this straitjacket of dividing solely on equal population. 
    Now, petitioner says that has discrimination. 
    Petitioner must take the position that is itself invidious discrimination unless you will give division on equal population alone, as a matter of law you have invidious discrimination.

   Argument of F. H. Pannill
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6949.654" stopTime="6950.684">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Pannill.
speaker="f_h_pannill" startTime="6950.684" stopTime="7225.428">
    Mr. F. H. Pannill 
    Mr. Chief Justice Warren, and may it please the Court. 
    We would consider ourselves remiss and our duties as counsel here, if we failed to call the Court's attention to two things, the causal relationship or connection between them being for the Court to determine. 
    One is that in the way the American System of Government is structured. 
    There is a special relationship between the states and a county such as Midland County which is a political subdivision of and a creature of the state and its legislature or other municipal corporations. 
    The other is that the United States Constitution is applied differently to local governmental subdivisions and municipal corporations than to individuals or private corporations. 
    Now, I make those two statements as a matter of fact as to what the structure of the United States Government is and as to what this Court in past opinions has held. 
    It has been recognized by this Court from its earliest history that governmental subdivisions and municipal corporations are creatures of and agents of the state, created by it for the purpose of carrying out and effectuating its law. 
    There are administrative agencies or enforcement agencies they have been created by the states for that purpose. 
    The states which create these governmental subdivisions and within the other local governmental agencies have power over them which is virtually complete and except, and unless, and until of course, such power is exercised in a way as to run counter to some plainly written and established federal constitutional prohibitions. 
    Specifically, a government -- a state would have the power and its will or wish or whim to abolish a municipal corporation or a county, or to divide it into two or to consolidate and merge it. 
    But certainly under the decisions of this Court, a state could not exercise that power in such a way as to leave its creditors high and dry because that would run counter to and bring the states actually in conflict with the Contract Clause, likewise as in the case of Gomillion versus Lightfoot, which is cited with some degree of relish by petitioner in this brief. 
    Admittedly, a state may not exercise this control which it has over its municipal corporations and its governmental subdivisions, in such a way as to run counter two the Fifteenth Amendment and bring in about a discrimination in voting based on race. 
    But subject to those specific constitutional restraints, the states have plenary power over their municipal corporation and likewise over the officials who served those corporations. 
    There are decisions which we have cited in this brief to the effect that the states have the power in the federal system to provide such officers and officials as they may choose. 
    To confer on these officers and officials, such power as the state chooses to give them or to take that power away to provide that they may be selected by appointment or by election, or by combination of both. 
    Or the states have power to abolish these officers all together.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is it your points insofar as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment goes in this area that so long as you have a legislature, apportioned in accord with the rule of Reynolds against Sims, then is the constitutional matter that legislature can be entrusted. 
    That legislature responsive as it is to the people proportionally and equally. 
    It can be trusted constitutionally to delegate its power such part of its power wherever it wants to. 
    Does that it -- that if the majority of the people in Texas with a precisely apportioned legislature in accordance of Reynolds against Sims want to give to each of these 254 counties this that of the other power, they can constitutionally do so and they can constitutionally take it away, and can be trusted to take it away with the legislature responsive to the rule Reynolds against Sims?

    Mr. F. H. Pannill

    It may be essentially here play on words to say whether or not, to say that the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution does not apply or that it does apply but it applies in a way which is so different from its application to state governments and the individuals that this particular case or the particular decision and action of the State of Texas in this case is supported. 
    For instance, I would say this, this Court has established many times and as recently as last term in the Sailors case that local governmental official may be chosen by appointment and it has said that in here as I read and understand that opinion that that power of appointment of the State of Michigan can be delegated. 
    And can be delegated to groups or voters and can be delegated to groups or voters which differ from each other markedly and materially in population, in numerical context.

    Well, the problem -- well, the problem is about this argument as I see it is that this Commissioners Courts are not to create creature of the legislature but that the creature of the Constitution. 
    And your State Constitution creates this Commissioners Courts and it's in your State Constitution says that they should be divided into precincts and that State Constitution says, they should be divided at the four commissioners precincts. 
    And the State Constitution as your legislature says that, the divisions of the precinct shall be made by the Commissioners Court after legislature. 
    I suppose as far as the legislature however ultimately apportioned it might be does not have the power to overrule the Commissioners Court decision with respect to the definition or division of the county and the precincts.

    One kind of a county --

    Mr. F. H. Pannill 
    -- unequally populated districts. 
    And that leads me to the conclusion stated here previously and that is that under these decisions as I read the Equal Protection Clause applies differently to local governmental subdivisions. 
    Now, whether you say it applies or but allows a more latitude and allows more getting of greater weight in consideration to such factors as geography and roads which are not proper factors to be considered in a legislative district in case. 
    Or whether you say that it just doesn't apply to the elections at all, it seems to me that in the context of this particular case -- just a different way of saying the same thing.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="8257.186" stopTime="8282.205">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How could we say that the logic or reasoning, maybe we could but how could we that you must apply that rule with the election of the governor. 
    You must apply to the election of a senator or a congressman but you need not apply to the election of local officials that touched the lives of the people and that this might as the larger officials?
speaker="f_h_pannill" startTime="8282.205" stopTime="8432.098">
    Mr. F. H. Pannill 
    You could apply, Your Honor, logically and rationally in this way, that we have at the basis of our entire governmental system, the doctrine that the ultimate sovereign power is reposed in the people. 
    And that each person, each citizen, exercises certain rights of sovereign -- sovereignty in proper times and in proper ways. 
    At the same time, the same citizen is a subject or subject to the laws and rules, and regulations of the state which he has created to carry out his sovereignty. 
    And so that when a citizen actually in a dual capacity, he is sovereign and he is also a subject and that when he votes, he very well may vote in one capacity and not in the other. 
    And that when -- and in the voting cases which this Court has considered up until this time, concern only state officials who exercise the inherent sovereign power of the state. 
    And that when a citizen is acting as a sovereign and voting for someone who is a state official, and who has inherent sovereign power, then he must be permitted to exercise his pro rata part of the sovereign power and if he is not permitted, he is denied equal protection. 
    When that same citizen cast a vote in a bond election or a school board election, or a county commissioners court election, then that same citizen is that -- that entity is not a sovereign. 
    And as to that entity, he is not exercising his sovereign power. 
    He is choosing an official which could well be chosen in some other ways. 
    He is merely acting as a good citizen and selecting an official who is to perform a subordinate and inferior function. 
    And that if you give him less then his pro rata part of the vote there you have not entailed his exercise of his basic citizen sovereign power. 
    It can in my mind be rationalized in that way.

    Mr. F. H. Pannill 
    Well, it might go to the point beyond that, Mr. Justice Black because as I understand this argument on the part of the petitioners and on the part of the Government, they admit that there are some governmental subdivisions and agencies which are not subject to this so-called one man one vote rule. 
    The petitioner's brief, as I read it, against the jury of distinction between legislative and administrative officials or districts, or powers, and attempts to establish that this particular one is exercising legislative power. 
    The Government in its brief, it attempts to draw it at some kind of a distinction between a general purpose and special purpose districts. 
    But this whole case has been submitted to this Court on the agreement as I comprehend the position of the party, it's attached to the agreement that there is a point in local government to which this so-called one man, one vote rule does not extend.

    Special purpose districts such as water conservation districts or something like that and draws the line to the effect that where you have a group of citizens which has a special interest or is particularly affected by the action of that government, then considerations other than population would be predominant.

    That probably would be the most in numerous type of district that there is with this Court last term had a school district when you had taxing power.

    What would you do about the city council of a -- say New York City and suppose it has a counsel or Los Angeles with budget in billions in dollars ordinance making power, police force, how to determine where the people or instead liberty or to go to jail within certain restrictions and in effect, perhaps, it would be unfair to say the powers of state legislature on the small scale in a restricted area. 
    Do you think that that fits within your category of state legislature for this purpose or is it something that this doctrine of our cases should not reach?

    Mr. F. H. Pannill 
    I would say that the argument which I have made couldn't be made to sustain and unequally apportion council in that type of government. 
    I would hasten to add that I do not represent that this Court's decision in this case is made to depend upon on this argument which I am making. 
    We are here resisting the relief which this petitioner seeks. 
    And we resisted on whatever grounds we may reasonably argue. 
    If this Court in its wisdom choses to draw a distinction between legislative and administrative functions or districts, then we would say that we are exempt or immune, if you please, under that exception or distinction because we do not have a legislative district.

    Yes sir, I submit that the cases as decided have been divided along that line and that they may rationally be divided along that line for the reasons which I here suggest and present to the Court. 
    There has been a suggestion here as to a policy argument. 
    We would call the Court's attention to the fact that we had refrained from giving any policy arguments basing off – base on the type of -- or the amount of litigation which may result from this. 
    We have kept ourselves above that. 
    There is a policy argument which I believe applies to that and it simply is this, that a citizen's right to participate in the creation or making of the law is not the same as his right to participate in the administration of the law. 
    The policy which I suggest and argue to Your Honors on -- in this particular case is simply one which would ask this Court not to, at the request of individual citizens, insert this doctrine into administrative functions of local officials contrary to a state's own determination as to their distribution and the distribution of their powers, and the manner of their selection where there has been no showing of any independently existing basic constitutional rights of the petitioner having been valid.
