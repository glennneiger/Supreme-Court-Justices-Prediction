    Mr. Marvin E. Pollock 
    May it please the Court. 
    The issue in this case is where a consonant with the religious clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
    The State of New York may furnish textbooks purchased with tax raised funds for use in religious schools. 
    The material facts in the case are not in dispute. 
    Prior to 1965, Section 701 of the New York Education law, authorized local school boards to purchase textbooks and either to loan or sell them to pupils in the public schools in the state. 
    In 1965, the provisions relating to textbooks in Section 701 were amended effective September 1, 1966. 
    The effect of the amendment was to turn a permissive practice into a mandatory one and to extend the coverage of the law to private schools. 
    Under the law as amended, each school board in New York must purchase and long free of charge to all children residing in its district enrolled in a grade from 7 through 12 of an accredited public or private school any textbook requested by the child so long as the textbook was one designated for use in any public school in the state or by any school board in the state. 
    As originally enacted, the law contained no limit on the number of books required to be purchased and no limit on the amount of money that had to be spent for the books by the local school district. 
    It did however provide for state reimbursement or state allocation to the extent of $10.00 a pupil. 
    In the view of the East Greenbush School Board which had children residing in its district who were enrolled in grade 7 through 12 accredited private religious schools. 
    The provisions of Section 701 as amended violated both the New York State Constitution and the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution both of which each member had sworn to uphold. 
    Failure to implement the law on a part of this board would have subjected the members a removal from office and also would have subjected the school district to a loss of state funds. 
    To resolve this conflict, the Greenbush School Board filed an action in the Supreme Court Albany County. 
    The relief sought in the complaint was a judgment declaring the Textbook Law to the extent that related to church schools unconstitutional and in violation to both the New York State Constitution on the First amendment to the Federal Constitution. 
    It also sought an order in joining the State Commissioner of Education from implementing the provisions of the law.

    Mr. Marvin E. Pollock 
    These boards have raised no constitutional objection. 
    After the suit was filed and the suit incidentally was filed April 29, 1966 which is about four month before the law was to go into effect, after the suit was filed, the Textbook Law was further amended in two respects. 
    The first respect was to reduce the financial book on the local school boards. 
    The second respect was to define a textbook as used in the statute to mean a book which a student is required to use as a text for a semester or more in a school he legally attends.

speaker="marvin_e_pollock" startTime="305.773" stopTime="510.425">
    Mr. Marvin E. Pollock 
    In a school he legally attends. 
    The state answered the complaint, did not raise any material issue of fact but did deny the allegations relating to the unconstitutionality of the law. 
    The state also raised a number of affirmative offenses, principal one of which was that the Greenbush School Board lacks standing to sue on the ground that it was an instrumentality of the state and could not challenge State Law. 
    After issue was joined, five parents of children who resided in the East Greenbush School Board were permitted to intervene in the action. 
    In their answer, they too did not raise any material issue of fact but did deny the allegations of unconstitutionality of the law. 
    And in addition, they raised a number of affirmative defenses. 
    The thrust of these defenses was that to deny the books to them and their children while permitting the furnishing of these books to pupils attending private nonsectarian schools constituted an interference with the free exercise of their religion and a denial of due process and equal protection. 
    All parties then move for judgment. 
    In substance, judgment on the pleading, they were in all affidavits. 
    At the time of oral argument, the Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 3 was joined as a party plaintiff and was deemed to have adopted all the pleadings in the case. 
    The Supreme Court Albany County granted the plaintiff's cross-motion for judgment. 
    It ruled that the Greenbush -- the two school boards had standing to sue, and also that the law as amended in 1965 and in 1966 violated the State Constitution and both the establishment of free exercise clauses of the Federal Constitution and a judgment was entered to that effect which among other things enjoined the state from implementing the statute. 
    An appeal was taken to the Appellant Division, third department. 
    Three of the justices constituting a majority of that court voted to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court Albany County and dismiss the complaint on the sole ground that the appellants lack standing to sue. 
    Two remaining justices would have found that the appellants had standing and would have voted to reverse on the merits. 
    They would have found a law constitutional in all respects. 
    The case was then appealed to the New York Court of Appeals. 
    That court reached the merits of the action. 
    It ruled that the appellants had standing to sue. 
    And by a four-to-three vote, it ruled that the Textbook Law as amended did not violate State Constitution, did not violate the establishment clause of the Federal Constitution. 
    Approximately 20 years ago, this Court for the first time defined the scope of the establishment clause's coverage.

    And then the Court of Appeals of New York has now availed that the law is constitutional and they can go forward without any danger of sanctions.
speaker="marvin_e_pollock" startTime="624.347" stopTime="665.650">
    Mr. Marvin E. Pollock 
    Well, as far as I can say here, I think if they went ahead and violated the Federal Constitution, it is quite conceivable that they might be subject to other liabilities which have not so far been asserted. 
    I would think that they might have taxpayer cases exposure if they're spending federal funds in violation of the Federal Constitution or spending state funds in violation of the Federal Constitution. 
    So I don't think the case would be at an end on that question. 
    I think that they're not out of the dilemma yet and I would think that if -- until the federal question was decided, this would be an open question.

    I think that there are people in these school districts who might well attack the active spending funds in violation of the -- of what they deem to be in violation of the Federal Constitution. 
    And that might raise the involved issue again so that they would then be in jeopardy. 
    They would have the same dilemma that is to risk the violation and to spend the funds or not to risk the violation.

    Well, I confess that that bothers me because the statute does read as if the statute says that the textbooks should be those that are designated for use or are approved by any Boards of Education trustees or other school authorities. 
    It might make substantial difference in this case if the parochial schools have the power to designate the textbooks, secular textbooks that are then purchased by the state funds.

    Mr. Marvin E. Pollock 
    Well, prescribed by the public authorities, but I have argued that the public authorities in many cases consist of a Board of Education elected by the residence of the particular school district and in some cases, I think where -- particularly where some religious group has let's say an ethnic majority, they do have power to elect the people to the board who are more prone to follow their views. 
    And once this board is elected and does have the power to designate books, it would not be unusual to have these books. 
    These boards designate books which are not contrary to the face which they hold. 
    I think to that extent, you have some involvement or some possibility of involvement. 
    So whether the books are designated by a public authority, the public authority itself is made up of people.

    Mr. Marvin E. Pollock 
    I take it that there is a question in my mind, and I don't know that anybody can solve it by even going to the construction laws to whether or not the books must be designated by a public authority. 
    I think there's some question in the statute and I think even if there is no question, that there is -- the books must be designated for use by a public authority, I think you still have the problem that the public authority could consist of eight Board of Education anywhere in the state who has the right to designate books. 
    And I think I have suggested in my brief that this does make the act susceptible to parochial interference. 
    If a school board is dominated by a faith, it can designate books for use. 
    Then, school boards anywhere else in the state or children anywhere else in the state can order that book. 
    And once the book is on the list --

    That's what I thought.
speaker="marvin_e_pollock" startTime="1619.668" stopTime="1863.359">
    Mr. Marvin E. Pollock 
    In the Everson case, which was decided by this Court 20 years ago, the Court defined the scope of the establishment clause as coverage. 
    The definition consisted of seven sentences that appears at 330 US 15 and is quoted at page 10 of appellant's brief. 
    One of the sentences reads that no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions whatever they may be called or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. 
    While four justices in that case disagreed with the application of that definition to the facts of Everson, all of the justices agreed with the definition, and the definition has been repeated and reaffirmed at least three times, once unanimously until a Castle against Watkins in 1961. 
    In applying the Everson definition to the facts of the case, the majority started out by saying that state legislation should not be overturned if it was within the state's constitutional power even though it approached the verge of that power. 
    Said on the one hand New Jersey could not, consistent with the establishment clause, contribute tax funds for the support of any religious institution which teaches the tenants in faiths of any church. 
    Presumably here, it had in mind church schools. 
    On the other hand, New Jersey could not interfere with the free exercise of religion by their citizens such as by excluding believers or non-believers because of their faith or lack of it from the benefits of any welfare legislation. 
    But the issue does pose it remained only for the majority there to determine the nature of the benefit, which was bus transportation, of where and how it was used. 
    And it determined that bus transportation was like certain other government services such as police and fire protection, sewage disposal, streets and highways. 
    The reason that it was no different than these other services the Court suggested was that it was separate and indisputably marked off from the primary function of the school, which was the teaching of religion. 
    In other words, funds, tax funds were not being used by or within the confines of a religious institution in connection with functions associated with religion. 
    Having determined that the funds -- that the benefit was marked off from the religious function, the Court concluded New Jersey did not support religion, although Justice Rutledge agreed to the definition of the scope of the establishment clause, he disagreed with the majority's conclusion that the busing law did not support religion. 
    For him, the primary reason children was sent to a church school was to obtain a religious education. 
    The payment of transportation not only helped them get there and their parents to send them, but it aided them in this objective. 
    And any aid to religion was outlawed and was intended to be outlawed. 
    The dual prohibitions for Justice Rutledge to the first amendment made religion a private matter and it could not be made public by legislation. 
    The question of whether the tax funds or funds were raised for a public purpose was for him a false issue, clouding a real issue of the first amendment span. 
    In summary, Everson said as I read the case that busing or the providing of bus transportation approached the verge of New Jersey's constitutional power but that it was permissible because it was separate and marked off from the religious function of the church school.

    Mr. Marvin E. Pollock 
    I think in this case, a textbook, unlike bus transportation, is not separate and marked off from the primary function of a church school, which is the teaching of religion. 
    The very opposite is true that transportation takes children to the door of a school but textbook aid spills over to the classroom. 
    A textbook is an integral part of the educational process which takes place in a church school.

    They are not connected to the teaching of the tenants of that church which is the primary mission of that school.

    A textbook, unlike a reference book or a book in general is not intended to be used by a student alone as a rule. 
    Its contents cannot be fully utilized until subjected to the interpretation and analysis of a teacher. 
    The book is used in a place where the syllabus that teacher, the curriculum and the whole atmosphere is oriented toward a religious objective. 
    The fact that it's secular makes no difference. 
    It makes no difference because if the states supply desks, blackboards, chairs, or other so-called secular items of education, it would still be aiding in the educational process which takes place in the school. 
    These are other items which are directly related to the educational process taking place in the school.

    I think there are special laws that cover these. 
    I think that any -- I think it's clear where a school is connected with a sect and there may be some cases where it might be difficult to determine whether there is some formal sect in action. 
    But I think in most cases, it isn't, that it's clear that this school is operated as a part of the church.

    Well then why would you say that if a religious school was furnishing free lunches and the state suddenly came along and furnished the free lunches for the children in this religious school, why wouldn't that be bad?

    Mrs. Coon.

    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Initially, I think what I would like to do is to give some observations to some of the questions of this Court which were directed to Mr. Pollock. 
    As to the issue of standing to sue being raised in this Court, no one has raised it. 
    We have considered that the issue withstanding to sue was one of State law. 
    It relates to the peculiar problems and provision of State law and the interpretation which the State Courts have placed upon standing to sue and that the decision by the New York Court of Appeals that under these particular circumstances, the East Greenbush and School Board had standing to sue that it was foreclosed from consideration in this Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2941.838" stopTime="2949.926">

speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="2949.926" stopTime="2961.532">
    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    It's for one of jurisdiction based upon what we felt were prior decisions of this Court which involved not a question -- it was not a question of standing the sue it involved the merits of the sue itself.

speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="2975.228" stopTime="2985.328">
    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    The standing to sue which was raised was standing to sue under state law and now a question of the general right of a taxpayer as may have it raised in this Court.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No, but it wasn't the (Inaudible) that questions standing the sue in New Jersey which New Jersey sustained what this Court said.

    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    Certainly, if this Court were, itself, to consider that standing to sue is a problem of this Court, you certainly decide it on that basis. 
    But the issue that was raised --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    Yes, I believe it was.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3026.867" stopTime="3072.104">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I'm just wondering. 
    In the statement of the case here in the jurisdiction -- statement as to jurisdiction, it's contended that these people were in a dilemma and that they were obliged either to obey the New York law or be subject to sanctions and that's what got them into and still they have the duty to take care of the children now. 
    Your Court of Appeals held that they were no longer in a dilemma. 
    They held that the Act was constitutional and how was that give them standing here?
speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="3072.104" stopTime="3118.238">
    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    Well, I would assume that the initial problem which raised their -- which started the sanction was that the members of the Board themselves, felt that the law was unconstitutional both under the state and Federal Constitutions. 
    And that while the New York Court of Appeals as the final arbiter to the state constitution provisions that they will still consider that there is a question and a dilemma raised for them under the Federal Constitution that if they still believe that the Court of Appeals was an error as to the Federal Constitutional question then and until they got a decision on the merits from this Court, they would still be faced with their own personal dilemma of either refusing to bail a law which they consider it to be unconstitutional federally or face the sanctions of the Education law.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3118.238" stopTime="3154.896">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But the fact is that they state in their statement of jurisdiction that they are in a legal dilemma that they cannot act without subjecting themselves to some kind of sanctions and the New York Court of Appeals has held that they are -- they can be subject to no sanction for the simple reason that the law in which they are obliged to act under the Court of Appeals order is constitutional. 
    So doesn't that quite bother the premise upon which they come to this Court?
speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="3154.896" stopTime="3158.263">

    As to the questions to who designates these books. 
    Mr. Justice Fortas question was one that somewhat a surprise to us because I don't think anyone in New York has ever assume that anyone -- other than the public school officials and public school boards for the final -- once we have the control over the designation of the books.

    -- no, the counsel of the education department like the New York Attorney General would like very much to have his opinions binding but they are entered in an advisory capacity only. 
    The only authority that an opinion of the counsel to the education department has is that it maybe supposed to represent the policy of the education department and the commissioner and therefore in a proceeding before the commissioner to appeal from a determination of a local school board.

    No sir. 
    As far as I know, there is no compilation of these texts. 
    They are determined by individual school boards. 
    Each public school board in the state has the authority to designate the textbooks to be used in that particular school district to public school district and they also, under the statute, approved upon request of the individual students to request additional textbooks which are not authorized -- already designated for use in public schools but may also request that time an additional book which the board may approve or may not approve as it see is fit.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3465.453" stopTime="3535.265">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, let me get clear about this. 
    I'm sorry to take time on this but we have one kind of case here if this statute means in his reply so exclusively with respect to secular books. 
    By that, I mean secular books. 
    I don't mean nonsectarian books. 
    We have another kind of case in my judgment if the statute is used to public funds to purchase either religious books or sectarian -- in the sectarian sense or in a nonsectarian sense but it's still religious books. 
    I think we've got the quite different considerations that apply in those two instances. 
    And so far as I am concerned here as I said here, in the absence of any regulations by the Board of Regents, the situation is far from clear and now, as I understand you, you're telling me that the actual approval of these books is by the local boards of education public bodies, is that right?
speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="3535.265" stopTime="3536.442">

    Yes sir.

    It would only go to the Board of Regents or particularly to the Commissioner of Education if a local taxpayer in one of the school districts disputed a termination of the local school board, possibly someone who objected to a book which they felt was sectarian or religious and nonsectarian sense.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Can you say that there's no way at all for us to have access to a list that shows whether in fact the word textbook in the statute has been construed in its broad sense in which without qualification, it's used in the statute in the sense of nonsectarian as used in the opinion of counsel to the Department of Education or in the still narrow sense of secular as used in the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals.

    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    I don't know whether there has been any list promulgated of any textbooks which they consider subversive or not. 
    I think the question usually arises in relation to a request to the counsel of the education department or an opinion to whether or not a particular textbook is permissible in use or may arise an issue of a taxpayer bringing a proceeding an appeal to the commissioner from a determination of a school board to use a text which they would consider to be subversive.

speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="3920.239" stopTime="3992.451">
    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    It works this way. 
    For the first three years of the statute, the local school board was limited to a requirement that it spend $15.00 per pupil -- not more than $15.00 per pupil and it was entitled to total reimbursement from the state in that amount. 
    The school boards also had the option to provided additional textbooks. 
    Above and beyond is $15.00 limit on which they are reimbursed upon a reimbursement formula which involves total school expenditures related to the tax rolls of the district and so forth which amounts to something less than total reimbursement. 
    In some districts, it amounts to something less than 50% of their school cost and others that maybe as high as 75% to 98% depending upon the economic status of the district itself. 
    The total gives me the figures on total textbook expenditures in 1966, ‘67 for the state was nineteen million and tow hundred and thirteen thousand dollars and this is the total expenditure so far of the product and it was of course initially considered that the initial expenditures in the first few year would be highest because of the fact of the new statute --

    Please the Court. 
    I would like to devote the remaining time to hitting some of the highlights or what we believe are the important things for this Court to consider and to bear in mind to decide in this case. 
    First of all, it is the problem with which New York State was faced and is facing in the time when we adopted the statute. 
    There is an educational crisis developing not just in New York but in this country as a whole and it has developed to the point where not only the local government but also the State and the Federal Government are pouring immense amounts of money into the school systems primarily to help the educationally disadvantaged. 
    The private schools children who are involved in this case are not simply children or parents who can afford to send them to tuition paying schools. 
    There are among them also the educationally disadvantaged. 
    And in this particular instance, New York in deciding that it was important that students in the schools -- the school children of the state have available to them up-to-date textbooks, consider the question of not only to provide them but to whom.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mrs. Coon, one thing that's not entirely clear to me is this. 
    What was the situation before the enactment of this law in 1965? 
    This law as I read it, provides for the furnishing of textbooks to students in both as it says in public or private schools which comply with the Compulsory Education law. 
    Prior to the enactment of this law, were textbooks furnished to students in public schools?

    I suppose I should know by now but I like to ask you this question again. 
    Under this Act, would a religious school have the right to prescribe its own textbooks as long as they were not religious in character according to their appraisal and submit them to the -- those textbooks to the board and then could the board spend public moneys to loan those books to the parochial school children.
speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="4286.751" stopTime="4310.698">
    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    Let me put it this way. 
    That certainly -- any of the school, the parochial school could tell any students what textbooks it wanted them to get. 
    In other words, for this particular course, you're going to want X textbook. 
    And the school child then can fill in a form which he request this of a public school district. 
    Now, the public school district then has two options. 
    One, if this is a book which has been designated for use –

    If it is what?

    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    Designated for use in the public schools by the public school board and then there's no problem about the student getting the book. 
    If it is not then the public school district, the Board of Education district has under this law the option to approve or not to approve that book.

    Our statutory definition is while the statutory definition if you take the preamble of the statute, it refers to nonsectarian textbooks but I think this has been interpreted in the Court of Appeals has interpreted all of these to require secular textbooks in that regard. 
    So that to the extent that over a course of time, it's been highly possible that within the range of a statute be -- with the exception of courses teaching religion that the parochial school children could get all of their textbooks in Grade 7 through 12.

    You would take that educational allowance by having some question of the child was free to buy a religious book with a big amount.
speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="4431.115" stopTime="4444.610">
    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    It might have some problem else, along the same lines of course is the question of a tuition allowance which was raised in Vermont I believe which the students were -- people are using this to attend the religious schools.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4444.610" stopTime="4447.861">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You would suggest the G.I. Bill then may have some question about?
speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="4447.861" stopTime="4563.278">
    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    That if this is -- if this we're going to go in that matter. 
    Now, of course one of the things with G.I. Bill the same thing with New York scholar and set a program, these are open to all students unlike without regard to where they go. 
    The same situation here, the textbooks are available to all children regardless of the school they attend and in that regard, it is not a -- it is a law which does not discriminate between the religion and not religion between the sectarian and nonsectarian schools. 
    It is neutral as between -- not only as between religions but it is between religion and non-religion. 
    How we think to that extent, it means to test them and lay down by this Court in cases like Everson and some of the others. 
    And also of course is I would bring out the secular purpose of providing this means of educating a child, excess of the child through education material in the sense of a textbook. 
    To children regardless of their -- the school they attend that this is a purpose within -- what was in the Sunday closing cases for example is a purpose which is secular in origin and it is a primary purpose of aide to the school child in this particular case of helping him to get a better secular education and not an education sectarian or religious subjects but in those subjects which he needs to enjoy and to further his competitive advantage economically as he gets older and gets out of school. 
    The problem has been pointed out and we've pointed out in our brief. 
    The problem of a child from an economically disadvantage family with several children in school and maybe required to spend $15.00 to $20.00 per child in purchasing textbook but they don't have a their set money for their necessities of life. 
    They certainly don't have the money to spend on textbook and this maybe a cause of a child dropping out of school.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, the term is a very -- that term is not very direct description of the kind of textbooks embraced in the statute.

    Ms. Jean M. Coon 
    I would say this Justice Fortas that if in a relation here that the use of the words here textbooks which are designated for use in any public elementary or secondary schools of the state are approve by any boards of education trustees or the school authorities, meaning public school authorities that this has been interpreted by the administrative agencies in the state of New York and -- New York Court of Appeals, to mean only secular textbooks, in other words, nonreligious textbooks. 
    I think on this basis, I think will leave the rest of the area to Mr. Chandler. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Porter R. Chandler
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="4716.090" stopTime="4717.495">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    May it please the Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4717.495" stopTime="4718.838">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Chandler.
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="4718.838" stopTime="4811.464">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    Picking up for a moment what Mrs. Coon has just said, the question that Mr. Justice Fortas has been concerned about. 
    The statute does not say specifically what kind of books they are to be but the statute has been conclusively construed by the Court of Appeals of New York as requiring secular textbooks and that interpretation arises out of the long history of New York under which public schools are not supposed to teach religion and are supposed to confine themselves to secular education. 
    I must remind the Court also that this case comes here on an attack on the whole statute without regard to its administration, without regard to particular books, the position of opposing counsel is quite flat that this statute is bad on its face. 
    It is so bad that no amount of good administration could make it better or save it. 
    It is so bad that no amount of maladministration could make it worse and there is no distinction raised between this book and that book in our friend's complaint. 
    The attack is on all books and the secular definition comes out of the long experience of New York which is taken for granted that the public schools should not teach religion and should not buy religious books.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4811.464" stopTime="4816.725">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That long experience has been with respect to public education and not parochial.
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="4816.725" stopTime="4939.508">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    That's right but the theme of this law is that the book that are to be provided are books uphold by public school authorities on the same standard that the public schools have been using for a long time. 
    Take the illustration that one of the other judges may have mentioned a particular school district, let us suppose somewhere, goes crazy and decides they want to put a course of religion. 
    In the public schools and take a district where there is no private school in the area. 
    The public school district decides, we will have religious courses in the public schools and they start ordering religious books. 
    That immediate result would be that any taxpayer in the district could stop it by a court proceeding. 
    If you didn't like a court proceeding, you could stop it by an appeal to the Commissioner of Education and the Commissioner of Education has very broad powers of the school districts. 
    He has not hesitated to use them in the field of religion. 
    Let me give you a couple of instances. 
    The Commissioner of Education of New York on his own authority banned the on premises release time, religious education before this Court ever had the McCollum case following Engel versus Vitale, the Commissioner of Education took very strong action on so called religious practices. 
    He even forbid the use in the public schools of the last stanza of the Stars Spangled Banner when it was being sang under circumstances that gave it a religious rather than a patriotic connotation so that the idea that a particular school district is to act as a rubber stamp for parochial school and order all kinds of religious textbooks is an idea -- a divorce from reality and divorce from the practicality of the situation that any such action would be amount claim a piece of maladministration under the Act and it would be very instantly crack down upon by the Commissioner or by the New York courts.

    But even if it weren't I suppose that even if the statute were sustained that specific practice could be attack in the constitution.

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    Yeah, I'm glad Your Honor asked that question.

    Yes.

speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="4996.790" stopTime="5001.270">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    There's no evidence or claim that that happens anywhere in the state.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if it did? 
    You wouldn't --
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="5002.632" stopTime="5023.865">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    I don't think it would -- I think it would be a matter of -- well, first of speculations of facts not shown on this record and I suppose that if a public school -- I would say that if a public school, a parochial school had been furnishing textbooks to children that the children in that school would still be covered by this law and would be entitled to get it. 
    I am --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5023.865" stopTime="5025.841">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You would say that it was wholly valid.
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="5025.841" stopTime="5149.620">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    I would say it was valid but I add that in this particular case and as far as we know towards the general practice throughout the state has been that the parent individually pays the bill for the textbooks. 
    It's un-contradicted on this record that that is the situation. 
    Now, questions asked earlier in the argument, I think had been laid at rest, the language of the statute about other approval by other school authorities. 
    I emphasize that school authorities is a word of art. 
    It has been specifically defined in Section 2 of the Education law which covers all succeeding sections. 
    May I have that Section? 
    I'll read it again. 
    The term school authorities means the trustees or a Board of Education or corresponding officers whether one or more and by whatever name known of a city school district or other school district, however, created plainly a reference to public authorities and the reason they have that catchall phrase is because in New York, we have a number of school districts with a vastly varying terminology. 
    We have urban school districts, we have rural school districts, we have united school districts, we have common school districts, we have high school districts and a whole series of districts with various names and this catchall phrase refers to authorities of a school district however created. 
    We have special situations for example a reform school. 
    In a reform school, the superintendent of the school is vested by law with the powers of the local Board of Education. 
    He is the Board of Education for a reform school, the same thing with other school for handicapped and so on. 
    The terminology in New York is greatly confused --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5149.620" stopTime="5155.463">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is the entire area of New York covered by at least one school district?
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="5155.463" stopTime="5156.636">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    Yes it is. 
    I think yes it is.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5156.636" stopTime="5157.974">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is there a school district covering it --
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="5157.974" stopTime="5229.662">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    There's a school district with widely varying terminology covering the entire state, yes. 
    There are school district, there's not one -- all districts under the supervision of the Board of Regents. 
    Sorry, I mislaid one piece of notes. 
    Now, as to the question -- as to the list of books as Mrs. Coon pointed out the basic fact to New York State is that there is not a statewide approved list. 
    The list of books depends upon the particular district. 
    Perhaps, the most all embracing one is the official list that has been got out by the City of New York that's referred to in our brief and some illustrations are given and it would be of any concern or interest to the court. 
    I can have copies of the New York list furnished. 
    That is a very widespread --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5229.662" stopTime="5234.525">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you know what percent of the books on that list are actually used in the public schools?
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="5234.525" stopTime="5235.960">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    No sir, I don't.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5235.960" stopTime="5237.424">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The small percent of schools.
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="5237.424" stopTime="5249.229">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    Your Honor, this is the public school list -- what percentage. 
    This is the list of books prescribed by the New York public school board for use in the public schools -- for use in the public schools of New York.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5249.229" stopTime="5256.409">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So this doesn't include the least that they approve for parochial schools with the public school list.
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="5256.409" stopTime="5266.666">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    The parochial schools I think in almost every instance withdraw from that list unless there were some very special reason. 
    Now, the reason, among the reasons by the way for --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5266.666" stopTime="5273.802">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, these are books that are approved for use in public schools, but maybe not that any of them were used.
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="5273.802" stopTime="5293.326">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    This is the list from which any local school board of New York can order and from which by the same token, any local parochial schools stood in order and it will be approved automatically without checking to see whether the book is on the list and a mention is made at page --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5293.326" stopTime="5298.669">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    To what extent can they add books in that list for parochial schools?
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="5298.669" stopTime="5471.884">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    If the list. 
    If the book -- there is no special parochial school list that the parochial school felt that it wanted some books that might not be on that list. 
    It could ask for them. 
    The local school board would then decide whether to approve it or not and the local school board would have as one major guideline is the book a secular book or does it have any religious training in it. 
    Illustrations of why a local school board books might not be required -- might not precisely fit on parochial school with this. 
    Let's suppose the only local public high school in the district has classes in French but not in German. 
    The parochial high school would like to get German textbooks. 
    The next school district up the line where the public high school does teach German will have German books. 
    What would be more natural or easier than for the public school book -- private school pupils to say that we like the German books that are used up to the line, you haven't got any available here. 
    The obligation to furnish the books is on the -- another reason. 
    The obligation to furnish books is on the district in which the child resides not on the district where he goes to school. 
    That is illustrated in the cases of my client's children. 
    They leave in East Greenbush. 
    There is no catholic high school in East Greenbush. 
    Those are my clients children and there are a couple of them who are going to catholic high schools, consequently, have to go to the next district which maybe either across the river to Albany or to the town of Rensselaer and they go -- they will want high school books corresponding to the ones that are used in the public schools in Albany and Rensselaer, the districts which they attend school which is not necessarily the same district in which they reside and there's the district in which they reside that has the obligation to furnishing the books. 
    The approval of other school authorities by the way, I advice one reason why I've got into that statute in the term of what it did was that the draftsman of the New York statute wanted to conform the language to the contemporaneously enacted federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act which presents problems quite analogous to this and Your Honors will find them that rather the luminous pile of briefs before you, a brief fro the Solicitor General of the United States dealing with this case and its relation to some extent with Title II of the Federal Act which also provides textbook of service for children in all schools.

    There are of course here three classes of schools that are enrolled and we mustn't forget the three classes. 
    They are the public schools, there are the private schools that do not teach religion and there are the private schools that do teach religion and the attack on constitutionality here is based solely on the furnishing of books to the third class of students. 
    There is no objection in furnishing them free in the public schools. 
    There is no objection to furnishing them free to children in the private schools so long as the private school doesn't teach religion.

    When I get through perhaps because I haven't done something further. 
    All education, public and private in New York State is under the very broad powers of the regents. 
    Their basic statute describes them as having legislative functions. 
    They are -- they rule over institution which is highly misnamed as the University of the State of New York. 
    Now the University of the State of New York has been in existence since 1784, no campus, no students, nothing that an ordinary university has. 
    It is by definition includes all the educational institutions public and private within the state and such allied institutions is libraries and so forth. 
    The schools have to be charted by the Board of Regents. 
    There are subject of hesitation by the regents. 
    Catholic schools have to be charted by the regents. 
    They are subject to visitation by the regents. 
    The curriculum as described in great detail.Perhaps the most startling illustration that I can give you Your Honor is this. 
    These students and let us say a Catholic school. 
    They draw down these books from the publics -- of the public school tithe and they use them to study courses prescribed by the regents. 
    When they get through -- I'm referring to pupils in a catholic school. 
    They take an examination. 
    Who sets the examination? 
    The regents. 
    If they pass, they get a diploma. 
    Whose diploma do they get? 
    The diploma signed by church authorities? 
    No. 
    They get a diploma in the name of the University of the State of New York bearing the seal of the education department signed by the Commissioner of Education.

    My brother Pollock talks about the parochial school being practically a seminary of religion and nothing else.

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    And I don't think there's anything ideological about a book called Hallet's Machine Shop Practice which is one of the books that is approved for use in the public schools of New York and which probably becomes bad the minute it is used by a parochial school student. 
    I'd like to take just two minutes remaining. 
    My friends have talked about the Establishment Clause. 
    They did not raise the Free Exercise Clause in their complaint below at all. 
    They have raised in their brief here and in closing, I simply want to remind the Court of the fact that what they are seeking to do is to single out that the bar from the benefits of this one -- of this broad general welfare statute, one particular class of children and to bar them on the ground, the sole ground of the religious nature of the school which they attend. 
    I suggest that the only Free Exercise question involved in this case is the Free Exercise question which they have raised by such a type of discrimination and which runs squarely into the language of Everson that the Court in regarding against the Establishment Clauses must see to it that it does not prevent a state from extending the benefits of a broad general welfare statute to all people whether they be Mohammed, Lutherans, Jews or others.

    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    No sir. 
    I think -- I must clear that out. 
    I take the line that the court took in Everson, the state can if it wishes confine the benefits to public school children.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, how can they enter the Free Exercise?
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="6438.730" stopTime="6486.481">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    The court said in Everson that that could be done but then I say that if the court goes outside there as it did here and extends the benefit to all children then there's always carrying it to all children that cannot exclude one particular task, the religious ones and while still going on to give the same books to show the attending non-religious private schools. 
    The New Jersey statute would have been plainly wrong if it said, buses are alright for children going to public schools and to private schools as long as they don't teach religion. 
    The statute would be all wrong if each had buses maybe descent, buses maybe used or books maybe used to children in public schools and parochial schools leaving out the private ones.

speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="6488.489" stopTime="6493.983">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    I rely very much so on Sherbet v. Verner and I cited in that section of our brief.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6493.983" stopTime="6505.433">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes but Sherbet would more support the idea that New York was violating the constitution before this law passed.
speaker="porter_r_chandler" startTime="6505.433" stopTime="6584.344">
    Mr. Porter R. Chandler 
    I wouldn't -- by providing it only for public schools. 
    I wasn't taken out sir under the Everson doctrine and I don't think that Sherbet would affect that. 
    I think New York's actions quite constitutional. 
    Incidentally, one more thing that I forgot to mention, to correct the New York law as it was before 1935, New York did have a law in 1934 which provided free textbooks for everybody along with transportation, clothing and shoes, provided that the child's parents were indigent and the Attorney General of New York handed down an opinion that that applied to parochial school children. 
    So if my friend is correct and if he wins here, he will stricken out the provision of the 1965 Act but left the 1934 one standing so that according to that construction, a child who goes to a public school gets free books whether he is rich or poor. 
    A child who goes to a private school that doesn't teach religion gets free books whether he is rich or poor. 
    A child that goes to a religious school will go on getting free books provided that he can prove that his family is on relief. 
    In that I submit rather serious questions of equal protection and free exercise.

    It's been -- argument about mathematics. 
    They may well be a distinction but my only answer to that would be that when you're faced to the facts in that situation, the thing is to see whether it squares with the dual test that this Court laid down in Schemp. 
    A primary secular purpose that in effect which neither advances nor inhibits religion, if it meets that test as we think this program does then it would be alright.

    There are three classes of such schools. 
    There are the public schools, there are the private schools that don't teach religion and it's still complying with the compulsory education law, and there are the private schools that do teach religion.

    That is the only attack that is being made here. 
    The statute -- my friend is attacking only the distribution of books to children in church schools. 
    He is not attacking the delivery of such books to children in other private schools.

   Rebuttal of Marvin E. Pollock

    Mr. Pollock.
speaker="marvin_e_pollock" startTime="6757.597" stopTime="6953.065">
    Mr. Marvin E. Pollock 
    Your Honor. 
    In this dissenting opinion in Everson, Justice Jackson set forth the cannonball of the church relating to Catholic schools by which all Catholics were bound so far as I know, these are still the cannonball of the church relating to church schools. 
    One of those cannons reads as follows. 
    Catholic children are to be educated at schools where not only nothing contrary to catholic faith and morals is thought but rather in schools where religious and world training occupy the first place. 
    I like to comment too on something that Mrs. Coon said having to do with the pupil request under the statute of the pupil that requested the books. 
    The way the statute is first written. 
    It did not contain the definition of textbooks and requested one would have to ask is what role can a 12-year-old play the selection of books which he's going to use it in school. 
    The way the statute read then, it would have to be argued that the student could go to the school board and ask for any book and any number of books so long as they were books designated for use. 
    But the statute was amended to make clear that the only book as student could request is one which is legally required to use as a text for a semester more in a school he legally attends making it absolutely clear that it is this school that is ordering the books. 
    In conclusion, I would like to say briefly that there are many advocates of aide to parochial school who seek to further purely the religious objectives by masking their appeal for funds in the rectory for public purpose. 
    Thus, their appeals many times are wrapped in the mantle of the educational problem or poverty problem. 
    While no one would dispute the need for these programs, we must be careful not to sacrifice constitutional principles in the process. 
    The principle in church and state separate has served this nation well attesting to the wisdom of those who fought hardest for its acceptance in our constitution. 
    It is part of our fabric not because we paid the lip service but because we continue to give it vitality. 
    We should not permit the principle to be eroded by mouthing its words while stripping it of all significance. 
    I submit that this Court should rule that the furnishing of textbooks by the state of New York with funds raised by taxation constitutes a use of state funds to a religion in violation of the First Amendment. 
    Thank you.
