   Argument of John Caughlan
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="9.944" stopTime="14.504">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="14.504" stopTime="313.388">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the members of the Court. 
    Mr. Schroeter yesterday outlined the basic societal values which we believe are at stake in this case. 
    First, the primacy of the individual embodied in concepts, including the First Amendment; secondly, the fairness of governmental procedures embodied in concepts in the Constitution which include the Fifth Amendment. 
    One additional one should be added to that and that is the guarantee of governmental integrity which is embodied in the concept of the separation of powers in the Constitution. 
    We feel that this is based upon fundamentally the societal understanding that man is fallible, that power corrupts, and consequently includes basic principles such as the division of the three branches of government and specific provision of the Constitution including bills of attainder, a prohibition against them, recognizing that judicial process should govern any question of punishment. 
    The civilian control of the military because men trained in authority can sometimes to be insensitive to the relationship of the individual in exercise of their rights that we cherish. 
    And finally, that the power of the governments may not be delegated one to another and that legislative enactments and administrative rules carrying out those enactments must have the clarity and precision particularly in relations in touching upon these other fundamental rights, so that the individual can understand and that the democratic values of society maybe preserved. 
    With respect to the last, we believe that the regulations in the Act which is before the Court fails in every particular and has the fatal vice of vagueness which this Court has spoken off in many recent decisions. 
    The regulations which I wish briefly again to refer to Mr. Schroeter did yesterday, the regulations, first of all, and these appear in our brief on page A14, the ones that I'm about to refer to, provide that at every stage of the proceeding in determination of an applicant to a Coast Guard whether he can receive special validation, the Commandant must be satisfied, that his character and habits of life justify beliefs that he will not be inimical to security. 
    That's -- an additional regulation provides that if the inquires that the Commandant makes of any applicant are in any way incomplete, that the Commandant may obtain under oath additional information. 
    And finally on page A14 Regulation 12105 (d) (2) that if any applicant fails to furnish such additional information that the Commandant may require, he may hold the application totally in abeyance. 
    This is the situation which we have here that no further action would be taken and in each case that the mandatory criteria which may preclude satisfaction includes the satisfaction of the Commandant, the absolute authority in him to determine that the individual is not inimical. 
    Now, under this procedure Mr. Schneider was submitted a questionnaire which was referred to yesterday which required him in effect to construct his own loyalty oath, that is to set forth in detail his association with every organization on the Attorney General's list, to set forth in detail his activities, his reading, in connection with the People's World, and to detail his present attitude to --

    Mr. John Caughlan 
    I do not believe that it was officially sponsored by the Communist Party. 
    I think generally, it is regarded as expressing the Communist Party point of view. 
    His present attitude towards the Communist Party was one of the things it would require and their principles, his attitude or the principles and objectives of that party, his attitude towards the form of the government of the United States. 
    For the reasons that are already been stated to this Court, Mr. Schneider having and feeling it was impossible to have an idea of what was required, refused under penalty of perjury to construct in effect this loyalty oath.

    I couldn't imagine Your Honor. 
    It seem to me that it would be impossible for anyone who read a paper to set this forth in any reasonable length of time especially during periods of daily paper and even after that. 
    So, I would believe Mr. Justice Black that this wouldn't virtually be impossible for anyone to answer.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="430.111" stopTime="435.179">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How many volumes, do you think [Inaudible]
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="435.179" stopTime="738.410">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    The Paper itself has 15 to 20 volumes, of thick ones and I just can't imagine how long it would take it, I believe it would be impossible. 
    Although this question -- these inquiries appeared in the guise of a questionnaire, we feel that they are indistinguishable in the inner impact and effect from the construction of a loyalty oath. 
    And indeed a loyalty oath that is far broader than anything has ever come before this Court which has been considered in the teacher-public-employee cases, the oath required public workers and has been denounced in the line of decisions which extend from Cramp to Shelton, although that is a slightly different type of oath, to Baggett, to Elfbrandt, to Keyishian, and the case decided this term Whitehill versus Elkins. 
    The underlying purpose, it seems to us of each of these procedures, the questionnaire we have in this case, the teachers and public employee oath that we have in the other cases is an attempt on the part of perhaps well meaning that we believe misguided public officials and legislatures to weed out dissidents, persons who disagree or wish to disagree with the status quo. 
    It's no accident, we think that in each one of the cases that have come before the Court, these had been answered previously, the actions had been instituted by teachers who are sincere and thoughtful people and have opportunity and time and consideration to understand the full implications of this oath. 
    And perhaps it's no accident that this comes up before -- this case come before the Court from a seaman who we believe is unquestionably sincere also, but who is not in the status of a teacher who wished to sail and who therefore attempted his best to meet the initial procedures until he has submitted the questionnaire which is before the Court. 
    But as this pointed out by Mr. Justice Douglas in the Elfbrandt case, it is the sincere, the persons of integrity who do bring these cases who needs oath to effect because others can construct their answer false oath or they do not have the sort of integrity and sincerity which is required, or which persons who present the issue for public consideration and consideration by this Court. 
    But it's precisely the same compelled conformity which is before the Court in every instance, and here we have clearly a situation where the interrogatory procedure takes the place of the oath procedure in the teacher cases, where the determination here is whether, if I can put it this way, the applicant to the Coast Guard's point of view has what we would call a bad First Amendment character because of his associations, because of his reading, and because of his attitudes. 
    Therefore, we feel that the statement ultimately made by this Court last Monday, in the decision to the Robel case, is particularly applicable here that it would be ironic if the name of National Defense, we would sanction subversion of those liberties which we cherished and which make the defense of the nation worthwhile. 
    And these points to the origin of the vagueness which is before this Court which is found in the Magnuson Act itself because the Magnuson Act authorizes, in it's principle amendment to previous legislation, was to authorize rules and regulations, to authorize procedures by the President when he found that the country was endangered by subversive activity or subversion. 
    This word itself as indicated by its use in the Robel decision is a word of the widest meaning, generally it means bad politics, bad from who's point of view, bad in that it may subvert constitutional principle, bad in someone else's mind because subversion may mean refusal to conform to the status quo.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    [Voice Overlap] to what extent the government is relying in the Attorney General's list in this case?
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="790.750" stopTime="902.555">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    The government relies on the position that the -- Mr. Justice Black that the -- basically, that the applicant must answer the questions, but under the regulations, the questions must include answers to membership in each one of the 280 and more organizations that are on the Attorney General's list. 
    And in this amplified by the interrogatories which require the applicant to explain in detail his relationship to any organization which he belongs and I might add in this case, this includes on the Attorney General's list which had promulgated long after some of the organizations to my knowledge had become defunct such as the Washington Common Law Federation which in the State of Washington if one were to include sympathetic associates of that, would include most of the public officials during one period of time or many of them, most of the democratic officials that included such organizations as the labor schools, the Seattle Labor School, the North Pacific Northwest Labor School which was facultied by numerous teachers at the University of Washington, it includes the Harry Bridges' defense committee which presumably ceased to exist after his defense became unnecessary. 
    But these all appear on the list along with many, many other organizations and I would assume that in most of these cases, the applicant in this case who is an alert person and was aligned during the period of time when this happen, must have had not only membership, but sympathetic association, affiliation or even sympathetic association with these organization which is also included.

    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Well, we -- in addition Your Honor to the vagueness argument which we're making at the present time, we also wish to discuss the list as used in this case and on its face as a plain bill of attainder which we believe was the position that Your Honor took about in the Joint Anti-Fascist case. 
    We believe that it's used here, it is a bill of attainder.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think the Brown case has any relevance?
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="938.746" stopTime="939.666">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Indeed we do.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="939.666" stopTime="942.611">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    With this being a bill of attainder in the Attorney General's list?
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="942.611" stopTime="1055.446">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Indeed we do. 
    If I may anticipate at that moment, the argument we intend to make then I would say this. 
    With respect to this case, this isn't all -- we see it, always, as if this had come before the Court, if the power to construct these regulations at all exists, this case comes before the Court as though the Congress had written the Commandant of the Coast Guard is authorized to deny the application of any person who is or has been a member, sympathetically associated or affiliated with any of the organizations on that list. 
    If the powers are delegated to do that, this appears before the Court in that respect. 
    Now the only difference that we see here is that instead of saying he must deny the application, it says he may deny the application, but in the context of these regulations we feel that it is most unlikely that an administrative official would approve an application of someone who didn't disclaim present sympathy or association or sympathetic attitude toward any of these organizations. 
    We feel that the Commandant would feel impelled that he must ask the question under the regulations, would feel that any sympathetic relation to these organizations would atomically preclude denial. 
    That would be argued no doubt that he may approve, but we believe he would only approve if the applicant had somehow disclaimed knowledge or repudiated the organizations.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1055.446" stopTime="1066.596">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that one of the questions you would have to answer, that this Court should [Inaudible] or in some other way hold, that you've got to wait for a so called administrative proceedings?
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="1066.596" stopTime="1101.274">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Precisely, because the regulations say if you don't answer these questions we postpone any further consideration of your case until you have answered the questions. 
    So administrative remedies simply do not exist unless you throw away your constitutional rights before you start and that's the reason that we cannot believe, that the government can seriously argue that there can be any problem, exhaustion in the administrative remedies in this case Mr. Justice Black.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1101.274" stopTime="1114.718">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So, if we find -- we're to find that the regulation is over broad would it be necessary for us to reach the executive order and the statute itself?
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="1114.718" stopTime="1352.350">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    We believe that the Executive Order in effect sets forth the basis for the regulations. 
    Of course the regulations are over broad. 
    We will present arguments since we've discussed about bill of attainder, I will talk about it this time Mr. Chief Justice. 
    We think that this statute, though clearly vague on its face because of the importation into it of this concept of subversive activity, and giving authority for the Executive Order only on the basis of subversive activity that the statute itself doesn't authorize the procedures which the Coast Guard has here instituted in these regulations. 
    Now, let me spell it out on some detail. 
    The Magnuson Act enacted in 1950 is simply an additional two paragraphs to an already existing Act, the Act of June 15th, 1917 enacted two months after the commencement of World War I. 
    This -- the first two -- the first paragraph which appears as appendix A1 of our brief authorizes the President, in case of war or national emergency with proclamation, declaration of war, disturbance of international relations to take full possession of all foreign or domestic vessels and remove there from members of the crew who aren't especially authorized to go aboard. 
    It is clearly and unmistakably a war power. 
    It's one of some 13 titles in what in effect is the War Powers Act of 1917 and applies only in case of a national emergency or in cases of a proclamation based on disturbance of international relationships. 
    The Magnuson Act adds to this power which the President has under emergency or war situations, the provision that whenever the President finds security endangered by reason of subversive activity, he maybe do two things; part A, with respect to foreign-flag vessels only, he may place guards there on, take full possession of the vessels that he wishes, and remove all persons not especially authorized by him to go aboard those foreign-flag vessels. 
    Secondly, and as the second part of the Act and independent from this and separate from it, it gives the President the power to safeguard against destruction, loss or injury from sabotage, subversive acts, accidents or other causes of similar nature. 
    The maritime facilities of the United States, and it was indicated by Senator Magnuson and no doubt of course, that the government has a very direct interest in protecting these facilities, just pointed out that no authority existed to protect docks and so forth in time of danger and in the argument before the Congress which is set forth in -- which is referred to in our briefs, this was the principal basis for this addition of the Magnuson Act. 
    It says nothing about removing members of crews and we believe there is nothing in the history of the Act.

    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Yes it is, yes Sir. 
    But on the basis of we believe the emergency war powers which do -- which existed before the Magnuson Acts and which do authorize, we could say screening with respect to domestic vessels, this Act does not, the new part of the Act does not apply to the removal of crews in vessels except under the old Act in national emergency and we believe that the government's argument in this respect really is misleading and misleads occur. 
    I'll refer to what is said in the government's argument on pages 15 and 16 of their brief in which they imply directly that the Act provides, if the President finds it necessary, in order to protect any vessel at harbor for damage or injury, he may take full possession of such vessel and remove them from -- the officers and crews from it. 
    Now, this applies only under the national emergency Sections so that as far as our reading of this Act is concerned, no authority whatever exists for the program which the Coast Guard have used.

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I think in view of the war and varied attacks which the appellant here has launched against the statute, executive orders and regulations involved, it's important to know that the outset, the exact procedural posture of this case at the administrative level because I think this makes it clearer, the government's position as to which issues are really ripe for consideration at this time and which we consider are premature. 
    In October of 1964, the appellant applied for special validation of his mariner's documents. 
    At that time, he filled out and submitted to the Coast Guard an application and in an answer to the question concerning his activities in the organization which had been listed by the Attorney General, each of which was set forth in the application form, he responded as follows. 
    The answer appears at page 5 of our brief, “And I have been a member of many”, -- answer, “I have been a member of many political and social organizations including several named on the list. 
    I cannot remember the names of most of them” and could not be specific about any. 
    To the best of knowledge, I have not been a member or participated in the activities of these organizations for 10 years.” 
    That was the extent of his answer on this question. 
    Thereafter, the Commandant acting in conformity with the regulation which provide that when an application does not provide sufficient information upon which he can make a determination.

    That's correct. 
    And he requested additional information in the form of interrogatories. 
    Those interrogatories are set forth at page 34 and 35, 36 of the joint appendix. 
    The interrogatories asked him specific questions, referred first to his answer on the original application and asked him that's set forth to list the names of the organizations on the list to which he belonged, to furnish the dates of membership, and the particulars concerning his membership in that organization.

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    I don't think very long Mr. Justice Black for this reason. 
    I have no idea at this time how many of these organizations he belonged to. 
    I think in answer to your question -- to Mr. Schroeter before or to Mr. Caughlan concerning the People's World he was not asked to give his opinions on the articles that appeared therein. 
    He was asked only -- if you look at page 35 to state, “Have you ever subscribed to that paper?” 
    If he answer is yes, give the dates. 
    Then he was asked, “Have you engaged in any activities of behalf of that paper?” 
    I take it and I think it's the only reasonable way to read that question means did you ever work for it, did you ever write for it, did you ever act someway on behalf of the paper. 
    This is not an answer that calls for him to say what he thought on what appeared in it. 
    Now, it was at this point that --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Martin, excuse me. 
    These organizations are all on the Attorney General's list and there's no organization here that is not on the Attorney General's list or that has been removed from the Attorney General's list, is that was you're telling us?

    Well, Mr. Martin, I thought one of the questions was, are you now or have you ever been a member of, or affiliated, or associated with, in anyway any of the organizations on the Attorney General's list that proliferates to a very great degree, doesn't it, to say or associated with in any way --

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    That is one of the reasons why I think at the outset it's very important to get what we're involved with here because the question to which you refer sir is the one that is set forth in the original questionnaire and that is, are you now or have you ever been, it's question six at page 27 -- “Have you ever been a member or affiliated with in any way any of the organizations set forth below?”

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, as I read the question, it says, “Are you now or have you ever been a member of or affiliated with in any way any of the organizations set forth below?” 
    Then when he answered that as he did in the answer that I read to you Mr. Chief Justice, the interrogatories that came back called for him to list the names of the political and social organizations to which you belonged using the word “belonged.” 
    He wasn't asked at this point whether he was affiliated with any of these. 
    So, that is -- these are the questions that we were dealing with. 
    These are the questions that he refused to answer, the one set forth in the interrogatories. 
    Not -- he had answered the question on the questionnaire. 
    The Commandant felt that those answers did not give him enough information and he then set forth the interrogatories.

    Well, Mr. Justice Fortas I would certainly agree with you that there is an ambiguity perhaps present in the question as to whether or not they are now going outside the Attorney General's list. 
    I think that their intention was to referring to the organizations that they had referred to in the original question, and that was really all their interested in.

    Yes, I think -- I do think I would have read that one Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    But I don't think that -- again I don't think this is the issue because the response to this was not to the Commandant. 
    I don't understand your question. 
    I find it vague, the response was as was pointed out yesterday, if Mr. Schroeter's lawyer would said, “I have advised Mr. Schneider that it is possible for him to answer the interrogatories you have sent him. 
    So, the question was not one, of whether or not the interrogatories were vague, they would put this man in jeopardy to answer. 
    The question was essentially this and I think this is the issue that is certainly we do not intend that anything other than right to consideration by this Court. 
    That is when the government adopts a program, a screening program for an area which it considers to be essential to the national defense effort, does the government at that time have the right to ask an applicant for such position about his past associations. 
    Do they have a right to inquire? 
    Now, I think in treating this question, the entire regulatory scheme does become important because he is not -- these questions are asked not obtain answers which will then per se exclude him from employment. 
    They are the starting point of an investigation.

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    I think that what can be asked of an individual for employment of any industry which is determined to be an industry which is involved into our national defense are questions that are relevant to a determination as to whether or not this individual is going to use that position in a way that will be inimical to the interest of the United States.

    What --

    The question then --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2534.364" stopTime="2611.095">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, at the moment -- what's bothering me is a question of how -- that is to say whether there are some limitations, procedural or substantive upon how the government may go about it and I hear what they asked this man, it seems just offhand -- it seems kind of impossible to answer, and they required him to answer it under oath, as they require him to say or list under oath his political and social organizations and how much money he gave to them, what his contributions had been, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera and they give him a form to be filled out before a notary public under oath. 
    Now, there is some [Inaudible] What I'm really going to ask here is -- do you think there are any -- do you think there are any limitations on the power of the government, either in terms of the method that it requires for disclosing information or in terms of the substance of the information that it requires to be disclosed?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="2611.095" stopTime="2668.896">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    I certainly would agree with you that there are limitations. 
    I think that there are limitations in the questions that can be asked and the procedures that must be followed. 
    I think this Court made that clear in Robel. 
    You cannot just adopt the rule that says, some particular membership of a particular organizations going to exclude you from such a job. 
    You have to have a procedure which will as you have here which will allow the party to see what the charges are against him, to confront the witnesses against him, and to have an opportunity to explain, to indicate what the extent of his membership was. 
    But I do think that a relevant starting a point for this type of investigation is membership in organizations which has been listed by the Attorney General according with -- in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Securities Activities Control Act.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2668.896" stopTime="2702.428">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    [Voice Overlap] it seems to me you've got similar thing as to establish -- I know your position on it, I am not suggesting spending a time on it -- establish that the Commandant may communicate it to this applicant about what he's talking about, and certainly I think we all agree that there is an ambiguity in the question stated by the Commandant in response to the first filing by this applicant.

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2703.031" stopTime="2745.481">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And the second -- of course, the second thing you have to establish is it seems to me is that the -- these questions as stated not merely listing membership, not merely listing whether you are or have been a member in these organizations but also listing contributions and all the rest of this stuff that's in here as a reasonable way -- a reasonable part of a procedure which let us assume that is permissible in its objective?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="2745.481" stopTime="2878.592">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, with regard to your first question Mr. Justice Fortas I think that there are two answers to the question of whether or not this ambiguous and I think that that was not the response that was made. 
    Two, if that is the case, the remedy here is not the remedy that this petitioner asks for, but to remand the case with directions for the Commandant to limit his questions to organizations on the Attorney General's list. 
    With regard to your second part of your question, I do think that contributions and number of meetings are relevant considerations. 
    This Court has said in a number of cases that people can innocently belong to such organizations without knowing the full extent of the organizations activities. 
    How do you determine what person belongs innocently and what person belongs with full knowledge of the organization's activities. 
    You have to determine the extent of his participation. 
    Did he only attend one or two meetings? 
    What do you know -- what does the government know about the meetings that he attended? 
    Maybe that there were a number of meetings held by these organizations that did not reveal their illegal purposes. 
    There maybe certain meetings of this organization that did reveal fully in which the participants at those meetings set forth the full extent of the organization's purpose and activities. 
    The government can't make a reasonable determination as to whether or not this fact of membership should preclude this man from the employment which he seeks unless they know the full extent of his participation in the organization, and how he feels and felt at the time about that organization's activities. 
    Did he subscribe to the purpose of the Communist Party to overthrow the government of the United States by force and violence? 
    If he did, then I think that that is a fact on which you'd certainly exclude him, if he still retains that position.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2878.592" stopTime="2922.164">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But, let me ask you one more your question, I know I'm taking more of your time? 
    Section 121.07 on page A14 of the appellant's brief, that the Commandant is satisfied that the character and habits of life of the applicant are such as to warrant the belief that his presence on board the vessels of the United States would not be inimical to the spirit of the United States, on directive of special validation endorsement of the issue. 
    Now, that is the ultimate standard, isn't it?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="2922.164" stopTime="2923.618">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    That is correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2923.618" stopTime="2942.905">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So that it's the standard that says that a Commandant has to believe that the presence of the person affirmatively, that the presence of the person on board the U.S. vessels would not be inimical to the security of the United States, is that right?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="2942.905" stopTime="2944.209">

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr.

speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="2963.237" stopTime="3002.213">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, I think that those standards have to be read in conjunction with the standards set forth in Section 121.03 which relate to the information that maybe considered which are listed and advocacy which give the nature of the information that they're concerned with, advocacy of the overthrow, or alterations of the government of the United States by unconstitutional means, commission of or attempts or preparations to commit an act of espionage, sabotage, sedition -- sedition or treason, or conspiring with, or aiding or abetting another to commit such an act.

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, to that Mr. Justice Fortas, getting there is this. 
    I think the standards do clarify what is meant by inimical as the Second Circuit said in the case involving the same statute, inimical is not a word that does not have meaning as back -- a word which this Court used in Aptheker, in referring to the activities that could be governed. 
    Here again I think the -- another important consideration that goes into this entire consideration of this case is the fact that this is a standard which is to be used in conjunction with a procedure that provides for a hearing to the applicant at which he will be given the right to confront -- first to be notified for the reasons why the Commandant feels he should be denied an application, a hearing at which he will be entitled to be present, to be represented by a counsel, he will be entitled to cross-examine the witnesses against him, confront the witnesses against him.

    This list does not contain any organization that has not been listed according to the procedures adopted after the Anti-Fascist Refugee case, and that these procedures were designed to comply what this Court said in that case, that they would provide procedures which gave the organization an opportunity to be heard.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    [Voice Overlap] affirmatively gets in the list, otherwise you stayed on the list and [Inaudible] and you can answer Mr. Justice Fortas, [Inaudible] He was talking about those [Inaudible] associations with. 
    And they think Mr. Brown is maybe a member of an affiliate division, as he pointed out in the question six that the original application speaks of being a member of or an affiliate with [Inaudible] Mr. Justice Fortas the standards which govern whether one is inimical and so forth are those in 121.03 and I noticed that he said membership in or affiliation or sympathetic association with any organization on the list, [Inaudible] haven't really had sympathetic association with.

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    [Voice Overlap] as you pointed out [Voice Overlap] that the question six on the application is still talking about associations with [Inaudible] Now you tell us that the Commandant makes his determination on the basis of the standards of 121.03 -- there is sympathetic association with.
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="3249.693" stopTime="3259.671">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, I think that that -- what it means I think is that a party associates himself with an organization, knowing its purposes and --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3259.671" stopTime="3265.196">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well then, it has to mean something different on membership in or affiliations with?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="3265.196" stopTime="3266.303">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    That is correct.

    The third thing is about sympathetic association with.

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    That is correct, and I think that it has to refer to some type of association with the organization. 
    But again Mr. Justice Brennan, I think the important thing is that this is a determination that is made and it can be made in conjunction with a hearing. 
    And I want to point out that this is a question which I think should not -- as this Court said, Monday in the Dubois Club case, it should not be decided in a vacuum. 
    It should be decided in a context where there has been a hearing at which the evidence has been produced and which the -- the Court can then judge on a factual record such exited in the case of the Boyd v. Roland which was taken to the Courts and we do not contend for a moment that when this hearing is held this man will have an opportunity to take the case to the Court and having the action of the Commandant reviewed judicially.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That is not the case of Dubois.

    That is correct. 
    And that is the issue I think that is really before the Court, it's does the government, when a man comes to apply for position which the government believes is a position in an industry vital to the national defense, in which some effort should be made and taken to protect that industry against sabotage, what can they inquire of that individual for the position? Can they ask him about his past association? 
    Can man present himself for such a position and say, my name is John Martin and I want a job?

    That I could not be sure of Mr. Justice Fortas, exactly what the standards are in the various programs and how they are administered.

    I understand that, I'm talking about the over breadth of this regulation as it was applied to this man. 
    And let me ask you this also, you cited that the -- our action in the Dubois case yesterday. 
    There is some difference between the two cases in there because in the Dubois case, they were trying to avoid all the entire administrative process and wanted us to take the case and decide it on the merits of it. 
    In this case, a man was demanding a hearing and he wasn't given a hearing?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="3867.345" stopTime="3959.765">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    That is correct. 
    I agree with you Mr. Chief Justice entirely on that preposition that the question is in this man has every right to bring this question to the Court, is does the Commandant have the right to require him to answer the questions before he passes on the application. 
    I'm not saying that the Dubois has anything to do with that question. 
    What I am directing myself to is that the appellant make several contentions that the hearing maybe inadequate because witnesses against him may not be produced. 
    That the standard -- the burden is going to be cast on him to prove that he has a bad Fifth Amendment -- a good Fifth Amendment character. 
    I think that these questions, the other question is, that he raised which I think also is going to be effective only by a hearing is the extent to which membership in the Communist Party or any other organization may preclude granting of a special validation because all of these questions were going to be developed at the hearing, I think you'll find that after a hearing has had that many of these questions are going to drop out of the case. 
    I have been informed by the Coast Guard that they now take the position that four witnesses will be produced at the hearing. 
    So that question of whether or not you could -- the question left open in other case in this Court -- whether you can at any time rely on information not produced, will not be a factor in this case because I feel that this is an advice, that this goes to a hearing, or witnesses will be produced.

    This man has said according to his attorney's letter that he could've answered the questions, but the government has no right to inquire. 
    So, that's why I think we're not concerned here so much with specificity of the question because had there been a challenge to the specificity of the question, then yes the Commandant should have come back and been specific as he was with the organization to which he belonged. 
    That is certain with something that can be handled administratively at that point. 
    This is a man who just said you have no right to know. 
    That's the issue. 
    Do we have a right to know?

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    He said nothing to those.

    Well?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4156.372" stopTime="4158.336">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    The answer came --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4158.336" stopTime="4193.456">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- then he is complaining that he wasn't given a hearing. 
    Now, do they have a right to compel him to give all these answers to the extent that they can deny him, convict him on what he says before they give him a hearing or is he entitled to have a hearing at which witnesses will determine the truth or falsity or the relevance of the questions that are asked to him so he can have a record upon which to obtain judicial review?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4193.456" stopTime="4216.375">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, I do think Mr. Chief Justice before he is entitled to a hearing, I think that the Commandant does have a right to ask him to provide information about himself which will enable the Commandant under take an investigation to lead to the determination initially whether or not the special validation should be issued.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4216.375" stopTime="4223.403">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then in your opinion, could he make the investigation and determine that he was not entitled to it and deny it?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4223.403" stopTime="4245.297">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    He could initially deny it, at which point if he took that action this man would be entitled to the hearing. 
    The man will always be entitled to a hearing and always be entitled to judicial review except in the cases where he refuses to supply information which is relevant. 
    That is question before the Court, here again, I want to stress --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4245.297" stopTime="4254.711">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why can't he then deny it? 
    Why could he deny this man on his application and that let him -- let him demand a hearing if he wanted?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4254.711" stopTime="4291.427">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, I think the position of the Commandant is that he cannot -- the Commandant cannot bring himself to a position where he has enough information about the man to present at a hearing until certain factors or certain answers that are given by the applicant. 
    To use the example I used before Mr. Chief Justice, if I were to show up that the Coast Guard station, ask for a special validation and they -- let's say, “My name John Martin and I want a special validation”, and they say well, you know, they started asking me some questions, I said, “No, I will not answer any of your questions.”
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4291.427" stopTime="4334.551">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But he didn't say that. 
    He didn't say that here. 
    He filed answers to all of the questions that were asked. 
    They might not have been sufficient. 
    They might not have satisfied the Commandant. 
    Why couldn't the Commandant say, “I deny your certification” and then the man as you say is entitled to demand a hearing and he would be given a hearing, but why shouldn't they do that instead of saying, “No you never can have a hearing until you give us answers to questions that are not in regulations that are propounded by us and until you answer that we won't give you a hearing”.
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4334.551" stopTime="4355.906">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, I think the reason for that Mr. Chief Justice is I think because before the Commandant can participate meaningfully in a hearing, he has to know something about the individual which will enable him to determine to make some findings, to gather evidence as to the nature of this man's character.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4355.906" stopTime="4380.379">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, why couldn't he say? 
    Why couldn't he say, “Your answers to our questions are not sufficient for us to determine whether you are qualified for this position or not. 
    Your application is denied.” 
    Then as you say, if it's denied in that way he has a right to demand a hearing. 
    Now, why couldn't that be done in order that the man could get his judicial review?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4380.379" stopTime="4399.917">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, the question is then what would happen at the hearing. 
    This man would come in and he would testify that I am a person, his counsel has represented, that Mr. Schneider, I'm a loyal person in the United States. 
    The Commandant is in no position at that point, having no information about the man to contest that fact this purpose of this --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4399.917" stopTime="4404.865">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Would say he wanted to deny him, deny him the right to have that hearing?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4404.865" stopTime="4429.764">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    He does not want to deny -- he does not want to deny the man the right to have that hearing. 
    But he does feel and I think reasonably that before the Commandant can participate meaningfully in the hearing as a represent to the government they have to have some information about the individual because all the hearing would come out to as this man coming in and say, "I'm a person loyal to the United States”.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4429.764" stopTime="4434.489">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How do you know? 
    How do a Commandant know that that's all that will happen?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4434.489" stopTime="4448.737">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, it has to be assumed that if he is not going to answer questions about his -- this is the assumption in which the regulations have based, that if a man is not going to furnish the information that they need to make the determination --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4448.737" stopTime="4510.285">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose he would come in and say, “Well, now I'm not a member of the Communist Party or I was a member of the Communist Party and I resigned a long time ago and I'm no longer interested in it. 
    But I think what I read in the newspapers is my personal business and I don't propose to answer that because they're invasion of my First Amendment rights, I don't propose to answer this question and that question because I believe it's an invasion of my rights,” then they could take whatever action they wanted and the man is entitled to judicial review, but when the Commandant says, “Well, [Inaudible] we won't give you a hearing until you answer all the questions that we want to propound to you”. 
    The man is never in the position as you claim here to come in and have any judicial review.
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4510.285" stopTime="4570.375">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice I hope -- let me try to make myself clear on that. 
    I do think that this action is properly brought to determine whether or not the Commandant had the right to ask the questions and require this man to answer those questions. 
    If this Court determines that the First Amendment gives a man a right to refuse to answer any questions about his past associations even when he is applying for a position in National Defense Related Industry, certainly that issue is before the Court, the only thing that I said about the hearing is that certain other arguments which he made concerning what is going to take place at the hearing. 
    Should he wait the hearing? 
    We do not contest the fact that he had absolute right to judicial review of the determination not to proceed further with the application.

    The Commandant insists that he does have the right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4614.932" stopTime="4622.420">

    You forced him to – you forced him into those things because you won't give him a hearing on which he can have a record.

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, I would agree that certainly the remedy, if the Court disagrees with this, that this manner is -- that the Commandant did not have the right to ask -- withhold the action and in receipt of his answer just to order a hearing. 
    I don't think it's to grant him the application which he seeks which is the relief he sought in the District Court, but I do think that would be the proper remedy in that case. 
    I do --

    I do feel that -- the question that he dispose is does the Commandant have a right to ask these questions and get these answers? 
    This man said no. 
    It's our position that the Commandant does have a right to ask questions concerning the organizations on this list. 
    Now, it maybe that a particular question could be more precise, it might be proper to order that a question be made more specific if the Commandant insists on an answer to that. 
    But if there are certain questions which are quite precise what organizations did the man belonged to? 
    Now, he just said that we had no right to ask any of these questions.

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    I would concede Mr. Chief Justice that certainly that particular question is not precise and --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4725.896" stopTime="4729.572">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, isn't that the basic question of the application?
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4729.572" stopTime="4891.772">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    No, I think the basic question started with the first one which asked him initially about the organizations on the Attorney General's list and then the first question on the interrogatory which asked him which organizations he belonged to, I think that's the basic question. 
    I think that this is an answer -- this is a question to which the Commandant has the right to expect an answer so that he can make the reasonable investigation of this man and to determine whether or not a special validation should be issued. 
    I think that is the question before the Court. 
    Now, I would like if I my at this point to turn briefly to the question which Mr. Justice Harlan asked concerning the delegation of a power to the -- whether or not the Magnuson Act authorized this type of program that we have here. 
    I think the answer to that is that it did. 
    I think the Congress was acting. 
    Unfortunately there is not a great deal of legislative history because this was an amendment to existing legislation that was passed during the Korean crises, but there is some history which I think is significant. 
    This is an Act which was passed amending existing legislation and under to that existing legislation there had been during World War II, screening program from merchant seaman which had been enforced. 
    At the time the bill was introduced in the Senate, Senator Magnuson informed the Senate that the purpose of this bill was to allow the President to institute security measures similar to those adopted during World War I and World War II. 
    So I think that fact indicates that Congress contemplated some type of screening procedure similar to that used during World War II. 
    Second, I think that in the use of the words, the President has delegated the power to make rules and regulations, to prevent sabotage and espionage. 
    How do you -- what rules and regulations do you adopt, why does the common sense meaning of those phrases when put together. 
    It seems that to prevent sabotage and espionage, you have to do two things. 
    You have to deny access to those places that maybe subject to those activities; one, to the people who might engaged in it and two; to the materials that might be used to carry out those activities. 
    So, I think that just on a reading of the language that it contemplates that rules and regulations are going to be adopted to exclude people from areas where sabotage and espionage could be engaged in.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4891.772" stopTime="4933.785">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Martin, why do you make of this incomplete sentence as I see it? 
    The word ‘such' is generally a word indicating the limitation is going to follow, that is to say authorizing the President to institute such measures, and issue such rules and regulations, and ordinarily that would be followed by some of these to effect as maybe essential or as maybe necessary in the circumstances and like that, but the statute apparently uses the word ‘such' and that's all.
speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="4933.785" stopTime="4963.502">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, the only thing I can say to that Mr. Justice Fortas is I do have somewhat difficulty with it. 
    I think it may come into this statute in view of the fact that again we're dealing now, a paragraph to which you refer is the beginning of the amending legislation. 
    They were concerned. 
    They were adopting an amendment that maybe that they would refer back to types of rules and regulations that could've been adopted under the first part, that is the --

    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    Well, I do think that it can take on some meaning from the fact that this is what they were doing pursuant to the authority granted in this original Act and it was something that was brought to the Congress' attention. 
    I think this also gives meaning and the counsel correctly pointed out, and I will apologize for briefly not making clear enough the fact that -- we referred you to the fact that the President was also given a power to exclude people from vessels that was in connection here in subsection (a) which dealt with the foreign vessels in our waters, but I do --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    There's nothing -- let me ask you this specifically.

    But I do think that when the President was given the power to exclude persons from vessels of foreign nations in our waters, it's implicit and that is that Congress recognized that he would certainly have at least that power and draw the powers when dealing with our own merchant marines which is much more vital to our national defense and to which our power is so much greater to regulate.

    Well, I agree that they can be -- I certainly agree that they can be broad areas in which you can inquire to our contention in this case that were ruminated to the what we feel and I understand if there was a disagreement in the Court with our reading of that question, that when you're limiting your inquiry to organizations that on the Attorney General's list, were that list is being used is not per se to exclude the person, but solely for the purpose of starting an investigation which will lead eventually to determination, whether or not that person is presently qualified, and he presently presents possible danger to the interest of the United States, I think that in those circumstances, certainly the inquiry is reasonable. 
    I would agree wholeheartedly that if a question that was asked, you know what church do you belonged to, is not a proper matter of inquiry in this.

speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="5909.928" stopTime="6045.720">
    Mr. John S. Martin, Jr. 
    For this purpose, I think the government has to make its investigation of two things. 
    One, what activities first, indicate that a man belonged to them and participated in them would be a danger to the government. 
    Now, whether they do that by a published Attorney General's list whether they take that action on their own which is circulated to the department -- by an agency in government makes an investigation and says that we have determined from our investigation that these organizations are engaged in unconstitutional efforts to overthrow the government. 
    With that, they had then made the determination that there are certain activities that a man if he's engaged in unknowingly, make it quite likely, that he is not the type of person who should be granted access to any sensitive position. 
    The next part of the investigation is to look -- to see if this man belonged to that type of organization and if he did, what was the extent of his participation in them? 
    Then you can come to the fact where you inform the man that we have come to a determination that you belong to these organizations which we believe are acting in a manner that would -- to take unconstitutional action to overthrow our government, and for that reason you should be denied your special validation. 
    At that point he's got the right to come back in and say, one of -- several things. 
    One, I don't belonged; two, I belonged, I did not know of its activities; three, I belonged knowing full well of its activities and you are all wrong because that is not the activity to be engaged in, and if he's got an act -- if they're not engaged at any unconstitutional activity, and he's got a right to litigate those issues. 
    So I don't think viewing the entire process that the question of where you start is necessarily determined. 
    I think the government has the right to start at some way. 
    They have made -- the government has made the investigation and has determined in its mind, that at least by face these organizations are engaged to the activities designed overthrow the government. 
    And I think that they can use that as the starting point to investigate an individual's activity to determine whether he should be granted the access to any sensitive position that he seeks.

    Secondly, the question that Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice Warren just asked, is similar to a question that Mr. Justice Brennan asked earlier that I just briefly like to comment upon. 
    Whatever the Coast Guard's understanding of the question was, it was Mr. Schneider's understanding and mine that it included every organization that you ever belonged to. 
    And part of the problem we had among other things is that -- or had affiliations with, Mr. Schneider's family had come over from the old country. 
    They were Jewish and they belong to a number of groups that automatically merged into the Jewish People's Fraternal Order on that list, with the (Inaudible) Society on the list, Mr. Schneider as a child had grown up in this kind of thing which was rather peculiar to Ghetto culture when Jews came over to this country. 
    Do we list them? 
    Do we not list them? 
    Did he belong? 
    Didn't he belong to? 
    We talked about what he belonged to when he was four years old don't we? 
    That's enough to drive a lawyer to drink. 
    I mean you have no idea what to advice him or not advice him, that was really perfectly horrible. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan --

    -- so horrible, [Voice Overlap] Court with the facts where it will be so horrible without telling the Commandant --
speaker="leonard_w_schroeter" startTime="6375.794" stopTime="6440.305">
    Mr. Leonard W. Schroeter 
    Because that -- well, we did say and I call your attention to page 22, in my letter I said look, Mr. Schneider doesn't -- have no objections whatsoever to privately discussing his past or present political attitude, he's not ashamed of anything.” 
    I said in the letter, “We offered to go with the Coast Guard and talk to them privately”. 
    Now, the only thing they could have found out is that he belonged to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Jewish Community Center for the past 15 years, it wasn't anything we were worried about. 
    But we've done -- we'll work and say it under oath, we just felt that this was an absurd to have to write all these essays under oath, to have to answer questions that were simply not capable of being answered adequately. 
    If the Coast Guard want -- had any real question about this man, they could've asked it which goes of course to the total position of the government. 
    The government, the helpless United States government has no way to know anything about Mr. Schneider even though for five months, the FBI had had the file, even though whatever of these organizations are still alive, have more FBI Agents than they do people, for heaven's sake --

speaker="leonard_w_schroeter" startTime="6442.022" stopTime="6532.231">
    Mr. Leonard W. Schroeter 
    Probably in the clan too. 
    I suspect so. 
    There's just no question, the government knows more about Schneider than Schneider knows about Schneider. 
    And for five months, they've had ample opportunity to go to their IBM records on him and talking to them, we knew they knew the whole story about him. 
    I thought the Coast Guard people, they knew everything about Schneider and they come up with this pious nonsense that he has to answer the questions so they have a basis to go ahead, that's simply factually false. 
    They knew everything about him. 
    What they were seeking to do is to make him conform by answering questions under oath that were unanswerable. 
    And if there's any question that this is still what they're up, which is what Mr. Brennan asked, what kind of question do they ask? 
    I have in my hand a questionnaire that we received two weeks ago from a man in which they say, “In 1949, were you a member of the Progressive Party of Washington in 1950 and 1951 and 1952? 
    Did you attend a bazaar under the sponsorship of the People's World for the purpose of raising funds?” 
    They asked, “Did you attend any meetings?” 
    Now, listen, “Did you attend any meetings with an official of the Communist Party, you know, give dates and places of such of meetings and what officials?” 
    Well, who knows whether they attend meetings on and on and on. 
    And mister -- it is suggested by the government that this is relevant by a set of standards that the government adopts that this is relevant to a determination as to whether the character and habits of this man are inimical for the government of the United States.

    Mr. Leonard W. Schroeter 
    Now, this of course -- the relevance of these questions, it seems to me is critical and it really gets to what to me is the heart of the whole case. 
    The only thing that the government and appellant I think agree about is the high desirability that you look at the entire program. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Stewart indicated we've denied cert in other case that's similar, have we not, and there are -- Mr. Justice Warren has asked questions about, “Well, can we limit this to the regulations? 
    Can we send it back and say, give the man his hearing?” 
    I suggest to you that implicit, what I tried to suggest yesterday, implicit in the heart of this program, is its defect. 
    I cannot believe that the Commandant of the Coast Guard is capable of regulating the program that would deal sensitively with the minds and hearts and feelings of people who had to go through this. 
    I don't think he is capable of it. 
    I don't think that the separation of powers would permit it. 
    I don't think that the government can device reasonably at least they've been notoriously unsuccessful, devise a program that could possibly meet the feelings of this Court about such matters.

    And with respect to that particular point, I think this Court can easily decide this question by simply saying and we have read everything in your library, Mr. Caughlan and I, that we can find, there isn't a shred of a word that suggests that in language or otherwise, a screening program, nothing in the legislative history, nothing in the executive order.

    Mr. Leonard W. Schroeter 
    Well, there was not such a program in World War I as far as I can make out. 
    If there was a program in World War II, it comes from some knowledge that is not found in the Courts of this -- the library of this Court. 
    Now, it is my knowledge from asking people not from this that there was a kind of a program but had nothing to do with the kind of program there is here, nor was it administered by the Coast Guard.

    Mr. Leonard W. Schroeter 
    Yes. 
    All I'm suggesting is there were some kind of a very loose form of screening program, but the heart of this is and to me the heart of the issue before this Court and it's this -- that this Court can and has said many things for many years about programs of this kind and I need to reiterate this Court's decision. 
    And this Court recognizes they are multiple ways in which you can decide this question, but is this a proper occasion, this kind of a case, for the exercise of judicial limitation? 
    I suggest not and I suggest not because the central problem of our society it seems to me is not that this Court does not articulate magnificently what the constitution is all about. 
    That isn't our problem. 
    The problem is that it is implemented in Seattle, and Schenectady, and in Albuquerque, and in Albany, we don't get the views of this Court adequately indicated. 
    We have here the last vestige really, a full-blown what is I think properly called institutionalized McCartneyism. 
    This program almost without change, despite 17 years of existence, for 17 years, this Court has more or less articulated points of view which I could spell out extensively, but I think need not which are at war with the program of this kind, yet this program in its heart permits questionnaires such as this, that is still be asked in November 1967, and it does so, not only because a program of this kind violates the concept to separation of powers essentially as it does, because it over delegates, because it may well be a bill of attainder and seeks to punish --
