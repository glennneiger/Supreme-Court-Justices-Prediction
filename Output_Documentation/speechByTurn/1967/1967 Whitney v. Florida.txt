Whitney v. Florida
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="0.000" stopTime="122.618">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    -- whether it is feasible for this Court to accept standard by which the effectiveness and duty of a Court appointed trial counsel can be measured. 
    Secondly whether a Court appointed trial counsel has a duty to abide by his client's instructions during the pretrial proceedings of the case. 
    And lastly whether when this Court held it was inherently invalid to hold a murder trial in a community exposed to the defendants televised confessions, did this Court mean inherently invalid or mean inherently invalid sometimes. 
    I feel that the facts in this case are decisive to all of the issues which I am attempting to raise and I will discuss them at some length. 
    I expect also to discuss the need for an adequate standard to measure the effectiveness and duty of Court appointed trial counsel. 
    I also expect to discuss some suggested standards with particular emphasis on the American Bar Association's minimum standards for criminal justice and lastly of course to discuss the existing precedent as it applies to this case. 
    As to the facts, the defendant at the time of his arrest was 17 years old, he is white, of average to above average in intelligence. 
    He has a tenth grade education. 
    He and his family at the time of his arrest resided in California, so that when he was apprehended near West Palm Beach, he was out without of either a counsel or family.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    I feel that the failure to present such testimony Your Honor is one of the indications to show that trial counsel completely abandoned all defenses that were applicable so far as the question of mercy was concerned Mr. Justice. 
    The defendant at the time of his arrest immediately confessed to an additional seven homicides all committed in the perpetration of robbery. 
    All of these homicides were committed within the period of 30 days; one in California, three I believe in Arizona and four in Florida. 
    The four that were in committed in South Florida were all committed within that past week. 
    The defendant as I say was apprehended in West Palm Beach and immediately the next day on March 6th of 1960 he was taken to Miami where he again repeated these confessions to these eight separate homicides, this time Your Honors in the presence of television cameras, radio microphones and of course the news media. 
    The defendant was returned to West Palm Beach in May where he was convicted and given a recommendation of mercy which in Florida is automatically means life.

    Your Honor I have only examined the record I don't know, other than what the Rule 1 -- what I've alleged in the Rule 1 petition. 
    The defendant was returned to Miami in May and counsel were appointed for him. 
    Counsel made a motion for the appointment of the psychiatrist to determine his competency. 
    Two were appointed and three examined the defendant. 
    The defendant was found competent by all of the three psychiatrists and competent to stand trial and know right from wrong. 
    Their opinions ran the range that he was suffering from a mere personality disorder to the fact that he had a severe psychosis, that is almost out of touch with reality, although still able to know right from wrong. 
    The psychiatrist who had not been formally appointed two weeks before his trial filed his report and this psychiatrist said I can state unequivocally that without further advances in the psychiatric field this boy will a menace to society as long as he may live. 
    Counsel were asked by the petitioner to move for a change of venue, but they failed to do so. 
    So to please the Court it was against this background that the defendant went on trial for his life in June.

    After the selection, after the voir dire and the selection of the jury the defendant freely and voluntarily and on the advise of his counsel and on the advise of his two sisters and his brother who had come from California to the trial signed what was denominated as a “Stipulation” which in effect was a plea of guilty because it admitted facts, all of the necessary facts necessary to constitute murder in the first degree of this person in question. 
    The defendant was not taken before the Trial Court prior to the introduction of the stipulation into evidence. 
    So the trial was limited as it was to the judicial stipulation. 
    There were some corroborating physical evidence, corroborating the confession of stipulation and also the defendant's own testimony as to his earlier environment.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor, the record is unclear as to why it was played to the jury. 
    There is testimony in a habeas corpus petition proceeding which is in the record before this Court that the -- the stipulation was entered on a quid pro quo basis, that is that the state would certain things and limit their evidence providing the stipulation was signed. 
    There is actually nothing in the stipulation itself or any copies of the stipulation as to exactly what the consideration was nor is there anything in the stipulation Mr. Justice as to whether any promises were made to the petitioner.

    Mr. Richard Kanner

speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="549.012" stopTime="550.601">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But his testimony to that --

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes, yes sir.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="552.211" stopTime="553.570">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    He signed the testimony.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="553.570" stopTime="715.637">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes sir, Mr. Justice, as to whether those witnesses would be relevant in Florida if not before this Court. 
    So as I say the trial was limited to the stipulation. 
    There was the Gray Audograph disk and some corroborating testimony in the defendant's trial. 
    There was no mitigating testimony at all from the psychiatrist, nor was there the first instruction for the jury. 
    Gentlemen of the jury, this a stipulation and it leaves to you the sole question of mercy you are to disregard any publicity that you may have learned about the defendant and you are to base the decision on mercy to the facts in this case. 
    That was not the first instruction, not the first word from this Court, that so far as the question of mercy was concerned, that the jury had to limit its deliberations to the facts, to the evidence presented at this trial. 
    The Jury did return a verdict without a recommendation of mercy. 
    If it pleases the Court, I do not wish to imply however by I what I've said heretofore that counsel or proforma in their representation of this boy so far as the question of guilt or innocence was concerned because they were not, counsel moved for such discovery as available in Florida and they also moved to some discovery that was not available in Florida such as his testimony at the Palm Beach Trial. 
    They also moved for a list of witnesses and the bill of particulars and they asked to hire ballistics and fingerprint experts. 
    So as far as the question of guilt or innocence is concerned I don't wish to leave any implication to the Court that trial counsel, defense versus proforma because so far as guilt or innocence was concerned up to the assigning of the stipulation it was not proforma and I have no quarrel with the counsel's recommendation Mr. Justice Marshall assigned the stipulation. 
    My quarrel with counsel is that having entered into the stipulation, they completely abandoned this boy. 
    They made no attempt, no effort to insulate him from the affects of this publicity. 
    The appeal again ignored the publicity. 
    It was limited to the inability of trial counsel to challenge members of the grand jury, the prejudicial final argument and the fact that the trial court found the defendant competent to stand trial.

    That is correct. 
    The petitioner that in proper person filed in the United States District Court of Jacksonville a habeas corpus petition alleging for the first time that the listing had deprived him of a fair trial. 
    The United States District Judge denied the petition on the grounds that the State Court had not been given the opportunity as yet to rule on that matter. 
    After which the petitioner filed his pro se appeal in the Fifth Circuit. 
    The Fifth Circuit concurred in the judgment of the District Judge, stayed his execution, where upon the petitioner with counsel filed his collateral attack proceeding in the Florida Circuit Court, the trial court. 
    Our post conviction of collateral attack statute, our rule is identical with the Federal 2255 proceeding. 
    The Rule 1 petition made no allegation, though that his trial was unfair so far as guilt or innocence was concerned. 
    Defendant has always conceded his guilt, but as Rule 1 petition laid down in length what that it was that his trial so far as guilt or, so far mercy was concerned was unclear. 
    And this Mr. Justice Fortas is one of the reasons I suggest that his trial on the question of mercy was unfair because of the failure to defense counsel to call the expert mitigating witnesses.

    Is there any case in which this Court has taken an issue, directed the way you want this one directed let us say not to the specific question of guilt or innocence, but to the recommendation of mercy? 
    Do you know any such case?

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor no appellate court has the power to tell a trial court or to tell the trial court jury that it should recommend mercy.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    No, I don't mean that, but I mean your -- so I understand what you are saying, you are not asking us to reverse because of error in the judgment. 
    You are asking us to reverse because you think that there was error committed focused to crime or directed to the jury's failure to recommend mercy. 
    Correct?

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes sir Your Honor.

    Have we already done that? 
    Do you know of any case in which we have taken such action?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1395.504" stopTime="1424.071">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    My research has not found a case on this point pro or con. 
    I think that I may have -- I have confused the Court by conceding the guilt of this defendant and only subjecting my argument to the question of mercy. 
    There's a practical and there's an actual matter as you understand Mr. Justice that is what I am complaining about.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1424.071" stopTime="1435.154">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I would not say you -- I certainly wouldn't say you've confused the Court, but you baffle me, because I don't understand the jurisdictional basis?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1435.154" stopTime="1463.076">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Only this Mr. Justice that if this Court feels that it is possible to establish guidelines, to test one the effectiveness and two the duty of court appointed trial counsel and then finds that such guidelines or standards were violated in this case so far as the question of mercy were concerned then I feel this Court has an obligation to reverse it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1463.076" stopTime="1471.489">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if reversed I would suppose that there would be no confession evidence to the subsequent retrial?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1471.489" stopTime="1482.016">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Mr. Justice White I don't know whether the judicial confession would be admissible or not. 
    He had his counsel there. 
    He had his sisters there.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1482.016" stopTime="1483.982">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But none at the pretrial?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1483.982" stopTime="1581.868">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    I would presume on the random that it would not be. 
    So as I say I expect to discuss one; the need for adequate standards to measure the duty and effectiveness of Court appointed trial counsel and secondly some suggested standards and lastly the applicable precedent. 
    Mr. Justice has asked for the need. 
    35 years ago in Carl versus Alabama this Court laid down the mandate that counsel should render effective and substantial aid. 
    Up until this case, I don't believe the question as to what effective and substantial aid has come up. 
    It came up to the slight extent in Avery versus Alabama and the Court held in that case that it was not violated. 
    This Court did in it's supervisory power over the Federal Courts in Alaska versus United States hold that when there was a conflict of interest between co-counsel that there was not aid, the counsel was not “As effective as it might have been.” 
    Now Your Honors with the advent of Gideon v. Wainwright and the proliferation of Court appointed counsel throughout the state systems, I feel that there is now a need for some adequate guidelines to test what is duty and what is the criteria for effective counsel.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    It is this Your Honor, they did not question the Court to give any instructions to the jury that the jury so far as the question of mercy was concerned was required to limit the deliberations on mercy to the record in this case.

    And my argument is to the effectiveness of counsel is only to show in these circumstances that the record conclusively shows that a post conviction evidentiary hearing was required. 
    Counsel for the state has conceded that there's no question of waiver or adequate independent state grounds to support the appellate court. 
    If the record is the statement, would have the Court believe showed positively that the trial on the question of mercy were a fair one, then there would be no due process question. 
    My argument Mr. Justices is that the state contends one that the voir dire conclusively shows that the trial on mercy was fair. 
    I say Mr. Justices that the voir dire or no voir dire, the trial on the question of mercy was not fair for reasons one, two and three and that we either need to have this case reversed, if this Court is going to have minimum trial standards or two if the Court rules that it is a duty then this Court has -- the case has to be reversed for only an evidentiary hearing.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes, sir, unless this Court propitiously on it's own feels that such error is -- such unfairness is substantiated in the record and the reason I put it this way, is that this case is not quite Rideau v.

    I think this Court on it's own could reverse this case, but so far as the actual publication of these televised confessions were concerned, it's -- I only gathered from the questions on the voir dire from the state attorney and that's primarily and the -- there's no question about what the televised confessions were taped as positive testimony is to that, but so far their publication I only gathered this from the voir dire questions for the state attorney.

speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="2375.160" stopTime="2509.413">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Mr. Justice White I -- the reason that I my oral argument is taken the tact that it has is because the State says that he received a fair trial. 
    There is no question of waiver. 
    On page 21 of the state's brief, the state says, if I can quote that in a second, the state does not regard of the factual situation in the instant matter as being a waiver of petitioner's rights. 
    It is state's position because the jury was in fact fair and impartial petitioner's constitutional rights were preserved by his counsel and consequently there was no waiver. 
    But in view of this concession I think that -- so far as argument is concerned that I have to come forward to show that the constitutional rights were not preserved because of items one, two and three. 
    The present test to determine the adequacy of court appointed counsel was whether such trial resulted in a farce. 
    And I hardly feel that this standard approaches anywhere close to the level of, this court laid down last term in Anders versus California where appellate counsel, that is a counsel must be an active advocate. 
    The -- I invite the court's attention to just numerous recent law review articles. 
    There is numerous recent editorials and articles in the American Bar General and of course the American Bar Association's project to establish minimum standards and I invite the Court's attention to all of these articles to attempt to show that there is some need to establish minimum standards and if there are any type of minimum standards whatsoever then such minimum standards were violated in this case.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor of course it is and there was an instruction from the trial judge that the jury shall make its determination of facts on this, on this record, or this evidence or was one cause of the sentence. 
    So far as the question of fact was concerned that the jury should confine itself to the evidence, but of course there were no facts to decide. 
    Now as to the applicability of existing precedent the state has as I've read has conceded that there was no waiver. 
    They have – and the State of Florida now recognizes that res judicata is not actually applicable in matters which let's say are actually raised. 
    The state has made no explanation as to why there was no instruction relative to publicity immensely or why that there was no motion for a change of venue or instruction.

    Well how come the court, what the judgment the court charged [Inaudible] there is no evidence [Inaudible]
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="2698.501" stopTime="2803.393">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor I think that this Court has held in Rideau versus Louisiana and more probably more particularly pointed in Marshall versus United States. 
    Marshall v. United States was a case where trial was in progress and they sequestered or they broke through the night recessed and there was evidence in Marshall prior records or convictions of the defendant which would not be admissible and the trial judge in Marshall took each of the jurors into his chambers and asked them will you disregard this. 
    And each of the Juror said certainly we will and we will base our record on the evidence, base our verdict on the evidence. 
    This court nevertheless reversed. 
    I feel that the reasoning in Irvin versus Dowd, Mr. Justice Black is that sometimes when things can be so bad that regardless of presence or absence of what a juror says that the case has to be reversed. 
    We've got Rideau versus Louisiana standing for that and certainly Turner versus Louisiana, a case where the jury was taken out by the two of the witnesses over the deputy sheriffs, as [Inaudible] v. Texas everyone said that they were going to be fair. 
    So the fact Mr. Justice Black that there was no evidence actually introduced as Court noted in Marshall versus United States at least when you introduce evidence you have some protective proceeding but if the evidence is not introduced and everyone knows about it anyway there are no protective procedures.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Counsel for the state relies on Beck versus Washington which of course is, I say of course I feel is nowhere, anywhere close to being in point. 
    In Beth there was lots accusatory publicity but there was actually no confessions. 
    I believe the distinction between a confession and other accusatory publicity has been, I think is crucial. 
    This Court is, not this Court the Sixth Circuit in Shepard versus Maxwell noted it in Sixth's Circuit's opinion dismissing the Shepard Petition that is the Sixth circuit said that there is a big difference between hearing confessions of the defendant and this other accusatory publicity. 
    So I feel Mr. Justices that the record shows that while there may not have been actual prejudice, the prejudice is inherent in this entire record that this boy was tried for six or seven, actually seven or eight murders at one time.

    I feel that in view of the state's concession that this court here has the opportunity to declare itself in favor of American Bar Association projects that seek to raise the standards by which indigent representation can be had. 
    I think the Court has the opportunity here to reaffirm the proposition as set out in Sheppard v. Maxwell that sometimes the court, trial court has a duty on its own to prevent unfairness. 
    I think this court has an opportunity here Mr. Justices to establish some type of adequate standards to measure effectiveness and duty of court appointed trial counsel that such standards would reinforce the unanimous mandate of this Court's mandate in Gideon v. Wainwright --

    I'd also urge conversely that to affirm this decision may it very possibly establish a precedent that this Court possibly might approve the (Inaudible) of the representation in this case and that it would certainly be -- affirmation of this case I believe would certainly be in sharp contrast to our goal of having equal justice under the law. 
    So in answer again to and in summation and closing I would again like to answer Mr. Justices Stewart's question that I feel that in this case that the failure to move for a change of venue were tenuous, or to have jury instruction, or to present expert mitigating witnesses, the psychiatrist, when viewed against this background of the publicity certainly violated minimum standards and it's because it did violate minimum standards that this case should be remanded back to the district court to either -- for either a new trial or for an evidentiary hearing to prove the existence of the pretrial publicity. 
   
   
   
   Argument of James T. Carlisle

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Carlisle.
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="3169.195" stopTime="3273.585">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I have no desire to argue my friend's case for him and -- but I would like to answer some of the questions that were raised by the Court and I feel were not adequately answered by the petitioner. 
    There were some other issues as to the fact which and by the way they were accurately stated to you, but there are just a few things I want to make clear about the facts. 
    Now as I understand the petitioner's position it is simply this. 
    He alleges in the Rule 1 petition, that's our 2255 or your 2255 we call it Rule 1, he alleged in his motion for collateral attack, his motion to vacate the judgment and sentence that he was denied or that there was this pervasive pretrial publicity including, and it says tape recorded confessions of the defendant, which were broadcast over local television stations and local radio stations. 
    Now I don't think we have a Rideau situation if we base or bottom our thinking solely upon the allegation as made in the Rule 1 petition. 
    He does not allege there was a picture appearing on the television screens of Dennis Whitney being interrogated by the sheriff. 
    I think the allegation is simply that there was this tape recorded confession, which was played.

    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    Well, let's, let me I guess I am getting ahead in my argument, but I am glad you asked the question because it's a beautiful time to answer it. 
    Let's take Rideau. 
    Supposedly it has situation just like Rideau, now it's my position that even if we had a Rideau situation that this Court did not say in Rideau that when we have such a situation we are not going to let you bring in any evidence of voir dire. 
    We are just going to automatically assume that because we have that situation, there could not have been a fair trial. 
    I don't think that's what this Court meant to say and I don't think that's what this Court said. 
    I think Rideau and Irwin and Sheppard and Estes and all of these cases mean simply this. 
    That when you have a situation, a pervasive adverse pretrial publicity that then the burden shifts to the state to show that no prejudice juror got into that jury box. 
    I say that by the way this appendix Mr. Justice Stewart is all of the voir dire relating to pretrial publicity of every person.

    Well now of course your ground if you just – you spoke of -- it's not a ground I believe there are -- that was articulated by either at the trial court which dismissed this petition and nor by the Court of Appeals which confirmed it, and isn't the reason that district court appeals gave, it was saying that on this point there need to be a hearing.
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="3534.571" stopTime="3547.415">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    No I -- it is of course my argument and it was in the third district court that the voir dire proves that this was a fair trial at least as far as the jury, the composition of the jury --.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- the court said he didn't move for a change of venue and that's the end of it. 
    That's a state, that sounds like a state ground that you either move to change the venue, where you had that collateral relief. 
    That's what it sounds like.

    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    Let me again I think I started out saying I didn't want to argue my opponent's case and yet I want to make clear what I think his position is, and I believe I can do this I only got far of it out and I began to answer questions and I am not deferring your question I am going to answer it right now. 
    His second allegation is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to move for a change of venue and I understand from oral argument now, there is something about it in the brief that I never really understood the relevance of it, and I didn't respond to it, but that he failed to ask for instructions, that he failed to use the psychiatric testimony. 
    I am prepared to answer these questions. 
    So I think that we're properly before this Court and I always want to say as long as we are in the Court, let's have that, but we properly here because counsel has very clearly coupled the one, the adverse pretrial publicity argument to the competency of counsel in failing to do something about the adverse pretrial publicity.

    The record, the trail record did not contain a description or evidence with respect to these television broadcast, is that right?
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="3664.585" stopTime="3674.975">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    That is right, Your Honor.

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3674.975" stopTime="3676.412">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright, alright I understand.
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="3676.412" stopTime="3677.717">

    Alright.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3677.717" stopTime="3698.515">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now subsequently collateral proceedings the court did not afford the defendant, petitioner here an opportunity to introduce evidence as to that prejudice, allegedly prejudicial publicity is that right?
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="3698.515" stopTime="3699.988">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    That is correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3699.988" stopTime="3773.437">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now the question is, whether the petitioner here was deprived of constitutional right by reason of the court's refusal in collateral proceeding to permit him to present evidence with respect to this prejudicial publicity. 
    I don't believe that received much attention in your adversary's argument. 
    Justice Marshall asked you a question along those lines. 
    I now repeat the question in this form. What is your position with respect to the, to that question, was it or was it not constitutional error for the state court to refuse in these circumstances where a man faces death penalty to admit evidence of the – this allegedly prejudicial pretrial publicity and that sets a legal question to this Court on which I'd like to hear your position?
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="3773.437" stopTime="3806.193">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    Alright Your Honor my answer is that it was not a denial of due process for this reason that assuming as we must in the posture of this case that there was adverse pretrial publicity that nevertheless the voir dire examination of the jurors establishes beyond any shadow of a doubt that no prejudiced juror was seated in that Jury box.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3806.193" stopTime="3819.854">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now you are saying that if this was error, was harmless error, I'm not sure it depends on the legal infirmity here if there is a legal infirmity?
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="3819.854" stopTime="3823.724">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    There is no legal infirmity, there is no harmless error.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3823.724" stopTime="3834.570">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Let's point to, now lets see your position on that. 
    The first point is that in view of the voir dire questions there was no harm done, correct?
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="3834.570" stopTime="3838.249">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    I don't like it when you say there was no harm done Mr. Justice.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3838.249" stopTime="3843.174">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well you stated it your way but give me a complete answer to that.
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="3843.174" stopTime="3933.263">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    Well Mr. Justice my position is simply that no evidentiary hearing is necessary if, I assume and I am positive that in Florida or that in the Federal courts under 2255 a motion to vacate a judgment and sentence is handled the same way it is in Florida. 
    The trial Court Judge reads the motion and he determines from the motion that the ground A, B and C are frivolous, but ground D, if true would require an evidentiary hearing. 
    Now at this point the judge then turns to the record and I might add this judge was the same judge, he was a trial court judge, he then turns to the record and examines this and if ground D is not conclusively refuted by the record then he must grant an evidentiary hearing. 
    So I suppose that I could very accurately I hope in answer to your question by saying that the record of the voir dire in the case at Bar conclusively refutes the petitioner's allegation insofar as he alleges that he was denied a fair trial by reason of adverse pretrial publicity, even if we assume that its all true as he say it is.

    I think every lawyer feels that way, I want to go to trial in any side.

    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    You mean that perhaps these Jurors saw this. 
    Well I can only refer you again to the voir dire. 
    It's this, perhaps it's the size of city of Miami, the transient population, I don't know what it is but people in the newspaper business or the news media business who read this are dismayed I mean we might go rat fishing their product for all that is red. 
    The Jurors had only a cursory knowledge of this case. 
    Some of them in, reading between the line I'd say, we are almost totally ignorant of the facts of this case. 
    Now maybe this speaks for our crime rate that perhaps Dennis Whitney was just buried I don't know, but the, as I see it Your Honor we cannot -- Let me put it this way, yes it's probably many situations in which television Rideau I believe was one there no doubt about that that it would be impossible to obtain a fair trial at least at that time. 
    But in Rideau there was no, well there was evidence of the voir dire but what did the evidence show. 
    Now we admittedly the rule is that it does not happen to be a nexus, I believe in ST's and so on, we have, we have, you have, you've done something to Rideau. 
    Now you say that Rideau holds that, there didn't have to be any nexus. 
    Mr. Justice Clark had dissented in Rideau because there had been no showing of a nexus. 
    I thought when I read Rideau that there was. 
    But in any case the rule now appears to be that there does not have be to a showing between the community prejudice and the jury prejudice. 
    As I see it Your Honor that if in Rideau instead of eight jurors saying well I have reached a -- I believe this is the facts, eight jurors saying I have formed an opinion based upon what I've read, heard and seen, but I'm willing to listen to the evidence and if you can convince me that he's innocent, I'll vote that he's innocent. 
    Now, that was what Rideau had to face. 
    That's not what Dennis Whitney had to face and again I refer to look to the voir dire examination in the record and for your convenience as the appendix of this brief.

    Justice White asked earlier the opinion of your appellate court is not to be read as holding, that because there was no request for a change of venue, the petitioner was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on these allegations. 
    Now, on the premise that's the way it is to be read and I must say it strikes to me that's the way it is to be read, is the State of Florida telling us that this is not an adequate state ground for denying him an evidentiary hearing under your post conviction procedure?

    I understand that Your Honor, but if the only contention raised by the petitioner had been the adverse pretrial publicity perhaps the holding of the Third District Court of Appeals of the State of Florida that failure to move for a change venue and failure to exhaust the peremptory challenges constitutes a waiver or an adequate state ground. 
    If that were the only allegation that were made, I would say the Court had no jurisdiction because this was an adequate state ground. 
    And I do not say that I agreed the decision of the the District Court of Appeals.

    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    I think they could have set a great deal more and I would like to state it here, let me continue to answer your question though, as I say that if the only allegation had been this pretrial publicity that would have been an adequate state ground, but counsel has also alleged that the -- he was -- petitioner has alleged that he was denied the adequate assistance of counsel or the effective assistance of counsel in that his attorney failed to move for a change of venue, failed to ask for these instructions, fail to use the psychiatric witnesses and that would -- I would like to make that portion of my -- that portion of this case, that issue, the second portion of my argument. 
    As I -- the first one that we about exhausted I believe is just simply this, that it did not move for the change of venue. 
    Of 150 venire men he only, a total of a 150, the state and the defendant only examined 48. 
    Of a total of 10 peremptory challenges afforded to the petitioner, petitioner only exercise seven. 
    Now, this may not be conclusive but when you couple it with the second argument.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4469.196" stopTime="4490.104">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, they certainly didn't pass on it as respects the publicity failure to move for change of venue. 
    They did talk about the psychiatric witnesses, but the only -- they just tied it down as being raised and none of them have effective assistance of counsel?
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="4490.104" stopTime="4630.981">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    Your Honor, they close by -- its not because we didn't tell them either, it's -- they closed by saying that the quoting from the record of the Supreme Court in the habeas corpus which Mr. Whitney took to the Florida Supreme Court the opinion and that just simply says the record is to devoid of any evidence that petition's counsel failed to act in good faith, whether they -- it's quoted on page 8, and 9 on my brief, I don't want to read it to you, at any rate that's the only mention they make of whether counsel was confident or not. 
    They bypassed that issue so to speak, unless you consider that a holding on the effectiveness of counsel. 
    The second argument is just -- I don't know, the second argument is just simply that the defense -- the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney after being told or requested by the petitioner to move for a change of venue he didn't do it. 
    And now we hear on oral argument that after being -- that he failed to ask for cautionary instruction as to the pretrial publicity and that he failed to use the psychiatric witnesses. 
    The petitioner tries to draw a line between pretrial strategy and trial strategy. 
    I'm not so sure that this line can be drawn. 
    Certainly we recognize that the decision of whether to plead guilty is ultimately up to the defendant, the decision of whether or not to take an appeal is ultimately up to the defendant, but when you get into questions like whether to move to quash an indictment or an information, whether to move for a change of venue, these questions I submit are part of the trial strategy even though the motion might very well be made long prior to trial. 
    Now as far as the --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Because the lawyer [Inaudible]

    That's what they allege.

    They allege but the court – has the lawyer [Inaudible]
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="4650.303" stopTime="4745.831">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    As far as the transcript of the habeas corpus and that's really the only point where we get to ask the attorneys and happened, there's no evidence about it, it was not an issue at that time and we must take as true. 
    We must take it as true the fact that he asked his attorney to move for a change venue and that his attorney failed to do so. 
    I say that a motion for a change of venue is, although it might be filed long prior to trial, is part of the trial strategy and for this reason because the most appropriate time absent a Sheppard situation for instance, the most appropriate time for the trial court judge to make his decision on whether or not to grant this motion is during or after voir dire when he confined well this fellow is not going to be able to get a fair jury. 
    This area is so permeated and everybody knows about it and every jurors that's been up here has got some sort of an opinion, I'm going to grant his motion, but by the same token a lawyer who had filed such a motion could very well find himself with a jury or with a panel of persons in the jury box which he could accept which he feels is the best possible jury that he can get and in which case I think it would be up to him to withdraw his motion or at least not raise it again. 
    So I think very well that's what happened in the case of Beck.

    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    Well, if you wanted to reverse this I think you're going to have to say that voir dire is no longer a useful tool and while you might as well then go on and say that that sworn testimony in court is no longer useful tool in determining truth. 
    Because if jurors lie and they're under an oath, if they lie when they go into the jury box and I am sure that they do just as witnesses do.

    Now I just don't think that a trial lawyer is required to do what a 17-year old boy tells him to do. 
    If he is required to do this, he is nothing more than a mouth piece. 
    17-year old boy says get up and object to that evidence, yes sir, I object Your Honor. 
    Sit down and don't talk so long now, okay and this is not the way I am ever going to try a case and I don't think any other confident lawyer would do it. 
    Now counsel has mentioned Powell versus Alabama, Gideon versus Wainwright, you convinced the people of State of Florida of the necessity of counsel. 
    Certainly we now recognize that a defendant in a criminal trial is entitled to the guiding hand of counsel in all aspects of his trial. 
    Now how are you going to give this man the guiding hand of counsel and at the same time say that every time the defendant wants the attorney to move for a change of venue, wants the attorney to request particular instructions, wants him to object to certain evidence, wants him to use certain witnesses.

    Mr. James T. Carlisle

    Yes you dissented because you said that there had been no nexus shown. 
    I respectfully disagreed with you even though you were favoring the prosecution in the case. 
    Now I say that the rule is now, despite the facts of the rule is now that there need be no nexus shown between the community prejudice and the jury prejudice that if that at this time that once you to show sufficient prejudice to, sufficient adverse pretrial publicity to show the possibility of that type of community prejudice, that then it becomes duty of the state to show by some means preferably by the voir dire as was done in this case that no prejudice jurors found the way into the jury box. 
    Now as far as I don't know I can't get inside of defense counsel's mind at the time they tried this case and I wonder if an evidentiary hearing will be of any value. 
    It would certainly put them in a strange position where they would, if they get on the stand and they say, my reasons for doing what I did were good reasons then he is hurting his former client. 
    If he says my reasons, I did what I did were because I'm not a very good lawyer, I just can't conceive of any lawyer wanting to do this and any lawyer who realized that he would have to be subjected to this type of thing in the future would ever take an appointment in a criminal case.

    Without taking great deal of time Your Honor, I do not know that it is there, I'll leave it to Mr. Kanner to bring it.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The reason I asked, Justice White asking I think both of you and Mr. Kanner earlier, certainly the opinion of Court of Appeals makes no reference to an issue of effective assistance of counsel. 
    And I just suggest I think it's understandable, that, that point wasn't raised as I read these assignments of error, I don't see that it was ever raised before the Court of Appeals, whatever may have been the case in the habeas corpus proceeding.

    Your Honor --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5372.106" stopTime="5374.758">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    This is another proceeding, isn't it?
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="5374.758" stopTime="5390.396">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    Yes, it is but Your Honor let me say this that I assure you that Mr. Kanner argued this very vigorously before the Third District Court. 
    Now, if the Third District did things the way I would like them to do it, they would not have heard this point, but they are very liberal about this.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5390.396" stopTime="5396.017">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I know but they may have listened to him but they certainly didn't address themselves to it in their opinion, did they?
speaker="james_t_carlisle" startTime="5396.017" stopTime="5615.752">
    Mr. James T. Carlisle 
    No, they did not other than as I stated before they quoted something from the Supreme Court opinion as to the effectiveness of counsel but that's a rather tangential holding I would say. 
    Now, I can -- as I say I can't get inside of the defense counsel's head but I can see why defense counsel would not have put on the psychiatric testimony. 
    All you have to do is look at psychiatric testimony. 
    First of all, I believe it will open the door to the fact this man had killed six other people and shot another one who happened to live four times in the head, look at page 23 of the record. 
    I can't think of anything more damming to have in evidence and that's seems to me a very good reason for deciding not use this type of testimony. 
    I don't know why defense counsel did not request a certain instruction, I'm not even sure that he didn't but I would think that if I were defense counsel that I might not want the jury put on notice again that there had been all this pretrial publicity that this fellow must be a real bad guy, I just wouldn't want it. 
    I think I might be very happy to go trial and take my chances on the Court's standard instruction as to evidence heard from the witness stand. 
    And again back to the change of venue, I think that counsel after being requested by his client, this defendant to move for a change venue that this decision was up to defense counsel and he made the decision at some time during the voir dire examination. 
    I think it is apparent from the voir dire examination that at some point defense counsel decided that, you know this looks like a pretty good jury to me, let's go to trial, let's hear it on the issue. 
    And as I say I've cited Nelson as being the controlling case on this issue, I'd like to -- they're talking about it doesn't make any difference as to whose decision is as to make. 
    Now of course Nelson wanted to object to allegedly unlawful search and seizure and the Court held, well this was the decision for counsel not the defendant to make. 
    And that counsel's decision is binding on the defendant except for in unusual circumstances which they feel is fine and so the Court says now this is the same situation as Whitney had. 
    Nelson had asked his defense counsel object to that testimony, object to this evidence and the counsel refused to do it. 
    And so the Court then says does the fact here that there was prior consultation with the accused and that he disagreed with counsel's strategy make a legal difference. 
    The question is not in before the Supreme Court. 
    Our view is that the result should be the same meaning that it did not make any difference. 
    So I submit gentlemen that the issue of the adverse pretrial publicity is controlled is by the voir dire examination and that these decision – decisions be made solely by counsel. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Richard Kanner

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    May it please the Court, in the short time remaining Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Fortas and to get over the jurisdictional problem what the third district did they said that it was a waiver of a Federal right and this Court's clear holding that waiver of Federal rights that is the question of publicity is a Federal question. 
    So what the --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5638.188" stopTime="5677.859">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So I just don't read it that way Mr. Kanner I read it there is nothing more than a determination, decisive like that of the Court of Appeals in Fay and Noia. 
    Fay and Noia was a case where he had to take in a direct appeal, the Court of Appeals of New York held for that reason the post conviction remedy of coram nobus was not open to him under state law and I read this as saying no more and for our failure to request the change the venue, your 2255 counterpart was not open to him as a matter of state law and in either case the answer is that the proper forum for your client is Federal habeas corpus.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="5677.859" stopTime="5696.856">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    This is for this Court to decide. 
    Now an answer to Mr. Justice as to your query as to raising the adequacy of counsel. 
    I think we've got to go back here to the Rule 1 petition, which sets out the counsel without authority or justification didn't do one, two, three, four, five.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Okay now Mr. Justice White without any type of hearing the trial Judge says in response to the state--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5705.365" stopTime="5706.313">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Res judicata.

    Well I don't think you took a look before the Court of Appeal.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Well, yes Your Honor this was the question of res judicata is to one, two, three, four, five.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5732.325" stopTime="5747.902">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But what is your practice Mr. Kanner, this is assignments of error and it begins defendant assigns the following errors in this cause. Now aren't you acquired under your practice the list all of the assignments?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="5747.902" stopTime="5749.377">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5749.377" stopTime="5762.799">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, these are the only ones you listed and not one of them that includes a denial of an evidentiary hearing on the point of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, is this not one of them, says anything about it.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="5762.799" stopTime="5781.451">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Mr. Justice my talking about ineffective assistance of counsel here is only to show that we were entitled we should have an evidentiary hearing. 
    Now the Rule 1 petition is -- talks about violation of duties and obligations of trial.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5781.451" stopTime="5797.194">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Oh, it certainly does but it -- my difficulty is, you don't seem whatever the reason may have been perhaps your practice permits it, but surely you didn't assign that as one of the errors in the denial of an evidentiary hearing when you went to the Court of Appeals, did you?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="5797.194" stopTime="5798.099">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    I am not going to--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5798.099" stopTime="5805.032">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    These are the same kind of errors that you list that the Court of Appeals lists as having been read.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="5805.032" stopTime="5838.776">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes Your Honors this -- these were the assignments. 
    The only order that the trial court entered was saying that this was res judicata. 
    This is the only thing the trial judge did. 
    The trial judge made no finding of waiver. 
    There was no question of waiver presented in the apartment of defense. 
    The trial judge said res judicata. 
    Now one last, so I feel Your Honors that there is a Federal right here that the state court has – excuse me I see that my time is expired.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5838.776" stopTime="5843.157">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, not as till the red light comes on.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="5843.157" stopTime="5953.178">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    So in one last, one last comment, the voir dire is still certainly and effective means to determine the fairness of a trial and I don't ever concede that it isn't. 
    But I say this Your Honors that in this case the jury was not given the proper tools by which they should perform their function and their function in this trial was to determine whether or not mercy should have been extended. 
    So far as this function was concerned I don't believe that the jury were given the proper tools to do their job. 
    I feel that this Court does have jurisdiction that the adequate state ground that is troubling some of the Justices was a ruling on a Federal ground that is of the publicity which of course is a Federal question.
