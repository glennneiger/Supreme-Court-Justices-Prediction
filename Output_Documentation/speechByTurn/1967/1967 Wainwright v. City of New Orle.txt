Wainwright v. City of New Orleans
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="9.150">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No. 13 Steven R. Wainwright petitioner versus City of New Orleans. 
    Mr. Wulf, you may continue your argument.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="9.150" stopTime="95.829">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Mr. Justice Fortas raised the issue yesterday which I want to clarify, reexamine the record or the question exactly when the arrest for vagrancy took place. 
    It appears without any dispute in the record, that the arresting officer made the arrest of vagrancy on the street and specifically, explicitly told the petitioner on the street that he was arresting him for vagrancy. 
    That appears on the record at the BE 168-169 and again at BE 148. 
    I argued yesterday that the arrest was unlawful, if that so caused the search itself consequently unlawful. 
    Even if the arrest is found by this Court to be lawful, though we don’t concede that it was, we still contend that the search was nonetheless unlawful for several reasons. 
    First, it doesn’t satisfy the requirements for a search incidental to an arrest and that’s so whether or not the arrest is found to be either for vagrancy or for murder. 
    Search is incident to arrest of unjustified on only two grounds. 
    One, to prevent destruction of evidence that might be in the possession of the suspect and in this case the only evidence they’re looking for was a tattoo which is not susceptible to destruction. 
    And the second reason is to seize any weapons which the defendant might have in his possession which could endanger the arresting officers.

    I think it does and I think that the -- we have support for that in Schmerber, where Schmerber spoke about two -- they spoke of invasions of the body but it seems to be a matter of degree of the right to privacy that’s being invaded. 
    But I think drawing upon Schmerber that the search -- the identification of an individual on the circumstance of this case is protected by the Fourth Amendment.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Seither, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="richard_c_seither" startTime="803.902" stopTime="1148.824">
    Mr. Richard C. Seither 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    It is the view of the City of New Orleans that the matters, enlarged matters that the Court has asked the city here today on the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. 
    And we will try to eliminate any consideration of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments summarily. 
    Now, it is significant in the city’s view that enlisting authorities, the American Civil Liberties Union which submitted an outstanding brief, professional brief obviously written by professional lawyers in a professional manner, listed the Fourth and Sixth Amendment and did not cite in its list of authorities of Fifth Amendment. 
    I am asking this Court to consider the Fifth Amendment in this case only bring it into the case only for consideration. 
    It is important because the Wainwright forces cite Miranda, Escobedo, Gideon versus Wainwright. 
    I’ll take those three cases. 
    First, Gideon versus Wainwright, the Sixth Amendment, this is not that type of Sixth Amendment Case. 
    There is no question that Mr. Wainwright was represented at all times by counsel in the court room. 
    So let’s look at Escobedo and Miranda. 
    There is no question, there are no confessions here to suppress, no admissions, no statements of anytime. 
    So if then we cite Escobedo and Miranda just in reference to the Sixth Amendment, leave out the Fifth Amendment considerations of Escobedo and Miranda, we’re only citing half of the case. 
    Escobedo and Miranda primarily stands we submit for the introduction of confessions unlawfully obtained and this Court has held. 
    Correctly we think that a denial of counsel at the time when statements are made, would then rule out on the Miranda and on the Escobedo any incriminatory statements. 
    We bring the Fifth Amendment into this case to say there are no incriminatory statements. 
    There never were any statements. 
    There never were any confessions entered into this case. 
    So Gideon versus Wainwright, Escobedo and Miranda go out of the case. 
    And we’ve met this issue head on. 
    We don’t want to cite the effective date of Escobedo and Miranda. 
    We wanted to meet the issues of Escobedo and Miranda, if Your Honors please. 
    Now let’s go to the Fourth Amendment. 
    The Fourth Amendment, all cases cited have to do with the suppression of illegally obtained evidence. 
    There is no illegally obtained evidence. 
    There is no evidence, physical, real, and any other kind of evidence in this case for the Court to suppress. 
    There was never any offered that could not have been any offered. 
    There was never any sought. 
    The facts of this case are that a man was found murdered on October 3, 1963 Or rather he was -- the date of the murder was fixed at October 3rd, but his body was not found until October 6, 1963. 
    Mr. Wainwright was not arrested until October 13, 1963. 
    Mr. Wainwright was arrested because he thrice walked away from investigating officers who told him not to do it after he tried to do it the first time. 
    They told him specifically. 
    They were in the course of investigating a murder. 
    They told him. 
    They showed him. 
    Came out a composite picture from the murder, they said, “You resemble this man. 
    All we want to do is question you in relation to this case. 
    And when we ask, we don’t want to arrest you.” 
    They even told them that. 
    “We have a perfect out for you. 
    The man we are seeking has a tattoo on his left forearm, on to raise hell. 
    Bare your left forearm and go on about your business if you don’t have this tattoo on your left forearm.” 
    Now, there is no doubt when I say bare your left forearm, they didn’t just ask him to do this, although there were some people who believe, the testimony has a little shake on it. 
    There’s no question. 
    They did ask him to remove his jacket, for all purposes of observing this left forearm. 
    At no time was he ordered to remove his jacket. 
    I say this especially in answer to your question yesterday, Mr. Justice White. 
    If this man was charged with resisting arrest and he was, under no time, I mean resisting an officer, never was he charged with resisting arrest. 
    And it is a very important distinction here that we must draw. 
    But at no time was he arrested for resisting an officer in a sense that he resisted an order of the officers to take off his jacket. 
    He was never ordered to take off his jacket at the Bourbon Street scene, the arrest scene. 
    He was requested to remove his jacket so they could look at his left forearm to see if he had a tattoo. 
    And if he didn’t have a tattoo, he could go on abide his business.

    At page 148, Defense Counsel Mr. Spencer asked the officer, the first charge against him was what? 
    All three were put on at the same time. 
    What did you arrest him for first? 
    Answer, vagrancy violating, and resisting an officer. 
    Those are together. 
    At what point did you charge him with resisting an officer? 
    The charges were all brought at the station. 
    You arrested him on Bourbon Street? 
    What did you arrest him for? 
    Answer, Resisting an officer and vagrancy by loitering. 
    How did he resist you on Bourbon Street? 
    By attempting to walk off.

    It says here, have you discussed this case with any officers involved since May 7th? 
    No sir. 
    You didn’t discuss it with the same attorney? 
    You haven’t advised Mr. Marbelo or Adison as to what your testimony was? 
    I believe you stated that you put defendant under arrest. 
    He started to walk away and that is why you charged him with a resisting arrest. 
    Answer, As he attempted to walk off from us, yes. 
    Question, You had already informed him he was under arrest? 
    Yes. 
    Did you inform him as to what he was under arrest for? 
    Answer, Vagrancy by loitering. 
    Question, What was it he did that constituted loitering in your opinion? 
    We observed him standing in a 600 block of Bourbon Street. 
    The subject had no identification on this person. 
    He couldn’t show us anything. 
    What was it that constituted loitering? 
    Observed him standing in the 600 block of Bourbon Street. 
    I tried to get some identification. 
    He would not show us any. 
    He said he didn’t have any to show. 
    We questioned him about what he was doing there. 
    After some reluctance, he said he was going to a restaurant to get something to eat. 
    Was there anything else that led you to believe he was guilty of loitering? 
    And the Court said that objective now. 
    That would indicate. 
    It seems to me that he was arrested for vagrancy. 
    And when after that he was arrested for vagrancy, he started to walk away. 
    Now, how can you reconcile this testimony to what you have just said that he was arrested for all of these things at the police station?

    I just want to ask you the question about -- .
speaker="richard_c_seither" startTime="1520.825" stopTime="1762.709">
    Mr. Richard C. Seither 
    I didn’t mean to argue, Your Honor please I’m just citing (Voice Overlap) even the Civil Liberties, you need in there splendid brief said that the matter, it’s undetermined as to which he was arrested for first. 
    Now, that’s in the brief that was submitted by Civil Liberties Union. 
    Now it is my position that there is no question that the trial lawyer was trying to make out a case of -- you mean you’ve had an arrest to this man for vagrancy first and now you charge him with resisting an arrest that had not been made yet? 
    And when the police officer said that it was close, we don’t know which came first. 
    We arrest him all three simultaneously, it looked at that point as a very strong position for Mr. Wainwright because throughout this the early proceedings of this case, they persisted in calling this a charge of resisting arrest. 
    And the city has shown, and will show and that record shows, and the exact transcript for this, the man was charged with resisting an officer. 
    He was arraigned for resisting an officer. 
    The original affidavit which is in the record is on resisting an officer. 
    He was tried for resisting an officer Mr. Justice. 
    So it is (Inaudible) to the case. 
    There is one other thing why this is so important to me. 
    To me, it’s the most important part of the case, sir. 
    I direct this especially to Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    There is not a man in this Court room, Mr. Justice Douglas, who is more concerned personally or more in agreement with you when you said in that 1951, I think it’s a Carignan Case, that is the time audit system of the police to arrest a man for vagrancy, or for a lesser charge, so they could investigate a greater charge. 
    There is no community in the nation who agrees more with that, that it’s a wrong practice. 
    With me personally, it’s a very important matter because there’s a lot of guilt that attaches. 
    I was running the -- well the complaint desk for Mr. Leon Hubert between 1954 and 1956. 
    And there is no doubt that prior to 1957, we charged everybody with 107 vagrancy pending investigation of everything from murder to rape, to incest, to petty larceny but the difference, it has not been done since 1957. 
    I have made part of my response brief, an actual copy of the order put out by the police in 1957. 
    Mr. Hubert and I were instrumental in doing this. 
    We searched it out. 
    We realized we were wrong. 
    We saw the error of our ways. 
    And so we came in with this order, police order, which says effective in August of 1957. 
    There will be no more arrests on vagrancy pending investigation of anything. 
    And when you take the charge of vagrancy, it must stand on its own feet. 
    And what did we do in this case? 
    The thing that might be overlooked in this matter, since I was part and parcel of this bad system, if we charge a man with 107, pending investigation of murder, armed robbery, burglary, what not, if he were cleared on the burglary charge, the armed robbery, the 107 went out the window, we threw out the vagrancy charge. 
    That did not happen in this case. 
    Mr. Wainwright was cleared as a suspect in this murder the very morning of his arrest. 
    And yet the city persisted in prosecuting him on vagrancy. 
    The city persisted in going to that one resisting an arrest -- resisting an officer? 
    These were not holding charges. 
    As long as I am in the City of New Orleans, nobody will ever again take a lesser charge for purposes of pending investigation of a greater charge without running into a fight with me. 
    As Mr. Hubert and I, Jim Garrison he was part of that office, just beginning. 
    We all knew this was wrong. 
    And when we realize the error of our ways, we did away with it. 
    It was not done in this case, Mr. Justice and I want to assure you that it was not done in this case.

    Well, one thing when the police passed by and saw him resemble a suspect in murder of Johnny McTailor whom we were looking for, they stopped their car, backed up and went to talk to him. 
    Civil Liberties people make a lot out of the fact that he was only observed for five seconds. 
    There is no controversy on that evidence. 
    The police said we were passing by. 
    We saw this man he was standing there. 
    They don’t know whether he was standing there for an hour or five seconds. 
    They saw him for five seconds before they went over to talk to him. 
    Now, when they went to talk to him, they told him about the tattoo, etcetera.

    And the police refused to do it. 
    They have orders not to do it. 
    Their expression is, “If I take them there, we might be walking into the mouth of a cannon.” 
    Further, he had no draft card on him. 
    The man we were looking for was 8WOL from the Armed Services Mr. Johnny McTailor, the man whom he would show on the composite picture of him, said you resemble. 
    He said he was going to eat yet he had scarce funds on him.

    Mr. Richard C. Seither 
    I think this is the answer that you seek, Mr. Justice. 
    Had he shown his right arm? 
    As soon as they said, “Look man, we don’t want to arrest you. 
    We got a picture here, you are -- we got to out, perfect out. 
    The man we are searching for has a tattoo upon the (Inaudible) on his left arm. 
    Would you remove your jacket and let us see your left arm?” 
    He didn’t remove his jacket. 
    He refused to do it. 
    So they went on investigating for another four minutes. 
    It was not as he said, “Our stop is a suspect for murder and put vagrancy at you.” 
    It was then after four or five-minute interrogation that he was charged with resisting an officer and with vagrancy. 
    Now if at any time before he was booked, I mean charged, arrested for vagrancy or for resisting an officer, he had shown his arm, the matter is over. 
    Once he was arrested for resisting an officer and for vagrancy, the matter wouldn’t have ended no matter what he did because we did find out (Voice Overlap) –

    This was 1963. 
    This was before the hippies had invaded New Orleans or (Inaudible) or whatever the mold of the moment is, long before that.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose Mr. Wainwright had been extremely well-dressed and a $156 in his pocket. 
    And the identification card showed and demonstrated that instead of going to the law school, notorious behavior, lots of vagrants do that. 
    Instead of going to the law school, he was honestly employed somewhere. 
    But suppose that he looked exactly like Johnny McTailor, the police had a picture of Johnny McTailor, when they saw this well-dressed fellow walking down the street. 
    They went up to him and they said, “Will you remove your jacket so we could see if there is a tattoo on your arm?” 
    And he said, “No.” 
    Now what could the police have done other than -- let’s assume that I wasn’t wrong but just for this question let’s assume he is wrong for the charging with vagrancy.
speaker="richard_c_seither" startTime="2319.558" stopTime="2321.683">

    That’s right because he look behind.

    Now he says, “I’m not going to remove my jacket.” 
    It’s an impolitely kind of a exposure that I being an employed gentleman and not employed law student don’t believe him. 
    What could he have done?

    Now this is not arrest on suspicion. 
    It is not suspicion alone if they wanted to arrest this man on suspicion alone. 
    As soon as they saw it, they got out of the car and say, “Hey, you look like this murderer. 
    We arrest you for murder.” 
    But they didn’t do that. (Voice Overlap) 
    --And when he refused Mr. Fortas, nothing happened. 
    It’s not just a hypothetical case.

    Mr. Richard C. Seither

    We don’t do that in New Orleans because that would amount to vagrancy pending investigation.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2477.547" stopTime="2511.093">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I heard what you said. 
    You don’t do that in New Orleans. 
    But here, they arrested him for vagrancy. 
    Let's suppose that it isn't for (Inaudible) charge and what I'm suggesting is perhaps at issue here is that it changed the facts as I've indicated or elucidate facts the way I've tried to do it. 
    The question is not whether that was the cause of his arrest but whether he was arrested on a charge that was not justified in the circumstances.
speaker="richard_c_seither" startTime="2511.093" stopTime="2623.405">
    Mr. Richard C. Seither 
    I appreciate the question, Your Honor. 
    And we say that was not done. 
    We say it was done because he was charged of resisting an officer, for walking away three times. 
    We tried to make out a guess at the composite picture made out of case of vagrancy. 
    As a matter of fact, it was not, this is the one thing that's most important to us. 
    If we charge him with vagrancy under the circumstances that presented here today, then I couldn't face you and say it, we are not charging people with vagrancy pending investigation or something because that's precisely what would have had happened. 
    But in this case, we persisted in the charge. 
    Now the one important thing in the old days when we did this wrongly, as soon as the man was cleared as a murder suspect, the vagrancy went out the window. 
    That didn't happen here. 
    We thought we had a good concrete charge of vagrancy. 
    We took it to court. 
    We tried it. 
    We also did the same with resisting arrest, of resisting an officer and he was convicted. 
    And the judge of the Criminal District Court, our appellate court even reversed this on resisting an officer but does he fell for the argument that it was resisting arrest, and had he been not placed under arrest first for vagrancy. 
    Then how could you resist an arrest that wasn't first made. 
    And so it looked very strong for American Civil Liberties Union when they brought out in the testimony, in this Court I'm talking about, Your Honor please. 
    The second time, the second go around of Officer Beopple, when they said, “Which did you do first?” He said, “I did all three simultaneously.” 
    So this is very strong to defeat the resisting arrest article because if he had not been arrested first for vagrancy, then how can he resist an arrest that had not been made yet.

    Mr. Richard C. Seither 
    That's precisely our case. 
    That all the other things had nothing to do with the fact that he stands convicted up here. 
    I wrote in brief but I say here, the only thing properly before the Court in the city's view is the uncontroverted evidence that this man butted these police officers from wall to wall and say, put himself down like a full bag running through a line and butted these men from wall to wall. 
    That went uncontroverted. 
    This was said in front of Mr. Wainwright in the Court of Law. 
    And when he had a chance to controvert, he took the stand. 
    I know if it would be fairly defective for me to comment on his refusal to take the stand but he took the stand. 
    In his total testimony, it's less than a page, with them making all these statements but he didn't deny anything. 
    That's what I mean when I say it went un-controverted. 
    I agree Mr. Justice White and I have two cases that I wanted to cite when you ask me too. 
    That I think this case goes off on the whole case of 1910. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall raised a question yesterday, the whole case which was reasserted in Schmerber as being the leading case in the considerations in Schmerber. 
    They had made this man model of glass. 
    And since then, I think it has been held repeatedly through the years. 
    I'd like to jeopardize the whole cases where an exploratory search of the body -- if you want to use the word search, is permissible. 
    Certainly, if we could have a bloodletting, Mr. Justice Douglas or an intrusion into the bloodstream to get evidence against a person, we can certainly ask him to remove his jacket for all purpose of search. 
    But the city contends there was never any search made here.

    We never did order him to do anything until we've got to the precinct station. 
    And there, nothing was done for some 15 minutes. 
    They called the lieutenant. 
    They said, “We know how to handle this.” 
    Lieutenant explained to him before we can -- of course we think legally the whole case, would say if you can examine a person in exploratory search of the body for identifying marks. 
    The whole case says this, Astriago (ph) says it but to answer your question Mr. Justice, as a matter of fact, he was not ordered to take off anything at the Bourbon Street scene.

    I must say, I've not understand the relevance of any of these.

    And let's just assume, assume without deciding that his constitutional rights were violated as a result of which he found himself in custody in a police station. 
    Isn't the basic issue in this case, whether or not he had the right of self-help as against that violation? 
    Did he have a right to assault those police officers?

    Mr. Wulf --
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3889.418" stopTime="3916.873">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Let me just clarify what the situation is about this trial. 
    That's all I want to say. 
    He was first tried on vagrancy reviling and resisting. 
    The statement on this case, at the end of the State's case, they discontinued that case and filed the three new charges against him which were two charges of disturbing the peace for assaulting the police officers and the resistance. 
    It's the latter three which are actually before this Court to review.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What judgment do we have before?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3926.165" stopTime="3930.874">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    The actual judge is on the two charges of breach of the peace for assaulting a policeman.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3930.874" stopTime="3937.004">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that's all we have before us, isn't it? 
    By way of judgment of the Court of Louisiana.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3937.004" stopTime="3945.592">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    That's right sir. 
    But of course, but our theory is that these cannot be examined without examining the prior arrest on the street.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3945.592" stopTime="3948.674">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why is that so? 
    Can you explain to me?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3948.674" stopTime="3949.768">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Because we --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3949.768" stopTime="3967.124">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Are you claiming that (Inaudible) on the street that he refused for butting his head against the officers in the court alley?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3967.124" stopTime="3968.045">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Yes, we're saying that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3968.045" stopTime="3970.819">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's what you have to get down to it.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3970.819" stopTime="3979.243">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    That's what we're saying, Your Honor. 
    We're saying that because he was in custody in violation of the constitution that the search of his -- the attempted search was unlawful --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3979.243" stopTime="3990.509">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I'm talking about the assault, that you're excused for the assault here that he had been mistreated by the officers in an entirely separate case down on the street.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3990.509" stopTime="3992.067">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    No, not mistreated, Your Honor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3992.067" stopTime="3995.337">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, whatever it is. 
    Whatever was done to him --
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3995.337" stopTime="3996.049">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Yes, but you've further --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3996.049" stopTime="4004.923">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You say he had a right to do it, rush in and butt his head against the officers, pushed them against the wall because of what they had done to him on the street.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="4004.923" stopTime="4014.406">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    I said, yes. 
    We say he has the constitutional right to resist an unconstitutional search.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4014.406" stopTime="4017.570">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What he was doing there was to butt his head against them.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="4017.570" stopTime="4018.878">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    But --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4018.878" stopTime="4019.932">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's the charge.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="4019.932" stopTime="4034.159">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    But that's current in the course of the police officers' attempting to take off his jacket in order to see whether he had the tattoo. 
    That was the scuffle. 
    It was intimately, directly related to the attempted search.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4034.159" stopTime="4047.050">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, it's a little more than that, isn't it Mr. Wulf? 
    If I understand the position and perhaps I don't. 
    You're also relying on the allegedly unconstitutional arrest.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="4047.050" stopTime="4047.561">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Absolutely.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4047.561" stopTime="4112.879">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    If I understand your position that's in two frights. 
    Number one that he was brought in to the police station in violation of the constitutional rights that being no probable cause for his arrest. 
    Number two, that in the police station, the officers attempted to do what you call a search and that is to remove his jacket, in violation of these constitutional rights. 
    But in those circumstances, is that your position as I understand it, that he was at liberty to physically to resist what he proceeded to do and he had a right to resist the search because of those two violations to which I'm referring. 
    And he could not be convicted for disorderly conduct that is resisting a police officer.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="4112.879" stopTime="4116.577">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    That is precisely our position, Your Honor.
