    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    May it please this Honorable Court. 
    This case comes before you on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and you will review an order of disbarring petitioner, John Ruffalo Jr. in that court. 
    That order was in turn based upon action of the Supreme Court of Ohio, that action being not here for review. 
    Ohio had suspended Ruffalo on two charges. 
    The Court of Appeals found that one charge justified disbarment from its roles. 
    The District Court had earlier reviewed, the Ohio disbarment had found that neither charge justified the striking of Ruffalo from the rules, but after the Court of Appeals opinion, the District Court entered a second order saying that although still convinced that he was right, he would bow to the judgment of his superior court.

    In words, no lawyer who has ever been suspended in Ohio has ever been reinstated as you may know. 
    But technically, after two years, he can apply for readmission. 
    He can take the bar again if he is given the right to, by the Supreme Court. 
    It is not total disbarment for life. 
    There is a right to reapply.

    Is that so?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="142.924" stopTime="217.468">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    There is one pending now where there are some speculation he may be, and so it will be unique. 
    But the case involves chiefly one Michael Orlando. 
    He was a nightshift inspector, a car inspector for the B.&amp; O. Railroad. 
    He bled the air from the break systems of incoming cars. 
    I make this point as to his non-trust, non-confidential, non-secret position because he has been described in other opinions as an espionage agent, as secret agent planted in the shops. 
    I do want to make it clear that in the sense of espionage, he had no access to anything worth extracting from company files. 
    He was an investigator. 
    He had general knowledge of railroad and useful to Ruffalo and the ability to talk to railroad men in railroader's language which his useful to any lawyer who has a railroad case. 
    In the Ohio practice, charges are tried first before a panel of three lawyers. 
    Their record and findings are reviewed by a board of 17. 
    Their decision is reviewed in turn by the Supreme Court of Ohio which says it has final authority to say what the facts are and what should be done.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="217.468" stopTime="220.748">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Does the Ohio Supreme Court appoint those 17 people?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="220.748" stopTime="224.084">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    They appoint the Board of Commissioners, that's the 17.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="224.084" stopTime="224.867">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The 17?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="224.867" stopTime="226.887">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    The panel comes from the Board.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="226.887" stopTime="230.061">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    From those 17, for what? 
    Four-year terms, is it?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="230.061" stopTime="371.889">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    I don't know the length of the term. 
    It's a long term. 
    They are not appointed for the case. 
    They are a standing board. 
    The original charges had been developed against Ruffalo by detectives of the American Association of Railroads presented to the Local Bar Association, which invoked the hearings. 
    Before the panel of three conducting the primary hearing, there were two charges that had to do with Ruffalo. 
    One, that Ruffalo through -- through two charges that had to do with Orlando, one, that Ruffalo, through Orlando, had solicited the claim of a Sam Cotellesse against the P&amp;LE Railroad, that was charge four. 
    Charge five, that Ruffalo had attempted to solicit through Orlando the claim of one Quinn against the B.&amp; O. 
    Both charges were dismissed by the panel at the first level for one of any evidence. 
    During the hearing on those charges which were unsupported and later to be dismissed, Ruffalo, the respondent, was himself called for cross-examination under Ohio practice and testified before the panel, defending himself on the charge of solicitation through Orlando. 
    He said that Orlando was only an investigator who gave Ruffalo expert advice on general railroading practices, who located witnesses, sometimes interviewed them, sometimes -- and often drove witnesses to courts so they would be available to testify. 
    Orlando investigated all of Ruffalo's railroad cases, some of them were against the B &amp; O. 
    No evidence was ever developed to any greater extent as to just what Orlando did. 
    For example, there is no evidence that he ever investigated a case in the yard in which he worked, certainly, no evidence that he ever investigated at night when he should have been on duty on his own railroad. 
    Ruffalo said he paid him piece work, $25.00 a day and expenses and the mathematic shows that he averages 10 days a month or thereabout which is consistent with Orlando's own testimony. 
    Orlando was called, he testified to the same extent. 
    After these --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="371.889" stopTime="376.501">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How these two men came together? 
    How did Orlando come to be employed?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="376.501" stopTime="394.757">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    No, the record doesn't show that except that it shows that Orlando was a former client of Ruffalo's and had worked for Ruffalo as an investigator for many years, not only in railroad cases. 
    He also did some work in trucking cases.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="394.757" stopTime="412.167">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Didn't I see in the records, somewhere a testimony by Mr. Ruffalo, saying that one of the things he learned early including from his father, who is in the practice before him, that “If you're going to be a successful plaintiff's lawyer in railroad cases, you have to get yourself a railroad man.”
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="412.167" stopTime="421.256">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    Yes, he had said that generally (Voice Overlap). 
    If there's intellectual curiosity about Orlando, he had worked for John's father before him, John Ruffalo, Sr. was a well-known railroad lawyer.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="421.256" stopTime="422.656">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I think that's in the record, Mr. Spangenberg, if I'm not mistaken.
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="422.656" stopTime="507.901">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    Yes, If i not mistaken. 
    And then after Ruffalo, Sr.died, Orlando continued to work for John, Jr. and had work for him since 1953. 
    That is in the record. 
    That was after this testimony came in that the panel added the charge, in these words that Ruffalo did conspire with Orlando and paid Orlando moneys for preparing lawsuits against the B.&amp; O., the employer of Orlando, well knowing that the practice was deceptive and was morally and legally wrong as respects Orlando toward his employer. 
    I note here they didn't say it was wrong for Ruffalo to prepare his case as well. 
    They said it was wrong for Orlando toward Orlando's employer and therefore wrong for Ruffalo to use Orlando when Orlando was doing something that is disloyal to his employer. 
    At the time the charge was added, the examiner said that the only evidence he was depending upon is that from Ruffalo's own lips to you, gentlemen, and then that from Orlando saying, “We don't have anything else to support it”. 
    However, they did give Ruffalo time to answer the charge based on what he had already said in which was a fairly meaningless procedure since there was nothing to add or take away from it. 
    Now, I realized that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="507.901" stopTime="510.946">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What was their decision on that issue?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="510.946" stopTime="800.863">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    The panel said that was wrong. 
    The Supreme Court of Ohio said that a man who would hire an employee and investigated to work against the interest of his general employer was not morally fit to be a member of the bar of the State of Ohio. 
    The Court of -- the District Court said, “No”. 
    They thought it was a proper practice. 
    The Court of Appeals, said that if we -- the profession of high-minded man must rely upon planting secret agents in the shops of those we call to account, we cannot hope to enjoy public respect and they would not find it unreasonable for Ohio to say that this would justify disbarment. 
    This is the one ground on which the Court of Appeals said that Ruffalo should be disbarred from the Court of Appeals. 
    So far as our position in this Court is concerned, I realized that you said in Theard that the state court finding brought title deeds of high respect. 
    But I realize also that in Selling, you said that you had a duty not to disbar unless constrained to do so by principles of right and justice. 
    We all recognized that to a trial lawyer of the law is his life. 
    If you take that from him, you have taken a great deal. 
    But our position generally is that even a lawyer is entitled to due process when he is brought up on charges, and chiefly, that he ought to have the right to know in advance that what he is doing will be called to account before some reviewing court. 
    I would think also that this Court would look to the right of the client, the right of the public to have his case well-prepared. 
    Here, I realized that the Court of Appeals said, “Present rules of discovery will do all you need to do.” 
    I'm afraid the Court of Appeals' judges who wrote that have never been down on the battleground trying cases. 
    You can't have discovery on the federal practice until you file the petition, you can't file the petition unless you have some idea what the accident was about, and indeed, discovery presupposes that we both investigate. 
    The defendant then asked me what I have found out, I asked him what he has found out. 
    To give discovery to the defendant, I must do some preparation. 
    As a practical matter too, it helps when you prepare an interrogatory to know what the information is you're trying to seek, and I would think that a blind reliance on no preparation at all, with the simply list of interrogatories after you filed a lawsuit on which you don't know whether you ought to believe or not, does not really serve the client well. 
    Our Canon of Ethics would deny to railroad employees, in the Sixth Circuit at least, effective legal assistance can hardly be justified unless it really involves some basic immorality. 
    But let's take a simple example, Your Honors. 
    Suppose a widow calls me, I do some railroad work, not a great deal, but some, says her husband has been killed on the railroad. 
    She has no real knowledge what happens. 
    She's heard some rumors, in those cases and they have happened. 
    It's commonplace to call a former client who you know works on the railroad and ask him if he will come in and tell you what he knows, what has he heard, and what area of the yard did it happen, what track, what generally is the story around the yard as to how the accident happened. 
    And these men generally are willing to come in but always with a caveat. 
    I'll have to mark off if I do, “Will you pay me for my time?” 
    Well, of course, you'll pay him for his time. 
    In the same way in an admiralty case who will pay a seaman first time to come in and tell us what is the layout of the boat. 
    What kind of tackle? 
    What kind of equipment was involved in the accident? 
    And lawyers do pay money to employees of corporate defendant for information necessary to get some knowledge of the case and to lead them into further exploration. 
    But the simple act of like paying an employee of say the River Terminal Railroad, to come in and tell what he has heard, would now be condemned by the holding of the Supreme Court of Ohio because there is no question but that it is a payment of money to a general employee for information helpful in preparing a case against that railroad.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="800.863" stopTime="821.929">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But isn't there a narrow point here which is -- that is alleged in a way as I understand it, that Orlando for a pay advised Mr. Ruffalo with respect to cases against Orlando's employer.
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="821.929" stopTime="822.947">

    Yes, Your Honor.

    I am presupposing --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="826.672" stopTime="837.365">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That raises a real problem, doesn't it, whether or not it's grounds for disbarment that does ordinary practicing lawyers mind, that would raise a real problem, wouldn't it, Mr. Spangenberg?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="837.365" stopTime="851.969">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    I'm giving you the same example and that the widow said her husband was called on the River Terminal. 
    The only one who'll know about that is a River Terminal employee and which I'm quite likely to find one and ask him to come in and tell me about it and pay him the first time.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="851.969" stopTime="870.637">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Would you think it's all right for lawyer, I don't want to personally any of these questions, would you think it would be all right for a lawyer having a case against the B.&amp; O. Railroad who calls some employee of the B.&amp; O. for advice or assistance?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="870.637" stopTime="892.388">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    Yes, I think he would do better to call a B.&amp; O. man than a Pennsy man if he wants to know what the track layout was, where the latter goes, what the rip track -- where the rip track located and so forth. 
    A yard layout should do get from a man who works in the yard or who has worked in the yard.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Then so far as the relationship between employer and employee is concerned, would it made any difference to the Supreme Court of Ohio and if there are no money in past hence?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="905.948" stopTime="933.316">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    Apparently so, they made a good deal of the point of the statute, Section 60 of FELA that makes it illegal to try, for the railroad to try and keep its employees from giving information as written in terms of voluntarily furnishing information. 
    So they said that although Orlando, as an employee, could voluntarily give the information he couldn't be paid for giving the information to Ruffalo.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="933.316" stopTime="934.587">

    Yes, it's all they said.

    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    Well, Your Honors, you have said in Theard and in Selling that you would review the state court proceedings to see whether or not the respondent received due process in the state court. 
    This against the argument generally made its unseemly to the federal court to retain on its roles, a lawyer who has been disbarred by the state. 
    It is rather more unseemly to strike him from your roles if he was disbarred from the state in complete contravention of our fundamental notions of due process because you are a Constitutional Court.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1287.025" stopTime="1312.712">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I suppose, you mean in so far as the Court of Appeals may have reached its conclusion based upon what the Ohio Supreme Court did, are you arguing that because he was denied due process as you submit in the state proceeding, then necessarily, the Court of Appeals could not have relied upon the state judgment in any respect, is that it?
speaker="craig_spangenberg" startTime="1312.712" stopTime="1558.797">
    Mr. Craig Spangenberg 
    Yes. 
    I say also that -- I would hope this Court would reverse at least the language of the Court of Appeals which said that due process does not require bar associations to fashion that Canon of Ethics, to define the impermissible conduct in advance. 
    What the Court of Appeals said was, our profession is not summarily and ethically naïve as to need advanced definition of what is and what is not the impermissible behavior. 
    To me, this is a critical point.I think lawyers do need advanced definition from some source. 
    It may be that the wrong is so universally recognized that you need not spell it out, but for a course of conduct that has been followed by lawyers from time in memorial, I think you do need advance definition when you're going to say, from now on this is improper and we will disbar a man who did it before we ever said it was improper. 
    To say that you cannot pay for information is to say that every district attorney in the United States should be disbarred, I would assume, if he uses the information that comes from a paid informer who actually breaches someone's trust which isn't much go as much deeper than this business of using a simple yard laborer as an investigator. 
    And note, Ohio had said that misconduct, as a defined offense, consists of a violation of the Canon of Professional Ethics. 
    There are 47 of those who any lawyer could read through the 47 and know generally what he could do and what he could not do. 
    But if they say this is misconduct, and then they do, misconduct is defined as the term as used herein, says Ohio, as a violation of the Canons of Professional Ethics. 
    No one has been able to find anywhere in all of the 47 Canons where this kind of views of an investigator violates anything or even comes close to violating a Canon of Ethics. 
    Now this was the argument I made in the Court of Appeals, saying it is not wrong to which the Court of Appeals said that due process doesn't require the Bar Association to fashion a Canon of Ethics in advance on this ground that our lawyers are just not ethically naïve. 
    I quote the Court exactly in language that I've said in my brief. 
    I thought it was rather prim, if a lawyer can read all of Draco's legal ethics, which is the leading text, read all the Canons and read every decision in the United States and find no word anywhere that hiring a man like Orlando is wrong, then on what -- how does due process get satisfied? 
    How do you reconcile this with Lanzetta, with Connolly, with Giaccio, with Bouie where you've said in every kind of proceeding, where there is to be some criminal or quasi-criminal penalty, an advanced definition is needed. 
    And particularly, when you give an advanced definition, this is your decision in Bouie of course, if you give an advanced definition as Ohio has saying, it's a violation of a Canon of Ethics, how can you then say you have satisfied due process when retroactively you expend and say any kind of conduct that we deem to show who are moral character will be enough to justify disbarment even though it doesn't violate the Canon of Ethics? 
    Thank you, Your Honors. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Thomas V. Koykka

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Koykka?
speaker="thomas_v_koykka" startTime="1560.477" stopTime="1676.285">
    Mr. Thomas V. Koykka 
    May it please the Court. 
    We should have in mind what it is that John Ruffalo was disbarred for. 
    I can give that to the Court most clearly by quoting to you what it was that the Court of Appeals said. 
    The Court of Appeals said that one who hires an experienced lawyer, and here was a lawyer John Ruffalo who had 18 years of experience at the bar practicing in Youngstown, Ohio, to act as an undercover agent to obtain evidence and information for use in suits against his own employer does not exhibit the fair character and the integrity which must be the mark of a lawyer. 
    The Court said, “We do not believe we should say to today's society of whom we ask that our profession be held in high regard that we do not have the ability to represent our clients except through planting secret agents in the shops of those we call to account in the Courts. 
    If this kind of espionage is -- has become a way of life in some of today's business, more is expected of a lawyer, then that they conform to the minimal standards of the marketplace.

    Yes, the dishonesty was enlisting an employee in the very camp of the party he was suing to develop evidence against that party.

    My question is, that if the association of railroads had been investigating Orlando and Ruffalo, let's say five or more years, well at least during that period, Orlando wouldn't have been a “secret” agent?

    Mr. Thomas V. Koykka 
    They were investigating on the business of soliciting and not -- it never apparently occurred to them that he was actually investigating cases against the railroad because that fact never appeared until Mr. Ruffalo said, “That is my defense to the charge of solicitation.”

    Against the B.&amp; O., yes, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2567.771" stopTime="2581.317">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And did those relate to the area of Mr. Orlando's own employment for the B.&amp; O.'s? 
    Does the record show?
speaker="thomas_v_koykka" startTime="2581.317" stopTime="2708.506">
    Mr. Thomas V. Koykka 
    The record does not show. 
    And may I say, with respect to that -- the point suggested by that question in the argument made by Mr. Spangenberg that it seems to us not to be an answer to say that this lawyer or that Mike Orlando did not investigate in any area where -- which involves his own work nor is it an answer to say that he did not filch record from the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad and that he had no access, that we say is beside the point as Mr. Judge Edwards who dissented in the Court of Appeals said, “The employment of a -- in dealing with that specific argument made there that his work involved no supervisory responsibilities.” 
    Judge Edwards gave this answer and I submit that it is the answer this Court ought to accept, “I cannot avoid concluding that Orlando's access to the B.&amp; O. property and personnel would be of potential value to respondent and that it would sometimes be impossible, probably even for Orlando to know when he was working for the railroad and when he was investigating for respondent.” 
    Now, I started to say that this relationship started in 1953 and when the charge was first made, Mr. Ruffalo said, “I want you to amend that charge.” 
    He had been subjected to discipline in the Ohio Courts for misconduct in 1957 and he said, this charge should begin from 1957 and go on forward and whether the commission could have gone earlier than that, it's not a matter of concern here because the commission exceeded to that request and the charge was amended, the charge that this relationship and the investigating cases against his own employer started in 1957 and continued until midyear in 1961.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you are going to draw a line then between the continuous course of dealing with an employee because I don't suppose you would deny that a lawyer in investigating his client's case may call on fellow employees and a fellow employee may give him as much information as he has about the accident.
speaker="thomas_v_koykka" startTime="2730.471" stopTime="2732.694">
    Mr. Thomas V. Koykka

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And let's assume –- let's assume that that lawyer constantly goes to a particular foreman, a yard foreman where almost these accidents occur, the yard foreman readily and voluntarily gives in all the information he had. 
    A lawyer must be able to do that.
speaker="thomas_v_koykka" startTime="2749.864" stopTime="2760.292">
    Mr. Thomas V. Koykka

speaker="thomas_v_koykka" startTime="2761.847" stopTime="2788.502">
    Mr. Thomas V. Koykka 
    The line is hiring an employee as a regular course of conduct. 
    And I think it would be wrong for him to say, “I want you to investigate this case against the railroad for me in this one instance.” 
    I think that would be wrong but that isn't this case. 
    But if he merely says, “There has been an accident on the railroad. 
    I want you to tell me whatever you know about it”. 
    That would be perfectly proper.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2788.502" stopTime="2810.576">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Should we say the yard foreman -- if the yard foreman says to him, “Sorry, I don't know anything about that,” and the lawyer said, “Well, could you please find out about it for me and tell me whom I may talk to.” 
    And that yard foreman investigates and calls him up the next night and says, “The fellows who really know about this are John and Jack and they tell me this,” and that's wrong.

    Mr. Thomas V. Koykka 
    The Railroad Adjustment Board does not so view this practice in the very case that they cite. 
    What the Board did was to say that a railroad employee may tell whatever he knows about an accident but that, in that case, the firing was proper because the employee there took a stranger onto the railroad premises and took a picture of a structure that was involved in a suit.

    Do you have any Railroad Adjustment Board cases that sustain firings on facts like these?
speaker="thomas_v_koykka" startTime="2966.819" stopTime="3059.638">
    Mr. Thomas V. Koykka 
    No, but what the Board said in that very case, it said only that he has a right to tell what he knows about an accident, period. 
    And I say that cannot be read to justify this. 
    Next, the only case that I know of where the Railroad Adjustment Board held that an employee was improperly fired was a case where also the employee took the stranger onto the premises, took a photograph of a spiral stairway, permitted the stranger to take the photograph of a stairway which was a subject of a lawsuit. 
    After all, that could be a more truthful representation on what was there on the photograph and the employee said now, “I wasn't warned and there was nothing in this employment contract that said I couldn't do this kind of thing,” and the National Railroad Adjustment Board said, “You shouldn't have been fired.” 
    The Court -- District Court reversed that and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed or held that it was properly reversed saying in an opinion Mr. Judge Gilliam said, “What could he have done that would have been more detrimental to his employer, than assuming the employ -- than assisting the employer's adversary in litigation” and that is exactly what Ruffalo did in this case.

    Mr. Thomas V. Koykka 
    I think it is wrong because of what I read, for example, in the rule of this Court, “The only standard this Court lays down for disbarment is conduct unbecoming a member of the profession.” 
    I think that the standards that are established for the legal profession by this Court in its rule, the same rule is enjoined upon the Courts of Appeal in the new rules that is going into effect and by the decisions of our own Supreme Court where our Court has held that any lawyer brings disbarment or discipline upon himself for -- for conduct which brings discredit upon himself or the Courts.

    Mr. Koykka, you made this an important issue in your case, the fact that this lawyer had failed to use a customary practice in paying this employee that he paid the others by check and he paid this one in cash so that other people would know it. 
    How do you distinguish that from the employment by the government of Partin in the Hoffa case where they use every kind of circumvention they could think of to prevent anybody from knowing that public funds were expended for this purpose?

    I know your time has expired but I want to ask you one question to explore the perimeter of this doctrine that you're stating. 
    Suppose a lawyer's client -- suppose a lawyer works for an industrial company in Ohio and the president of the company comes to him and says, “You know, we have some litigation against company X and I paid a thousand dollars to one of the employees of company X that came to us. 
    He came to us voluntarily on his own initiative and he gave us some information that's useful in that litigation and the lawyer proceeds to use that information in the litigation. 
    Would the doctrine that you are here stating extend to disbarment of that lawyer? 
    In other words, the lawyer knowingly uses in litigation information that has been supplied at the initiative of an employee of the adversary in litigation and for which that employee has been paid.
