    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 93-1988, Ticor Title Insurance Company versus Brown. 
    In a Per Curiam opinion filed with the Clerk this morning, it is ordered that the writ be dismissed as improvidently granted. 
    Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which I and Justice Kennedy have joined.
