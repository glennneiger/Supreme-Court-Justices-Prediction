    Unknown Speaker 
    On behalf of the court I also have the judgment to announce in No. 93-609, Morgan Stanley and Company versus the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company. 
    Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of the case, and the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is affirmed by an equally divided Court.
