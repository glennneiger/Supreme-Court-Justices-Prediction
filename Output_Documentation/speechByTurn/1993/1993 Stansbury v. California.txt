    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 93-5770, Stansbury against California. 
    For reasons set forth in a Per Curiam opinion filed with the Clerk today, the judgment of the Supreme Court of California is reversed and the case is remanded to that court.
