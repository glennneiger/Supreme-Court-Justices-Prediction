    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In the second of the two opinions I have to announce is 92-1949, Davis against the United States. 
    And here, petitioner, Davis, is a member of the United States Navy. 
    A serviceman was murdered on the Charleston Navy Base and the investigation by the NIS, the Naval Investigative Service, gradually focused on petitioner. 
    After being advised of his rights to remain silent and to counsel, he agreed to talk with NIS agents. 
    About an-hour-and-a-half into the interview, he said "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer." 
    The agents asked him whether he was asking for a lawyer or just making a comment about a lawyer, and he said "no, I am not asking for a lawyer", and, "no, I do not want a lawyer." 
    The agents then continued questioning him. 
    The Trial Court declined to suppress the incriminating statements he made during the interview finding that he had not requested counsel and that the agents properly determine that he was not indicating a desire to have an attorney present. 
    He was convicted of murder and the Military Appellate Court upheld his conviction. 
    We granted certiorari in the case to resolve a conflict among the State and Federal Courts with respect to how law enforcement officers should respond to the suspect's ambiguous or equivocal request for counsel. 
    In an opinion filed today with the Clerk and authored by Justice O'Connor, we affirm the judgment below. 
    In our Miranda decision back in 1966, we held that a suspect is entitled to the assistance of counsel during custodial interrogation even though the Constitution does not provide for such assistance. 
    In our 1981 Edwards decision, we held that if the suspect invokes the right to counsel anytime the policeman immediately seize questioning until an attorney is present. 
    But we are unwilling to create a third layer of prophylaxis to prevent police questioning when the suspect might want a lawyer. 
    Unless the suspect actually requests an attorney by making a statement that a reasonable officer in the light of the circumstances would understand to be an invocation of the right to counsel questioning may continue. 
    The courts below found that petitioner's remark to the NIS agent "maybe I should talk to a lawyer" was not a request for counsel and we so no reason to disturb that conclusion. 
    The NIS agents, therefore, were not required to stop questioning petitioner though it was entirely proper for them if they wished to clarify whether he wanted a lawyer. 
    Accordingly, there is no ground for suppression of petitioner's statements and the judgments of the lower courts are affirmed. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Souter has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Blackmun, Stevens, Ginsburg join.
