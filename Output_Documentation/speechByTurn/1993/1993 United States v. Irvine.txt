United States v. Irvine

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-1546, United States v. John Irvine and First Trust National Association. 
    Mr. Jones.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="11.949" stopTime="212.561">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    In 1917, Lucius Ordway formed a trust with substantial assets. 
    Each of his grandchildren, including Sally Ordway Irvine, was given a remainder interest in the trust. 
    By 1931, when Mrs. Irvine was 21 years old, she was aware of her remainder interest. 
    In 1966, when her father died, she became entitled to receive and did receive each year a portion of the income from the trust. 
    In 1979, when the trust terminated, Mrs. Irvine was entitled to receive one-thirteenth of the corpus of the trust, which then exceeded $1/2 billion in value. 
    Mrs. Irvine at that time was 68 years old and had five adult children. 
    She determined that she did not need her entire share of this enormous fortune, and filed a written disclaimer of a portion of her interest in the trust. 
    Under the disclaimer, each of her children received one-sixteenth of her interest in the trust. 
    Mrs. Irvine retained the remaining eleven sixteenths of her interest for herself. 
    The Federal gift tax supplements the estate tax by imposing a tax on any direct and indirect transfer of property by gift. 
    The question presented in this case is whether Mrs. Irvine's 1979 disclaimer of five-sixteenths of her interest in the trust represents a gratuitous transfer of property to which the gift tax applies. 
    Many of the issues presented in this case have already been resolved by the Court. 
    Since 1943, in Smith v. Shaughnessy, it has been established that a remainder interest in a trust is a form of property, to which the gift tax applies, and the fact that the remainder interest is subject to defeasance goes only to the value of that interest and not to its character as property. 
    The only other question posed by the statute is whether the disclaimer of such an interest in property represents a transfer of that property for purposes of the gift tax, and in 1982, in Jewett v. Commissioner, this Court held that it does. 
    The Court accepted the interpretation of the Commissioner that a disclaimer that is not made within a reasonable time after the taxpayer learns of his interest in the property is an indirect transfer of property to which the gift tax applies. 
    The Court explained that the passage of time is crucial to the gift tax scheme. 
    With the passage of time, the taxpayer can decide whether to retain the property for himself or allow it to pass to the next generation. 
    The analysis of the Court in Jewett obviously applies directly to Mrs. Irvine's long-delayed disclaimer in this case. 
    The court of appeals concluded, however, that the gift tax does not apply to this 1979 disclaimer solely because the interest that was disclaimed was created in 1917, before the gift tax was enacted. 
    The Court's analysis ultimately rests upon its acceptance of a legal fiction.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What section are we talking about here, Mr. Jones?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="214.001" stopTime="215.454">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    What section of the Internal Revenue Code?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="215.454" stopTime="226.399">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, where... that the court of appeals relied on, the fact that it was not created by that particular date.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="226.399" stopTime="252.657">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    The section of the code that is relevant would be section 2511, but I think that the answer to your question is that in the enactment of the Federal gift tax there was a provision that says that this statute will not apply to any transfer prior to the date of enactment, and so it was that retroactive... it was that feature of the statute that the court had in mind.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="252.657" stopTime="258.750">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, the Eighth Circuit also relied on one section or subsection that talked about something being a taxable transfer, didn't it?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="258.750" stopTime="263.035">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, that was a different portion of the court's rationale that I haven't yet discussed.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="263.035" stopTime="264.654">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Okay. 
    You're going to get to that?

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="265.285" stopTime="265.976">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Okay.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="265.976" stopTime="322.473">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    At this point, what I'm pointing out is that the court's analysis ultimately rests upon its acceptance of a legal fiction about disclaimers. 
    Under State law, a valid disclaimer is treated as if it were made ab initio, at the same time that the initial transfer was made, and that State legal fiction is designed to protect the property from the intervening claims of creditors and other third parties, but in Jewett the court explained that those State law concerns do not control application of the Federal gift tax, and that's because the State legal fiction is counterfactual. 
    It is only a fiction and not a fact that a long-delayed disclaimer is made ab initio. 
    In this case, for example, Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer was made 62 years after the trust was formed and a full half-century after she reached her age of majority.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="322.473" stopTime="330.808">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But under State law principles, it would be treated as having occurred back in 1917?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="330.808" stopTime="338.773">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    That is correct. 
    Under State law principles, the State deems the disclaimer to have been made ab initio.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="338.773" stopTime="350.450">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And in Jewett, did this Court indicate, the majority, that State law supplies the answer in cases before the promulgation of the 1958 regulation?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="350.450" stopTime="370.235">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    No, to the contrary, the Court held in Jewett that a disclaimer represents an indirect transfer and then looked to the regulation to determine the limitations on that analysis that the Secretary had reached in issuing the interpretive regulation that was in effect at that time.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="370.235" stopTime="379.151">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you take the position that in light of Jewett there is no way that the court of appeals judgment here can be affirmed?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="379.151" stopTime="421.378">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I think Jewett and Jacobs, read together, answer all the questions in this case. 
    Jewett answers the question of whether this is an indirect transfer of property by gift. 
    Jacobs and Estate of Sanford answer the question of whether this gift tax is applied retroactively when it's applied to a transfer that occurs after the date of enactment but with respect to an interest that was created before the date of enactment, and what the Court squarely held in Jacobs and Estate of Sanford is that the gift tax retroactivity... nonretroactivity requirement has nothing to do with a tax that's imposed on a transfer that occurs after enactment.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="421.378" stopTime="425.792">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    In your view, when did the taxable transfer take place?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="425.792" stopTime="436.348">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, the transfer that is subject to tax in this case occurred in 1979, when Mrs. Irvine made a disclaimer.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="436.348" stopTime="440.552">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    When did the taxable transfer within the meaning of the regulation take place?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="440.552" stopTime="450.590">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Within the specific words of the regulation, the taxable transfer referred to in the regulation is the initial, completed gift.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="450.590" stopTime="453.441">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So that's 1917?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="453.441" stopTime="456.522">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    That would have been in 1917, with the gift in trust.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="456.522" stopTime="464.257">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So is it necessary for your case to say that the 1917 creation of the trust was a taxable transfer?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="464.257" stopTime="466.771">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    It is not necessary for our case.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="466.771" stopTime="469.713">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is that your number 1 line of defense?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="469.713" stopTime="535.080">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    No, not really. 
    I guess to answer that question you really have to start from the beginning of describing what the '86 regulation does and what it says. 
    The '86 regulation was made necessary by the enactment of 2518 of the code, which established a fixed 9-month period for tax-free disclaimers of interest created after 1976. 
    In adopting the regulations in 1986, under... to implement the old and the new statutory provisions, the '86 Treasury gift tax regulations used the term, taxable transfer, to describe the initial completed gift. 
    Now, we know that because the regs specifically cross-reference to the contemporaneous regulations adopted under 2518. 
    Those regulations contain a definition of the term taxable transfer for the purpose of the regulations, and that definition is a completed gift regardless of whether a tax was imposed. 
    Now, this--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="535.080" stopTime="545.725">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    May I just ask you a question there? 
    You said, regardless of whether a tax was imposed, but that isn't the verb tense used in the reg, is it? 
    The verb tense used... the reg uses the present tense.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="545.725" stopTime="550.319">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --I thought I... well, I thought I said regardless of whether a tax is imposed, but--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="550.319" stopTime="572.796">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    I thought you said was. 
    In any case, your brief on page 26, second line from the bottom of the text, quotes the phrase, 
    "was not subject to the gift tax. " 
    and you then cite the reg 2511, and I don't think that's what the reg says. 
    It makes it... I understand it makes it easy for your case if you use the past tense, but that's not what the reg uses.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="572.796" stopTime="584.743">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --We... respondents properly took us to task for having a citation mistake at that page of our brief, and we discussed that citation mistake in our reply brief.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="584.743" stopTime="586.693">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    The language came out of Ordway, is that correct?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="586.693" stopTime="613.531">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Yes. 
    The ibid... what should have been on page 26 was an ibid, and the simple explanation is that the cite checkers in our office don't accept an ibid at the beginning of a paragraph, and so when they struck out the ibid, they looked to the last thing in the prior quote. 
    The last thing in the prior quote was the reg that was cited in Ordway. 
    The proper citation is simply to the Ordway opinion again.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="613.531" stopTime="620.276">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I'm still not sure when, in your view, the taxable transfer within the meaning of the regulation took place.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="620.276" stopTime="651.707">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Within the meaning of the regulation there are two relevant transfers. 
    The initial transfer is described as the taxable transfer in the regulation. 
    It is defined in the regulation to simply mean, a completed gift without regard to whether a tax is imposed. 
    It is simply a clock-starting mechanism. 
    The phrase is awkward, and but for the definition in the cross-section it would be confusing, but with the cross-reference it's not confusing. 
    It simply says you start the clock running from the date of the initial completed gift.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="651.707" stopTime="654.630">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And in your view that is 1917?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="654.630" stopTime="676.365">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    That was in 1917, and we know... the phrase, completed gift, comes out of this Court's decisions in Burnet v. Guggenheim and cases of that type, and what it... the completed gift is a gift made when the donor has parted with all control and dominion over the property, which Mr. Ordway did in 1917.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="676.365" stopTime="683.049">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Do you still... do you take the position here that the disclaimer had to be made prior to the enactment of the gift tax?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="683.049" stopTime="690.063">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    To be subject to tax, the disclaimer would have to be made after the date of the gift tax.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="690.063" stopTime="705.904">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but for the disclaimer to be effective to avoid the tax on this transfer, Mrs.... whatever her name was's transfer, do you take the position that she was required to make that disclaimer prior to 1932?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="705.904" stopTime="713.971">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    In all likelihood, we would take that position if the issue had arisen, but I want to amplify that in two ways.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="713.971" stopTime="718.222">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    That was the position that the IRS took below, wasn't it?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="718.222" stopTime="719.975">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    It was an answer to a hypothetical question.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="719.975" stopTime="727.689">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is it an academic question, because in fact she did not disclaim after the gift tax came into effect?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="727.689" stopTime="729.640">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Yes. 
    It really has no relevance to this case.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="729.640" stopTime="736.296">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So you don't have to answer the question whether, and suppose she had done it in 1933 or 1934, because she didn't do it till '79.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="736.296" stopTime="743.923">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    No, we don't have to answer that question here, because here we have a full half century that passed between the time she reached her age of majority and the time that she disclaimed.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Oh, yes.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="748.637" stopTime="749.268">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --that that would have sufficed?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="749.268" stopTime="766.089">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Yes. 
    She reached her majority... actually, the record's a little bit mixed on this and apparently in Minnesota the age of majority was 18 so she actually reached her age of majority in 1928 but it really doesn't make any difference and with respect to your point--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="766.089" stopTime="769.541">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But possibly it was unconstitutional not to give her the extra 3 years. 
    [Laughter]

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --I don't have any views on that.

    You can concede that.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="775.114" stopTime="779.947">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    But I just want to point out that there isn't anything odd--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="779.947" stopTime="791.166">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, there's a decision of this Court... Stanton, I think v. Utah... that suggests that the differential in age of majority might be unconstitutional.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="791.166" stopTime="794.686">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --I accept that fully.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="794.686" stopTime="800.392">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Alternatively, it might be unconstitutional to give the men 3 more years. 
    I mean, one or the other is bad.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="800.392" stopTime="801.982">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I would leave that to you.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="801.982" stopTime="803.532">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    We'll argue--
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="803.532" stopTime="833.415">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I really don't have an opinion on that at this time, but I wanted to point out in response to Justice Souter that there's nothing odd about saying that for her to make a tax-free disclaimer it might have been necessary to do it before the gift tax was enacted. 
    For anyone to make a tax-free gift, it would have been necessary to do it before the gift tax was enacted. 
    That's equally true whether the gift was made by disclaimer or by outright grant, so there's nothing odd or unfair about suggesting that if she wanted to make a tax-free disclaimer, it should have been done before the gift tax--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="833.415" stopTime="855.911">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --But the argument that's being made is that the disclaimer in effect precludes her acceptance of the gift in the first place, and if the reason she wants to preclude the acceptance is to avoid the gift tax, then it would be sort of unreasonable to say that she was required to make that act of refusal prior to the enactment of the tax which she's trying to avoid.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="855.911" stopTime="864.376">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --There have been no cases that have really been at the border that test the... how you decide what a reasonable time is.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="864.376" stopTime="872.400">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But you could concede that if she did it a reasonable time from the effective date of the gift tax, that would be a different case.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="872.400" stopTime="929.790">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    It might be a different case, but I doubt that we would take that position. 
    We think that the reasonable time describes one of two things, and you can look at it either the way the dissent or the majority did in Jewett. 
    The reasonable time either reflects a passage of time that allows the disclaimer to work in an estate planning function, which is clearly what we have in this case. 
    Another way to look at the passage of time is the way the 1986 regulations describe their interpretive rationale, and that is that property cannot be disclaimed free of tax after it is accepted, and that property is deemed to be accepted when it has been retained without disclaimer for more than a reasonable time. 
    Either of those rationales is really satis... is sufficient under the Jewett decision and under the interpretive regulations.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="929.790" stopTime="941.376">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So your position is it shouldn't be a decision driven by tax consequences, that what you're looking to see is if this person was... exercised control, or--
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="941.376" stopTime="949.053">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    That is absolutely correct, because there's no... the gift tax doesn't apply only when it's a substitute for estate planning.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="949.053" stopTime="965.724">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Well, it can be driven by tax purposes. 
    I can decide not to accept the gift simply because it will cost more in taxes if I accept it and then give it to my children than if I let it go to my children directly, and so long as I don't accept it, it can be driven as much as I like by tax consequences, can't it?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="965.724" stopTime="967.056">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    As long as--

    You're just saying--

    --As long--

speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="987.168" stopTime="1061.249">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Absolutely, and I do want to emphasize that point. 
    This is simply an interpretive regulation. 
    If... it does not purport to be a complete codification of every conceivable application of the statute. 
    It sets forth an interpretive rationale that guides application of the statute, and whether or not one were to think that this specific transaction fell squarely within the language of the regulation, the rationale of the regulation is still a suitable guide for this Court. 
    Because, ultimately, whether the tax is imposed or not is a matter of statutory construction, and the interpretive guide that this regulation contains for any situation involving disclaimers is the one that we've discussed, which is that a disclaimer not made within a reasonable time represents an indirect transfer of property. 
    The other way to reach... to make somewhat the same point is that the interpretive regulation describes an exception from the gift tax, that the gift tax applies unless a disclaimer is made within a reasonable time, and that if a tax exception does not apply, then the tax does.

    "A refusal to accept ownership does not constitute the making of a gift if the refusal is made within a reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer. "
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1122.853" stopTime="1128.467">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And the term, transfer, refers to taxable transfers, which is the beginning phrase of that sentence?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1128.467" stopTime="1178.970">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    That is absolutely correct, and the definition of the phrase, taxable transfer, is contained in the cross-reference provisions of section 2518 of the regulations, and those, Chief Justice Rehnquist, are quoted at the beginning of our merits brief on page 2, where it says, 
    "With respect to inter vivos transfers a taxable transfer occurs when there is a completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes regardless of whether a gift tax is imposed on the completed gift. " 
    and again, a completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes is the one described by this Court in Burnet v. Guggenheim, where the transferor has parted with complete dominion over the property. 
    That was Mr. Ordway's gift in trust in 1917. 
    I want to emphasize simply, we are not--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1178.970" stopTime="1189.418">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    It seems to me a little odd to say a gift tax imposed or not imposed can be meaningfully applied in 1917, when there was no gift tax at all.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1189.418" stopTime="1239.891">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --It isn't the most felicitous phrasing... I'm not suggesting that it is... but it is phrasing that has been clearly articulated in the regulation to have this specific meaning, and I think there's a historical explanation for why they used this perhaps awkward term. 
    It relates to the fact that the 1976... post 1976 transfers under section 2518, the initial starting date was referred to in some of the legislative materials as the original taxable transfer, and when they coordinated these regulations in '86, they picked up that same terminology, but it has no... notwithstanding the fact that the court of appeals seemed to give it great weight, you cannot read the contemporaneous cross-references in the regulations and be confused.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1239.891" stopTime="1253.930">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, what would happen if we decided that this regulation was not applicable to her because it was not a taxable transfer? 
    Would she then be outside the safe harbor provision and in even worse condition, or--
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1253.930" stopTime="1298.509">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    For two reasons, she would still... the transfer would be subject to tax. 
    If she doesn't come within the exception for disclaimers made within a reasonable time, then she has no exception to rely on, and she's taxable under the general rule set forth in the statute and the regulation, but more importantly, this is an interpretive regulation, it is not a substantive one. 
    It doesn't necessarily try to cover every conceivable situation. 
    Justice Stevens' opinion for the Court in Jewett goes through the history of this regulation, and points out that in its original 1958 form, it was written in a broader manner that by its terms would have covered inter vivos, testamentary, and every type of transfer.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    But even if it doesn't cover... even if we don't look to the reg for analogy, we're still dealing with a gift, a gift implies an acceptance, and if there's no renunciation within some reasonable period of time of an intent to transfer, there's still a completed gift, and if she later renounces, she's still giving something away. 
    That would be your argument.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    That is our argument, and the facts of this case are really, I mean, perhaps one of the strongest settings in which this issue could arise. 
    We have a transfer of a contingent interest in an enormously valuable property that was made after the transferor had held the interest for more than 50 years. 
    She did it when she was 68. 
    The property passed to the natural objects of her bounty. 
    All of the economic realities of this case indicate that this was an indirect transfer of property by gift, to which the statute applies.

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Government's position in this case is that Mrs. Irvine should have had the foresight to disclaim her interest, her remainder interest in the Ordway Trust in 1928 when she turned age 18, which was then the age of majority in Minnesota for her disclaimer to be free of gift tax. 
    Now, at that time, her interest was contingent, it was subject to her surviving the six living life income beneficiaries, and it was dependent upon the number of grandchildren who would be living at the time of the death of the last--

    It implied it was a new Federal standard, it had a new requirement, it had a new timeliness requirement which did not exist under State law, under the law that was controlling at the time that the Gift Tax Act itself was enacted.

speaker="phillip_h_martin" startTime="1847.541" stopTime="1911.185">
    Mr. Phillip H. Martin 
    That's right, but the right that Mrs. Irvine took in 1979 was based on a right that was existent back in... when the trust was created. 
    As the Court in Brown v. Routzahn held, she had a right to accept and a right to reject, and that was governed by State law, and that was the status of things when Congress enacted the Gift Tax Act in 1932. 
    When Congress has enacted disclaimer rules, they have always looked prospectively. 
    In 1976, when they enacted section 2518 here, they specifically provided that that would not apply to preexisting interests. 
    Similarly, in 1981 when they amended it, they did not retroactively apply that amendment. 
    It's interesting that counsel for the Government, when he argued this case in Jewett, specifically said with respect to why 2518 wasn't applied retroactively, he said that Congress normally legislates prospectively in the estate and gift tax area.

    Mr. Phillip H. Martin 
    Jewett said it was wrong... Jewett was interpreting the 1958 regulation. 
    The 1958 regulation dealt with the transfers after the act. 
    The 1958 regulation was subsequently replaced by the 1986 regulation, which says that it does not apply to taxable transfers after the act. 
    Now, incidentally, there is a no cross-reference in section 111-1(c)(2), which is the section we're focusing on, to section 2518. 
    There is a cross-reference in section 2511-1(c)(1) to section 2518, but that makes sense, because that's post '77, and they're talking about qualified disclaimers, but with respect to taxable transfers for pre-'77 transfers, there is no cross-reference, and so the definition that the court... that the Government is relying on in 2518 simply doesn't apply. 
    It doesn't apply for that reason, it also doesn't apply because it is really directed to the issue of when the 9-month period begins, and the 9-month period is only relevant with respect to post-'76 transfers.

    The... this Court in Jewett did not decide that all disclaimers are transfers. 
    The very premise of the decision in Jewett was that a disclaimer may be an indirect transfer. 
    That's all that the Court said. 
    When the Court said that a transfer may be unquestionably encompassed, that language was really referring to whether we have a property interest, whether a contingent remainder is a property interest, and that really is not the issue here. 
    I want to emphasize that this case is not simply a replay of Jewett, that in Jewett the Court found it very significant that the right, the Jewetts' right to disclaim did not come into existence until... that his interest did not come into existence until after the Gift Tax Act had been enacted. 
    Mrs. Irvine's right, on the other hand, was in existence well before the enactment of the gift tax, and therefore she did have a right to disclaim.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, the... if we take the position... I guess you can have two arguments here, and I was assuming you were making one and maybe you're making the other one. 
    You could be making the argument that this entire scheme of disclaimer cannot apply to your trust because your trust was created prior the enactment of the gift tax and therefore nothing that relates to the gift tax applies to your trust because of the time it was created, or you could be arguing that the crucial point in Jewett was that there was an opportunity, after the enactment of the gift tax, to make the disclaimer, which precluded the property from vesting in the taxpayer and hence precluded the making of a gift at the time of the disclaimer. 
    I thought you were making the second argument. 
    Maybe you're making the first one.
speaker="phillip_h_martin" startTime="2291.771" stopTime="2294.002">
    Mr. Phillip H. Martin 
    Well, actually, Your Honor, we're making both arguments.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2294.002" stopTime="2318.499">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    If you're making both arguments... if you're making both arguments, then with respect to the second one, you would be in the same position as the Jewett taxpayer, would you not, if we held that the effective disclaimer by the taxpayer could have been made within a reasonable time of the enactment of the gift tax statute or within a reasonable time of her attainment of majority?
speaker="phillip_h_martin" startTime="2318.499" stopTime="2330.426">
    Mr. Phillip H. Martin 
    Which really is saying that there was some kind of a hidden grace period in the enactment of the Gift Tax Act to permit disclaimers even though the reasonable time had already expired.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2330.426" stopTime="2346.707">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, it's saying that reasonable time is to be determined with respect to the point of the disclaimer, and if the point of the disclaimer is tax planning, then reasonable time certainly couldn't start running before there was any tax.
speaker="phillip_h_martin" startTime="2346.707" stopTime="2356.984">

    But in this case, the Government has conceded, has acknowledged that under their position of the case her right to disclaim expired before the enactment of the gift tax.

    Well, the Court could take the position, could it not, that even if there had to be... if the reasonable time had to run from the date the gift tax took effect, even if that were so, it wouldn't make any difference because here the disclaimer came over 40 years later.

    Mr. Phillip H. Martin 
    --Well, they not only don't take that... they've acknowledged that there is no acceptance here. 
    In their regulations under section 2518, they treat income interest and principal interest as separate, and they make it clear that the acceptance of an income interest does not prohibit a person from accepting a principal interest, and so the fact that she received income under the Government's own regulations is really irrelevant. 
    The other... another point that was brought up is that the Court, when they decided Jewett, was not aware that the Commissioner had consistently taken the position that Brown v. Routzahn was the proper rule and that there was a... even more materials than what was available to the Court at that time indicating that the regulation was intended to codify Brown v. Routzahn and that the Commissioner's position had not been entirely consistent in interpreting the disclaimer regulations, that the--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Martin, you're dead right that you've called our attention to things that were not before us at the time of Jewett. 
    Their response, and I'd like you to directly respond to their... their response, as I understand it, is that in each of the instances on which you place primary reliance, there was a prompt disclaimer right after the interest was disclaimed. 
    Do you agree with that appraisal of the various cases that you've cited?
speaker="phillip_h_martin" startTime="2541.399" stopTime="2633.099">
    Mr. Phillip H. Martin 
    --Well, I don't think that was true at all in the 1966 private letter ruling, where we had an inter vivos trust that was created in 1933. 
    The beneficiary started receiving income in 1936, and 30 years later, in 1966, her brothers died, and she became entitled to an increased income interest. 
    Now, she was aware of that interest from the time that she became a beneficiary of the trust. 
    It was a contingent interest. 
    It was contingent upon whether her brothers had issue when they died, and it turned out that they... both of them had adopted children, and the court ultimately held... a State court... that adopted children were not issue. 
    As a result of that holding, the Government takes the position that that's what gave rise to the increase in the income, but that really isn't... that isn't any different than if one of those children had died ahead of time, that if it had been a natural child and had died ahead of the brother, we still would have had the situation where there was an increase in income. 
    And certainly she was aware of that trust from the time that she started receiving income, so she was aware of her interest for 30 years, which is... which was the gist of Jewett's interpretation of the regulation, and that was a trust that was established after the act. 
    Unless there are any further questions, Your Honor--

   Rebuttal of Kent L. Jones
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="2637.461" stopTime="2743.312">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    With respect to the 1966 letter ruling that was just referred to, we've discussed this in our brief. 
    I just want to emphasize again that it was the Commissioner's interpretation in that case that the taxpayer did not have knowledge, or should not be attributed to have knowledge of that interest until the supreme court of Pennsylvania, after somewhat lengthy litigation, determined that the adopted children could not succeed to the interests of the other affected interest. 
    What is absolutely clear about that ruling is that that was the Commissioner's interpretation, so in stating his interpretation he was plainly being consistent with the analysis of the regulation, which is that a taxpayer has a reasonable time to disclaim after the taxpayer becomes aware of the interest. 
    In brief, a person who transfers property by gift is subject to tax. 
    In Estate of Sanford, in 1939, Chief Justice Stone held for the Court that the Federal gift tax looks to the economic realities of the transfer of control. 
    Justice Cardozo said exactly the same thing for the Court in 1933 in Burnet v. Guggenheim. 
    This Court's decision in Jewett is an amplification of that simple principal, and as I've already described, it is not subject to argument here that the economic realities in this case reflect a lengthy control over the property by Mrs. Irvine and an enjoyment of the income interest, and an ultimate transfer of that property to her children. 
    Therefore, the gift tax applies.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2743.312" stopTime="2758.041">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't know why an effective disclaimer doesn't exercise effective control over the property anyway. 
    Why don't you go whole hog and say, even a disclaimer amounts to a gift? 
    That exercises control over the property, doesn't it? 
    It says, it doesn't come to me, it goes to him, even if you exercise it promptly.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="2758.041" stopTime="2782.826">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    You're saying a disclaimer made within a reasonable time. 
    I believe that the Commissioner's view of a disclaimer made within a reasonable time is that if a tax is imposed on that transfer, then it requires the taxpayer to accept the gift, and the Commissioner doesn't want to impose that requirement. 
    The Commissioner allows the gift to be disclaimed within a reasonable time, but if it occur... if more than a reasonable time passes--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2782.826" stopTime="2786.479">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I understand Justice Scalia to be suggesting the Commissioner's giving away the Government's money when he does that.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="2786.479" stopTime="2815.459">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --I think that what the Commissioner is attempting to do is not to give away the Government's money but to come up with a sensible approach to this scheme. 
    Congress ultimately adopted a similar, even though more objective rationale. 
    They give the taxpayer 9 months to disclaim. 
    I think that the legislation ultimately enacted under 2518 reflects that the Commissioner's interpretation of the proper application of this statute was sensible and correct, and certainly the Court upheld it in Jewett.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2815.459" stopTime="2818.153">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why did Congress agree with it if it was wrong?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="2818.153" stopTime="2822.865">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, I believe it also reflects that it was sensible and correct.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2822.865" stopTime="2834.453">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And I suppose there's no largesse involved, unless we assume that the Commissioner could redefine the very concept of gift in a way which certainly is not suggested by any act of Congress.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="2834.453" stopTime="2853.375">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, what's really at issue here is, when was the property transferred? 
    There's no question that it was a gratuitous transfer. 
    The disclaimer is an indirect transfer, and that was really the event that the Commissioner's regulation focused on, and this Court's decision in Jewett did. 
    Thank you.
