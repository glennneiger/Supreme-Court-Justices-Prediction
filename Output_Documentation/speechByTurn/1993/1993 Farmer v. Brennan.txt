    Justice David H. Souter 
    The first of the two is Farmer and Brennan, No. 92-7247. 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and it requires us to define the term, "deliberate indifference". 
    Under the Eighth Amendment, prison officials have a duty to ensure that prison inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners. 
    Prison officials violate that constitutional duty when they act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that a prison official may be held liable for acting with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm only if he is aware of that risk and disregards it by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. 
    That subjective definition of deliberate indifference is the equivalent of the recklessness as generally used in the criminal law and it is compelled by Wilson and Seiter decided in 1991 which interpreted the word "punishment" in a Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to mandate inquiry into a prison official state of mind in which held that inmates challenging the conditions of their confinement must satisfy what we called a subjective requirement. 
    In object to approach deliberate indifference adapted by some Courts of Appeals and urged on us by petitioners simply incompatible with our precedent. 
    The prisoner here is a federal prisoner who is a transsexual and who respondent, federal prison officials agree, projects feminine characteristics. 
    The petitioner claimed to have been beaten and raped by another inmate after being transferred to a federal penitentiary and placed in its general prison population. 
    The District Court dismissed petitioner's lawsuit which claimed the violation of the Eighth Amendment in respondent's deliberate indifference to petitioner's safety and the Seventh Circuit narrowly affirmed. 
    Because the District Court may have applied a stricter test than the one we adapt today, we vacate the decision below and remand for further proceedings. 
    Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens have filed concurring opinions; Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.
