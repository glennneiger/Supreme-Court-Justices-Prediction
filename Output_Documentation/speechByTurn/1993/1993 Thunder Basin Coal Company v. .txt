    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    The petitioner, Thunder Basin Coal Company, is what its name implies a coal mining company. 
    Its workforce is non union but that force designated two employees of the United Mine Workers, to serve as miners' representatives under a statute, which is in 30 U.S. code section 813(f). 
    The company refused to post information about this as required by a Department of Labor Regulation and instead it files suit in District Court and obtained an injunction preventing the enforcement of the regulation. 
    The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 
    It held that the District Court jurisdiction was precluded by the administrative review scheme of the Mine Act, which provides for a review commission and then further review by the appropriate Court of Appeals. 
    The company contends that requiring it to challenge the interpretation to the statutory review procedures violates the Due Process Clause. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    We hold that the Mine Act's review scheme precludes a District Court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction over a pre-enforcement challenge to the Act. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment and has joined therein by Justice Thomas.
