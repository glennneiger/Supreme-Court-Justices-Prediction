Beecham v. United States

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I have an opinion to announce on behalf of Justice O'Connor who is also absent today. 
    This is No.93-445, Beecham and Jones against the United States. 
    This case comes to us on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    Petitioners, Beecham and Jones, were convicted of being felons in possession of firearms. 
    Under the felon in possession law, a person may regain the right to possess firearms if he has had civil rights restored for his conviction, and Beecham and Jones claimed this exemption applied to them. 
    But both petitioners had prior federal convictions as well as prior state convictions and their civil rights had been restored only under state law, and for this reason, the Court of Appeals ruled against the petitioners. 
    In an opinion filed today, we affirm that judgment. 
    We hold that a civil rights restoration can nullify the affect of a conviction only if it was performed by the convicting jurisdiction. 
    Petitioner's state civil rights restorations, therefore, cannot undo the disability flowing from their Federal Court convictions. 
    And this opinion also is unanimous.
