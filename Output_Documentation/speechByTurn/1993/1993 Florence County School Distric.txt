    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 91-1523, the Florence County School District Four v. Shannon Carter, et al. Mr. Ayer.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="11.800" stopTime="91.111">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    In the Burlington decision, this Court recognized that one of the judicial remedies available for a school district's failure to provide an education meeting the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is reimbursement of the child's parents for the cost of removing their child from the public school and putting he or she into a private school that provides an education that is proper under the act. 
    The Court in Burlington explained that conclusion in part on the ground that where parents select a private school placement that is found to be "proper under the act" the award of such reimbursement does nothing more than pay the parents the cost that should have been paid initially by the public school for the placement that should have been provided in the first place. 
    The issue presented in this case is whether, as the court below held, this right to reimbursement under Burlington arises wherever the private placement selected by the parents ultimately proves to be beneficial to the child, or rather, whether such placements are constrained, as are all other placements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by the obligation to provide a free appropriate public education, which is defined precisely and specifically in the act.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --The place to begin in thinking about it is with the initial section of the act, which states the purpose of the act, and it states that purpose very explicitly in terms of assuring that all children with disabilities will have available to them a free, appropriate public education. 
    That is the overriding, the primary purpose. 
    The Court recognized that in Burlington.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="137.662" stopTime="155.763">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, okay. 
    I recognize that, and I'd like you to tell us, if you will, where in the statute specifically it covers private placement, or whether this is just something by way of a remedy that the courts have developed under the act.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="155.763" stopTime="176.958">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, the statute does not explicitly provide for the Burlington remedy, either, and so the fact that there is a remedy there is something that is recognized as necessary to accomplish the purposes of the act, so I can't point to something specifically that limits a remedy that is not explicitly dealt with in the statute. 
    What I think I can do--

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    If you insist upon free, appropriate public education, there's no private placement.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Well, I would disagree with that.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, the public aspect I think has two parts within the definition, one is that it be a public expense, and that is certainly possible, and the other... well, there's three, I guess. 
    The other is that it... one other is that it meets State standards. 
    That's at dispute in this case. 
    And then the third is that it be under public supervision.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="207.536" stopTime="212.231">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="215.561" stopTime="241.009">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Justice Scalia, I think it depends how you define public supervision. 
    I think the act plainly contemplates and placements go forward I think on a regular basis in private schools where the public school authorities nonetheless are involved in that process. 
    They're involved in helping to prepare an individual education program, and that I think fairly satisfies the requirement of public supervision.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="241.009" stopTime="310.753">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Ayer, you made, I think, a very helpful and candid concession in your reply brief in which you say there are situations that would be an exception to this strict Burlington requirement that it must be a place that is approved by the district, and I'd like to call your attention to page 9 of your reply brief where you said, in the second full paragraph, that the Court should not allow FAPE's educational standards and IEP requirement to foreclose unreasonably the pursuit of educational opportunity through the unilateral parent placement process recognized in Burlington. 
    So you seem in that passage to be recognizing that there are cases where there can be deviations from both the IEP requirement, the FAPE educational standards, so doesn't this controversy, then, boil down to whether this case fits that description?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="310.753" stopTime="311.484">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Correct, Your Honor.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="311.484" stopTime="325.874">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And in this case there was no list supplied by the public school authorities as there was in Burlington, so why isn't that enough to make it exceptional?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="325.874" stopTime="326.244">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="326.244" stopTime="335.319">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Why shouldn't there be a burden on the public system to say to the parents, here is a list of approved private facilities?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="335.319" stopTime="392.878">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Your Honor, there's certainly nothing in the statute that dictates in what manner the public school authorities are required to be cooperative with the parents. 
    It might be that they have a list prepared. 
    In some States they do. 
    If they have such a list, in all likelihood, it's going to be necessary for the parents to go to somebody and ask for it. 
    If there is no list, it is in the same way necessary for the parents to go to someone, perhaps, and ask the question, here's what I'd like to do under my Burlington rights, I want to put the child in a private school, can you tell me whether this facility meets standards? 
    We would have a different case here if what had happened was the parents had done that and been given either no answer, or been given an answer which is, we won't cooperate with you, we won't help you. 
    That might be a case where you could say that the realization of the free appropriate public education simply couldn't realistically be accomplished here even though the parents tried to do it. 
    The fundamental--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="392.878" stopTime="430.152">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So it comes down to who has the burden of inquiry, or it's a question of whether the public authority has to supply either a list or a procedure, and you say no, the parent has to ask, and if the parent doesn't ask, then there is effectively no recourse for the parent even though the very first step in this case is a given... that is, the public authority has not been able to provide the education that the statute requires.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="430.152" stopTime="497.235">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'd like to take a couple of steps back, because I think you only get to the issue that you are raising, which is whether or not it is essentially not possible to accomplish not possible for the parents and the private school to accomplish the objective of the statute. 
    You only get to that point after you impose an initial requirement, presumptively at least, that a free appropriate public education is an objective to which the parents must make some efforts to achieve, and I want to just talk briefly to this question of how the statute operates, and the fact, first of all, what I mentioned earlier, that this is a statute that, perhaps unusually, has as its stated primary purpose not the elevation of educational quality for disabled students, not some general objective like that, the primary purpose of this statute, as it states in its own language, is the assurance that all children with disabilities will have available a free, appropriate public education. 
    What is--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="497.235" stopTime="542.846">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    May I just interrupt you there? 
    Isn't the point that the statute or the conditions that we're concerned with here are all conditions which are intended to be for the benefit of the students. 
    It's to make sure that the kids with disabilities do not get stuck down in some... some second-rate status, and if the purpose of the various conditions that are in question here are for the benefit of the students, then under Burlington isn't it at least possible for the students, or the parents of the students, to waive those, or you might say ignore them, so that that waiver or ignoring of them would not be a per se disqualification for reimbursement.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="542.846" stopTime="557.946">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well I have not, I have not heard, I have not seen or heard of that notion in the cases Justice Souter-- 
    It is the case that parents can take their child out of the public system and pay for a private school education on their own.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="557.946" stopTime="575.887">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Let me, if I may interrupt you, do you claim that either of the conditions in question here, either the requirement of IEP or the requirement of teacher certification, is for the benefit of anyone other than the student?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="575.887" stopTime="580.109">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    No I think it is for the benefits of the students.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="580.109" stopTime="597.063">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --So that if then the students or their parents say well we'll waive those so long as we can get, in fact, an adequate education elsewhere, why shouldn't they be allowed to waive them and why should their waiver be a bar to reimbursement?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="597.063" stopTime="606.957">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Well, I think this goes directly to the question of whether State educational authorities were intended under the act to be left in the primary role with regard to the making of educational policy.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="606.957" stopTime="636.099">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Exactly. 
    Exactly, or to put it differently, whether the IEP and the FAPE requirements were put there out of mistrust of the parents, or out of mistrust of school authorities. 
    It seems to me they were put there to make sure that the school authorities did not give the disabled child second-rate treatment. 
    You really think Congress was worried about the parents giving their disabled child second-rate treatment, putting him in a private placement that would be no good for him?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="636.099" stopTime="656.241">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Your Honor, I think that what Congress intended to do was to create a mechanism that relied on essentially three different factors to assure the quality of education, and I don't think that they assumed that parents were in many... in most instances the best judges of what would be a quality education.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="656.241" stopTime="668.608">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Ah, the best judge is going to be the judge in a contested case for reimbursement afterwards, or if not the best judge, an adequate judge. 
    I mean, the scheme that the other side is claiming does not leave them in the unreviewable driver's seat.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="668.608" stopTime="734.310">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, it... the standard that is applied, as I was saying just now, there are three elements, essentially that the statute puts in place, and I would submit they work like the legs of a stool to elevate together the quality of education. 
    One of them is the requirement that State educational standards be met in the educations provided to disabled students, and I think that's very important, because what was happening before was that disabled students were in many instances simply being pushed aside or being given a clearly inferior education, so the notion is not that we're going to tell the States what policies to put in place, but that we're going to require that they treat disabled students no less favorably than they treat nondisabled students. 
    The second is the IEP process, which in this statute was very explicitly spelled out. 
    This is not, if you read through the language of it, a general reference to the notion that, and there should be some sort of discussion between the parents and the school officials. 
    This is a very explicit set of requirements which Congress believed was necessary in conjunction with the other factors that it was putting into the statute in order to accomplish the result.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="734.310" stopTime="753.364">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Are you contending that the... that what went on at this Trident School... it wasn't an IEP, but there were, what was it, goal-settings, and I think more frequent reviews... that that wasn't a reasonable substitute? 
    Is the IEP so much more intense?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="753.364" stopTime="764.100">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, Your Honor, I think... I think it is perfectly clear from the court of appeals decision that the court of appeals did not view what went on at Trident as complying with the act, because it says explicitly that.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="764.100" stopTime="766.063">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    It wasn't an IEP, but--
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="766.063" stopTime="766.451">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    It wasn't an IEP.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="766.451" stopTime="777.738">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --there was a setting of goals for this student to achieve, and an evaluation whether the student... of the student's progress periodically, was there not?

    That's correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="778.008" stopTime="790.528">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And I'm asking you, in terms of quality, was it substantially less effective in measuring the child's progress than the IEP?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="790.528" stopTime="812.883">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, what is missing from that, from what you've described, and I think, Your Honor, you have accurately described what is in the decisions in terms of what kind of process there is. 
    There is absolutely no discussion of the critical part of the IEP process, which is a cooperative interaction, a give-and-take between the parents and the school. 
    There is no discussion of a written statement of the services to be provided.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="812.883" stopTime="839.001">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Ayer, what does a parent... what is a parent supposed to do when a school district such as your client has failed to provide the IEP, the FAPE, and what the statute requires, but there happens to be no alternative school around that works via an IEP, and the parent finds the best school available, saying, you know, the school district has failed me, has violated the statute, I'm going to do the best I can for my kid--
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="839.001" stopTime="839.281">

    Well--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --and there happens to be no private school who is willing to go through all of the folderol of an IEP, or they think an IEP is really not the best way to do it? 
    That parent has no remedy.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="847.796" stopTime="862.104">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --No, I don't think that's necessarily the case, Your Honor.

speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="862.104" stopTime="878.875">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Ayer, did I take it that your answer to the question I asked you before was that if these parents had inquired, if they had only inquired, tell us a school, and they got no answer, then you would say, yes, then they would be entitled to reimbursement?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="878.875" stopTime="879.306">

    Well--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="879.306" stopTime="892.254">

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --I don't think it comes down to that, Your Honor, I think the first issue must be whether the holding of the court of appeals decision, which is that the free appropriate public education requirement is entirely inapplicable in the Burlington context, with the one exception of the requirement that the education provide educational benefit.

    Well, let me ask you the question in a different way, and if I... this is the way I see it, and if I'm wrong please tell me. 
    The school system has not been able to provide the child with an education that the statute requires. 
    That's a given.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, let's go back to the purpose again, because I don't think you've answered one of the questions that we keep asking, and that is, for whose benefit are these conditions which collectively make up the purpose? 
    The benefit of the stay-put provision in Burlington was supposedly, or was treated as being... the object of the stay-put provision was being to serve the children so that they did not get side-tracked into some inappropriate class while the fight was going on about what to do. 
    Isn't the benefit of the... the object, rather, of the two provisions that you were most concerned with in making up the collective purpose of this statute also to benefit the children?

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    It is a relevant fact, Your Honor, I think first with regard to the requirement of meeting State standards, that whereas the primary purpose is to benefit the children, a secondary purpose which is made explicit in the statute and which this court has recognized is to leave State authorities as the primary authorities in determining educational standards.

    --The first two legs, Your Honor, were the requirement that the education meet State educational standards, the second was that it be provided in compliance with the IEP requirement, and the third is that it be "appropriate". 
    Now, this Court in Rowley, in considering what constitutes an appropriate education, focused on the fact that there are other procedural and other requirements under the act and adopted a standard which I think by any fair reading is a fairly low level standard. 
    That is to say, it is simply a question of whether the education was capable or calculated to provide educational benefit. 
    That in itself I think plainly is not an effective support to a statute that is trying to elevate the quality of disabled children's education. 
    The statute has in mind something else. 
    The statute has in mind these things working together. 
    It has in mind, under the educational standard requirement, essentially a nondiscrimination provision that says, you can't treat the disabled children worse than you treat the other children. 
    If you have teachers certified in the areas they're teaching for other children, you've got to have similar kinds of certification. 
    And that's... the certification point which is at issue here is a very significant part of the statute. 
    It's addressed specifically in the regulations and in the statute, indicating at one point in the statute... I think it's... 1413(a)(14) talks about with regard to disabled children, if you are not hiring teachers in accordance with the highest standards in the State, number 1 you're supposed to do that for disabled children, and if you're not, you've got to give an explanation as to what you're doing to get up to that standard.

    I took the last one. 
    You're arguing... if Burlington hadn't been decided, you'd be making essentially the same argument with respect to the stay-put provision, wouldn't you? 
    Wouldn't that be essential to, for example, the maintenance of control over public education and assuring that the public educational authorities would see that the kid did not get sidetracked into a second-rate classroom while they were fighting over what to do?

speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="1370.416" stopTime="1395.173">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, I think... this is a case where what occurred was that, while the review process under the statute was going forward, the parents, completely on their own and without any conversation with the school, and without telling the school district authorities that they were doing it before they did it, they took the... they applied to the Trident School, they took the child out of the school, and they put her into the Trident School, so that this is not a situation where the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1395.173" stopTime="1435.028">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    They took a big risk in doing that. 
    I mean, it may well be that when they came to apply for reimbursement and the school district resisted it, a court would have found, well, the Trident School is really not a very good school, and since you didn't provide substantially what the act wanted, we're not going to allow... that's a big risk for the parents. 
    Why isn't that risk enough? 
    Once the school district has failed to meet its obligation, the parent has the right, if the parent wants to take the chance, to send the kid to any school at all. 
    If the school doesn't meet up to fulfill the obligation substantially of the act, the parent gets no reimbursement. 
    That's a substantial sanction, but I don't know why the parent has to--

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer

    The bottom line is, there's been a finding that what they offered wasn't meeting the standards under the act. 
    The one answer I would give goes back to what is the explicit purpose of the act, and Congress must have had something in mind when it said that it wants to assure a free, appropriate public education to all children, meaning--

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, you can case it as an abuse of discretion. 
    I think the key point is, is the rule announced by the court of appeals consistent with the objectives and language... the purpose, explicitly stated, and language of the act... and I would submit that inasmuch as the purpose, as stated, is to create this, as I described it, three-legged stool to elevate the quality of education, what we have created here with this rule, not simply in this case, but with the rule amounts, simply saying, all you have to do is show that you've found an education that is going to provide educational benefit, we are going to have a lot of placements that are publicly funded, federally funded under the act in part and State-funded to a significant degree.

   Argument of Peter W. D. Wright
speaker="peter_w_d_wright" startTime="1650.368" stopTime="1757.009">
    Mr. Peter W. D. Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    Before we get into the issues, I'd like to take a moment to review some of the factual questions that are important in responding to Mr. Ayers. 
    In 1983, when Shannon was 13 years old, she entered the seventh grade at Timmonsville School. 
    Her mother told the school officials that Shannon could not read and requested that she be evaluated. 
    The school system evaluated her, concluded that she was lazy, unmotivated, a slow learner who needed to be pressured harder to work. 
    Relying upon that, the parents pressured their daughter. 
    By February of 1985, she was 16, functionally illiterate, had become suicidal, and was severely depressed. 
    Her parents obtained counseling for her. 
    The counselor recommended that Shannon receive a complete psychological evaluation. 
    The results found that Shannon had a severe learning disability and intense educational services were recommended. 
    Following this, the school did evaluate Shannon and concurred that Shannon had a severe learning disability and was average to above average in intelligence. 
    At a conference with parents and school personnel, an individualized educational program was presented to the parents that proposed a resource program for Shannon. 
    This resource class would be one where Shannon was going to be placed with emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded children. 
    The parents said that was not appropriate for Shannon. 
    The school then offered an itinerant program. 
    This program consisted of 3 hours of special education a week, and after a year in the tenth grade as a 17-year-old, her reading still would have remained at the fifth grade level, and she would have fallen further and further behind her peer group. 
    The parents contended that this--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1757.009" stopTime="1760.842">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You say, would have. 
    That was what they projected the results of this would be.
speaker="peter_w_d_wright" startTime="1760.842" stopTime="1761.392">
    Mr. Peter W. D. Wright

    That's correct.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What the school board projected?
speaker="peter_w_d_wright" startTime="1762.523" stopTime="1835.959">
    Mr. Peter W. D. Wright 
    The school board said, we will have you reading half... 5 months more, after a year's worth of intense special education program. 
    The parents said that was not... inadequate, and based upon the advice of the evaluators that were working with the family and with Shannon, requested at that time a self-contained learning disabled program such as the one that was offered right down the road in Florence County School District One. 
    Now, Florence County has multiple school districts, and this is a case against District Four, not against Florence County itself. 
    District Four refused to consider placing Shannon in any public or private self-contained program. 
    The parents then requested a special education due process hearing. 
    At the August 20 due process hearing, the Carters requested funding for either two neighboring schools or Trident Academy, a special educational school accredited by the Southern... excuse me, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. 
    The issue at the special education due process hearing and before the district court judge was whether or not District Four's itinerant program was appropriate. 
    The trial court not only found that District Four's program was inadequate, but also found that Trident Academy provided Shannon with an excellent education.

   Argument of Amy L. Wax
speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="2666.672" stopTime="2783.899">
    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    Under the broad remedial provision of this statute, a judge is allowed to award any remedy that he deems appropriate, and as this Court said in the Burlington case, appropriate means appropriate in light of the purpose of this statute. 
    We think that the answer to this case and the answer to many of the questions that the justices have posed today comes in asking the right question, and that question is, what is the purpose of this statute? 
    What is its aim? 
    Why did Congress enact the IDEA? 
    Congress enacted IDEA to provide a basic floor of educational opportunity for disabled children, to ensure that those children received an education that was calculated to enable them to receive benefit, and in deciding what remedies are appropriate, we believe that basic equitable principles dictate that the legal standard should be no more onerous and no more complicated than are absolutely necessary to effectuate the statutory purpose. 
    Now, with respect to the questions that Justice Ginsburg have raised about whether parents have to make reasonable inquiries or reasonable efforts to comply with the particulars of section 1401, or whether they have to choose a school from a list, the position of the United States is that no such per se requirements should be imposed as a rigid matter. 
    There should be no requirement as such that parents make inquiries, and the reason for this, first of all, is that the statute contains no such requirement. 
    There is no explicit mandate that parents make inquiries, seek information, confer and consult endlessly before they may challenge the IEP proposed and received a remedy.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2783.899" stopTime="2800.251">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Of course, they always have an incentive to ask for a list anyway, or to select a school from a list that is provided, a very considerable incentive, don't they? 
    That is to say, if the school district has provided a list, you know that you can get reimbursement so long as you pick one of those schools.
speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="2800.251" stopTime="2812.168">
    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    Well, it certainly increases your chances of getting reimbursement, Justice Scalia, but part of our point is that just because you choose a school from a list doesn't mean you satisfy the substantive showing that it's appropriate for your child.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2812.168" stopTime="2818.123">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Who would contest it? 
    Certainly the school district wouldn't be able to contest it, if the school was on the list.
speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="2818.123" stopTime="2831.299">
    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    On the contrary, Your Honor, I think they very well could contest it, because they don't want to provide reimbursement, and just because it's on the list, although it satisfies the particulars of the definition of a FAPE, it might not meet the substantive standard under Rowley for--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2831.299" stopTime="2833.921">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I see, they would still contest the IEP--
speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="2833.921" stopTime="2834.132">
    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    --Exactly.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2834.132" stopTime="2837.924">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --and all of that, but they certainly couldn't come forward and say, this is a no-good school.
speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="2837.924" stopTime="2851.383">
    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    They couldn't come forward and say, it doesn't come forward and comply with the procedural and formal requirements, but under Rowley they could certainly try and come forward and say, this school is inappropriate in that it doesn't provide the sort of education that your child needs.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2851.383" stopTime="2854.465">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, they could continue to contest their own inadequacy.
speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="2854.465" stopTime="2926.493">
    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    Correct, and they could contest that, too, and those are the two elements of the inquiry. 
    Now, it's important to realize that every time you set up a requirement like, the parent has to make inquiries, the parent has to look at a list, that requirement comes at a cost. 
    It comes at a cost to the parents and the children seeking a remedy, and that's because although it may seem simple to ask parents to pick up the phone and call the school district, as this Court recognized in Burlington, the reply that they're likely to get is, we'll get back to you, we'll look into it, call back next week, when the right person is here, and that produces delay. 
    And when there's delay, the parents are in a quandary, because each day that the child is in an inappropriate and unsatisfactory setting, is a day that's lost to the education of that child, and it also produces uncertainty, because the parents ask themselves, how much of an effort is enough, how much of an official response is sufficient, when can we cut our losses and move our child, and all of those uncertainties get played out at the remedial phase of the statute, when the judge is asked to consider how much effort is enough, whether what the school district did is equitably sufficient.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2926.493" stopTime="2957.521">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Ms. Wax, we're going back now to the setting in the school system and not when we're in court talking about the parents' choice. 
    In the school system, isn't the thrust of the act that the parents and the school authority should be trying to work with each other to the maximum extent possible, rather than an incentive for the parents to pull that child out of the public school system quickly and put it in some superior private school?
speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="2957.521" stopTime="3097.815">
    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    Your Honor, that overstates the statutory interest in having parents and school districts consult and confer. 
    That interest in mutual cooperation is fully exhausted by coming together to try and formulate an IEP in the first instance. 
    Once that proposal is signed and sealed and proposed, then under the statute parents have no openended obligation to consult and confer without end, and in fact as this Court recognized in Burlington, to incorporate such a requirement would be very much to the disadvantage of parents, because the school district always has the upper hand in this situation. 
    On the contrary, under section 1415 of the act, the parents have an immediate right to challenge the adequacy of the IEP, to challenge any aspect of the school district's proposal at the administrative level, first by directing the challenge to the school district itself, then with appeal to the State, and finally, judicial review. 
    So I think petitioners vastly overstate the statutory interest in consultation and cooperation, and if their proposal was adopted, it would work to the detriment of the parents and the children. 
    So the point is that the requirement that parents choose from a list, which vastly reduces their options for providing their child's education, and that they inquire of the school district, creates tremendous obstacles and complications to their receiving relief, and the question is, the equitable question is, do those added complications come at some benefit to the effectuation of the statutory purpose, and the answer has to be no. 
    The statutory purpose is fully effectuated when a judge determines whether in a particular case the education that the child received in the parent's chosen institution was an appropriate education within the meaning of Rowley. 
    That is, it accomplished the purpose of the act, which was to provide a basic floor of educational opportunity. 
    And if the education lives up to that standard, then consideration of whether the school's on a list, or whether inquiries were made, or whether certain formalities were complied with, really becomes superfluous. 
    They become beside the point, and in that case it would effectuate the statutory purpose to allow reimbursement, and it certainly would defeat the statutory purpose to deny reimbursement.

    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    Yes, we are, Your Honor. 
    We think that as a hard and fast, rigid requirement, it doesn't hold water. 
    It may come in at the very end of the inquiry of whether the education is appropriate. 
    It could be a factor in a case where the child didn't clearly benefit from the education, where the child didn't make educational progress, and then the judge is thrown back on certain indicators of educational quality with respect to the private school that was chosen, and then the judge might look at things such as how well-trained were the teachers, how does this school compare to other schools, did the parents have ready at hand an alternative which looks like it might have been better than the alternative which was chosen? 
    None of those considerations would come in in this case, because here there was clear benefit to the child, and we think that when the child clearly benefits, that's really essentially all the judge needs to know, because--

    Now, the parent is entirely free to choose the most expensive and the school district has to pick up the cost?

    We would distinguish between the availability of some reimbursement, okay, which we think should not be affected by the alternatives that might be available but should only be determined by whether this school that the parents chose meets the appropriate standard. 
    The amount--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3209.176" stopTime="3213.741">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, do you think under the statutory scheme a court could deny full reimbursement?

    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    --No, we do not. 
    We think the court could limit the amount of reimbursement.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, that's what I'm asking you. 
    You do? 
    How? 
    On what authority?
speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="3221.426" stopTime="3238.636">
    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    On equitable grounds because, it considering that the substantive standard of appropriateness is really a standard that sets a floor, and that therefore the court could say, well, since that floor is abided by, we can limit the amount to what the floor would cost.

    Mr. Ayer, I hate to take part of it, but it's an important point to me. 
    This list that you would make up and submit to the parents is just a list as to schools that meet the State educational standards. 
    It isn't a list of those schools that don't charge more than you're willing to pay, is it?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3262.161" stopTime="3264.114">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, we weren't proposing to make up a list, Your Honor--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I didn't--
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3264.455" stopTime="3268.465">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --but if someone were to make a list that reflected State standards, it would only reflect State standards.

    --Not cost.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, that list would not, and you could have another list that would. 
    But three points I'd like to make very quickly, and one is that I must take exception to the proposition that the purpose of the act is to provide an appropriate education as that word is defined in Rowley. 
    The purpose of the act is to provide a FAPE, a free appropriate public education, which is, I think, a good bit more than an appropriate education, which is one that simply confers some benefit. 
    Second, I would also disagree with the proposition that the obligation and the intention of the statute that their be cooperation ends as soon as the IEP is signed. 
    Indeed, it's a continuing process that's intended to go on into the future, and I--
