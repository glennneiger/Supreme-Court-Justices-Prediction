    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    This case comes to us from the Supreme Court of Hawaii. 
    The respondent, Norris, lost his job as an aircraft mechanic with the petitioner, Hawaiian Airlines when he refused to sign a maintenance record for a plane he considered unsafe. 
    He brought separate State Court suits against the Airline and its officers in which, he alleged wrongful discharge in violation of public policy expressed in federal statutes. 
    The State Court dismissed these tort claims as preempted by the Railway Labor Act. 
    The State Supreme Court reversed rejecting petitioner's claim of preemption. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm that judgment and hold that the Railway Labor Act does not preempt respondent's state law causes of action. 
    The court is unanimous on this one.
