    Mr. R. Napier Murphy 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves a claim that section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires Bleckley County, Georgia, to enlarge its current, single-member county commission to a five-person commission. 
    Our position is that the act cannot be read as authorizing Federal courts to alter the size of governing bodies. 
    Instead, the existing structure of State and local governments, the number, and types of offices, must be taken as a given, a basic assumption. 
    Thus, while the method of election may be a cognizable claim, changing the size of a government to prove a voting rights violation is not.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="94.094" stopTime="124.512">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well now, that means that if, for instance, we had a situation where some counties had three-member commissions and others had five-member commissions, that if minority voters in a three-member commission county sued under section 2 seeking a five-member commission, you would say that, as in this case, section 2 just doesn't cover it.
speaker="r_napier_murphy" startTime="124.512" stopTime="143.716">
    Mr. R. Napier Murphy 
    Your Honor, our position is not that section 2 doesn't cover a claim. 
    Our argument is that section 2 cannot be read as authorizing Federal courts to change the size of the government. 
    The courts must look at the existing structure when analyzing a section 2 claim.

    No.

    So that the overarching proposition that section 2 does not apply to changes in the size of a governing body has at least one exception in the case that I put.

    There has been a group of private plaintiffs who have filed a lawsuit seeking to change the size of the local governing body. 
    Our position is that the intent of Congress in writing section 2 was not to guarantee election to office, not to guarantee proportional representation, but simply to question whether the existing size, or the existing system dilutes minority--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="261.954" stopTime="279.143">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But I just want to make sure what your proposition is. 
    I thought that you'd stated at the outset that section 2 is not applicable to changes in the size of governmental entities, and I put this hypothetical designed to test that, and I'm still not sure of your answer.

    Mr. R. Napier Murphy 
    --Your Honor, section 2 has not... section 2 addresses the method of electing persons to office. 
    If there were a change by the government from five to three, and it could be proven that there was a dilution of minority voting strength as a result of that, then there would be a claim under section 2.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    All right, then the courts are, in that instance, interfering with a governmental decision as to what the size of the governing body ought to be.
speaker="r_napier_murphy" startTime="312.505" stopTime="321.162">
    Mr. R. Napier Murphy 
    That is because the governing body has made a change in the size.

    Mr. R. Napier Murphy 
    No, sir, I don't agree with that. 
    I don't think an act of omission is the same as an act of commission. 
    There was one case from Carroll County, Georgia, in which there was a change in the size of the county commission from three to one, and in that case the plaintiffs were able to prove an intent to discriminate and to dilute minority voting strength as a result of that. 
    That is not the situation in our case.

    The question here is whether Congress intended, under section 2, to authorize Federal courts to judge the governmental structure not as it presently is constituted, but as it might be in a hypothetical model, and if we have three, or five, or seven, or one, it doesn't matter how many members you are electing to office, minority members could always come in and say, in our five-member commission we are in a minority, we can't get elected, but if you increase the commission to 10, then we have a chance to have proportional representation.

    Well, you may have a very different... I mean, you do, it seems to me, have a very different argument when you in effect say, well, where are you going to stop, are you going to impose a 100-member commission, and so on and on, but that's a very different argument.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I think the answer is the only position taken in this case is that where you have what they call benchmarks, five or three, that you could use those, not that you could use anything other than those, but that you must have solid precedent for those.

    Mr. R. Napier Murphy 
    --Your Honor, I disagree that that is a benchmark in Georgia. 
    There are counties with all different sizes. 
    It's a question of local and State interest in determining the size, because every county is different. 
    They have different geographies, different ideologies, different needs, and simply because most counties have five doesn't mean that the citizens in one county or another must have five or must have three simply because that's the most popular form.

    Five plus one at large. 
    It was a referendum. 
    The General Assembly passed legislation authorizing a referendum to go to a six-member commission, five from districts and one at large. 
    There was very little interest in the black community in that referendum. 
    It was a tax issue. 
    There had been an ad valorem tax change in the county by the commissioner, voters were unhappy with it, the referendum was held whether to change the commission, and the voters in the county, only 25 percent of whom voted, voted in favor of keeping their sole commissioner. 
    In School Board District Number 2, which is the majority black school board district, the measure passed by only 2 votes, and there was very little organized interest in the black community at all in that referendum.

    Mr. R. Napier Murphy 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Four years earlier, the county had decided to go to five single-member districts for the school board, so it's not a question of whether the county is racist or polarized. 
    The county voters decided they preferred five single-member districts for the school board. 
    As far as their county governing authority is concerned, one is what the citizens there prefer.

    The county commissioner is paid by taxpayers.

    --Yes. 
    That is the reason... that is the primary reason local voters like what they have. 
    If you need your roads scraped, if you need anything that the county commissioner has authority to do, you walk into his office, and you talk to him about it.

    I'm just wondering if your financial concern might be met by hiring your one administrator to do most of the work and then have these five commissioners on a part-time, low-salaried basis.

    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    The district court judge, after he heard all of the evidence in this case, announced from the bench that having run for public office himself, I guarantee you under these circumstances I wouldn't run if I were black in Bleckley County. 
    You're going to put your hard-earned time and shoe leather campaigning through this county under these circumstances. 
    The court of appeals found that voting in Bleckley County is along racial lines. 
    At present, the only polling place in this county, which consists of 219 square miles, is an all-white private club. 
    Between 1978 and 1986, 224 persons were appointed to serve as poll managers in Bleckley County, and not one of the 224 appointees were black persons.

    That's correct, Your Honor, but looking at the legislative history, the principal problem that the Congress was addressing in enacting the Voting Rights Act was the dilution of minority voting strength at the legislative body process, and I think that that's the distinction that should be drawn here with regards to true single-member offices and legislative offices--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Coates, you said, I thought, in response to Justice Souter's question that you look all around the country for a benchmark so that even if all of the 250 or whatever it is counties they have in Georgia all had single commissioners, you might find a benchmark out in the State of Oregon, say, where perhaps they all had... the counties had five-member commissions?
speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="2072.960" stopTime="2079.286">
    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    No, sir. 
    I think that the first place you would look to a benchmark would be to the State, because that would determine the State's policy.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2079.286" stopTime="2086.360">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So if you found all single commissioners in Georgia, could you look any further?
speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="2086.360" stopTime="2102.249">
    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    I think that that would be a much more difficult case, because if Georgia had a statute that provided that every county would have a sole commissioner, then there would be a strong argument in this case that the State policy required the sole-commissioner form of government, but I thought--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2102.249" stopTime="2103.301">

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    The district court went with you, as I understand it, the first two steps of the way. 
    Where the district court and the court of appeals divided was on what has been called the second two Gingles factors. 
    Would you explain on what basis you think that your case meets those second two requirements, the cohesiveness on the part of the minority community and the bloc voting on the part of the majority community?
speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="2174.768" stopTime="2225.450">
    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    Well, the court of appeals held that the analysis applied to the issue of racial bloc voting by the district court judge was too narrow. 
    The district court held that in making that analysis, or determination, that he was limited to statistical analysis in determining the existence or nonexistence of racial bloc voting. 
    The court of appeals held that you could look to other, antidotal evidence in the case that addressed the issue of racial polarization, such as the fact that when black people go to vote in Bleckley County, that there would be in an 8-year period 224 black... white managers and no black managers, for example. 
    The court of appeals said that one could look at--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2225.450" stopTime="2251.927">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, you wouldn't have to look at anything other than if you had a minority population that would always be the case. 
    Then no single-member system would be permissible. 
    There was no proof of any kind with respect to the division of the votes at the time of the referendum minority-majority votes for and against, was there?
speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="2251.927" stopTime="2356.667">
    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    --That's correct, because in 1986, the eight existing precincts that existed in 1984 had been consolidated into one precinct, and under a one-precinct situation regression analysis is not possible because you need at least two or more precincts to compare to do the regression analysis, so it was not a possibility for the plaintiffs in this case to offer a statistical showing concerning the 1986 referendum. 
    But the court of appeals pointed to footnote 25 of this Court's opinion in the Gingles case and read that footnote to say that the district court was incorrect in ruling that you looked at only statistical evidence, and allowed a broader look, and on that basis came to the conclusion that the district court had erred. 
    What is the broader look, other than that when you have a unit that has a majority population and a minority population, the chances are that you will have a representative from the majority group? 
    The broader look was the continuing racial segregation and polarization within the county which created an impediment for black candidates to solicit white voters, or for black voters to form coalitions with white voters, and that continuing polarization was evidence sufficient in addition to the statistical evidence that the plaintiffs offered to satisfy the racial polarization requirement in Gingles. 
    The court--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2356.667" stopTime="2376.900">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    If you have a jurisdiction in which, say, there are four races, and one race is 10 percent, and that race has had difficulty in electing its representative, I take it under your principle we would have to go to proportional representation and have, say, a 10-person commission?
speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="2376.900" stopTime="2419.976">
    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    --No, sir. 
    First of all, our position is that the increase in the number of representatives on the governing authority would first be determined by looking at the State law benchmark, and the State law benchmark in this case I believe is 5, it would not be 10. 
    Secondarily, this court held in 1972, in the Beens case... I think it's Sixty-seventh Minnesota v. Beens... that minor deviations are allowed from the State choice concerning the number of representatives. 
    If the deviation from the State benchmark were more than minor, then Beens would tend to teach that that alteration would not be allowed.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2419.976" stopTime="2439.451">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, let me put it this way. 
    If there were a benchmark that permitted a governing body of a size which would give proportional representation to the excluded race, then it is your position that they would have to reconform the district accordingly, is it not, in the case that I put?
speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="2439.451" stopTime="2441.722">

speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="2445.275" stopTime="2462.585">
    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    --No, sir. 
    No, because the increase there, Your Honor, would be not because of the claim of proportional representation, but because the expansion would be tied to the benchmark established by State law, as is the case here.

    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    No, sir. 
    The... in this case, I would respectfully beg to differ. 
    The court did not say... the court of appeals did not say, in suggesting the use of the five single-member district plan, that that was done to effectuate proportional representation. 
    It chose the five single-member district plan because it would have been choosing an alternative system which was established by a benchmark of State policy.

    Well, let me ask you this... let me ask you this: suppose the... we affirm the finding that there should be a five-member district.

    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    The... if the plan was drawn as the board of education... if the board of education plan was adopted, then I do not think it would be fair to say that that would be drawn on strictly a race-conscious basis, because that is the very plan adopted by the Georgia General Assembly in 1983 for school board elections, so what the court of appeals was suggesting--

    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    No, it does not have to be because of proportional representation. 
    It would have to be because of the finding of vote dilution, Your Honor, is affirmed by this Court, then the district court, in determining the remedy, would have the responsibility of implementing a plan that would cure the vote dilution effect.

    Mr. Coates, we said in Chisom v. Roemer... and I didn't agree with our saying it, but we said it, and maybe we said it in order to get around this problem of converting section 2 against its plain text into a provision that provides proportional representation.

    Black people have to go to the polls, but they are run by white people.

    Mr. Coates, could you have another referendum? 
    The State proposed it in '85-'86, and it seemed that there wasn't much of an interest in either community in voting in that referendum, but if the preference, the strong minority preference is for a five-member commission, could you have another referendum?

    Do you have any information in this record about what happened in the other counties, now we've got this number that's now dwindled to 11, and they went from one to a larger number?

    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    Yes. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    There's a... in the appendix, there have been the consent orders in some of the cases which have been settled. 
    For example, in Webster County there was a sole commissioner, there was an expansion to a three-member commission elected from single-member districts, and an at-large commissioner who would serve as the county administrative official, so that's how in one of the counties the problem has been resolved. 
    There has... there's no evidence that in any of these counties have the cases been resolved on the basis of expanding the membership of a sole commissioner to 50 or 100 commissioners.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Suppose that throughout Georgia the choice were between having either a one-commissioner system or a three-commissioner system, and suppose further that in Bleckley County the increment from one to three would not result in the election of any representatives of the black community. 
    What then would be your position as to the appropriate remedy? 
    Could the court then order five?
speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="3007.091" stopTime="3021.320">
    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    That would be a much more difficult case, because there would be a policy, a State policy applied across the board to counties that would establish either a one-person commission or a three-person commission.

    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    Because in determining the benchmark for the increase, I believe that it would be appropriate for the Federal courts to give deference to the State policy established in that benchmark. 
    The Federal courts would not be at liberty to just create numbers so as to achieve some type of proportional representation, but they... but the--

speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="3068.801" stopTime="3097.900">
    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    --Yes, sir. 
    It is mentioned in the legislative history of section 2, where it says that in determining whether or not a State's policy is tenuous, you look to how the State has treated other jurisdictions in a State. 
    The State policy is not established by what happens in Bleckley County. 
    The State policy is established by comparing how Bleckley County is treated with other counties in the State.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, Mr. Coates, I don't find anything, actually, in section 2 that says you defer to State policy. 
    If you find vote dilution then there's a violation and a Federal remedy is required.
speaker="christopher_coates" startTime="3110.108" stopTime="3118.994">
    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    The only place that it is referred to is not in the face of the statute, but in the seven Senate factors. 
    The tenuousness of the State policy is--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3118.994" stopTime="3126.188">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    In looking at the totality of the circumstances to determine the dilution question, right?

    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    --Yes, ma'am. 
    That would be one of the factors that a court would appropriately look at.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3131.911" stopTime="3138.216">

    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    Yes. 
    The only analysis that I'm saying, or presenting to the Court, is that the Federal court would not be permitted to completely disregard the State's policy, but that's not what happened in this case.

    Well, isn't it the nub of your argument that dilution is in effect a question involving comparisons, and what the appropriate comparison may be, you assume, Congress intended to be established by looking to traditional practice within a State?

    Is that--

    That's correct, a State practice establishes the benchmark, and it would be a different case--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    --So ultimately you're saying, what is an appropriate comparison is a question of congressional intent, and congressional intent was, look to what they have been doing within the State for other possible, reasonable comparisons.

    Mr. Christopher Coates 
    --That's correct, because I think section 2 shows that there's a demonstrated Federal interest to cure the problem of vote dilution in the United States. 
    I mean, it's Nationwide, and so if there's vote dilution found, and there's a Federal interest in correcting that, then if you're going to give some special weight to the State's interest, it at least ought to be an interest that has been applied by the State in some type of systematic manner, not--

    You talk about vote dilution as though it's something objective, but you've told us it isn't objective, that there's no such thing as vote dilution if you've had a single-member office all along. 
    That isn't vote dilution, even though the same system set up somewhere else is vote dilution if... I don't now, if it hasn't been a uniform State policy.

    No, no, but you said in another State there wouldn't be. 
    If another State had all single-member people, that wouldn't be vote dilution, even though the votes would be diluted to the same degree, but that wouldn't be "vote dilution" as you've been talking about, isn't that right?

   Rebuttal of R. Napier Murphy
speaker="r_napier_murphy" startTime="3290.256" stopTime="3422.772">
    Mr. R. Napier Murphy 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    We have a county of 10,000 people. 
    70 percent of the registered voters, black and white, are registered. 
    Voter registration is equal for both blacks and whites. 
    They vote equally in all elections, the same percentages... 29 to 30 to 31 percent. 
    It's the same. 
    They have an equal opportunity to participate in that county, whether they are voting for one sole commissioner, one sheriff, or one school board district member. 
    We're not talking about benchmarking in order to prove a section 2 claim. 
    We're talking about bootstrapping. 
    In these other counties that went from one to three... one to three... why didn't they go one to five? 
    Because three guaranteed proportional representation. 
    If five is the benchmark, these other sole commissioner counties that have decided to change should have gone to five. 
    If we're talking about benchmarking, should the Texas legislature, which has only 31 members, be expanded to meet the modal size of State legislatures in this country? 
    There are no workable limits if we start changing or expanding the size of government to determine a vote dilution claim. 
    You look at the existing number of seats. 
    This Court refused, in the Beens case referred to by Mr. Coates, to order a reduction of 50 percent in the State Senate of Minnesota and 25 percent in the House of Representatives. 
    This Court refused that change even for a constitutional violation. 
    We are talking about a 500-percent change in the size of the governing body for this small county. 
    That is not a minor change. 
    Mr. Coates also referred to sheriffs as having executive authority, but sheriffs make many decisions which affect minorities. 
    Hiring minority deputies, enforcing the laws as to minorities, providing patrols for minority neighborhoods... all of those actions affect minority voters. 
    You cannot--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Murphy, if we were to look at the district court decision and go that far, reject your argument as far as the district court did, what would your argument be about what it would take to satisfy the factors that the court of appeals found were not satisfied in this case, the bloc voting and cohesiveness? 
    Let's say that you lose on your main argument, and we're back in the district court, and the district court says, in my view, this case fails for lack of proof on those two items, what would be adequate proof?
speaker="r_napier_murphy" startTime="3458.456" stopTime="3485.785">
    Mr. R. Napier Murphy 
    --Adequate proof of political cohesion would be proof that minorities get together to sponsor candidates, that they run a candidate. 
    No minority has ever run for any county-wide office in the 81-year history with the exception of one election for a probate judge in 1984, but as long as no minority runs for office in that county, then it's certain that no minority will win election.
