Johnson v. California
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="73.239">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 03-6539 Johnson against California. 
    We granted certiorari in this case to review a decision of the Supreme Court of California interpreting Batson against Kentucky, a challenge as to jurors. 
    The case was briefed and argued but we now conclude that we are without jurisdiction in the matter because the opinion of the California Supreme Court was not final. 
    We conclude this opinion in these words, "It behooves counsel for both petitioner and respondent to assure themselves that the decision for which review was sought is indeed a final judgment under Section 1257. 
    Such attention is mandated by our rules and will avoid the expenditure of resources of both counsel and of this Court on an abortive proceeding such as the present one." 
    We dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction. 
    The Per Curiam opinion is unanimous.
