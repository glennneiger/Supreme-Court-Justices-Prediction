    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In 1990, Congress enacted a catchall four years statute of limitations applicable to all causes of action arising under acts of Congress thereafter enacted. 
    The question in this case is whether that limitations period applies to a cause of action rising under 42 U.S.C. 1981, a statute that was originally enacted after the Civil War but amended in important respects in 1991. 
    The claim asserted by the petitioners in this case would not have stated a violation of the 1981 as originally enacted but it does state a violation of the amended statute. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the Clerk, contrary to the views of the Court of Appeals, we conclude that the claim arose under the amended statute and that the four years statute limitations applies. 
    Our opinion is unanimous.
