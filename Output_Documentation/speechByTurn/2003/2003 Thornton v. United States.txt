    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 03-5165, Thornton against United States. 
    Here a Norfolk Virginia a police officer attempted to pull over petitioner, a guy name Marcus Thornton. 
    Before the officer could stop petitioner however, he parked and exited his vehicle. 
    The officer pulled in behind petitioner and accosted him. 
    After discovering that he had narcotics on him, the officer arrested him and searched the passenger compartment of his car. 
    Under the driver’s seat, the officer has found a handgun. 
    Petitioner was charged with federal drug and firearms violation. 
    The District Court denied his motion to suppress the firearm as a fruit of an illegal search relying among other cases on our opinion in New York against Belton. 
    In Belton, we held that when a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest of an automobile’s occupant, the Fourth Amendment allows the officer to search the vehicle’s passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident to that arrest. 
    The petitioner appealed his conviction arguing that Bellton was limited to situations where the officer initiated contact with an arrestee while the arrestee, in this case petitioner, was still in the car. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    We granted certiorari and we now affirm. 
    In Belton, we sought to set forth a bright-line rule that would protect officer’s safety and preserve evidence for trial. 
    We place no reliance on whether the officer initiated the contact with the occupant of the vehicle. 
    In all relevant aspects, the arrest of a suspect who is next to a vehicle presents identical concerns regarding officer’s safety and the destruction of evidence as the arrest of one who is still inside the vehicle. 
    It would make little sense to apply two different rules to what is at bottom the same situation. 
    We disagree with the petitioner that applying Belton’s rule to arrestees who are not confronted while they were inside the vehicle would diminish its clarity. 
    Belton explicitly applied to recent occupants of a car as well as occupant. A rule requiring officers to signal confrontation with occupants of vehicles would be inherently subjective, highly facts-specific, and would require precisely the sort of ad hoc determinations of the officers in the field and of reviewing courts that Belton sought to avoid. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals was affirmed. 
    Justice O’Connor has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Ginsburg has joined; Justice Stevens has filed a disssenting opinion in which Justice Souter has joined.
