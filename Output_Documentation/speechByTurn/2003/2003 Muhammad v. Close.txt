    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The second case which I have to announce is No. 02-9065. 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    The petitioner Muhammad is a state prisoner. 
    He brought this 1983 action alleging that a prison officer had charged him with threatening behavior and subjected him to mandatory pre-hearing lock up in retaliation for prior lawsuits and grievance proceedings against the officer. 
    The amended complaint sought money damages solely for the physical, mental, and emotional injuries sustained during the six days of pre-hearing detention. 
    The District Court awarded summary judgment to the officer. 
    Muhammad appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which affirmed the summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by a favorable termination requirement set out in a 1994 decision in Heck against Humphrey. 
    In the unanimous Per Curiam filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we reverse and remand finding that the Court of Appeals made two mistakes. 
    It mistakenly assumed that Muhammad sought expungement of his misconduct charge, but such a request is absent from his amended complaint. 
    It also relied on Circuit precedent for the proposition that the favorable termination requirement applies categorically to all suits challenging prison disciplinary proceedings. 
    We hold that Heck’s rule is trigged only where a judgment would raise an implication about the validity of extent of an underlying conviction although, prison disciplinary proceedings may do just that by bearing on the award of revocation of good time credits, for example. 
    That is not necessarily so. 
    In this case, Muhammad raised no claim on which habeas relief could have granted on any recognized theory with the consequence that Heck’s rule was inapplicable. 
    So, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    It is unanimous.
