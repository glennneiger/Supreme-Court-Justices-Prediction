United States v. Scheffer

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1133, United States v. Edward G. Scheffer. 
    Mr. Dreeben.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="7.777" stopTime="82.616">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Polygraph evidence is opinion evidence about credibility. 
    Based on inherent doubts about the reliability of polygraph evidence and the burdens of litigating about polygraph results, it has long been banned from courtrooms in a majority of the States. 
    In 1991, the President adopted the same rule for military courts martial. 
    Exercising delegated authority from Congress, the President promulgated Rule 707, which makes polygraph evidence per se inadmissible in military courts martials. 
    That determination is constitutionally valid for three main reasons. 
    First, the reliability of the polygraph remains unproven. 
    Second, polygraph evidence is not necessary to help the trier of fact perform its core function of determining credibility of witnesses, and third, the costs of litigating about the reliability of polygraph evidence on a case-by-case basis outweigh any limited probative value that the polygraph may have.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Would that have been the... was that the consequence of the Armed Forces Court of Appeals opinion here that the validity of each individual polygraph examination had to be tested in each case?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="96.646" stopTime="129.827">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    I think that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    In 1987, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, then the Court of Appeal... Military Appeals, determined that the per se rule against polygraph evidence which had prevailed in the military should be dropped, and that individual defendants should have the opportunity to litigate about it in each case, and in 1991 the evident response to that was to reinstate the per se rule that had been prevalent in courts across the country as well as the military courts.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    How is it handled in other jurisdictions where there's no per se rule in effect? 
    Is it treated like any other bit of scientific evidence?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="140.774" stopTime="156.625">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    It is not, Justice O'Connor. 
    In the States, 27 States have per se rules; 22 States allow polygraph evidence into... to be admitted only if there is a stipulation between the parties so that the parties have agreed to it.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="156.625" stopTime="163.731">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And so from your research no State is treating it like other expert testimony, in effect.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    One State is. 
    The State of New Mexico is allowing polygraph evidence in on a routine basis, provided that a very strict list of procedural requirements are satisfied, but--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="175.279" stopTime="179.802">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But even New Mexico doesn't follow the typical expert testimony approach.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --I think that that's fair. 
    The requirements are spelled out in the statute with a--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="182.914" stopTime="183.235">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="183.235" stopTime="189.438">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --far greater degree of specificity than for other expert testimony. 
    Now, in the Federal system--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Daubert, of course, is in the civil context, but would you say that the petitioner's... pardon me, that the respondent's position here is consistent generally with what we held in Daubert?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="204.138" stopTime="224.401">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --I think the respondent's position here is... goes quite a bit further than Daubert. 
    Daubert, of course, is simply an interpretation of Federal Rule of Evidence 702. 
    The respondent's position here is that the Constitution prohibits any promulgator of a system of evidentiary rules from establishing a per se rule.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="224.401" stopTime="233.698">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I recognize the difference. 
    I'm talking about the thrust of the case and what it held, which was to undercut the Frye-type rule which is really being applied by the military here.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="233.698" stopTime="235.828">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    That is--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="235.828" stopTime="247.465">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I recognize one's civil, one's criminal, one's constitutional, one's evidence, but so far as the thrust of what the Court was talking about so far as sound management of trials, isn't there some inconsistency with your position in Daubert?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="247.465" stopTime="314.409">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --I don't think there is any inconsistency. 
    The point of Daubert was to drop the strict rule of general acceptance in the scientific community as a prerequisite for scientific evidence to be admitted. 
    Daubert did not do away with the rest of the evidentiary considerations that may bear on whether particular evidence may be admitted. 
    Prominent among those are the requirement in Rule 702 itself that evidence in the form of expert testimony must assist the trier of fact, and furthermore that it's benefits, its probative value must not be significantly outweighed by the waste of time, confusion, or redundancy of other evidence that might be admitted. 
    Those type of considerations amply justify exclusion of polygraph evidence. 
    Polygraph evidence is very different from most other kinds of scientific evidence that comes into the courtroom. 
    It represents in essence the opinion of the polygraph examiner that, based on an examination of the particular subject, he was deceptive or not deceptive on one particular occasion.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="314.409" stopTime="353.535">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Dreeben, when the Government itself is responsible for the polygraph, and the Government is attacking the credibility of the defendant, isn't that a different situation? 
    This doesn't have to be all or nothing, but at least as in this case, where the Government itself chose to administer a polygraph test and in prosecuting attacked the credibility of the defendant, when you have those two things, why isn't that enough to trigger a constitutional concern?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="353.535" stopTime="395.353">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Justice Ginsburg, the Government might have had a particular defendant interviewed by a psychiatrist if the defendant consented to that, and the psychiatrist might say, based on my expert opinion and analysis of this particular person's responses in the interview, I can render an opinion that he was quite certainly deceptive or not deceptive. 
    That kind of evidence is never admitted in courtrooms in this country. 
    Outside opinion, expert testimony that vouches for the credibility of a witness who testifies, is routinely excluded by both the State and Federal courts as not being needed to assist the trier of fact and, indeed, of impinging on the trier of fact's core function, and it is not--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="395.353" stopTime="424.664">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you this. 
    There's a brief filed by an amicus, a group of social scientists who say that, if properly conducted, these tests are accurate about 90 percent of the time. 
    Now, I don't know whether you would accept that, or you would say that's probably wrong, but assume that's correct, and if there are proper safeguards given and all the rest, what would your position be? 
    Even if it was 100 percent accurate, would you still say, along the argument you're making to Justice Ginsburg, this still should be excluded?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="424.664" stopTime="434.031">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --Yes. 
    I think, Justice Stevens, that it has a drawback from the point of view of courtroom evidence that justifies its exclusion even on the assumption--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="434.031" stopTime="435.430">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Even if completely reliable?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="435.430" stopTime="441.034">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --Well, completely reliable, I think that no form of scientific tests will ever be viewed by any--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="441.034" stopTime="444.286">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, at least as reliable as fingerprints or DNA or something like that.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="444.286" stopTime="455.926">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --Even if it had achieved that degree of reliability, which I think there's no reason to believe that it has, and there's no reason why the President as a matter of constitutional law must assume, it still has a different character--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="455.926" stopTime="456.376">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I understand.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="456.376" stopTime="482.633">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --than other forms of scientific evidence in two key respects. 
    The first is that it tells the trier of fact something that we have traditionally entrusted the trier of fact to determine itself, namely, whether a particular witness should be believed. 
    There are many kinds of experts who might be willing to come into court and render an opinion about credibility and say yes, indeed, I'm an expert on this. 
    My work has been validated by numerous outside bodies, and I think that this particular witness is credible.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="482.633" stopTime="483.124">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But why doesn't--
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="483.124" stopTime="483.674">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    We don't have that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="483.674" stopTime="496.644">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Why doesn't fingerprint do the... evidence do the same thing if the witness says... gets on the stand and says, I was never in the place where the crime took place, and somebody says, well, your fingerprints were there. 
    Doesn't that do the same thing?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="496.644" stopTime="555.522">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --No. 
    It does something quite different, Justice Stevens, and that's my second distinction of polygraph evidence. 
    It provides the trier of fact with factual information that it would otherwise have no access to. 
    An expert who was able to bring to the jury's attention specific scientific information that has a degree of reliability that is outside the realm of normal jurors' comprehension serves a valid function in the trial system, and is unlikely ever to be excluded by a reasonable system of evidentiary rules precisely because it does enable the proof of facts that could not occur otherwise. 
    Rules of evidence must be evenhanded, and the Government bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case of establishing a suspect's guilt, and it is therefore extremely unlikely that a reasonable system of rules of evidence will ever exclude reliable scientific testimony that is necessary to determine the facts. 
    The Government would suffer far more than any criminal defendant in such a system, because we would lose the ability--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="555.522" stopTime="567.129">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, this rule cuts both ways, because there might be times when the Government would like to produce a polygraph test in court because it shows the defendant is lying.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="567.129" stopTime="568.311">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --That's correct, Justice--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="568.311" stopTime="573.294">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And under the military rule, the Government can't do that. 
    So it cuts both ways here, I assume.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="573.294" stopTime="584.330">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --It does, and I think that that largely reflects the fact that we take a consistent position on this. 
    We don't believe that it's sufficiently reliable for courtroom evidence, and we think that it performs a function that the trier--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="584.330" stopTime="593.998">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What... under what authority did the President adopt the rule? 
    What is the provision that says the President may adopt these evidentiary rules?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="593.998" stopTime="623.466">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --The President is delegated authority under Article 36 of the U.C.M.J., which is reprinted in footnote 2 on page 5 of our principal brief, and it says that pretrial, trial, and post trial procedures, including modes of proof, may be prescribed by the President by regulations which, so far as he considers practicable, apply principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in a trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="623.466" stopTime="642.079">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Getting back to your colloquy with Justice O'Connor just a moment ago, I think perhaps the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces might have taken a different view if the Government had sought to introduce the polygraph test, because they seem to base their constitutional decision on the defendant's right to call witnesses in his favor.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="642.079" stopTime="661.100">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    That is absolutely right, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    This was not a two-way-street decision. 
    The decision partially invalidated Rule 707 to the extent that it erects a per se bar to the defendant's presentation of evidence. 
    The rule would otherwise remain in effect and bar the Government from introducing it, but I think--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="661.100" stopTime="662.792">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, the President could change that, the scope of--
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="662.792" stopTime="697.414">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --The President could change that. 
    Justice Scalia, the President could certainly change it, but I think it's important to emphasize here that the Department of Justice in criminal trials in the civilian courts takes the position that polygraph evidence should not be offered by prosecutors even when it might arguably be of assistance to us, and that it should be opposed when presented by defense lawyers, and we do that precisely for the same reasons that the President relied on in promulgating Rule 707. 
    The underlying scientific validity of polygraph evidence has always been a source of extreme controversy, and it has--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Mr. Dreeben, as to the truth-telling identification that the polygraph is offered for, it's been traditionally allowed to have a character witness for defendants. 
    Defendant testifies and he has a character witness that testifies to his reputation in the community for truth-telling.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --Correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="723.692" stopTime="733.689">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, isn't the polygraph far more reliable than just any character witness the defendant wants to present?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="733.689" stopTime="768.763">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that that assumes that there is scientific validity and accuracy to the polygraph, which we dispute, but more importantly, the system of rules of evidence that we have in courtrooms specifically right now allows opinion evidence and reputation evidence about a trait of character of a witness, but it does not allow specific instances, and it certainly does not allow a witness to say, I know this person, he did denied committing the crime to me, and I believe him. 
    That kind of testimony is routinely disallowed in criminal trials around--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="768.763" stopTime="772.414">

    No, but it's reputation as to credibility that the character witness testifies to.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --I think there's an important distinction, Justice Stevens, and that is the polygraph examiner will not render an opinion that I believe that this person is generally credible. 
    He will render an opinion that says, based on physiological responses that I observed, and all other information that was available to me in whatever hour and a half I had with this individual, I concluded that he did not exhibit physiological signs of deception on this particular instance, and that is akin to an expert psychiatrist meeting with a defendant, interviewing him, and coming away with the view that I think this man is credible when he says that he didn't commit the act.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="819.856" stopTime="832.194">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but there's a difference as to the degree of reliability between the two, obviously, and... but your position as I understand it is, even if it were totally reliable, you would still take the same position it's inadmissible.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben

    The official policy of most of the users of the polygraph in personnel screening, which is its main application, is that the polygraph result itself is not a basis for any action one way or the other.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Not even to hire or not hire someone?

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Not even to hire or not hire, except in extraordinary circumstances, and I certainly don't want to say that it never would be relied on as a sole factor, but it primarily is used in personnel screening in this way: 
    Questions are asked. 
    If the examiner concludes that there is some deception, there is an effort to determine what the truth is by further investigation, further questioning of the applicant and so forth. 
    Generally, problems can get resolved that way, and it is the entire body of evidence that is developed in a background check that leads to a decision. 
    The polygraph itself is not supposed to be a tool used in isolation, and it is distinguishable to say that in a context where the Government is considering whether to give access to an individual for national security purposes to use anything available that might be helpful in developing an accurate picture of an individual. 
    It's quite another thing--

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --In investigations, the polygraph is an extraordinarily productive interrogation tool. 
    An enormous amount of confessions are given when a suspect either fails a polygraph or believes that a polygraph is about to smoke him out. 
    I have to say that in that sense there are examiners who believe that it is entirely reliable in this respect, and that it's a great interrogation tool because it's accurate. 
    There are other people who will say that, well, it's a great placebo. 
    There is a story of a police interrogation in a State system where the police put a colander on a suspect's head and wired it up to a Xerox machine, and then pressed a button that produced a picture, a little copy that said, you're lying, every time the suspect answered. 
    [Laughter]

    Well, it has a certain use in that respect that would suggest that the Government continues to use it, but at the same time, it's not arbitrary to say that, look, not everything that we do in the investigatory phase should come into admission in evidence.

    Are there instances in which an employee is terminated for failure to take a polygraph, Government employment?
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="1126.840" stopTime="1255.322">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    My understanding, Justice Kennedy, is that in the... certain national security agencies if you're not willing to take a polygraph, then you won't be able to work at that agency. 
    In the Department of Defense, for example, you may be transferred to an equivalent job that doesn't require access to particular national security information, but you won't be terminated. 
    And Congress, of course, which has addressed extensively the problem of polygraph reliability, has banned most of its uses entirely in the private sector in large part because of concerns about its reliability, so the President, when considering whether military courts martials ought to be a forum for the admission of polygraph evidence, is entitled to take into account the findings of Congress in enacting the Polygraph Protection Act, the fact that 27 States enjoy a per se rule that bars polygraph evidence, and the fact that until this Court decided Daubert, the uniform rule in the Federal courts, with the exception of the Eleventh Circuit in 1989, was that polygraph evidence is per se inadmissible. 
    And even after Daubert has been decided, and several Federal courts have reconsidered whether it is appropriate to have a per se rule and have opted some case-by-case litigation, polygraph evidence is rarely being admitted in criminal trials in the civilian courts, by and large because the judges are concluding that either it will not assist the trier of fact, or it is unreliable either in a particular instance or across the board, or because traditional Rule 403 balancing considerations justify the exclusion of the evidence because it's not really needed. 
    I think that the President is certainly in a position to take all of that into account and to conclude that the military courts, of all places, should not be a place where experimentation with new evidence is to be carried out. 
    If there ever came a time when experience in the civilian courts revealed that the polygraph was a vital engine for getting out the truth, and that it ought to be part of our criminal trial process, I'm quite sure that the President or an appropriate rulemaking authority would recommend reconsideration of Rule 707.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Dreeben, why doesn't it work the other way with respect to the military courts, because my understanding is that the courts martial, the equivalent to the jurors, are of a certain high level, perhaps higher than the ordinary jury that would sit in a Federal court in a criminal case.
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="1277.257" stopTime="1320.786">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Justice Ginsburg, I wouldn't want to disparage the ability of the courts martial members to understand and deal appropriately with scientific evidence, but it is still true that the military conducts an inordinate number of court martial proceedings around the world. 
    These proceedings in which, under Daubert, litigants have attempted to admit polygraph evidence usually involve extensive evidentiary hearings back and forth with experts testifying at great length about the supposed merits of the polygraph while other experts come forward and testify about the demerits of the polygraph. 
    One recent hearing that was carried out under the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces decision in Scheffer took 3 days.

    Well, it seems to me you're somewhat deflecting the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question, and I notice this in your brief, too. 
    You talk about danger of confusion of the jury. 
    The military rules allow conclusions of experts on the very premise that military juries are somewhat more sophisticated than most juries.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    That is true, Justice Kennedy, and I don't disagree with that submission. 
    My point is the different one, in that polygraph evidence simply doesn't have a history of use in the civilian courts in this country. 
    It is in an experimental phase in the Federal courts.

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben

    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    --Mr. Chief Justice, that is certainly an additional consideration that supports the rule here. 
    [Laughter] 
    --happy to accept that. 
    What does distinguish polygraph evidence, again, from the other kinds of scientific evidence or ultimate opinion evidence that might come in in these proceedings is that it's about credibility. 
    It's an out-of-court opinion based on one experience, or exposure to the defendant that says that he was not credible or he was credible on this particular occasion, and it's not a form of evidence that is particularly necessary, and it has high costs as far as the litigation of the reliability of the polygraph whenever it is admitted.

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Airman Scheffer's polygraph examination was one of 34,788 polygraph examinations conducted by the Department of Defense in fiscal year 1992. 
    Although Department of Defense personnel rely on polygraph results in matters of national security, Military Rule of Evidence 707 automatically predetermines, without any evidentiary hearing whatsoever, that the results of Airman Scheffer's examination were both unreliable and a waste of the court's time. 
    Despite the fact that polygraph examinations are used in the ordinary course of government business, the rule further predetermined that the military officers who sat in Airman Scheffer's panel were incapable of properly using or evaluating these results, even with proper cautionary instructions from the military judge.

    They're used for counterintelligence operations, where it's absolutely critical that we know, you know, national security issues. 
    They're used in whether or not people are going to have sensitive compartmented access to the secrets of the Nation.

    But that... that... that's a world apart from saying it's reliable enough to make the decision whether you're going to send somebody to jail or not send somebody to jail who belongs there.

    Because the President would be free to say, okay, all bets are off, and the next case, there is no rule. 
    It's the same government examiner that has given the polygraph. 
    And there is an inculpatory result. 
    And the government says, fine. 
    As Justice O'Connor suggested, this is a two-way street, and we're going to use it. 
    He gets on the stand. 
    We're going to say, he's a liar, and here's the polygraph to prove it.

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Yes, Your Honor, you're absolutely right. 
    If... if the rulemaker were to take 707 off the books, which they would have to do, because, right now, we just have a very narrow constitutionally required exception, but if the rulemaker were to take Rule 707 off the books, the potential for inculpatory results would come in. 
    Now, we would submit that would come in, in a parallel sense. 
    For example, in this case, the defendant took the stand. 
    He testified. 
    His credibility was attacked. 
    And it was brought in to bolster his credibility. 
    We would submit that the parallel right, then, would be for when a defendant who takes the stand has taken a government polygraph and failed... that that could perhaps come in to impeach his credibility.

    But... but these cases are few and far between. 
    The greater weight of cases, where you have an exculpatory polygraph, the military convening authority knows that. 
    And, many times, based on that, elects not to take the case to trial at all. 
    And if the... if he knew that those results were admissible, that's very much a factor. 
    As Judge Gerky pointed out for the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, in his opinion, look at the overall effect on military justice with this rule.

    And we could presume that that would meet whatever standards one might set up. 
    If your position is correct, that the defendant is entitled to use this evidence to bolster his credibility, then, in the next case, suppose the government said, we're not going to give this person a test; we think this person could probably pass one. 
    Could that... that defendant then insist, as a matter of his Sixth Amendment right, to have the government provide a polygraph test, which he could then use in his defense?

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Your Honor, we submit no. 
    And on this case, this wasn't a test that this defendant asked for. 
    That's another thing to bear in mind. 
    The government wanted this test done. 
    And they went to him.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't understand this constitutional rule you're asserting. 
    You're asserting that if the evidence exists out there already, because the government has given a test, he has a constitutional right to have it admitted. 
    But he does not have a constitutional right to develop a test on his own, to hire his own... his own polygraph administrator and have that put before the jury?
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="2086.797" stopTime="2092.862">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield

    No; I understand.

    But looking at--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, what's the answer?
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="2150.180" stopTime="2150.520">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    --Well--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2150.520" stopTime="2152.801">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    We'd... we'd have to... we'd have to--

    --we'd have to open the door.
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="2152.801" stopTime="2191.516">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    --Well... well, Your Honor, perhaps and perhaps not. 
    Because the other experts that we're shutting the door on giving truth testimony, a lot of times the most common example is the child accommodation syndrome, where you bring in a clinical social worker who treats abused children, their area of expertise is treating abused children. 
    And then, the types of cases where that ultimate truth testimony is precluded is with that kind of expert. 
    Well, we would submit, the difference with the polygraph, and of course you have to accord some reliability to it, is that this person's expertise is in using a scientific machine and a... a tested theory and a methodology to arrive at a credibility determination.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2191.516" stopTime="2223.089">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yeah, but you can make the same argument, absent the... the... the mechanics on... on the part of the psychiatrist, a psy... or a psychologist, with... with long clinical experience, and the opportunity to verify the stories of the... of the people interviewed, with... with independently verified facts. 
    And it seems to me that, on your logic, that kind of specific credibility testimony would at least have to be ad... admissible potentially. 
    Wouldn't... wouldn't you agree?
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="2223.089" stopTime="2234.907">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Yes, Your Honor, the... the courts don't allow that now. 
    And... and I... I agree with you that the theory would seem to apply to that as well. 
    And oftentimes it comes extremely close.

    But--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    --But... but you really... therefore, if we accept your position, we're... we're going to make a determination not only about polygraphs, but I suppose we would be making a... a kind of sea change in... in... in a... in a constitutional evidence rule. 
    Because we would be, in effect, forcing the courts into a... a realm of evidence which, as a... as a general rule, an almost universally general rule, is inadmissible. 
    And that is, evidence about the specific truth telling in a given instance. 
    So we would... we would really be entering a... a new evidentiary realm here.
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="2275.763" stopTime="2297.168">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Well, Your Honor, I... I would think that the... the... whether or not it's a sea change is going to depend on how narrowly or broadly this Court chooses to view this. 
    Because if you look at it from a standpoint of a polygrapher being someone who has specialized expertise in judging credibility, and look at the others as their specialized expertise in perhaps treating children or victims, there could be differentiations made.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2297.168" stopTime="2327.897">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yet... but your point in... in response to some of the questions, Ms. Sheffield, has been, you know, we don't ask that it be admitted, we just ask that it be submitted to a judge to decide. 
    But it seems to me, following up on Justice Souter's question, you could then call into question all of the hearsay rule. 
    In other words, don't exclude hearsay that... it doesn't come within the traditional exception, but if it has a lot of... it seems reliable, put people on the stand and let the judge decide whether it should come in.
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="2327.897" stopTime="2337.283">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Well, Your Honor, I'm glad... I'm glad you mentioned the hearsay, because the thing with the other evidentiary rules, designed to ensure reliability and other reasons, all of them have exceptions. 
    Hearsay does. 
    And--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2337.283" stopTime="2337.934">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Of course it does.
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="2337.934" stopTime="2352.143">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    --and... and if there is a case, I believe, where the defense thinks their case is strong enough and there's enough indicia of reliability, they will probably make a proffer, under the residual exception. 
    Even privilege rules have exceptions when the policy reasons that underpin them aren't at issue.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2352.143" stopTime="2368.503">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But, nonetheless, there... the rules tend to be categorical. 
    They don't have litigation of whether a particular piece of evidence or particular thing should be admitted, just to be inquired into de novo every time. 
    Because a trial would last for months if you did that.
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="2368.503" stopTime="2374.489">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is your argument, every rule has to have an exception?

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    --Well, Your Honor, what we're saying, basically, is, one, when... when a defendant's constitutional rights are clearly at issue, where he has a Sixth... an arguable Sixth Amendment right that's at issue, a per se rule... you... you have to see if it apply... if the reasons for the per se rule apply in his case. 
    That's what Rock basically said: wholesale inadmissibility is going to be arbitrary.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2401.115" stopTime="2404.029">

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But the underpinnings of Rock, it seems that it would apply with equal force. 
    In fact, I think, in a... in... in this Court's opinion in another case... which escapes me... but... but, basically, the Court said that in Rock--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2419.386" stopTime="2421.128">

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    --Okay. 
    The other case... in Taylor v. Illinois... in a footnote, the Court said: Although in Rock we were addressing the specific issue of the defendant's right to offer testimony, it derived its standard from general compulsory process case law on the theory that the right to present one's own testimony extended at least as far as a right to present testimony of others. 
    I see nothing constitutionally in Rock that would say it could not apply with equal force to someone other than the defendant's testimony.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Really, the... the... the key difference between... between all of these... all of these other rules of admissibility and... is what Justice Souter was inquiring into. 
    And that is, leaping over, into... into this new field of... of accepting evidence on whether... whether the defendant is lying here, today, in this trial, on this fact. 
    And that's... that's... if... if polygraphs are really that good, you know, 90 percent accurate, what do you think the accuracy of juries is?

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    --Well, Your Honor, to me, the... the most perplexing argument is this idea that the jury can determine credibility and the polygraph usurps their function. 
    It is one tool they use. 
    It is simply one piece of the puzzle. 
    And military juries especially, they balance things all the time and weigh competing interests to make important decisions.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2518.225" stopTime="2536.615">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I thought that the argument that Mr. Dreeben was making was not that it usurps the jury's function, but that it's unnecessary, since juries, from time immemorial, have been judging questions of credibility. 
    I thought his argument was, on that branch, it's unnecessary and it's very costly.

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Well... well, Your Honor, we... we submit that it's not unnecessary. 
    And in Airman Scheffer's case, it would be particularly helpful to a jury. 
    Credibility was the issue in this case. 
    Twenty-one times, in closing argument alone, he was called a liar or said his credibility was lacking, even while the trial counsel knew he'd passed this government-initiated polygraph. 
    And interestingly, the government brought in evidence of his external physical manifestations going to credibility. 
    There was testimony in the record from Special Agent Shilaikis, when they... when Airman Scheffer came in, and he explained what happened to him the night before the urinalysis, they elicited from their witness, well, what was his demeanor when he testified? 
    Well, he was nervous. 
    He used a fast rate of speech. 
    Now, arguably, that went to whether drugs were in his system or credibility. 
    But reading the record, it's clear, they're trying to use evidence to go to his credibility. 
    As one judge from the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals said in this case, Airman Scheffer's credibility was the whole ball game.

speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="2797.674" stopTime="2879.788">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Well, Your Honor, that came from a study... a survey that was conducted by Dr. Licken... Dr. Lykken... I'm not sure which the correct way was. 
    The study has been called into question by the amicus brief that we have done by the Committee for Concerned Social Scientists. 
    Basically, they... they... obviously, it is polarized. 
    There's no doubt about that. 
    Dr. Raskin and Dr. Honts and some other scientists talk about this study that the government relies on, and says less than one-third said that. 
    But there were some problems with the survey that they point out. 
    They... they... to question whether it was a random sampling, the context that the survey was sent out under. 
    Apparently, it had a cover letter that dealt with the O.J. Simpson case. 
    It asked them about legal implications. 
    And we would submit that there are two other surveys that are out there that show very different results from that. 
    In fact, two other surveys... one done by Gallup in 1982, I believe, and... and another survey done by a Dr. Amato, both show that about two-thirds of that same group would support the polygraph being used, at least in conjunction with... as one piece, with other evidence, in... in making this type of determination. 
    And the last survey that they reference in their brief was conducted by someone who is noted for being almost a vitriolic critic of polygraph evidence.

    As a matter of due process, I don't know how you could exclude it from a civil trial.

    It would be a strange rule that said you had to admit it, even if you found the expert was a fraud.

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Absolutely, Your Honor. 
    And that's why we're not asking this Court to hold that. 
    We're simply saying, let the military courts, like the vast majority of the Federal Circuits do, let the trial judge hear the evidence. 
    Let him do his 403 balancing. 
    Let him see, and... and make a determination.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, if... if... if we were the co... Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and... and there weren't any Rule 707 promulgated by the President, your presentation cert... certainly would make a great deal of sense. 
    But you... you're in the position where it isn't just a common law judgment on our part. 
    The President has said this will not come in. 
    And so you have to say there's a constitutional principle that says it has to come in.

    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Yes, we do. 
    And... and... and we... and we, of course, do assert that. 
    And... and what's ironic is the reasons that are adduced here for allowing poly... keeping polygraphs out make less sense in the military context than they do in the civilian. 
    We... the... the States--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    --Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3032.023" stopTime="3051.887">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is there any way of... of limiting the rule adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to military criminal trials, as opposed to civilian criminal trials? 
    As I read the... the opinion, there... there is no effort to. 
    I mean, it comes in as a constitutional matter, the right to... for a defendant to present its case.
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="3051.887" stopTime="3057.632">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    However, in this Court, looking at it, such a limiting could be done. 
    Of course, the Court of Appeals--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How... how would you suggest that we do it?
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="3058.930" stopTime="3095.115">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    --Well, basically, the reasons that are problems for a lot of the States are not present for us. 
    If you look at their amicus brief, they cite things like there's no standardized training for polygraphers. 
    Much of the reliability depends on the qualifications and training of the examiner. 
    The States, unlike the Department of Defense, do not have the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute. 
    They don't have standardized equipment. 
    They don't have standardized protocol. 
    They don't have two layers of independent review above the polygrapher. 
    We have protections that make our tests more reliable, more trustworthy, that don't exist in the States, which would be a basis for this Court not to apply this case beyond the... the military.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3095.115" stopTime="3102.920">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But then what... but you would still have to derive it from the same constitutional principle, wouldn't you... the right of the defendant to call witnesses in his defense?
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="3102.920" stopTime="3127.576">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But I think the argument would be on the... as far as the States, that the government reasons are not arbitrary. 
    Which they are in the military and which they are in Airman Scheffer's case specifically... arbitrary or disproportionate. 
    Because we have safeguards in our system that they don't have that make these rules arbitrary and disproportionate, and certainly in Airman Scheffer's case. 
    Even the thing about the waste of time and everything else is--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3127.576" stopTime="3134.589">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, if those safeguards were... were eliminated, the Army could... could then no longer admit polygraph evidence?
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="3134.589" stopTime="3137.073">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    --They would--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3137.073" stopTime="3146.089">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, if... if we rule that it must be admitted only because there are all of these safeguards, the military could get them unadmitted again by simply eliminating all the safeguards.

    Yes.

    --hundreds of thousands of polygraphs into disarray.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yeah. 
    I mean, go... go under the colander, the colander theory instead, just-- 
    [Laughter] 
    Right.
speaker="kim_l_sheffield" startTime="3154.316" stopTime="3166.535">
    Ms. Kim L. Sheffield 
    And... and, you know, what's interesting about the colander theory is that confession would be admissible. 
    But if an individual defendant goes through this grueling process, designed to elicit confessions, and he's been there, done that, and doesn't confess, he can--

   Rebuttal of Michael R. Dreeben
speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="3171.406" stopTime="3233.938">
    Mr. Michael R. Dreeben 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The fundamental unreliability of polygraph evidence is underscored not only for the reasons that Justice Breyer adverted to, but also because of the possibility that countermeasures can defeat any test. 
    Any individual who wants to can go on the Internet and download a book called 
    "Beat the Box: The Insider's Guide to Outwitting the Lie Detector. " 
    And studies have shown that with about a half an hour of education in how to outwit the lie detector test, a suspect can do that by provoking physiological responses that fool the examiner by measures as easily as pressing his toes against the ground or biting his tongue when asked particular questions. 
    Those kinds of ways of skewing any reliability that polygraph might otherwise have make it clear that the examiner can never be confident to the level that should be required before this form of evidence is admitted in a criminal trial. 
    If the Court has no further questions, thank you.
