Steel Company v. Citizens for Better Environment

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-643, Steel Company, also known as Chicago Steel and Pickling Company, v. Citizens for a Better Environment. 
    Mr. Stein.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves the 60-day notice period in the citizens provision of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, and whether that period is intended to operate as a cure, thereby obviating a citizen's suit, or whether citizens may sue for wholly past violations even after cure. 
    As found by this Court in Gwaltney v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and again in Hallstrom v. Tillamook County, the overriding congressional purpose of environmental citizen provisions is to prompt compliance with environmental laws. 
    Litigation ought to be used as a last resort, when other methods have failed. 
    On receiving a 60-day notice under EPCRA, the Steel Company, a small manufacturing company, came into complete compliance, filing the 15 forms required, all within the cure period. 
    The respondent, Citizens for a Better Environment, sued anyway. 
    They alleged no current or ongoing violations.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Let me ask you a question, please, if I may, Mr. Stein. 
    What if it were the EPA that were coming in asking for penalties to be imposed after the fact of a cure, so to speak, after the forms were actually filed, but the EPA then comes in and says, well, they should have been filed on X date and they weren't, and they've now filed them, but we want a penalty for every day of the nonfiling. 
    Under the statutory scheme, is that permissible?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="107.082" stopTime="118.070">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    Yes, Justice O'Connor, under our reading of the statute the EPA's enforcement policy comes under section 325 of the statute, a wholly different section than section 326, the citizen provision.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="118.070" stopTime="142.726">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the citizen's suit provision I suppose is designed to be a sort of private attorneys general approach, and to let citizens pick up the slack if the EPA doesn't do it, and is there any reason why the citizens suit shouldn't have the same authority, then, to come in and seek a penalty for the failure to file on time?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="142.726" stopTime="237.762">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    Yes. 
    Several reasons, as we see it. 
    First of all, section 326 is far more limited, giving citizens a more limited enforcement and assistance role than the EPA's authority under section 325. 
    In the citizen provision, a citizen may commence a suit upon the failure to complete or submit the forms. 
    The Sixth Circuit, in analyzing the same language in the United Musical case, found that it was the failure that Congress was looking for. 
    EPA's authority is far broader than that. 
    Also, section 326(c) of the statute specifically points out that citizens are able to invoke the court's jurisdiction in the evidence of an enforcement or an injunctive remedy, and then at that time the court can apply penalties if it has jurisdiction through 326, section 326(c). 
    In that respect, the citizen provision of EPCRA is very similar to the citizen provision of the Clean Water Act that this Court analyzed in Gwaltney. 
    In Gwaltney, the Court found many reasons to find that Congress did not expect... intend citizens to sue for wholly past violations, but one of the most convincing was section 505(a) of the Clean Water Act. 
    There, also, the Court found that before a citizen could invoke the court's jurisdiction it had... there had to be some kind of injunctive or abatement remedy that it was seeking and then, and only then, would the Court be willing to address penalties relative to a citizens' action. 
    Beyond that, and further answering, we think that if... even if the court below were somehow correct that they can seek wholly past violations, we think it fails the Article III standing test because on that date any injury that would befall a citizen had been fully cured.

    What about the attorneys fees and costs that the claimant might have incurred in investigating the claim and filing it?

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --I think the Court has ruled that penalties alone have to... do not give a party standing. 
    They have to be... a standing has to accrue as an underlying part of the plaintiff's claim and just investigation costs and fees are a byproduct of the litigation.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    That was just whether or not there was an interest in being a prevailing party per se. 
    I'm not sure if it said that Congress couldn't create a cause of action for attorneys fees or investigatory, preparatory fees legitimately and in good faith incurred.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, then it's not an Article III question. 
    It's just a statutory question.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --We believe the statutory question here is far more important than... and... than the Court could rule completely under the statute, because under the plain language of that... it is the completion and submission of the forms, the failure of that action, that gives rise to a citizen action, and that's what United Musical found, that's what the district court found. 
    The--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So on your view, then, if the compliance came after the 60-day period, let's say the time sequence is 60-day period runs, suit is filed on day 70, the defendant comes into total compliance, files all the back forms, the suit would be moot at that point, if I follow your reasoning.
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="360.822" stopTime="388.781">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --Justice Ginsburg, at that point, mootness principles would apply and the burden would shift to the defendant to show why mootness would apply and why there would be no likelihood of a recurring violation such as to relieve the court of its jurisdiction. 
    But whereas mootness will lie after the complaint is filed, if it is filed with Article III authority for standing, mootness standing is the plaintiff's burden. 
    It must be proven at the... prior to the complaint being filed, and we don't believe that they had standing in this case at the time the complaint was filed.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're asking us to read the provision in such a way that nobody would have an incentive to file suit.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --Well, first of all, I think they may file for any number of reasons. 
    First of all, the Congress was interested in compliance, and interested in citizen enforcement. 
    If the suit, which we think is properly filed after the 60 days, because that's the limit of the cure period... the burden on the defendant at that point is a heavy one to show that there's no further likelihood of an intermittent or recurring violation, and there may be cases where it is mooted, and there may be cases where it is not, but I believe Congress--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="437.336" stopTime="459.342">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why shouldn't we say that... I guess we don't have to decide that issue in this case, but why couldn't the situation be that so long as you have not filed before... after the 60-day period and before suit is filed against you, you are liable for the penalty that's set forth in the civil provision. 
    Would that contradict your theory of this case?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="459.342" stopTime="466.227">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --If you're filed before the suit was... before the suit was filed, but after the 60 days, I believe standing would not lie.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If you file after suit, and after the 60 days, if you come into compliance with the law after the suit is filed and after the 60-day period, why isn't it reasonable to say that the Federal Government intended to give these private attorney generals the right to the penalties accruing?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="487.912" stopTime="492.053">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein

    --Not necessarily.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    And the court determines that there is reason for the court to retain jurisdiction, it is not moot in the court's estimation because there is a possibility of further violations, or that the allegedly illegal conduct may continue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="525.490" stopTime="531.752">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Assume no possibility of further violations, it's your position that the plaintiff's entitlement to the penalty alone wouldn't make any difference?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="531.752" stopTime="548.214">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    The court at that time, after a suit is properly filed, would be able to assess whether its jurisdiction... whether the granting of penalties at that point would have some continuing effect, or some beneficial effect as to the defendant, but if it is mooted the court would lose jurisdiction, I would agree, and therefore the penalties would not apply.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="548.214" stopTime="552.516">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Would the penalty ever go to anyone other than the Government?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="552.516" stopTime="558.623">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    Not at all, Justice Souter. 
    Under section 325, the Government is the only party entitled to receive the penalties.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="558.623" stopTime="573.362">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But even if there were mootness, after the 60-day period ran as a result of compliance there would still be entitlement to attorney's fees, would there not, because the mootness didn't come about until after the case was in court.
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="573.362" stopTime="597.058">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    If the court were to retain jurisdiction after properly receiving it, then I assume the court could then address the question of anything within its jurisdiction, including whether or not the prevailing party was the plaintiff, the citizen organization in that case, and whether or not it should receive fees. 
    We do not have a problem with those issues after proper filing, meaning that there is a violation that is ongoing on the date that the complaint is filed.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="597.058" stopTime="624.540">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, you're putting in this phrase, retain jurisdiction, and I... maybe Justice Scalia thought you answered his question. 
    I still... I'm still not sure of the answer to that question. 
    Let's assume that after the 60 days has run, the suit is filed, then it's cured, then it comes before the judge, the judge says there's nothing more to do, I'm going to give no... I'm going to terminate my jurisdiction now, there's no necessity for me to issue some ongoing injunction, but I am going to award attorney's fees. 
    Can he do that?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="624.540" stopTime="649.237">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    I believe, Justice Kennedy, he might be able to determine in that case that because the plaintiff brought the suit, and because it was cured after suit, and presumably the judge could at that point say that it was the action of suit that brought the defendant into compliance, he might be able to find that the plaintiff citizen organization at that time was the prevailing party or substantially prevailing party, as the statute reads, and award fees. 
    I think that would be a--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="649.237" stopTime="656.132">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, from the standpoint of mootness and Article III, the precise analysis would apply if the violation were cured before the 60 days.
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="656.132" stopTime="679.439">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --If... I disagree, because before the 60 days... Congress gave a 60-day period to cure, and Congress gave citizens the right to sue in the event... going back to the statute, in the event cured... in the event there was a failure to comply. 
    That is the right that Congress gave citizens the opportunity to vindicate, if it is vindicated either under the statute or under Article III as we see it, but more strongly under the statute, because we think you can decide this under the statute.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="679.439" stopTime="694.599">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, what if it is before the 60-day period that the company files the reports, but the plaintiff believes and is prepared to show that the company is likely to be a repeat offender?

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    Justice, in that situation it would be similar to Gwaltney, where the was a possibility, a likelihood of recurrence, and in that case the court could find that there was... that jurisdiction attaches, because--

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --I find it theoretically possible, but only on reading the statute academically.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Isn't the significant point there's no such allegation in this case? 
    They don't allege, if I remember the complaint, that there's a likelihood you will not comply.
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="733.344" stopTime="741.241">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    That is correct. 
    They agree that the violation ceases on page 14 of their brief. 
    They acknowledge that the violation ceases on the filing of the forms. 
    This is a case--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="741.241" stopTime="744.824">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The complaint does not allege a concern about future violations.
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="744.824" stopTime="780.880">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --It does not, Justice Stevens. 
    This is a case about a wholly past violation, and that is the point, and under EPCRA, which is an information-gathering and information reporting statute, unlike the Clean Water Act that the Court was concerned with in Gwaltney, where there was... I think the Court said the episodic, chronic episodic instances of violation. 
    This is not likely to happen here because of some complicated, especially engineered piece of equipment that might fail. 
    Likelihood of recurrence is extremely remote. 
    A party would have to be completely asleep. 
    So the likelihood of recurrence, the likelihood of an intermittent injury here, and that's what the Court must look at for a recurring violation, is very remote.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="780.880" stopTime="791.358">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, why... no, I mean, there was for 8 years no filing, and then it was called to their attention. 
    By the way, when there was a filing, was it for all the past years or only the most recent year?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="791.358" stopTime="832.367">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    No, Justice Ginsburg, they filed all 15 forms that were due within the cure period and, as we pointed out both parties rely on the GAO report, that many small companies such as the Steel Company simply were not aware of their requirements, otherwise dutifully compliant with a host of complex environmental laws, and their unawareness... their nonfiling was an innocent unawareness. 
    But upon being given this information, the notice, they filed, and we think that's part of the intent of Congress here. 
    Congress gave citizen enforcement in two stages, first with a notice and cure period, and then, and only then, if a party will not heed or cannot heed, for whatever reason, and come into compliance, then Congress gave citizens a very powerful weapon at the end of that 60 days, which was the opportunity to invoke the court's jurisdiction and seek penalties.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="832.367" stopTime="854.172">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Stein, can I ask you, with regard to attorneys fees and the like, they ask in their complaint for all costs in connection with the investigation and prosecution of this matter, including fees, attorneys fees and expert witness fees. 
    Now, do you agree that the statute authorizes the award of the investigation costs before suit was filed, or when they were trying to make up their mind whether to file suit?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="854.172" stopTime="862.386">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    I believe, Justice Stevens, they're entitled to those fees if they're a prevailing party, but not if they are not... if they can't bring suit because the defendant cured in the cure period.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="862.386" stopTime="866.821">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I'm asking, if they are a prevailing party, you agree they get the pre-suit investigation.
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="866.821" stopTime="872.945">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    The court would be able to look into... that would be a subject before the court if they are a prevailing party in a citizens' suit, not if, as here, there was a cure--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="872.945" stopTime="905.816">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But the statute says under (f) that the court may award costs of litigation. 
    That's what the statute says, so I guess they are entitled to investigatory costs only if those are part of the costs of litigation. 
    Is that right? 
    I mean, what we're... I mean, what I would interpret the question to be is, is there something special here by way of costs that are being awarded in this case that are not normally present whenever a statute provides a winning party with costs of litigation?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="905.816" stopTime="952.488">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --And we believe not, Justice Breyer. 
    We believe this is a normal investigation cost that if the EPA should step in barring them from a citizens' suit within a 60-day period, they would not be entitled to those costs. 
    They're only entitled to those costs as the prevailing or substantially prevailing party, and the question is, is, if there is no suit, if cure occurs during the first stage of the congressionally mandated two-stage citizen action period, is that a cost of litigation or is that a normal cost of their activities, which are to assert their interest on behalf of their members. 
    So we think their costs come into it if a party is not able to take heed of the 60-day notice period and not able to cure within that period. 
    At that point, Congress... the congressional goal is satisfied, and the congressional goals achieved. 
    Compliance was achieved with this law. 
    The citizens have information that they... the Congress entitled them to have.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="952.488" stopTime="1056.239">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Stein, may I ask you this question: one of the arguments that is being made here is that if standing is not found, with the opportunity to go forward with penalties and, of course, get counsel fees and investigatory fees and so on as a result of that, no one is going to have really an incentive... no citizen is going to have an incentive ever to commence one of these proceedings. 
    My question... with that in mind my question is this: is there any requirement that when a citizens organization starts the 60-day period running it must then have concluded that it can prove a case, or could a citizens group simply come forward and say, we don't know of any reason why this particular company should not have been filing these reports. 
    It looks to us as thought they're covered by the law. 
    So we're going to put them on notice that we think they should comply and simply wait and see what happens. 
    In that latter instance if, at the end of 60 days, there hadn't been any compliance, then at that point the citizens organization could decide whether to go ahead and in effect make an investment in legal fees and investigatory fees to see whether it would really be worthwhile to bring action. 
    So that's why I ask the question. 
    Can they simply put them on notice, as it were, on the basis of a good faith claim that they ought to be filing, or is there some requirement in the statute or regulations to the effect that they must in effect be ready to establish probable cause, or some such thing, for a violation before they even give the notice that starts the 60 days running?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="1056.239" stopTime="1073.303">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    I'm aware of no provision in the statute that would require the latter. 
    I believe it is... the intent of the notice is precisely as you have formulated it, to put the party on notice that they may be out of compliance and that they have 60 days to cure, but if at the end of that period they don't, the court's jurisdiction could be invoked against them.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1073.303" stopTime="1076.625">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So nobody has to make a big investment to get the 60 days running?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="1076.625" stopTime="1105.326">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    I don't believe so, as, importantly, most of this information is readily available through public filings on the Internet. 
    This is... despite what the Seventh Circuit said, it is not a huge task, we don't believe, to investigate these various instances of innocent unawareness, as the case was here, at least investment of cost, particularly for an organization that is devoted, and has 180,000 dues-paying members, devoted to this particular task. 
    But to be precise, we do not believe it is a very costly or time-intensive activity on behalf of the citizen organization.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    Perhaps, Justice Kennedy, it would be a good idea to help get the word out, because as I say, smaller companies that do not have huge environmental staffs that are able to keep track of all of this have unfortunately gotten caught in this. 
    It would not hurt. 
    We were happy to obtain this information. 
    The Steel Company obtained it, and the first thing they did is, as a dutifully compliant company, compliant with a host of complex laws, said how do we comply, and how fast can we do it, and can we get in within the cure period, and they did, so there is no history here of a company that is trying to dodge or skirt the law. 
    It's quite the contrary.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why isn't an adequate explanation of the 60-day cure period that that's the period provided so that EPA itself might come in, instead of having the private plaintiffs do it?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="1151.708" stopTime="1189.505">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    It's perfectly adequate. 
    In fact, quite... as specifically set forth in the statute, section 326(e) says that a citizen's suit is barred. 
    The citizen organization is barred if EPA decides to assert its authority to enforce this law within the 60-day period. 
    We believe... and Hallstrom v. Tillamook looked at this. 
    We believe that that is one of the primary purposes of the notice, to prompt compliance, or enforcement by EPA or compliance by the alleged violator, that it is EPA's primary role to enforce these statutes and, as stated by Congress, by saying that if EPA comes into it... the case and brings an administrative or judicial action within that period, the citizen organization is barred from its complaint.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1189.505" stopTime="1213.432">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Had that provision not existed I would... I think it would be a very strong argument that the only possible reason for the 60-day period is to give the defaulting company an opportunity to make good, and if the company makes good, then suit cannot be brought after the 60 days, but there is another explanation for the 60 days, as you said. 
    It's to allow EPA to come in.
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="1213.432" stopTime="1235.787">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    But Your Honor, the same provision, the same opportunity for the EPA to come in and bar citizen action existed under the Clean Water Act when it was analyzed by Gwaltney, and the Court found the same reasoning. 
    The reason for the notice to EPA is to give it a chance to come in, and the reason for the notice to the alleged violator is for the alleged violator to cure. 
    The Court answered the question, what else could be the purpose of the notice to the alleged violator?

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In Gwaltney, though, the case turned on fairly specific language in that act, the present tense of to be in violation, and the Seventh Circuit said they thought the language of this act was different.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Gwaltney used the to be in violation formula, and EPCRA uses the failure to do formulation. 
    Beyond that, there are not a whole lot of differences between the two provisions. 
    To be in violation and failure to do are both infinitive phrases. 
    Failure and violation are both nouns, no temporal limitation. 
    This is a information-gathering statute.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --Well, we submit that failure to do is, as used here is forward-looking also, and Gwaltney studied the legislative history of the Clean Water Act... there's very little of it here in EPCRA... and the Clean Air Act, the templates that were used for citizen provisions, and found that citizen provisions are intended to be forward-looking. 
    Failure... understand... I'll try and make clear... I hope I make clear that failure to do is the operant... the condition before a citizen's suit can be brought. 
    In the absence of the failure, a citizen's suit is not permitted, so failure to do is a phrase which talks about inaction. 
    In the absence of inaction, the presence of action, a citizen's suit is barred. 
    United Musical found that.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I would like you to go back for a minute to this costs, getting your cost. 
    What is your response to the following fairly simple argument that has to do with whether their injury is redressable, which I take it is the standing question? 
    You'd say, well, how did this hurt you, their violation? 
    Answer: you are an environmental group. 
    The violation hurt you in that you were forced to live in a world without information, or you had to spend some money to cure the lack of information, and the spending of money involved putting the company on notice, and then they cured it. 
    And so what we do in this statute is, we don't allow you in respect to past violations... we don't completely help you out, but we help you a little. 
    Either they will be stopped in their tracks by the court because they didn't comply, or if they did comply, we will give you back some of the money you spent getting them to comply, and therefore we are redressing your harm, not all of it, but some of it.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein

speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1396.049" stopTime="1431.784">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But I have to worry about a different question. 
    I take it one of the questions that I'd have to answer in this case is whether there is standing, and the reason you argue there is not is because their injury is not redressable insofar as they were injured, it was redressed. 
    This lawsuit doesn't redress it. 
    Hence my question. 
    Is the lawsuit aimed at redressing a different part of their injury, namely, the cost of investigating the matter and bringing it to the attention of the company, and the lawsuit gives them some of that money back.
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="1431.784" stopTime="1436.979">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    At the time the complaint was filed, they had no injury.

    Every party who had some cost--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1436.979" stopTime="1449.358">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    You're saying the statute does not give them back their cost except insofar as they are related to this litigation, which took place as part of the litigation decision, not as the other decision?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="1449.358" stopTime="1449.799">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --That is correct.

    And how do I look that up?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="1450.930" stopTime="1490.426">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    You find it in the statute, which says that they are entitled to receive their cost if they are the prevailing or substantially prevailing party, but since they can't get to court because there is no standing on the day the complaint was filed, they don't have the opportunity to prevail, Congress gave the defendant in this case, who should not be a defendant, the opportunity to cure, obviating the suit. 
    And when Gwaltney studied this it said, you know, the citizens don't get their pre-investigation costs if EPA were to come in either, so the Congress was not necessarily that interested in those costs, only in the event a party could not heed the 60-day notice, could not come into compliance, we have severe costs, then they could get those extraordinary costs as being the substantially prevailing party. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

   Argument of David A. Strauss
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="1493.989" stopTime="1536.478">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Let me begin with the language of section 326 of EPCRA, the citizen's suit provision, both what it is and what it is not. 
    Section 326 provides that a citizen may bring a suit for a failure to complete and submit a form under section 312, or under section 313. 
    That citizen's suit provision does not occur, that form of citizen's suit provision does not occur anywhere else. 
    The kind of citizen's suit provision that was before the Court in Gwaltney used the term, alleged to be in violation. 
    That provision is ubiquitous throughout citizen's suit provisions that Congress has enacted. 
    Alleged--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1536.478" stopTime="1549.067">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I have three statutes that use the word, occur. 
    One is CERCLA, one is RCRA, and one is TOSCA, and they all use in the venue provision the word occurred, and then in the liability provision... they're rather parallel to this one, aren't they?
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="1549.067" stopTime="1552.420">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    --The venue provision uses the word occur, Justice Breyer.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes.
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="1552.600" stopTime="1559.274">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    What I'm focusing on is the provision that authorizes citizen's suits, which in those three statutes contains the phrase, alleged to be in violation.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1559.274" stopTime="1560.987">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Right, and so they're parallel to this one.
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="1560.987" stopTime="1563.976">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    No, this statute does not contain the phrase, alleged to be in violation.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1563.976" stopTime="1565.157">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, in violation of--
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="1565.157" stopTime="1606.207">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    It says, failure to complete and submit a form. 
    The alleged to be in violation formulation, which is the formulation that the Court held in Gwaltney, a case with facts somewhat parallel to this, led to the conclusion for which petitioners contend. 
    That formulation does not occur in this statute. 
    What this statute contains is the phrase, failure to complete and submit a form under section 312 and section 313. 
    The evidence that this is a deliberate choice by Congress is really quite overwhelming. 
    In the very same public law that enacted EPCRA, Congress also enacted the Superfund amendments. 
    The Superfund amendments contain a citizen's suit provision. 
    That citizen's suit provision used the alleged to be in violation formulation. 
    EPCRA used a different one.

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Justice Stevens, then they could have used that language.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Strauss, the violation here, the only requirement is that you file a form, so then it's logical to talk about failure to file or submit a form. 
    In the other statutes, perhaps more encompassing, there would be a reason to use language, alleged to be in violation, because there were many things that could violate the statute.

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    --Well, Justice Ginsburg, there's... the requirement in EPCRA is that you file a form by a certain date, and what the statute says is, failure to complete and submit a form under sections 312 and 313. 
    Sections 312 and 313 contain deadlines, and it seems to us that if you do not you are guilty of a failure to complete and submit a form under section 312 if you don't meet the deadlines in 312.

    In fact, I'm--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1686.496" stopTime="1690.849">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    --Well, I'm actually... I'm actually omitting a part of the statute. 
    It says, failure to complete and submit an inventory form under section 312, so the reference to section 312 wasn't even needed to say which form they had in mind. 
    And not only that, Justice O'Connor, but it's quite clear from the structure of the statute and from the purposes of the statute that timeliness is not an incidental requirement. 
    Timeliness is at the core of what the statute is about.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1714.097" stopTime="1719.452">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but the 60-day notice provision has to be factored in, too.

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Well, absolutely, Justice O'Connor, and Mr. Stein referred to it as a 60-day cure provision, which is a curious reference for a number of reasons. 
    Here's one. 
    The Clean Air Act contained the phrase, alleged to be in violation. 
    After this Court's decision in Gwaltney, Congress... it also has a notice period. 
    After Gwaltney, this Court amended, or the Congress amended the Clean Air Act to include the phrase, or to have violated, making it clear that Gwaltney was not to apply to the Clean Air Act, but Congress left the notice period intact in the Clean Air Act.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But wasn't it more than that?

    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    Yes, exactly so, Justice Ginsburg.

    --or investigatory fees, so your claim is still tied to an obligation to come up with some injury that can be redressed by the suit, and number 1 there is no claim here that there's any further redress that you can get for the past failures. 
    Everything that can be known is now known. 
    There is no allegation, as I read it, that in fact there is a likelihood of violation in the future. 
    Number 3, if you make your claim for the penalties, you don't get one red cent of that penalty money, as I understand it, so that the only thing that you can obtain that you do not now have is the attorney's fees or the investigatory fees, and they are tied, it seems to me, to litigation which has got to give you some other benefit. 
    In other words, they alone cannot under the statute justify it. 
    So I guess my problem is, if I construe the statute the way you want me to construe it, it seems to me there is a very serious Article III question, and it makes sense to construe the statute in a way which will not raise this Article III question.

    Let me first address the point about circularity, Justice Souter, because I do understand the circularity point, and here is why we are not making a circular argument about attorney's fees. 
    One of the injuries they inflicted on us was not giving us information we and our members had a statutory right to. 
    As a result of that, we had to dig out that information ourselves.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Strauss, in attorney's fees provisions, I mean, there are many in many statutes, and I had thought that the Congress tried more or less to be careful about when it is talking about litigation fees, that is, fees generated post complaint, and fees that happen because of investigation, fees at the agency level, and when Congress speaks of litigation fees, that generally has meant while you're in court, and when it talks about fees before the agency or investigation, that's for that earlier period. 
    But here, the term is litigation fees.
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="2452.451" stopTime="2480.380">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    It's litigation costs, Justice Ginsburg, and I agree this would not apply to an agency proceeding, but the Court has made it clear that litigation costs or attorney's fees include work that goes into developing the complaint, as, of course it would have to, investigation you have to do in order to develop, as in the Court's words, the work associated with the development of the theory of the case, and the drafting of the initial pleadings. 
    That sort of pre-complaint work has to be covered by the term. 
    It's an integral, indispensable part of litigation.

    Yes, but you're saying that this material is... I mean, it seems to me you're arguing that it's two different things. 
    First you're arguing it is an independent damage and not associated with attorney's fees because we wouldn't have known what stuff was in the air.

    The question--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Did you do this investigation in order to bring the lawsuit, in which case you can't rely on that for standing, or, did you do it not in order to bring the lawsuit, in which case it's not part of your cause of action?

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2524.432" stopTime="2533.628">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It depends on why they were undertaken, why these investigations were undertaken. 
    Were they undertaken in order to bring this lawsuit? 
    In that case, the statute gives you a right to them, but I question whether you have standing--

    --have Article III standing. 
    On the other hand, were they conducted not in order to bring the lawsuit, but just because you wanted to know what was out there in Hyde Park, or wherever, in which case you clearly would have standing, but you have no cause of action under this statute.
speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="2547.255" stopTime="2570.098">
    Mr. David A. Strauss 
    --Well, they were undertaken for both purposes, Justice Scalia. 
    What CBE does is to find out information about the communities and if someone is in violation of the law bring suit against them, but I don't know why our purpose in doing this should be material to the redressability inquiry. 
    Our injury will get redressed. 
    The fact that it will get redressed under a litigation cost rubric, I don't see where that bears on the Article III problem.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2570.098" stopTime="2577.781">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Because it relates to whether they constitute litigation costs.

    Oh, I'm not suggesting the... or, I didn't mean to suggest by my question that the statute should be interpreted so narrowly as to preclude standing if there were an allegation of either a continuing violation or the probability of a future violation, but I'm concerned about the interpretive question when there is no question of continuing violation in the sense that they file everything that can be filed with respect to the past, there is no allegation, and we'll leave the question of ambiguity aside for the moment, of the likelihood of a future violation, there is no penalty that can be recovered that will go into the pocket of the private plaintiff, and the only thing which is in issue is the issue of attorney's fees or investigatory fees for the time prior to the moment when litigation could be begun. 
    That's the scenario in which it seems to me there is an Article III, a serious Article III question, and it's on that scenario that I would suggest it might be wise to interpret the statute narrowly to avoid having to reach that issue.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    --Well, let me just define the class of plaintiffs who have a cause of action here and then say why we think that there's no Article III problem. 
    The class of plaintiffs who have standing are only those class of plaintiffs where the defendants files the report only after receiving notice of an intended citizen's suit. 
    That is what this statute authorized. 
    We derive that not just from the plain language of the citizen's suit provision, which says that you can sue for failure to file untimely reports, but by a contrast between the notice--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2857.134" stopTime="2864.691">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    It's not in that language.

    Failure to complete and submit reports under section so-and-so.
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="2864.691" stopTime="2891.438">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    --Right, and the most natural reading of under in that context is that it incorporates the requirements from the reporting provisions so that they did not have to be repeated all over again in the citizen's suit provision, and one of those requirements is that there has to be timely reports, so a failure to submit and complete reports under those reporting provisions encompasses a suit for the filing untimely reports just as it encompasses a suit for inaccurate information in those reports.

speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="2896.761" stopTime="2909.289">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    And that's why the Article III question turns on the reasonable likely... the Article III standing question is whether there's a reasonable likelihood of recurrence in that situation, and we submit that the voluntary cessation--

speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2989.162" stopTime="3002.073">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It's mootness, and in a case called mootness... there was a case under the Constitution. 
    There's no argument. 
    Do you think those should be parallel? 
    If they're parallel, I don't know what that's going to do to standing law. 
    I haven't really thought that through. 
    It never occurred to me that those two things were parallel.
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="3002.073" stopTime="3004.514">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    They are parallel in an Article III sense, Justice Breyer.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3004.514" stopTime="3016.753">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So in any case in which the possibility of recurrence prevents mootness, in any such case, a plaintiff would have standing despite the absence of any... of any ongoing violation. 
    That's a pretty broad--
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="3016.753" stopTime="3043.151">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    That there would be a prudential standing barrier at that point, because the Court has not carried on on its own the same rules at the standing stage, the same presumptions at the standing stage that it has employed at the mootness stage, but as an Article III matter, any time somebody comes into compliance only because someone has either told them, I'm going to sue you or somebody has filed a lawsuit, there's a presumption. 
    Now, that presumption, I hasten to add, can be rebutted.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Are they based on-- 
    --All they show is that if there was originally standing, that there was... it was established that there was going to be a continuing violation. 
    That simply does not eliminate the prior established standing. 
    It's a huge leap from that to say that in and of itself it establishes standing.
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="3075.424" stopTime="3105.651">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    No, I don't think it is a huge leap as an Article III matter, because as an Article III matter, the plaintiff at that stage of the litigation has to have a sufficient interest for Article III purposes to carry on the litigation. 
    If the... if it... let's say things had been remedied 1 day after this litigation commenced, 1 day after, you would apply the voluntary cessation cases and you would say there is a presumption that there is a sufficient likelihood of recurrence to keep this case alive, and that could be rebutted only if the defendant has a heavy burden.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3105.651" stopTime="3115.058">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I would agree with that if the complaint alleged before the voluntary compliance occurred that this person was in violation and would continue in violation.
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="3115.058" stopTime="3127.235">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    But we have a situation, though, where the person has cured that original violation, and the plaintiff at that point has the burden of showing that he has a continuing interest in the litigation. 
    The only way he gets there is through a presumption.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3127.235" stopTime="3153.164">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right, but let's allege it at least. 
    I mean, look, this seems like the simplest approach is also the best approach. 
    The simplest approach would say, in those instances where there's some likelihood of recurrence, the lawsuit's serving an excellent purpose. 
    The lawsuit is. 
    And in those cases where there is no likelihood whatsoever, the only purpose it's suing is perhaps through the litigation cost thing to give them some of their money back. 
    Well, that would be the simple approach, and why not follow that simple approach?

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    Relative to the term under, the term under appears 27 times in section 326, the citizen provision of EPCRA.

    --what was the name of that case--
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="3256.605" stopTime="3298.307">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --in the context of this statute, though, I think in the context of the history surrounding the statute, and the context of the way this Court has analyzed citizen suit provisions as being forward-looking, under simply is a relation back. 
    Again, they... respondent suggests that under means in accordance with, but at section 326(a)(1)(B)(iv), and again in section 321(a)(1)(C), Congress did use the in accordance with formulation, and therefore Congress knows how to say, in accordance with, if it wishes to incorporate the specific provisions of the related-to section, and it knows how to use under, as it did 27 times. 
    So we think the better reading, as the United Musical Court looked at it. 
    Under simply relates back, and did not get into what that Court--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer

    Or they didn't do it before, maybe they won't do it again. 
    In such a case, it authorizes the suit.

    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    It would be inconsistent to apply... if we're talking about under, still, and the timeliness element, it would be inconsistent to apply the timely provisions of section 312 and 313, because Congress had readily available options which it used in other statutes. 
    It could have said, failure to complete and timely submit. 
    It could have said, failure to have completed and submitted. 
    It had many options. 
    It could have given the opportunity to--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, it could have used the language it did in all these other statutes, too. 
    But what's your response to his argument when Congress amended the other statute in response to Gwaltney they just didn't adopt this route?
speaker="sanford_m_stein" startTime="3381.050" stopTime="3417.004">
    Mr. Sanford M. Stein 
    --Well, by amending the Clean Air Act in 1970... 1990, to say that the... they can sue for a past violation in the event there is evidence of a repeated violation certainly doesn't amend EPCRA. 
    It only amends the Clean Air Act, or any of the other statutes that use these various formulations in citizen's suits. 
    United Musical drew strength from the fact that Congress amended the Clean Air Act but not EPCRA to say EPCRA must mean what the citizen's 60-day cure periods mean in 17 other statutes, all 17 of which were cited in a footnote in Hallstrom. 
    So looking at the case as a whole, looking at the context, we think that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3417.004" stopTime="3422.229">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    A later Congress' amendment doesn't necessarily show what the earlier Congress meant, anyway.
