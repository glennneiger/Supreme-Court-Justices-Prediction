    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 97-174, Cass County, Minnesota v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians. 
    Mr. Maus, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="29.771" stopTime="173.379">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    It's Cass County's position in this case that the alienable land patented in fee by the Federal Government and subsequently reacquired in fee by the Indian tribe is subject to State and local taxation absent treaty or statutory exceptions to the contrary. 
    In 1889, Congress passed the Nelson Act, which provided for the complete cession and relinquishments of lands to the Federal Government. 
    The Federal Government in turn, pursuant to section 3 of the Nelson Act and in conformity with section 5 of the General Allotment Act, issued individual allotments to Indians in conformity with the section 5. 
    Pursuant to sections 4 and 5 of the Nelson Act, they sold pinelands, which were basically timberlands, on the open market to individuals. 
    Pursuant to section 6, they issued homestead patents, or gave patents in fee under the Homestead Act to various individuals, again on the open market. 
    In 1993, Cass County began taxing all of the above lands and that was following the 1992 Yakima decision which was set forth by this case... 1992, Yakima County v. Yakima Indian Nation. 
    At that time, there were 21 parcels, 13 of those parcels involved a lot of land, and that issue has already been resolved in the Eighth Circuit, and it was a petition for further review of that, and that was denied on cross petition for that. 
    So at issue here today are the pinelands parcels, seven of those, and one homestead parcel. 
    These various parcels, I'd point out to the court, are now... the ones that are left, they're all in trust at the present time, have been placed in trust and I believe it's a matter of public record since about 1995. 
    Why we're here today, there's still the issue of back taxes that were sued for. 
    In addition, obviously, both sides want to know how to deal with lands--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="173.379" stopTime="181.915">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Are these parcels within the boundaries of the tribal reservation here?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="181.915" stopTime="193.805">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --For purposes of this lawsuit we have stipulated that the lands are within the reservation boundaries. 
    Whether or not they're within accepted reservation boundaries based on some of the Court's recent cases or not--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="193.805" stopTime="194.154">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But--
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="194.154" stopTime="195.206">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --is a matter for another day.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="195.206" stopTime="205.611">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Right. 
    They're within the reservation boundaries and held in trust for the benefit of the tribe, by virtue of the reacquisition by the tribe?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="205.611" stopTime="219.471">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    That's correct. 
    They've subsequently been put in the trust, and in... obviously the period that we were taxing them was while they were being held in fee, up and until they were put in the trust, and once they're put into the trust there's no dispute that we cannot tax them.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="219.471" stopTime="228.427">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And if they had never been sold off as pinelands and homesteads, you concede that no county tax would have been possible?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="228.427" stopTime="243.526">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    That's correct. 
    If they hadn't been placed on the open market, and it's our contention that the Nelson Act did that and, indeed, they have been taxed since their inception or their sale on the open market back in the early 1900's----
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="243.526" stopTime="256.546">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And there were additional parcels that were reacquired pursuant to the lands covered by the Dawes Act as amended by the Burke Act, but they're not at issue here?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="256.546" stopTime="257.846">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --They're no longer at issue, that's correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="257.846" stopTime="268.975">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And as to those parcels the tax is being levied and the Burke Act expressly says that taxation is possible, I take it?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="268.975" stopTime="292.440">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Well, the Burke Act says that but we believe that the Court went a step farther than that in the Yakima case in finding that the Burke Act made it more clear, but that section 5 of the General Allotment Act made it clear and made those lands taxable as they were alienable following the logic, basically, of Goudy v. Meath, which was decided in 1906, and decided also by this Court.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="292.440" stopTime="306.180">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I be sure I understood something you said? 
    When the land was reacquired by the tribe, did you tell me that you seek to tax it while it was owned by the tribe, but you say you cannot tax it after the tribe had it put back in trust?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="306.180" stopTime="307.041">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="307.041" stopTime="309.723">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And who's the trustee? 
    Is the United States the trustee?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="309.723" stopTime="336.989">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Yes, they are. 
    Under the trust process, pursuant to the Reorganization Act, which was passed in 1934, there's a trust process where the band can acquire lands, apply to put them into trust, and the Department of Interior makes a decision based on whether or not they're to be put in trust, and one of the criteria for that decision is basically the effect on local units of government.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="336.989" stopTime="347.748">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I don't quite understand why it should make a difference whether the land is owned outright by the tribe or held for the tribe in trust by the United States. 
    I don't understand why that should make a difference.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="347.748" stopTime="362.527">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    You know, basically that's... the difference being this, is that's what Congress decided to do, and they did a balancing test, obviously, when they did the... passed the Indian Reorganization Act, and wanted to look at land as--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="362.527" stopTime="366.257">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The answer in other words is, that's required by the 1934 statute.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="366.257" stopTime="372.334">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --That's correct, and there is specific language that says, once it's put into trust, that it's not taxable.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="372.334" stopTime="376.115">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I see. 
    Is it also not alienable if it's in trust?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="376.115" stopTime="383.090">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    That's correct. 
    It could not be sold. 
    It would have to go back through... the Department of Interior would have to approve any sale.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="383.090" stopTime="407.436">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And so-- 
    --And that's the second 465 procedure that you said, if they want to get tax exempt... it doesn't happen automatically. 
    I think when Justice O'Connor asked you when the tribe reacquires it, does it then gain exemption, and I think your answer is no, not unit there is this 465 procedure to put it back in trust, at which point it's neither alienable nor taxable.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="407.436" stopTime="408.855">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    That's correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="408.855" stopTime="417.143">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So how many years are we talking about that it was in this state where it was reacquired by the tribe but not yet put in trust?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="417.143" stopTime="450.504">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Okay. 
    All of the parcels in issue, all 21 of them, have been purchased... were purchased since 1980. 
    That was the earliest of those. 
    14 out of those original 21 had been purchased in 1993. 
    We began taxing them in 1993. 
    I guess there was some confusion in the... within the State, you know, can this land be taxed or not, you know, prior to being put into trust, and after the Yakima decision came out, at least at the county level we received one of the State memos basically saying that it appears that this land is taxable and we put it on the tax roll.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="450.504" stopTime="452.186">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So we're talking about 2 years.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="452.186" stopTime="477.212">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    We're talking about... well, basically if we... if it went on the tax rolls in 1993 it would have been taxes payable in 1994, and the lawsuit was commenced in '95, and towards the latter part of '95 all of these parcels, or at least the remaining parcels were put into trust, so we're talking about a year and a half, basically, I guess of actual, payable taxes for most of the parcels, maybe more or less for some of them.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="477.212" stopTime="487.809">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Does the provision of the law which enables these parcels to be put in trust, does that say that when they go into trust they are no longer taxable?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="487.809" stopTime="495.554">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Yes. 
    Section 465 specifically says that once lands are in trust they are not taxable.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="495.554" stopTime="502.579">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That probably wouldn't be necessary if they're not taxable anyway so long as the tribe acquires them.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="502.579" stopTime="520.642">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    That's correct. 
    It's our belief that the legislature could have, had they wanted to with the Indian Reorganization Act clearly made all lands that were acquired by the tribe not taxable, or reacquired, but they didn't do that. 
    They stopped short of that, in effect set forth that process to give us some input. 
    Now--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="520.642" stopTime="529.419">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But your point is that there's a distinction because if it's not put into trust the tribe can sell it and do whatever it wants to with it, but if they put it in a trust they have to get the consent of the United States to do something with it.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="529.419" stopTime="530.349">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --That's correct.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="530.349" stopTime="530.869">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="530.869" stopTime="546.760">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    And I... you know, I point out to the Court that I know that the tribe in this particular case and United States is taking an opposite position saying, well, we just can't sell the land, and I would submit to this Court that that... I don't believe that that's the case, and that's not our position.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="546.760" stopTime="549.613">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're talking about the Indian Nonintercourse Act--
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="549.613" stopTime="550.622">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="550.622" stopTime="551.393">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --argument?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="551.393" stopTime="552.334">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    It--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="552.334" stopTime="556.368">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, that... what is your answer to the Indian Nonintercourse Act? 
    I mean if you read it, it does say that, doesn't it?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="556.368" stopTime="563.724">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --But it's real simple. 
    It... one of the parts that it says early on... you know, it's passed in 1834, okay, and--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="563.724" stopTime="565.434">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I thought it was earlier than that. 
    Is that when it started? 
    I thought it was--
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="565.434" stopTime="568.616">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --Yes. 
    It was actually before then, but the latest version, I guess--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="568.616" stopTime="569.157">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --Oh--
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="569.157" stopTime="601.988">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --that Congress had addressed was 1834, and it provided that lands couldn't be sold without the permission of Congress. 
    In other words, Congress was to sell lands. 
    In other words, States couldn't take lands and start ceding them to individuals. 
    Well, the simple answer to that, the real short one is, along comes the Nelson Act. 
    There's Congress' authority. 
    In fact, they take the land, they cede it and relinquish any title of it and give it to the Federal Government, who then puts it on the open market, so is there authority to get around the Nonintercourse Act? 
    Absolutely. 
    In addition to that--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="601.988" stopTime="613.655">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Well, there was at the time of the... there was at the time of the allotment and the other distributions, but the question is, doesn't the term... don't the terms of the act cover it now that it is back in Indian or tribal ownership?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="613.655" stopTime="633.450">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --Two basic answers to that, I guess. 
    There's one... you know, if you look at the logic of reacquired lands, if you're looking at that pure logic, you have the Indian Reorganization Act, which deals with the reacquisition of lands and a determination of whether or not they should be taxable or not, whether or not they should be put into trust or not, and second of all--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="633.450" stopTime="644.339">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    The point that there would have been no point in making that, the taxability a consideration when it went into trust if... unless it were taxable before it goes into trust.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="644.339" stopTime="645.030">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --Correct.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="645.030" stopTime="645.459">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Right, okay.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="645.459" stopTime="661.910">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    And second of all, with respect to that, you know, the Court couldn't have decided the Yakima case the way it did had that been the case, because in Yakima I believe that there were some parcels of land that were due to go tax forfeited and that was at issue also, because there was some government lands and some individual.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="661.910" stopTime="666.232">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    That may imply that alienability simply is not the sole criterion.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="666.232" stopTime="667.474">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Correct.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="667.474" stopTime="713.137">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Why... what... is this... it seems to me if we're talking about these particular parcels, they're the same as any other parcels that have been out there, occupied and owned by people who are not Indians in fee simple. 
    There could be many such parcels, and it could have ended up in the hands of non Indians for many such... many reasons. 
    And so one day a tribe comes along and buys a parcel of land that previously didn't belong to the tribe, on the reservation, and isn't the issue whether, once the tribe acquires that, whether it ever... whatever it is, it's in the reservation. 
    They bought it. 
    Now, is it taxable or not? 
    And if the principle is, well, it's not taxable only because it's in the tribe's hands, however it got there, unless Congress clearly says so, where did Congress clearly say so?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="713.137" stopTime="723.713">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    We believe that Congress clearly said that the land was taxable first, I guess, looking at the Nelson Act itself. 
    I mean, it gave absolute fee title to everyone.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="723.713" stopTime="728.516">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Yes, but that has nothing to do with the issue. 
    The issue... that's an issue of what happens when the tribe owns the land and gets rid of it.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="728.516" stopTime="729.166">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Okay.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="729.166" stopTime="739.524">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Now, that's not our issue. 
    Our issue is, there's some land out there that doesn't belong to the tribe. 
    We don't care how or why it doesn't belong to the tribe. 
    It doesn't. 
    Now, the tribe acquires it.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="739.524" stopTime="740.724">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Okay.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="740.724" stopTime="752.334">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right, once it's acquired, is it now no longer taxable, and if the principle is, it's no... not taxable once it's in the hands of the tribe, however it got there, unless Congress clearly says so--
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="752.334" stopTime="753.484">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Mm hmm.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="753.484" stopTime="755.156">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --where did Congress clearly say so?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="755.156" stopTime="840.504">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    We believe that Congress clearly said so by making it alienable, and again I don't want to pound on the Nelson Act, but that's what... what made alienable, and then looking at the logic of Goudy v. Meath and the Yakima case, which basically are allowing for the taxability of the land because it's alienable, the tax is on the land itself, and I think that Congress has specifically acted in the area of lands and addressed that, you know, both in the Nelson Act and then later, of course, in the Indian Reorganization Act. 
    And if you look at the intent of Congress... and clearly we have to put up unmistakably clear intent, and that's a burden we accept, and we do think that's the correct burden of proof here. 
    We think that is all met when you add up, you know, the way it's put into fee, okay, the logic of the alienability of the Yakima and Goudy decisions... Congress clearly made it taxable... and if you look at, you know, the allotted lands, you know, they made them taxable after 25 years as opposed to immediately. 
    You know, that was part of the General Allotment Act. 
    So clearly, you know, you could look at that and say, well, in the case we have here, would it make sense to tax people that reacquired lands that were originally allotted to them and not tax lands that were put open in the general market? 
    I mean, that kind of logic doesn't make much sense.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="840.504" stopTime="850.110">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And of course, then they have the trust thing you were talking about. 
    So, why do they need the trust thing if they're not taxable in... I mean, you know, if it isn't nontaxable once they reacquire it.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="850.110" stopTime="881.923">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    That's correct, and obviously it... well, there's been a history of abuse of getting it into trust, and so one could look at it and say, well, you could always apply for trust. 
    Well, what are you going to do to stop that? 
    Well, we don't know what will happen in the future. 
    More recently the Department of Interior has changed some rules which now allow for 30 days after they decide to put land into trust for counties or local units the Government to appeal under the Administrative Procedures Act if we feel that the decision was not appropriate, so we do have that ability now.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="881.923" stopTime="909.489">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Maus... I'm not sure we have to reach it, but maybe we do. 
    I'm really troubled by the Indian Nonintercourse Act. 
    Suppose the tribe... suppose this is land that was never tribal land? 
    It was never allotted. 
    It was never opened to homesteading or anything. 
    It was just never Indian land. 
    And the tribe, as a tribe, buys this parcel of land that used to be owned by the Duke of Albemarle.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="909.489" stopTime="911.801">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Okay. 
    Sure.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="911.801" stopTime="929.252">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It was never tribal land. 
    Why isn't that land covered by the Indian Nonintercourse Act, so that once the tribe has it, the tribe cannot again resell it without a treaty or authority from Congress?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="929.252" stopTime="935.706">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    So in your scenario you'd be talking about land that was acquired for the first time outside the reservation?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="935.706" stopTime="936.717">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="936.717" stopTime="949.966">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Okay. 
    I think the Reorganization Act deals with land acquisitions by the tribe in general, either reacquired or acquired, and I think that those same provisions would apply, and it could certainly be argued that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="949.966" stopTime="952.219">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What provisions, the provisions that--
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="952.219" stopTime="955.331">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --The trust provisions under 465.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="955.331" stopTime="962.635">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --And which imply, according to you, that if they are not put into trust they are taxable, right?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="962.635" stopTime="964.595">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Correct. 
    Now--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="964.595" stopTime="971.890">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And then you would reason, and since they are taxable, you'd sort of go backwards from your reasoning for the purposes of this case, you're saying.
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="971.890" stopTime="972.441">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --Sure.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="972.441" stopTime="975.533">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Since they're taxable, they must be alienable, just as for this case--
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="975.533" stopTime="975.983">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Sure.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="975.983" stopTime="978.795">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    Well, I--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    That's ingenious. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="980.756" stopTime="1129.635">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --Well, I don't know about that, but the alienability results in taxability absent treaty or statutory exceptions. 
    Now, there may be some treaties that make land that might be alienable. 
    Maybe you can sell it, but it's not necessarily taxable because it specifically says it's not taxable. 
    And also, in addition to that, you know, the tribe also has the ability to apply for State exemptions without even going through the trust process, maybe to keep their land alienable, and maybe it's exempt for some... if it's for some governmental type purpose that's viewed by the States as being exempt. 
    For example, maybe a highway maintenance garage, or similar, like, you know, local units of government are exempt from taxation, just like cities are exempt from county taxation unless they have investment type properties. 
    Those would probably be found taxable. 
    So there is a difference there. 
    I would submit to the Court that deciding this decision to say alienability results in taxability absent treaty or statutory exceptions to the contrary would establish a bright line rule that could be applied. 
    It doesn't go too far, in that if there are individual treaties out there, or individual statutes with some of the various tribes or States that prohibit this, that they couldn't be taxed, and I think that would be fair for all. 
    I think that this would certainly allow the... both units of government input in the decision making process which it appears clear that Congress has given through the trust process, to allow the local units of government at least to have their say. 
    Second, you know that as a... or another point, as I also indicated, they have the ability to apply for State exemptions. 
    I mean, that's part of the overall rule too, and if they're appropriate they can do that. 
    An adverse ruling in this case to the county and other local units of government could have an adverse ruling, or an adverse effect on local units of government in particular by shrinking what has been heretofore a tax base that encompassed these lands by taking, you know, these off in a large fashion or in a regular fashion, which--

    But you told us that's in fact what happened. 
    It's only a year and a half we're talking about because the Government did put this land back in trust, and... which made it exempt, so the argument that the counties are losing all this revenue, it wouldn't have had the opportunity to get any if the Government had moved fast enough on the 465, right?
speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="1150.628" stopTime="1209.161">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    --Well, I would submit to the Court that if we're looking at the future, you know, the trust process has changed, and will the tribes be able to get land into trust in the future the way they have in the past? 
    Basically, throughout the history of the county we've opposed them all and never been successful, but now there's a new appeal process and we haven't... we haven't tried that yet, and that may result in the slowing down of lands put into trust, or at least give us some input, or more input into that process. 
    You know, is it going to hurt the tax base, for example? 
    For example, putting... one of these parcels involved a casino. 
    You know, is taking a casino and putting it into trust going to hurt the county's tax... taxing authority, or will it hurt the county? 
    Because you know, obviously when you have larger parcels, or larger investments, you're certainly talking about more Government services that are needed for those parcels.

   Argument of James M. Schoessler
speaker="james_m_schoessler" startTime="1342.941" stopTime="1378.364">
    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    As a preliminary matter I'd like to address a question that was raised about the Indian Reorganization Act and 25 U.S.C. section 465, which is the section that allows the United States Government to take land into trust for Indian tribes. 
    I think there was an implication made to the Court that that section somehow granted taxing jurisdiction to States and counties over land by negative implication.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1378.364" stopTime="1393.484">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, what it says, the negative... it does expressly say that if the Secretary does acquire the land in trust for the Indians, the land shall therefore be tax exempt, which one assumes that before it was acquired it was not tax exempt. 
    That's the argument, as I understand it.
speaker="james_m_schoessler" startTime="1393.484" stopTime="1394.015">
    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1394.015" stopTime="1394.526">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="james_m_schoessler" startTime="1394.526" stopTime="1457.587">
    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    It's basically a negative implication, to which I think two responses are required. 
    The first one probably is that that kind of a negative implication would be completely antithetical to the philosophy that was behind the adoption of the Indian Reorganization Act and the promotion of tribal independence and self sufficiency that forms the basis of the act and the rebuilding of the reservation land base that, at least partially, that act was all about. 
    The second thing I would point out is that, in fact, this Court has addressed the negative implication question in the past in a decision that was issued in 1973, Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones. 
    The Court had an opportunity to look at the legislative history and the wording of the trust provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act and the Court there specifically said that there was nothing in that act or its history which indicated an intent on the part of Congress to remove the traditional tax exemptions that tribes had within reservations.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1457.587" stopTime="1472.936">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, but that leaves open the question, doesn't it, because the question here is whether this particular tax exemption in fact would... is of the traditional variety, or whether, because of the history traced in Yakima, it's in a different position.
speaker="james_m_schoessler" startTime="1472.936" stopTime="1474.528">
    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    Yes, Your Honor--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1474.528" stopTime="1478.820">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So I think what the Court said really leaves the question right where we find it.
speaker="james_m_schoessler" startTime="1478.820" stopTime="1493.462">
    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    --The point that I was simply making is that there is no authority within the Indian Reorganization Act and section 465 to find a grant of jurisdiction, even by negative implication to counties or States to tax tribal lands.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1493.462" stopTime="1499.135">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    That may be. 
    I think... I thought the point was simply that it confirms a conclusion that we might reach on other ground.
speaker="james_m_schoessler" startTime="1499.135" stopTime="1526.913">
    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    It does bring up, I think, what the basic point of this case is anyway, and the basic rule of law that should govern this case. 
    It's a rule of law that even the county agrees with. 
    It's not disputed. 
    It was cited as authoritative by the county, and it's well known to this Court. 
    It's the unmistakably clear intent rule, what's called the per se rule, against taxation of Indians and tribes in Indian country.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1526.913" stopTime="1552.200">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The trouble is we say that on the one hand and we also have language very similar to that. 
    That is, that it's almost irrefutable implication that where there is alienability there is taxability. 
    You've also said something along those lines, and these two absolutes seem to be clashing head on in the present case.

    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    Your Honor, I would suggest that the unmistakably clear intent rule, or the per se rule, if you will, has a long and honorable history in this country's jurisprudence.

    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    --because, after all, it is probably the foundation of the county's argument here. 
    It's the case which the county asserts set forth an alienability equals taxability rule, and I'd like to make a few observations about that case. 
    Number 1, the unmistakably clear intent rule was even at that time a fairly longstanding principle in the law going back to the Kansas Indians and probably Russo v. Georgia for that matter, so the Goudy court was well aware of that principle. 
    The Goudy opinion, it seems to us just on the face of it, is a somewhat odd decision on which to base a fairly major shift from that per se rule against taxation. 
    The opinion itself was only two pages long. 
    There was a one page statement of facts and a less than one page opinion by Justice Brewer. 
    The opinion does not examine in detail prior Indian law precedent relating to jurisdictional matters. 
    The opinion does not seem to indicate that new Indian law ground is being plowed, or is intended to be plowed in that short opinion, and there's no indication, it seems to us, that the Court is clearly establishing a new generic rule of law that says alienability equals taxability.

speaker="james_m_schoessler" startTime="1682.956" stopTime="1778.279">
    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    I think the Court in Goudy did not address or consider the Indian Nonintercourse Act and I think it was for this reason, and it's probably I think the most critical factor in Goudy and perhaps one of the more misunderstood factors in Goudy, and that is the fact that the Goudy court treated the plaintiff in that case, James Goudy, not as an Indian but as a non Indian citizen. 
    It was stipulated to in that case that Goudy was to be treated as a non Indian citizen. 
    That was referred to by the Court and I think it was terribly important to the decision in that case. 
    It was terribly important because it reversed presumptions. 
    As a non Indian citizen Goudy was presumed already to be subject to State law unless he could show an express Federal exemption from that law. 
    If he were treated as an Indian, he would have been presumed protected from State jurisdiction unless the county could have shown an unmistakably clear delegation of authority over him. 
    What the Goudy court did is rule on the exemption question. 
    It ruled that James Goudy could not demonstrate an unmistakably clear exemption from the taxation that was presumed valid over him as a non Indian citizen. 
    The court did not decide and declare that the alienability of his land provided the jurisdiction over him. 
    That jurisdiction already existed because he was a non Indian citizen within the boundaries of the State.

    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    Your Honor, we certainly do argue that, but our most serious concern is the alienability equals taxability rule. 
    Certainly the nonintercourse act we believe would prevent the lands from being taxed if there was such a rule in this country's jurisprudence, so we seriously argue about the validity of the rule itself, and that's our primary concern.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1953.524" stopTime="1966.492">

    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    Yes, that's correct. 
    The other point that I would make about that is by adopting such a rule you have essentially de facto disestablished reservations, because the rule of Indian country generally is, as you well know, is that State jurisdiction is limited in Indian country. 
    It's limited over both Indians and tribes within Indian country.

    It seems to me if we held that to mean what you and the Government say it should mean here that a tribe today or tomorrow seeking to convey land in a business transaction is up against a very real burden. 
    How would a tribe that wished to convey some land that it owned today go about it if the Indian Intercourse Act means what you say it means?

    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, you're correct, it does, in fact, impose a burden on the potential transfer of lands that are purchased in fee by Indian tribes. 
    We understand that, and we would hope that if not now, in the future, rules for allowing such transfer under perhaps more flexible circumstances than exist now for allowing transfers of trust lands would be developed and the tribes could obtain that permission.

    They just ought to buy up all land in sight and they have a great economic advantage over all other landholders. 
    Maybe they don't have to pay taxes and what they ought to do is acquire vast, you know, acreage and then lease it out to other people, which can be done very profitably because the scheme just exempts the real estate from taxes.

    I would base it actually on the plain wording of the act. 
    The wording of the act does not talk about taxation. 
    The wording of the act talks about conveyance, and I think there is nothing that is necessarily mutually exclusive or improper about a piece of land being purchased off reservation that the United States would not allow to be conveyed without its approval as differentiated from land being purchased off the reservation that might be taxable.

    Mr. James M. Schoessler 
    The purchase of land has really only become an issue probably in the last couple of decades as tribal governments have built themselves up enough to actually consider being able to rebuild some of their tribal land bases. 
    Those land bases were devastated during the allotment era. 
    The Leech Lake Reservation is an example of that, where over 90 percent of the land, 95 percent of the land was lost to Indians and the tribe during the allotment era. 
    The whole thrust of current... of the current attempts are for the tribes to attempt to rebuild some of their reservations that were taken away during the allotment era and it makes a great deal of difference to them and it's very important to the tribes for several reasons, not only for economic development and self sufficiency, but--

    --Or by act of Congress. 
    But the last point that I was going to make is that it's also important for the tribes to rebuild these land bases because it is becoming increasingly apparent that much of the jurisdiction that tribes have as semisovereigns is being related to the land ownership that they have within their reservations. 
    So it makes a great deal of difference, both economically and in terms of self government and in terms of the sovereign jurisdiction that they can exert, that lands within the reservations be rebuilt and that they be reacquired by the tribes, and that's actually one of the reasons we're here, is because the tribes are starting to do that and the counties and States are objecting to that.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    If I understand it, there is an out, which you wouldn't like, but it prevents downtown Minneapolis from becoming inalienable, and that is that the Indian Nonintercourse Act only applies to lands that have not been sold in fee simple and thereby become alienable, but if the tribe reacquires land like that, well, it remains alienable, and that kind of interpretation applies on reservation and off reservation, et cetera. 
    If you accept that, you don't get into this problem of downtown Minneapolis, but of course, then, if you also accept taxation follows alienability, it means that this land would be taxable. 
    That's a long question.

    You've held that allotment lands that ultimately are reconveyed, or ultimately end up at the present time in the hands of an Indian or of a tribe are taxable. 
    If those lands are taxable, how could you possibly attribute to Congress an intent not to provide the like treatment to lands that come back... that come to the tribe or the Indian after having been through the pinelands conveyance process, or the process in... pursuant to the Homestead Act?

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, he... but I think we accept, and I mean I think the premise of his argument was, the statement does not have to have an express reference to the particular land or category of land. 
    It's simply got to be unmistakably clear. 
    And if it's unmistakably clear for allotment lands, it's got to be... you've got to have the same rule for nonallotment lands that would convey out. 
    I mean, it would just be bizarre otherwise, and that's where the unmistakability comes from, as I understand it.

    Ms. Barbara B. McDowell

    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right. 
    If you take that as your starting place, that allotment lands which by whatever process end up back in the hands of the tribe, or end up in the hands of the tribe are going to be taxable, isn't it a pretty strong argument that lands that went out by way of the pinelands or the Homestead Act kind of conveyances have got to be in the same position, or you're attributing a certain sort of bizarreness to Congress.
speaker="barbara_b_mcdowell" startTime="2665.363" stopTime="2680.873">
    Ms. Barbara B. McDowell 
    This Court's rule is that there must be some sort of unmistakably clear expression of what Congress intended, and it's impossible to tell here what Congress would have intended about land that came back into the possession of the tribe.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2680.873" stopTime="2723.563">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But once the Court has determined that it is clear with respect to land that was allotted to individual Indians, once the Court has made that determination that that is clear, then why isn't it, as Justice Souter says, equally clear that no rational Congress could have envisioned a different treatment for the land that went out not under allotments to individual Indians? 
    What rational Congress would say, yeah, we meant that if it was allotted to Indians, it's reacquired by the tribe tax free, but if it went out under the Homestead Act, then the tribe has its exemption?
speaker="barbara_b_mcdowell" startTime="2723.563" stopTime="2745.536">
    Ms. Barbara B. McDowell 
    Congress obviously would have understood at the time that there were many different tax statuses that might have occurred with respect to the homestead lands and the pinelands, depending on whether and how they were actually acquired. 
    The lands, after all, were ceded by the tribe to the United States. 
    It was possible that the lands would never be sold by the United States and thus would never become taxable at all.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2745.536" stopTime="2768.641">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but we're talking about land that was sold by the United States. 
    That's what we've got here and, as I understand, the object of those two categories of conveyances were either settlement or exploitation of natural resources, and certainly those are two paradigm examples of land uses that Congress would have assumed would be taxable in the normal course and that, if anything, makes the a fortiori argument all the stronger.
speaker="barbara_b_mcdowell" startTime="2768.641" stopTime="2804.417">
    Ms. Barbara B. McDowell 
    Well, Congress doubtless would have assumed that they would be taxable in the hands of an ordinary non Indian individual or business taxpayer, but we cannot conclude what Congress would have intended had the lands been reacquired by a tribe within the boundaries of an existing reservation. 
    Congress was legislating in 189... 89 at the time of the Nelson Act and subsequently, in light of this Court's decision, for example, in the New York Indians, which squarely held that tribally owned fee lands were not taxable to the tribe, so there was the background there that suggests that we cannot conclude what Congress would have intended back then with the--

speaker="barbara_b_mcdowell" startTime="2834.336" stopTime="2868.559">
    Ms. Barbara B. McDowell 
    --The distinction was not drawn perhaps because the focus of the tribe was on the parcels that was owned by individuals. 
    Those were the only parcels on which the county had been attempting to foreclose in Yakima. 
    Also, there was a special statute in Yakima that applied to at least some of the tribally owned lands that provided that they would not be entitled to any special tax status by virtue of their ownership by the tribe that suggested that in the Yakima situation the only protection that the tribe might have would be the same status, same protections as would be available to individual Indians.

    Downtown Minneapolis is not Indian country. 
    This is consistent with the legislative history of the 1834 act.

    It's not a clear statement, obviously, of congressional intent with respect to the taxable status of tribally owned reservation lands. 
    It should be emphasized that 465 was designed to allow the United States to take in trust both lands on the reservation and lands off the reservation, lands that clearly would have been taxable prior to their being taken into trust.

speaker="barbara_b_mcdowell" startTime="2936.532" stopTime="2946.470">
    Ms. Barbara B. McDowell 
    That's correct, but there are many tribes that have held lands for over a century now that have not... never been taken into trust and have always been recognized to be exempt from tax.

speaker="barbara_b_mcdowell" startTime="2954.504" stopTime="2976.367">
    Ms. Barbara B. McDowell 
    Well, traditionally those lands have been understood to be protected by the fact of Indian tax immunity, the absence of a clear statement, and the fact that those lands were within an existing reservation, the New York Indians being an example of that case. 
    Certainly it's hard to attribute to Congress an unexpressed intent to overrule the New York Indians and other cases of that kind when it passed section 465.

    I think it's important to look at section 3 of the Court's opinion in Yakima, where the Court actually starts applying the clear statement rule to the actual two taxes at issue in that case and there, when the Court decides that the ad valorem tax in Yakima is permissible, it is because it constitutes, quote, taxation of property within the meaning of section 6 of the General Allotment Act and the Burke Act proviso.

speaker="earl_edwin_maus" startTime="3080.375" stopTime="3156.875">
    Mr. Earl Edwin Maus 
    A couple of things, I guess, one just on the Burke Act, just to comment on that. 
    The Burke Act needed to say that the land given and early fee patented was taxable, because if it hadn't said that, I submit to the Court, there was still that provision out there that had the 25-year trust period, and that would have meant that the land would have become alienable, not taxable to the... at the end of that 25 years, so the Court had to... I mean, the proviso needed to say that for the early fee patenting. 
    I think that clears that one up, and... hopefully. 
    Also, she... you know, the U.S. referred briefly to section 3 of the Yakima decision. 
    Well, that dealt with the excise tax, and we're not here about that today. 
    We're here on land, and I think the rest of the Court's decision dealt solely with land, and those taxes are certainly distinguishable from this. 
    And one final thing, the New York case that was cited several times here, that involved the nonintercourse act, but in that New York case there was never any act of Congress to sell those lands. 
    Those lands were aboriginal lands that were just merely put on the tax roll, and so--

    That's correct, and it would be our position that the nonintercourse act applies to lands that have never been alienable. 
    In other words, Congress has never made them alienable and they've kept them just as they were.
