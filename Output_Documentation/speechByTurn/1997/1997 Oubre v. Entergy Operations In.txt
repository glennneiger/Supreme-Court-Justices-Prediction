    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1291, Delores Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc.-- 
    Ms. Haynie.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="10.068" stopTime="63.573">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    After 2 years of careful consideration, in response to a regulatory void, Congress enacted the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act to protect the rights of older workers who were in greater force leaving... being forced to leave the work place. 
    The Older Worker Benefit Protection Act mandates that an older worker may not waive their rights secured under the ADEA unless such waiver is knowing and voluntary as defined by the act. 
    If an employer chooses to utilize a waiver of age discrimination rights, Congress requires an employer to provide the older worker with the requisite information and time to assess the value of the right to be waived. 
    The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' adoption of the common law contract principles of ratification and tender-back in addressing a situation where the employer uses a waiver which is... does not comply with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act will in all practical purpose render the act meaningless.

    What would happen in the case if the day after the release is signed, but before any money changed hands, the employer says, we've made a mistake, it's a good faith mistake, we didn't know about the ADEA, we want to rescind the release?
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="81.554" stopTime="88.020">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    Well, Your Honor, pursuant to the statute there is a revocation period of 7 days after the release is signed.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    No, but this is the employer.

    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    I understand. 
    There will be a 7-day--that release is not effective pursuant to--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="92.943" stopTime="96.145">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, let's change the hypothetical. 
    Suppose... I want the release to be effective.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="96.145" stopTime="114.327">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --7 days after it. 
    The employer would not have the right to rescind the release. 
    It is an invalid release with regard to ADEA claims if it does not comply with the statute. 
    If they rescind the release to all other waivers, I believe the plaintiff or the older worker will have the right to proceed against the employer.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="114.327" stopTime="123.884">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But in other words you couldn't have-- 
    --doesn't have to rescind it. 
    Excuse me. 
    You couldn't have an equitable action to rescind the release at the employer's behest? 
    Let's assume a good faith mistake on his part.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="123.884" stopTime="132.540">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    No, sir. 
    If the waiver does not comply with the requirements of the act, it is a void waiver pursuant to--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well then, he wouldn't have to pay... he wouldn't have to pay any of the money, either? 
    Right. 
    If it's void, he wouldn't have to pay the money.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="138.384" stopTime="145.859">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --Well, the problem with not having to pay the money, Your Honor, is that the waiver includes, and particularly in this case, many other actions, other than a waiver of ADEA--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="145.859" stopTime="150.781">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    That's, it seems to me, one of the points, is that this might very well be valid as to everything but the ADEA.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="150.781" stopTime="151.543">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --And I believe that--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    There's a lot of talk on void and voidable, but this covers so many claims that it seems to me that's something that may be more of a problem for the respondent than for you.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="158.616" stopTime="162.409">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --I believe it would be void to the ADEA claims. 
    I believe that--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    As to them, then, the employer can, on day eight, say, I'm not going to pay anything insofar as it might be attributable... let's assume, keep the example, that he broke down the various considerations and said, with respect to this particular claim I'm not going to pay anything because it's void, because it violates the statute. 
    That would be legally proper, I take it, on your view.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="186.215" stopTime="191.117">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --That's correct, Your Honor, that would be, and the plaintiff can go forward and pursue their age discrimination claim in court.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="191.117" stopTime="228.822">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But in order to determine how much harm we're doing by saying these things are void from the outset I think we should be realistic and know that most of them do not assign a certain amount of money to the ADEA release and a certain amount of money to various other releases, and I doubt very much, when it's not broken out that way, whether you can say the contract is valid in part and invalid as to that one little item. 
    I mean, this is a standard question of severability. 
    I don't know how you can rip that contract apart, especially when the ADEA claim is a very major part of the consideration. 
    Do you know any other contract that's picked apart like that where it's just partially valid and we're going to enforce all the rest of it?
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="228.822" stopTime="236.668">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    Well, I think Congress has clearly spoken here that if the waiver drafted by the employer does not comply with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="236.668" stopTime="237.048">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="237.048" stopTime="240.130">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --That waiver is nonenforceable--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="240.130" stopTime="243.621">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Therefore that portion of the contract is bad, and I would say the whole contract is bad.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="243.621" stopTime="256.550">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --because I do believe the other portions of that waiver remain valid. 
    If the employer does not break out the enumeration for each right to be waived, that's the argument to save the set-off for the remedial phase of the trial.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="256.550" stopTime="262.775">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So all the employers who have these, have made these commitments can now simply stop paying money.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="262.775" stopTime="276.523">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    If they choose to stop paying money and have not enumerated out which moneys are going to be designated for which rights are being waived, then I believe the plaintiff has a simple right of breach of contract for all other rights that they had signed, if the money has stopped.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="276.523" stopTime="281.578">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, but a contract is... you can't pick apart a contract like that. 
    If the contract's void, it's void.

    Well, I--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What do you mean, he's breached it? 
    How much money is he supposed to pay, two-thirds of the full contract, or... I mean, how do you decide how much?

    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --I agree, Your Honor, I believe that's one of the practical problems of this case, and that's why the tender back at the very beginning of a case to bar plaintiff to going into court is very prac... impractical.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="299.280" stopTime="327.198">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What I am worried about is, you are destroying cause... you are destroying entitlements to these payments on the part of all older workers who have been terminated, including the majority of them who do not have any ADEA claims. 
    I'm not sure you're doing them a favor. 
    You're saying if the employer is confident enough that this worker doesn't have an ADEA claim he can just say, I'm sorry, we made a mistake.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="327.198" stopTime="331.240">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    Well, I believe that's what Congress has established--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="331.240" stopTime="357.787">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Ms. Haynie, we aren't sure about that, because Congress did not expressly say such an agreement that fails to comply with these requirements is void, as they have done in some other legislation. 
    They don't say that, so at common law I suppose an agreement where the employer was guilty of some kind of fraud, duress, or coercion would be voidable, wouldn't it?
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="357.787" stopTime="358.368">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --That's correct.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Voidable at the option of the person defrauded. 
    Maybe this contract is voidable, not void. 
    Congress didn't say, one way or another.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="368.205" stopTime="379.753">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    I believe the phrase, may not waive, is tantamount to announce, or proclaiming void any waivers which do not comply with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act for those rights secured under the ADEA.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="379.753" stopTime="477.290">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But why? 
    Why would Congress wanted to have done that, because what you're being told, I think, from Justice Scalia and others, is let's imagine... let's imagine that a... that we have 100,000 workers who are quitting, and each of them has a contract, and they all promise not to bring claims, and each of them is paid [dollars] 5,000 for that promise. 
    All right. 
    Now, very few of them will have real ADEA claims. 
    Very few. 
    But suppose they're all like this, that they didn't comply with the rule exactly. 
    Now, on your theory one day every employer is going to wake up to the fact that he hasn't bought a single thing for his [dollars] 5,000, and somebody might go around and collect the lawsuits and sue everybody and get the money back, so you'd be taking from 100,000 or 90 of the 100,000, [dollars] 5,000 each have to go right back. 
    On the other hand, if you're wrong, all that happens is when somebody has a good claim they have to put up a little bit of money up front, whatever the proportionate amount of the ADEA part is, which might be [dollars] 500, and the lawyer could front it for him. 
    So why would Congress want the result that you want, which would seem to put at risk hundreds of thousands of workers to have to give back the money who would have no claim... the employer would sue them... and at the same time to protect some lawyer from not having to put up a very little money up front. 
    Now, I'm putting it strongly, but it's exactly that practical consideration that I'm very disturbed about in terms of your position.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="477.290" stopTime="479.750">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    Your Honor, with regard to the practical--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="479.750" stopTime="486.503">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It's not practical, it's legal, and what I'm asking is, why would Congress have wanted that result?
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="486.503" stopTime="531.112">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --Congress was very clear in enacting this statute to protect the rights of older workers when negotiating with employers when they're forced out of the work place. 
    They are not arm-length negotiators. 
    Congress put in very specific requirements an employer must meet so that an employee knows they are giving up a valuable right in exchange for that consideration. 
    If they're given adequate considera... or information, and there is some specter of discrimination, then the employer can go... the employee can go back to the employer and negotiate for a greater severance or say, no, I'm not going to sign this. 
    Without that knowledge, and without the time to consider it in a coercion case, then the employee is really left with no option but to take the money.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="531.112" stopTime="567.827">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    We're not talking about the same thing. 
    What I'm talking about is, I agree with you the contract is no good. 
    I agree with you the employee can sue. 
    I agree with you that that provision in the contract promising not to sue is worthless. 
    It's no good. 
    The question involved is whether, before he brings the lawsuit, he has to give back a proportionate share of the money that he's been paid for his promise not to sue. 
    I would imagine if they're paying five or [dollars] 6,000 for such a promise he'd have to give [dollars] 500 back, or... and the lawyer could put it up front.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="567.827" stopTime="568.538">

    Well--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="568.538" stopTime="574.311">

    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --The problem is twofold, Your Honor. 
    First, the monetary amount could be greater. 
    The employee expends the money looking... for living expenses while looking for other employment. 
    The second problem is, who is to decide what the proportionate share will be? 
    That's going to have to be decided by a trier of fact, a judicial tribunal. 
    That means you're in court already.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="594.244" stopTime="599.988">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, can a proportionate share be determined? 
    How do we determine the proportionate share?
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="599.988" stopTime="606.342">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    The proportionate share can be determined at the end of the litigation, when a trial judge has taken into--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="606.342" stopTime="612.837">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I thought courts have routinely said they are unable to make that kind of a determination. 
    I mean, they can't do that.

    I don't see how that could possibly be made.

    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    --If you require the plaintiff to tender back all the money received, then it is the employer who receives the windfall there, because the employee has waived many other rights under that waiver. 
    The employer can raise the defense.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="637.244" stopTime="656.985">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But if you say the contract is void, then what you're doing is saying that the ADEA tail wags the State law dog with respect to all releases. 
    You are saying that all State law releases, State claim releases are, I take it, void because the contract is not severable.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="656.985" stopTime="666.292">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    No, I don't believe that, Your Honor.

    Ms. Haynie, suppose-- 
    --Ms. Haynie, did... maybe I misunderstood your argument, but I thought your position was, may not waive is... leaves employer and employee without any authority, without any power to do anything with respect to the ADEA claim. 
    That being so, you construe this contract as though what may not be done wasn't done, so that the only thing that would be covered would be the non-ADEA claims. 
    Maybe you're not making that argument.
speaker="barbara_g_haynie" startTime="699.554" stopTime="722.129">
    Ms. Barbara G. Haynie 
    No, I am making that argument, Your Honor, that again the statute speaks specifically to ADEA claims, and those are the... that is the waiver that is void. 
    That is the waiver that is nonenforceable against the plaintiff who signs it.

    Let me ask you a factual question. 
    we've all been making the same assumption here, but let me just question the assumption. 
    Is there any way of knowing, in the run-of-the-mill situation in which there is a release and the object, the obvious principal purpose of the release is the age claim, whether in those cases there tends to be a, in fact, others unrelated claims? 
    I mean, for example, in this case, was she an employee at-will, so... or was she subject to some kind of a cause requirement so that she would have had a lost wage claim? 
    Because if most of these releases in the real world are simply releases of nothing but the age claim, then this problem that's being raised would loom smaller than it might otherwise be.

   Argument of Beth S. Brinkmann
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1140.598" stopTime="1196.116">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    To respond to the concerns that the Court has raised, we would agree that the congressional scheme that has been established here addresses these concerns in that Congress gave the courts broad equitable authority, and the Court recognized that in McKennon, that that equitable authority is something that the district courts in ADEA cases exercised to take into account concerns of employers. 
    That is consistent with the common law trend, also. 
    As respondent pointed out in its brief, the common law tender-back was not required in equity, generally. 
    It was only for settlement releases, and in those cases those were... the cases we've seen are ones that only had one topic of the release, so by suing you were undoing the release. 
    But in cases like this, this is a waiver that violates a statute. 
    At common law, that was one of the major bases for not enforcing a contract.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1196.116" stopTime="1211.997">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, is it void or voidable? 
    At common law, it would have been voidable for fraud or coercion or duress, and this is a substitute for that. 
    This is a statutory expression of conditions that have to be there to avoid any kind of coercion or fraud, isn't it?
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1211.997" stopTime="1212.656">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    We believe--

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann

    Whether--

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    --We believe that the waiver of the ADEA claim is void, Your Honor. 
    At common law what they would have done with something like that, they would have applied the practice of divisibility. 
    When there was an illegal contract for gambling, or something that violated an antitrust statute, they would look and see if that statute was divisible. 
    If it was not divisible, often illegal contracts parties were left as they were. 
    There were some exceptions to that.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1247.541" stopTime="1252.172">

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    I think it may very well be. 
    I mean, part of the thing that is even more complicated, Your Honor, much more consideration was given for the [dollars] 6,000 than an ADEA waiver. 
    Petitioner resigned from her job, in addition to waiving other claims, so there's a lot of equity, and that's exactly what courts of equities would look at, and that's why that decision was made at the remedy phase of the proceeding, where the court could take into account those equitable concerns, and we--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1278.632" stopTime="1301.468">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Ms. Brinkmann, if the void waiver leaves the parties where they were, then doesn't someone who is asserting that the waiver violates the statute by bringing a lawsuit, doesn't that person have to return... in order to be consistent in the pleading, doesn't the person have to return whatever money that person has acquired under the contract?

    --Your Honor, we--

    --No. 
    We believe that Congress made clear in this statute that waivers were void if they did not comply with these requirements.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1311.744" stopTime="1312.214">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right.
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1312.214" stopTime="1315.618">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    And that means that that waiver violates the statute.

    Right.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We know that, but you're saying that Congress made expressly clear that no tender back would be required. 
    Where is that?

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    --Yes. 
    We believe, when you look at the... for example, (f)(3), where Congress foresaw that there would be disputes among parties about the validity of these waivers, Congress specifically said the burden would be on the employer, or the person asserting the validity of the waiver.

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Ms. Brinkmann, may I ask you to address a specific point there? 
    I thought one of the strongest, if not the strongest argument for the position that you and the petitioner take is that if you require a tender back, the prohibition in the statute is a dead letter, because in fact you're dealing with people who are not going to have the money to tender back, not because they went to the race track because they used it to pay the rent and buy the food. 
    Is there anything we can look at to find out whether that... that seems to have an intuitive appeal to it. 
    Is... has it gotten anything more than an intuitive appeal? 
    Are there statistics anywhere, or is there anything in the record to the effect that that is so?
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1481.861" stopTime="1519.755">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    --Certainly, Your Honor. 
    In the first section of the ADEA, 621, Congress made a specific find or example that older workers are much less likely to retain and regain employment once they're terminated, so it's a specific class. 
    The legislative history also concerns information about that. 
    Also, even where courts have applied a tender-back requirement as Judge Posner did in his opinion for the Seventh Circuit in a title VII case, he recognized that where there was a situation in which living expenses would preclude the bringing of the suit, that would not be permitted as a matter of equity. 
    He also pointed out that, you know, perhaps an offer would be sufficient, would be offset at the remedial phase.

    Justice David H. Souter

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann

    That is, I absolutely take in your point that if the worker has to front the money sometimes they won't have it, and maybe their lawyer wouldn't give it to them. 
    I see that as a problem. 
    I don't think it makes the worker back at stage zero, but it could be a problem. 
    But if we agree with you, everyone's been pointing out that in all the millions of retirements contracts in the United States, every one that doesn't comply with all this is void, and why won't, at some day, some clever person work out that he could go from employer to employer, buy up tens of thousands of suits, and all the people who don't have ADEA claims will have to give back several thousand dollars to their employer? 
    I mean, it's the people who don't have the claim who vastly outnumber the ones who do, who would be suddenly left high and dry, on your theory, at the mercy of whether an employer would just decide to sue him for the money back.

    There is no such provision. 
    Each worker is there with [dollars] 4,000 that he got. 
    Why can't the employer just sue him to get the [dollars] 4,000 back?

   Argument of Carter G. Phillips
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1757.212" stopTime="1777.395">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    It seems to me that the bulk of the discussion that's gone on today suggests as strongly as anything that I could propose to you why it is that we would do far better to leave the common law in place, providing us with a set of guideposts that can be applied on a regular basis and on a case-by-case basis, and recognize that section 626(f) is a very pointed--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1777.395" stopTime="1806.803">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Phillips, let me just raise a question that... you know somebody's got to ask you a question about this. 
    I agree with everything in your brief about the common law, the equities, the fairness, but the statute never says anything about void or voidable, but the statute does say, an individual may not waive this claim unless the waiver complies with the statute, and in this case the waiver did not comply with the statute. 
    If they do not come up with the money to pay you in advance, is it not true you claim you would have a defense to the suit which would be a waiver?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1806.803" stopTime="1821.085">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --If they do not pay it... no. 
    No, no. 
    It's not the waiver argument. 
    What we're saying is that they've forfeited their rights as a matter of common law by their failure to comply with an independent State law duty to tender back the consideration. 
    It doesn't revive the waiver.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1821.085" stopTime="1825.239">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What is your defense to the suit? 
    Is it not the document that she signed?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1825.239" stopTime="1832.112">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    No. 
    The... it's not. 
    It is the failure to tender back, and the failure to pay the consideration.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1832.112" stopTime="1835.205">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why should she have to... what in the statute compels her to tender anything back?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1835.205" stopTime="1839.679">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Nothing in the statute compels her to tender it back. 
    It is a bedrock principle of the common law and contract law.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1839.679" stopTime="1843.760">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You say she has not... you say there's just no waiver issue at all, then.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1843.760" stopTime="1870.607">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I've lost the waiver issue, Your Honor. 
    That's right. 
    She is perfectly available to come forward into court and bring her claim. 
    We do not fear, and I don't think any of the employers in these cases fear having these age discrimination cases go forward if that's what they want to do, but what we are concerned about, and what the common law protects, is our right to say, look, you have to put the money in. 
    That's the consideration you have to pay as a condition of coming in. 
    That is a wholly independent legal requirement that's been embedded in the common law for 200 years.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1870.607" stopTime="1876.542">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But if she had never signed a contract she wouldn't have to do that. 
    If she'd never signed the waiver she would not have to do that.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    If we had given her money in return--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Say she signed no document whatsoever, and you just said to her, we think you've been a wonderful employee, we don't think you're going to sue us, here's a lot of money. 
    Would she have to give that back?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips

    To bring an ADEA suit? 
    Why? 
    If she never signed a release she wouldn't have to give anything back, would she?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --As I understand the State common law--

    Would you... I'm asking you, would you have a defense to this case if she had not signed a release?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --If she had not signed the release. 
    No. 
    Ultimately we--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1907.162" stopTime="1910.903">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So the heart of your defense is the fact she signed a document that she has not rescinded.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --No, but that's not... no. 
    No, Justice Stevens. 
    The heart of my defense is that the common law recognizes an independent obligation, apart from whether the release is waived or not waived, that you must as a condition of coming to court pay back moneys that have been paid to you as a part--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1928.205" stopTime="1937.633">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    If you want to avoid a release. 
    That's what... the payback is in order to make something that is voidable... keep it alive.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1937.633" stopTime="1944.859">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --You can construe it that way, but that's not the way the common law views it. 
    Common law imposes it as an independent--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1944.859" stopTime="1953.845">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I agree with you on the common law entirely. 
    My question is, how can you get around the statutory language that says she may not waive unless you comply with the statute, and you're saying she did waive?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1953.845" stopTime="1975.778">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --I will go back to the Court's opinion in United States v. Olano, which draws a clear distinction between waiver, which is the knowing and voluntary relinquishment of a known right and the implications of that, and it's a narrow concept, and a forfeiture of your rights which arises because you don't fulfill your independent common law duties, and that's what we have here, is an independent common law duty to put forward the consideration.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1975.778" stopTime="1978.830">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But that duty would not arise unless she'd signed a waiver.

    That--

    --No.

    It has an operative effect.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2012.234" stopTime="2025.032">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I understand that, Justice... Your Honor, but the bottom line here, the problem with that is, is how far are you going to take statutory language to do damage to the common law, and basically what this Court--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2025.032" stopTime="2052.958">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Or you might pose the question, how far are you going to allow a common law process in effect to thwart the statute, and if, in fact, we are correct in the intuitive assumption that has been suggested here, that in most of these cases in which this is going to be a serious question the worker is simply not going to be in a position to make the tender, then, in fact, on your theory the statute is a dead letter.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2052.958" stopTime="2064.617">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, let's step back for a second, because that is... there is no support anywhere, empirical, that I know of, that that's true. 
    I mean, the principle of tender-back has been available for 200 years. 
    There's not a shred of evidence anywhere--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2064.617" stopTime="2078.167">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but the statute hasn't been. 
    I mean, we're in this position because we've got a fairly unequivocal-looking statute, and the fact that the common law may have operated without the hindrance of statute for 200 years leaves us, I think, exactly where Justice Stevens is.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2078.167" stopTime="2084.601">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, no, but there have been principles by which one can void or declare unenforceable contracts for 200 years, and there has been a tender-back requirement that applies to that.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2084.601" stopTime="2095.178">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But the tender-back-- 
    --Well, what was the common law, though, if it was void? 
    Was it the situation that the parties might be left where the law found them at the time it was voided?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2095.178" stopTime="2096.069">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Yes, that is my general understanding.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2096.069" stopTime="2099.090">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So there might not be a tender-back requirement.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2099.090" stopTime="2099.581">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Right, if it... if--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2099.581" stopTime="2101.291">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    If it were totally void.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2101.291" stopTime="2109.936">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --That's correct, if it's totally void. 
    On the other hand, there is not a shred of evidence that Congress intended to declare these totally void, for the reasons I think Justice Breyer's agrument describes--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2109.936" stopTime="2114.771">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But your argument depends upon our determining that the waiver is voidable.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --That's correct, Your Honor.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2119.663" stopTime="2120.845">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why-- 
    --Again--
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2120.845" stopTime="2122.355">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I agree with that, because--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2122.355" stopTime="2142.628">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --In response to Justice Stevens' point that I still think we'd better get straight, if we're the trial court, you don't say that the suit cannot proceed because the money was not paid back. 
    You say the suit was not... cannot proceed because (a) the money was not paid back, and (b) that allows you to plead the waiver.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2142.628" stopTime="2144.140">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --That's correct.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2144.140" stopTime="2146.791">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But the statute says the individual can't waive.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2146.791" stopTime="2170.217">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    But the point of the ultimate... the significance in terms of how the law operates, and it's true in Louisiana as it is in every other State, that is, if... you know, the fundamental principle is, you pay back as a condition. 
    It is true that I... they... I have both components of it, but the part that precludes you from going forward and has precluded plaintiffs from going forward for 200 years is the failure to tender back the consideration.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2170.217" stopTime="2172.227">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Phillips-- 
    --But not under Federal statutes like the FELA.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2172.227" stopTime="2186.696">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, the FELA is exactly on point in my favor on this, Your Honor, because there the language of section 55 says as plainly as possible any contract or device to limit the liability of an employer is void, and it says it in so many words.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2186.696" stopTime="2201.649">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But that's significant in this case for another reason. 
    This waiver is void only insofar as it waives FE... ADEA claims. 
    It doesn't purport to make the entire document void. 
    It just says it cannot operate as a waiver of this particular cause of action. 
    So it's void pro tanto.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2201.649" stopTime="2204.640">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, that goes back to Justice Scalia's question about severability.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2204.640" stopTime="2208.684">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Your point is that the FELA language about void does not find a counterpart in the ADEA.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2208.684" stopTime="2224.054">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Exactly. 
    Congress had a model it could follow in this context. 
    It had not only a statute that describes the matter as void, it also had a decision of this Court that enforced that statute in a way that eliminated the tender-back requirement, and Congress didn't follow that model here.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2224.054" stopTime="2234.830">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But there's a very good reason. 
    It did not want to create the specter that Justice Breyer's example creates of creating everything void. 
    It just said it's void insofar as it affects this particular claim.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2234.830" stopTime="2235.381">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    But it doesn't--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2235.381" stopTime="2236.192">

    It didn't say void.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2236.192" stopTime="2236.561">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --It doesn't say that either.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2236.561" stopTime="2239.823">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It says, it shall not operate as a waiver of this narrow claim.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2239.823" stopTime="2241.536">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Right. 
    It seems to me Congress knows how to--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2241.536" stopTime="2245.546">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But you can't give effect to that language, as I understand your position, and still say she has to tender back.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2245.546" stopTime="2256.236">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --But Your Honor, if the position of the common law would have set aside the contract for reasons of coercion or duress or fraud or any of those other reasons, it's still, under those circumstances, no more than voidable, and so it would seem--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2256.236" stopTime="2329.032">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    We have an example, Mr. Phillips of State law... of a State law that says may not waive, do you agree that that's... the essence of this case is for us to construe what those words mean, may not waive, and I take that to be an instruction to the employer as well as to the employee, so may I ask you to respond to the question that I put to Ms. Haynie? 
    That is, one way to look at what Congress did, these words, may not waive, is to say, well, that's a condition, that whatever else this contract does, it can't do that. 
    The employer doesn't have the power to put it in, the employee doesn't have the power to agree to it, so the contract... the employer knowing that full well, by the way... the contract then must be construed to waive the host of other claims that are waivable, and it's enforceable to the extent that it doesn't include the one thing that Congress says thou shalt not. 
    So it's perfectly good to waive title VII, to waive a slew of other claims. 
    Why isn't that the most sensible reading of the may-not-waive language?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2329.032" stopTime="2363.186">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Because the language has to be... I mean, you can look at may-not-waive on its own, but the truth is, it's a part of a provision that is designed to modify a very discrete element of the common law. 
    It eliminates the requirement and the burden on the employee to come forward and prove fraud, duress, or the other conditions that would justify setting aside a release. 
    Congress said, we're not going to put employees to that burden. 
    We are going to eliminate that obligation. 
    We're going to lower the burden that otherwise would exist. 
    But beyond that, Congress didn't say, and in addition to that we mean to eliminate through the language, waiver, all other forfeitures of rights.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2363.186" stopTime="2364.415">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    No, just may not waive this one claim.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --No, of course not. 
    I'm not saying... they're not waiving by failing to tender back. 
    That's not a waiver. 
    That is, as this Court said in Olano, a forfeiture, just as she's not waiving if she fails to satisfy a statute of limitations or other restrictions on the ability to go forward. 
    The fact that she doesn't do that doesn't trigger 626 as a set of conditions on that forfeiture, even though we might colloquially describe that as a waiver.

    Wouldn't the court, if I'm right, simply say to the employer, no, you can't get the entire consideration back because they waived a lot of... if this is true, you know, they waived other things besides the age claim, so I'll give you part of it back.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    No. 
    What we do have is a Federal question to decide where you look to the law, and my instinctive reaction is that you ought to look to the principles of State law and borrow those principles. 
    In this particular case, however, it makes no difference, because Louisiana, like the law of every other... all 50 States, and if there were a Federal common law rule what would be the Federal common law rule--

    The other case is a case like this in which, let us say, there might have been some substantial State law claims that were released as well as the ADEA claim. 
    It also is void. 
    You say the two cases are exactly the same.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2868.029" stopTime="2886.061">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Yes. 
    I think they should... well, they're not the same in... with respect to being able to waive the rights, sure. 
    That... the statute takes care of that. 
    But with respect to the obligation to come forward and satisfy the tender-back obligation as an independent, legal obligation that the State common law and, frankly, Federal common law applies, yes, those are exactly the same.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2886.061" stopTime="2916.911">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Phillips, can I ask you another question? 
    I also took contracts in law school by the way. 
    [Laughter] 
    Supposing one reads the statute noting that it doesn't use the word void or voidable, they're simply saying that when you have a release which purports to release 19 different claims, and if one of those claims is an ADEA claim the release shall not be enforceable insofar as it purports to release that claim, because that would be a waiver... they don't even talk about void or voidable... why wouldn't that be a reasonable reading of this statute?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2916.911" stopTime="2920.723">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, that doesn't answer the question, though. 
    I mean, it's a perfectly reasonable answer.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2920.723" stopTime="2921.374">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What question doesn't it answer?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2921.374" stopTime="2925.738">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    It doesn't answer the question whether you have an obligation to tender back as a precondition--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2925.738" stopTime="2936.746">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It says it shall not be enforceable, period, regardless of whether you're able or willing or not to tender back. 
    Doesn't... isn't it perfectly clear what the mean... and isn't that a fair reading of the plain language of this statute?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2936.746" stopTime="2943.329">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --No, because that gives a meaning to the word waiver that is much broader than that term is entitled to carry.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2943.329" stopTime="2945.571">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The meaning is, it shall not be enforceable as to that narrow claim.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2945.571" stopTime="2946.041">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2946.041" stopTime="2946.770">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2946.770" stopTime="2947.451">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    But it doesn't mean--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2947.451" stopTime="2950.473">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And that's much broader than the statutory language that says you may not waive that claim.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2950.473" stopTime="2968.227">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --But all that says is... and again, I think it's inappropriate to read that just as, may not waive. 
    I think you have to read it against the backdrop of all of those conditions that are imposed, because all of the conditions that are imposed in determining whether a waiver is voluntary and knowing are all conditions that would go to the question of coercion, duress, and all of the other--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2968.227" stopTime="2975.941">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Which, they put the employer on notice that if they want this to cut off the ADEA claim they must comply with these provisions, which your client didn't comply with.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2975.941" stopTime="2976.502">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2976.502" stopTime="2980.182">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Therefore, you have a perfectly valid document as to everything except the ADEA claim.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2980.182" stopTime="2980.753">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2980.753" stopTime="2984.616">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So I don't understand why that doesn't fit the plain language of the statute.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="2984.616" stopTime="3038.976">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Because what fits the plain language, Justice Stevens, is, in the ordinary case she has an age discrimination claim. 
    She's not happy with the release she signed. 
    She's got [dollars] 6,000. 
    It is her obligation, in order to get into court in the first instance, to show fraud, coercion, duress, or some other justification for setting aside the agreement. 
    Congress stepped in... and this is an important right. 
    It seems to be lost sight of in this context. 
    Congress stepped in and modified that directly, saying, first of all, you don't have to satisfy any of those requirements that ordinarily entitle a contract to be respected. 
    We're going to drop the barrier significantly, and second, we're going to impose upon the employer an ongoing obligation to prove that this was knowing and voluntary, a burden of proof that otherwise doesn't exist. 
    By doing that... and if we don't satisfy those requirements, she is free to go into court against those common law doctrines that would clearly prevent her from going into court, and that's what Congress had in mind.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3038.976" stopTime="3048.593">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It's the last part that's not in the statute, that you're bringing in against those common law doctrines. 
    You've just acknowledged that this modified the common law by saying you don't have those thresholds, you have a statutory threshold--
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3048.593" stopTime="3049.182">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    But I--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3049.182" stopTime="3050.764">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --which your client did not comply with.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3050.764" stopTime="3086.748">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --But... and I understand that, but then I go back to the Court's opinion in United States v. Texas, where it says, when Congress sits down and tries to modify the common law, we do not presume that Congress means to undo any broader than Congress states expressly in the language of the statute itself. 
    Therefore, it's perfectly sensible to me under United States v. Texas to say 626(f) would get her into court if there are no other legal impediments to going into court, but it doesn't go that extra step and offer her an opportunity to avoid a forfeiture, a forfeiture of her right that arises as an independent common law doctrine.

    But if the common law in a State were not the unreasonable position that a may-not-waive provision leaves both sides powerless, so the contract is construed, as Justice Stevens suggested, to cover everything else that could be covered to dispose of anything the parties could dispose of, but just as though it weren't there, the thing that they can't dispose of, so the common law, let's, say, in New York or New Jersey was not as you described it to be in Louisiana, could we then say that for these kinds of claims the Age Discrimination Act is going to mean one thing in one State, another thing in another State, or that there will be the Federal common law so that you'd have the same rule in all the States?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I think the farthest you can go with Federal common law is to deal with precisely how you analyze the precise waiver, because that comes from the statute, and if you have interstices within the application of 626(f), it seems to me those you would clearly fill in by reference to--

    Well now, in Hogue, which you say doesn't directly apply here because in FELA Congress said it's going to be void, but nonetheless at the end of the day in Hogue the Court said we're going to require an offset at the end of the day. 
    If the plaintiff recovers something under the FELA claim we'll offset whatever the employer already had paid. 
    Now, what about such a provision? 
    I guess the Court was crafting some principle of Federal law there.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips

    Well, obviously, as between having an opportunity to get some money back at the end of the day or not, undoubtedly my client would prefer that alternative, but the truth is, what we seek to have vindicated here is the common law rule, recognized in all 50 States and as a matter of Federal common law, that you must come forward with the consideration at the outset of the litigation.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What if New York had only adopted that rule for this statute, for an ADEA case, could it... could New York say, in ADEA cases, given the nature of this statute and what-not, we're going to adopt that rule, although in all other cases in New York we won't do it?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --I mean, they... well... can they adopt that rule, that question is yes. 
    Would that be preempted, the answer to that is probably no. 
    The question is, would a Federal court be obliged to borrow that kind of a direct intrusion into the manipulation, or whether it would feel more comfortable saying that interferes with a Federal policy in a way that would require us to set it aside. 
    That seems to me a tough question to answer in the abstract, but those are the legal principles that I think would apply--

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, but that's true in lots of Federal statutes, Your Honor, and at least with respect to 626 and the important elements of protection of Federal law that are embodied in there, I'm not saying you look to State-by-State law there. 
    It seems to me clear the interstices of that provision, because it's designed to oust common law, you have to come in with Federal rules to do that.

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3302.068" stopTime="3343.705">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Could we solve the problem this way, by saying that the tender-back requirement can be looked at as essentially a remedial condition. 
    We're not going to give a remedy when the person keeps 100 percent of what, in fact, he is claiming inoperative, and therefore we're going to leave the question of what has to be, in effect, tendered and ultimately paid back to the remedy stage. 
    At the remedy stage, the Federal court does have fairly broad powers to craft a remedy without any violation of Erie, and therefore solve both the problem of state variation and the tender-back problem by saying it's going to be a remedial issue here. 
    What's wrong with that?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    That's the other side of it. 
    You may never get anything back. 
    But the bottom line is that the tender-back rule is not a remedial rule. 
    It is a rule that serves the ends of justice and fairness, but it does so substantively. 
    It is a fundamental principle of contract law, it creates an independently recognized right, it is enforceable independently, and it is that right which she forfeited and which justifies the dismissal of her claim, and why the judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be affirmed. 
    If there are no other questions I'll yield back my time.
