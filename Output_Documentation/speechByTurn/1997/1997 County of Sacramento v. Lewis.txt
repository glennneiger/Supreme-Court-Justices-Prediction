County of Sacramento v. Lewis

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1337, the County of Sacramento v. Teri Lewis and Thomas Lewis. 
    Mr. Cassidy.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="9.346" stopTime="53.047">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Deputy Smith is entitled to qualified immunity in this case on the grounds that the law regarding substantive due process claims under the Fourteenth Amendment was not clearly established at the time of the police pursuit in this case in May of 1990. 
    In that regard, the legal standard was not sufficiently well-developed, nor were the factual contours of such a claim developed so as to put a reasonable officer in the position of Deputy Smith on notice of what type of conduct would constitute a violation of substantive due process in the context of a police pursuit.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="53.047" stopTime="96.615">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    May I ask you a question right at the start, please, Mr. Cassidy? 
    The County of Sacramento apparently takes the position that a substantive due process violation does arise from a negligently conducted police chase of someone. 
    I mean, you don't raise the question whether there is a substantive due process violation at all. 
    You apparently assume there is, and then just want us to decide what standard to apply. 
    Do I understand correctly that's your position on behalf of the county?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="96.615" stopTime="102.810">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Justice O'Connor, no, we do not concede that a negligent claim would support a violation of substantive due process. 
    In fact, we have--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="102.810" stopTime="119.529">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, do you concede that on the facts in this case, the police pursuit case before us, that the only inquiry is what standard to apply, because there would be a substantive due process violation?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="119.529" stopTime="138.783">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    --The petitioners in this case have asserted that the proper question presented is whether or not... what... the proper legal standard to be applied in a claim for substantive due process. 
    There are amici briefs which have asserted that no claim lies in this case because of the accidental nature of the conduct involved.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="138.783" stopTime="141.245">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But that's not the position taken by the county.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="141.245" stopTime="152.140">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Upon reflection, I would agree with that position as asserted by amici. 
    However, it had not been asserted in the lower court or by us in our briefing.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="152.140" stopTime="177.799">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So what am I supposed to do? 
    I mean, you give me two options, that it's a substantive due process violation if it's... if it shocks the conscience, or if it's grossly negligent conduct. 
    What if I think none of the above?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="177.799" stopTime="180.441">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Justice Scalia--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="180.441" stopTime="186.575">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Do I pick grossly negligent conduct because that's the closest to not having a substantive due process violation at all?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="186.575" stopTime="206.898">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    --Well, no, Your Honor. 
    We would respectfully submit that in the event this Court determines to adopt the type of approach it did in Albright v. Oliver and determine that all claims perhaps involving a seizure fall within the Fourth Amendment standards, then there would be no claim available under the Fourteenth Amendment.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="206.898" stopTime="217.274">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I certainly thought that's what this case was about when I first read about its facts. 
    I mean, we've had a number of cases involving police chases and they always come up as unreasonable seizure cases.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="217.274" stopTime="218.065">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    And I would--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="218.065" stopTime="239.298">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Lo and behold, I read this thing and it's somehow a substantive due process violation put in a whole different category of constitutional analysis, and the city just goes along with that. 
    Is there any case on record in which somebody has asserted that something like this... a court has held that something of this sort is a substantive due process violation?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="239.298" stopTime="254.369">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    --I believe that the courts of appeal have analyzed the case law involving police pursuits under substantive due process violations, or alleged violations, but if this Court then looks--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="254.369" stopTime="256.069">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Certainly nothing in this Court has.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="256.069" stopTime="291.482">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    --Correct, and if this Court were to look at the recent Mays opinion out of the Seventh Circuit, perhaps, and upon reflection by petitioners we would submit that that may be the correct analysis. 
    If only the Fourth Amendment were to apply in this case, then there would be no violation because, in fact, the means that were used to... or were involved in this accident were not intentionally applied, so there was no seizure. 
    So if this Court is left to analyze it under the Albright analysis, then there would be no violation. 
    Petitioner would prevail.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="291.482" stopTime="308.983">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I certainly... you know, you cannot expand the First Amendment, for example, by saying, well, this doesn't violate any of our First Amendment law, however, we think this was a deprivation of liberty under the Due Process Clause, apart from the First Amendment. 
    We wouldn't hear something like that.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="308.983" stopTime="310.716">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="310.716" stopTime="311.754">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why should we do it for the Fourth?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="311.754" stopTime="342.706">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Upon reflection, petitioners would submit that it should not be so expanded, and that perhaps the analysis by this Court in DeShaney v. Winnebago is the correct analysis, that in fact, if this Court were to allow the claim for substantive due process to go forward, it would substantially disrupt the political process. 
    As this Court's noted in DeShaney as well as in the recent Collins decision and the Washington v. Glucksberg, the political process is extremely important to allow the States to develop the appropriate law.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="342.706" stopTime="387.797">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But could you not have a high speed chase that wouldn't involve the Fourth Amendment? 
    For example, think back to the days of the Freedom Riders. 
    Suppose there had been State police involved in just following these people on the road to terrorize them for mile after mile, not for the purpose of seizing them for arrest, but to frighten them. 
    Couldn't that be an appropriate situation for a due process rather than a Fourth Amendment approach?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="387.797" stopTime="428.262">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Justice Ginsburg, although that specific type of circumstance has not been decided by this Court, the Fifth Circuit in the Checki v. Webb case did take that approach, and therein lies the basis for the analysis that potentially there could be such a claim. 
    However, I think that what that demonstrates is the fact that in the context of qualified immunity Deputy Smith could not have known, as a reasonable officer in the field, what type of standards should be applied not only at the present time but back in May of 1990, when this pursuit occurred.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="428.262" stopTime="454.238">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, do you... if we assume for the sake of argument that this is properly a substantive due process case and not a Fourth Amendment case, are we supposed to take the case on the assumption that on at least one of the two alternative standards that has been proposed here there is a substantive due process violation? 
    That seems to be the assumption of the State's position, but I may be wrong.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="454.238" stopTime="464.376">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    No. 
    I believe there was no violation of substantive due process, regardless of which standard may be adopted by this Court.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="464.376" stopTime="477.927">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So it's not merely a question of, he didn't know which. 
    We may assume that in fact it would be findable today that there is no substantive due process violation, even assuming that this is a substantive due process case.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="477.927" stopTime="485.069">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Well, 1), if you assume--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="485.069" stopTime="503.773">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Because usually we don't get wrapped around problems of qualified immunity unless we are at least assuming that now there's a violation, so that's why I want to know whether you are conceding that now, on at least one of these standards, there would be a substantive due process violation.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="503.773" stopTime="516.091">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    --No, we are not. 
    If the Court determines to reach the issue and make a determination as to what the proper legal standard is, petitioners do not concede, under either standard that has been posited, that in fact there may have been a violation.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="516.091" stopTime="526.219">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I suppose you take the position that there was... a) there was no violation, but b) if you should find a violation, there was nonetheless qualified immunity.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="526.219" stopTime="527.728">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="527.728" stopTime="547.681">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why wasn't this case disposed of on the basis of qualified immunity? 
    I think our cases have said that the courts should make that inquiry first before they move on to decide the constitutional questions, and even if this is a substantive due process violation, it's surely a brand new one, isn't it?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="547.681" stopTime="747.543">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Well, in fact, Justice Scalia, petitioners would heartily agree, and in fact the district court did dispose of this matter on behalf of Deputy Smith with respect to the qualified immunity issue, and we believe correctly did so. 
    We believe that the Ninth Circuit's analysis rejects this Court's prior teachings in Harlow and Malley v. Briggs and determines that, under this very gray area of conduct that is sufficiently egregious, that somehow an officer, in the context of the rubric of the Fourteenth Amendment, should have known that his conduct may violate a constitutional right, and we believe that this case should have been disposed of on qualified immunity grounds. 
    In fact, in the recent Linear case, which analogizes to the qualified immunity context, this Court specifically pointed out that when the case law leaves open the general rule to be applied, then it's necessary that there be a very high degree of factual particularity in order to overcome that immunity. 
    In the context of a police pursuit that occurred in May of 1990, no such factual particularity was present. 
    There were several cases that had analyzed this issue. 
    However, in those cases, excepting the Checki v. Webb case, there were no violations found, and only in Checki was there some suggestion there may have been a violation. 
    But circumstances in that case law had involved excessive speeds, traveling too closely, failing to activate lights and sirens, failing to call in by radio, alleged violations of departmental policies, alleged violations of State law, all of which had resulted in a finding of no liability, so certainly the factual contours were not sufficiently developed in May of 1990 to provide and put a reasonable officer on notice that he could be held liable. 
    But in the Malley case, this Court points out that, specifically, if reasonable officers could disagree as to whether there may have been a violation, then the immunity applies, and petitioners respectfully submit that in fact that's exactly what occurred in this case. 
    Reasonable officers could certainly disagree as to whether there was some potential for liability in May of 1990 arising out of the facts and circumstances of this case and the context of alleged violation of substantive due process, and on that basis petitioners respectfully request that this Court find that there was qualified immunity that Deputy Smith is entitled to, and therefore petitioners prevail. 
    If this Court proceeds to analyze what the proper legal standard is with respect to an alleged violation of substantive due process, then petitioners respectfully submit that the standard should be one that is either arbitrary or shocks the conscience. 
    In that regard, I think it's important to look at the policy considerations which may be affected. 
    Specifically, there should be deference given to the political process and the nature of the interests involved in the type of case in the circumstance or in the context of a police pursuit. 
    There's also the impact--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="747.543" stopTime="755.157">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask, on the political process, is it correct that in California the officers are immune for this kind of conduct, even if it's... no matter how gross?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="755.157" stopTime="765.265">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    --You are correct, Justice Stevens, in that the individual officer is immune. 
    However, the entity may be held liable under appropriate circumstances.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="765.265" stopTime="767.947">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In other words, the city might be held liable.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="767.947" stopTime="768.267">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="768.267" stopTime="771.319">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    On a respondeat superior type of approach, or--
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="771.319" stopTime="812.916">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    That's correct. 
    However, they leave the individual officer out of the context of that civil liability, and there is a specific statutory scheme which has been adopted by California that not only allows for the potential for a municipality to be liable in the context of a Code 3 emergent vehicle operation, but also specifically the legislature has adopted a statute that encourages departments in California to adopt an appropriate police or law enforcement agency policy regarding pursuits so as to potentially avoid liability if the accident results from the vehicle operated by the suspect.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="812.916" stopTime="817.951">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Now, in this case did the plaintiff sue the county, too?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="817.951" stopTime="818.412">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="818.412" stopTime="819.081">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    On State law grounds?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="819.081" stopTime="819.551">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="819.551" stopTime="820.022">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="820.022" stopTime="884.494">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    And a portion of that was dismissed at the district court level and a portion of that was reserved, specifically whether or not the county of Sacramento would be immune from liability under the vehicle code section that provides for the adoption of an appropriate pursuit policy as well as the issue of whether or not it was an accident that resulted from the operation of the suspect's vehicle in this case. 
    I think that if the less stringent standard is adopted by the Court in this case, then it will effectively remove this type of claim from the political process. 
    This type of claim is appropriate to be resolved by the States in adopting their State tort laws. 
    Specifically, the persons directly affected, whether it be the... in the category of suspects or in the category of innocent bystanders, it is clear that the States and those bystanders, being the very electorate that affect the laws of the State, should have a say in whether or not there should be recovery.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="884.494" stopTime="907.430">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, of course, we don't ordinarily say that if there's... when we're trying to interpret a provision of the Constitution that the public ought to have some input on it. 
    I mean, certainly we hear argument and we try to figure out what those who adopted that provision may mean, but we don't generally say that, let's hear what the people have to say about it.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="907.430" stopTime="946.015">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    But indirectly, Mr. Chief Justice, we do that through our State legislatures, and that is precisely what this Court has looked to to see whether or not States would adopt and should adopt appropriate laws to govern these types of situations, and that's what the Court referred to in Collins, directing to leave this to the area of the local representatives, rather than an interpretation of the charter of the Government for this entire country. 
    Then it becomes a judicial interpretation as opposed to a political interpretation.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="946.015" stopTime="967.520">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But I think Collins first evaluated whether or not there was a substantive due process violation and said no, and said, therefore this is left to the political process. 
    I mean, I think you first have to do your reasoning on the constitutional point, then the result may be that it's left to the political process.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="967.520" stopTime="990.717">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    I understood that was the analysis in the Collins case. 
    However, we would respect that there should be some deference given to the State political process as explored in the DeShaney decision, because that is important to determine whether this Court will expand its interpretation of claims for substantive violations of due process.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="990.717" stopTime="1041.550">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, we do it if we first conclude that it is not arbitrary, that whatever the State action was that caused the injury was not arbitrary in the sense of just being beyond the realm of reason as something the State might choose to do, or a governmental actor might choose to do. 
    Is it your argument here... I take it ultimately it is... that you simply cannot say that a high speed chase, assuming there is cause to apprehend in the first place, is so totally beyond the realm of reasonable conduct addressing a legitimate governmental object as ever to fall within that arbitrary character. 
    Is that your position?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="1041.550" stopTime="1050.845">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Well, I believe that the initiation and continuing of high speed pursuits are not arbitrary, at least in most circumstances.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1050.845" stopTime="1059.980">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    They may be unwise, but they are not, as it were, so totally beyond the realm of reason as to rise to the level of a substantive due process violation.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="1059.980" stopTime="1070.719">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    I believe that's correct. 
    There is a rational purpose, more often than not, I think, in the substantial number of police pursuits that allow for those pursuits to take place.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1070.719" stopTime="1115.228">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Now, how do you distinguish those... and I... I know I'm mixing apples and oranges here, but how do you distinguish those, your position there from the analysis that occurs in an unreasonable force situation under the Fourth Amendment? 
    Why is... why can we not say, let's say in unreasonable force cases that, sure, the force is always directed to the consummation of a legitimate governmental object, which is the apprehension of the suspect, or the person for whom there is a warrant. 
    Why don't we in effect dismiss all of those cases on the same analysis?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="1115.228" stopTime="1140.113">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Well, because I believe that, in terms of the Bill of Rights and specifically the Fourth Amendment, that those are directed toward guaranteeing certain minimal levels of safety, whereas the Fourteenth Amendment is essentially the residual provision. 
    It's a limitation on State powers as opposed to the guarantees that would fall within the Fourth Amendment, and--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1140.113" stopTime="1160.717">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But would it be fair to say that the force cases are all cases in which there can be, or could have been, or was an apprehension in the first place, and it's clear that by no stretch of the imagination was the force necessary to accomplish the object? 
    Would that be a fair characterization?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="1160.717" stopTime="1162.309">

    Justice David H. Souter 
    And in this case it isn't correct to say that by no stretch of the imagination the speed was unnecessary to catch the person. 
    Is that the distinction?

    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    That's correct. 
    We believe that the logical extension of shocks the conscience, in terms of the framework of defining such a claim, would be that of the language previously adopted by Judge Friendly in Johnson v. Glick, whether in fact there was conduct on the part of an officer that was malicious or sadistic for the very purpose of causing harm, and only in those circumstances could there potentially be a claim asserted for a violation of substantive due process in the context of a police pursuit.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Why couldn't there... so I'm thinking about it possibly a little differently, some things that you say. 
    There is a category of cases where Government officials deprive a person of life. 
    They're police officers, and most, but not all of those fall under the Fourth Amendment. 
    That's one category.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="1348.390" stopTime="1348.901">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Correct.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1348.901" stopTime="1388.356">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And there's a second category where they behave in ways that shock the conscience. 
    That's a second category, not the first. 
    Then there's possibly a third category that Justice Ginsburg mentioned where you could have conduct, perhaps it's rare, but someone who's not a policeman, someone who doesn't behave in a way that shocks the conscience, but nonetheless either negligently, recklessly, or intentionally deprives a person of his life. 
    Now, that might be covered by the Fourteenth Amendment, mightn't it? 
    I mean, at least where someone intentionally deprives a person of his life.

    Well--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What should the standard be there? 
    Maybe it wasn't a policeman. 
    Maybe it was a health officer. 
    I don't know who it was. 
    But what should the standard be in that third category of cases? 
    Would you say it never violates the Constitution to intentionally deprive a person of his life without justification? 
    Would you say, reckless? 
    Would you say, negligent? 
    Does it depend on whether the State provides an adequate tort remedy, so that the process is okay, or not okay? 
    What's the standard in that third area? 
    That's what I'm not certain about, which is why I asked.

speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="1465.217" stopTime="1529.319">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    --That may also be a claim under the Fourth Amendment, because that person effected a seizure of that party. 
    If it's a nonpolice officer it may not be, but that... it's our position that that gray area... the Fourth Amendment would handle the claims for alleged unreasonable seizures of the person. 
    The Fourteenth Amendment, as petitioners have proposed, should be limited to only those claims that involve conduct that shocks the conscience. 
    Any other areas should be covered by the State tort law and the political process in the States to adopt the appropriate tort remedies as the legislatures in the States see fit. 
    A good example of that is all of the statistical data that was submitted to this Court in the context of police pursuits. 
    This Court should not, certainly, be forced to wade through all of those statistical statistics in order to make its decision in this case. 
    However, the States are in the position to assess what statistical data is appropriate and to determine what remedies should be invoked, and with that, Mr. Chief Justice, I would--

    The individual who is killed in this case represents almost an innocent bystander, because he's on the back of a motor cycle, but at the time that he was actually killed he was standing in the middle of the street, because he had stepped off the motor cycle.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, if you... if, as you say, you can persuade a jury that the police officer just did this intentionally, as Justice Scalia says, you will win under any standard. 
    But the Ninth Circuit didn't analyze it as if that were the case. 
    It analyzed it as if it were gross negligence.

    Mr. Paul J. Hedlund

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Well, he wished that, and he wasn't exactly an innocent bystander.

    The only evidence is that Officer Stapp saw lights go on, and he was below the car, and at an angle. 
    He was faced in this direction. 
    He looked over his shoulder. 
    The boy... the boys at one time, he says, or another, looked at him and then proceeded off. 
    He immediately turned his car in a three point turn and proceeded out at a high rate of speed.

    Mr. Paul J. Hedlund 
    At that point... I asked him specifically, because, he said, they accelerated away quickly, and I said, what does that mean, you... oh, at a high rate of speed, he said. 
    At a high rate of speed, they went. 
    This is a 1976 Honda motor cycle that had just been worked on and finally fixed so it could even run, and he says, well, that means they accelerated quickly to the speed limit and then beyond. 
    The truth... when you see, as I have, the testimony of Officer Smith, everything in his testimony smacks of this incredible callous indifference, and this incredible hostility for an incident that was really created beforehand which, he came out of... he and the other officer came out of a house dispute which was... turned nasty, and he got back in his car... Stapp himself, all he heard was the revving of a motor cycle. 
    He assumed that the revving of the motor cycle meant something, perhaps that the motor cycle was going fast.

    Actually, in fact, the agreement here was that Mr. Lewis asked Brian Willard to stop and pull over on Orangevale, which is where the accident happened. 
    Now, of course, what will happen eventually is either they will show that he's either participating or, when we get to the negligence claim, if we ever get to there, they will say, well, then he was partially negligent for asking him to stop right in the middle of the road.

    It also removes any question of whether the person fleeing didn't know he was fleeing from an officer trying to make an arrest.

    Mr. Paul J. Hedlund 
    Yes. 
    The person fleeing was Brian Willard, the driver of the motor cycle, and the--

    It still bears upon the guilt of the police officer whether the police officer reasonably continued the chase.

    It may not make your client any more guilty, but it certainly makes the police officer more reasonable in continuing the pursuit, knowing that the person sees the police lights, hears the siren, and is fleeing.

    --Well, the problem that we have in all of these, and one of the things that we see constantly in the petitioner's briefs and the amicus briefs on his behalf is that there is a justification because you might catch other people. 
    Or one of the amicus briefs, he even goes so far as to say that a person who has such contempt or disregard for law and order and law enforcement officials, that the removal of that person from society serves a valuable function. 
    I... you know, I can't imagine the kind of transgression on fundamental constitutional rights that is envisioned by that statement, and nor can I envision what practical result is going to occur when the things discovered after the chase actually give reason for the chase to begin with. 
    That's like saying if we went into everyone's homes we find a lot of people have done crimes. 
    That's not what this country is about. 
    That's not what the Constitution is about.

    Oh, but presumably most citizens know that if they violate the traffic laws and a police car attempts to stop them they should stop and yield to the authority. 
    I mean, most of us understand that.

    Mr. Paul J. Hedlund 
    That's exactly true. 
    Most of us understand that you shouldn't murder someone, but the problem is that there are certain situations, most of the time murders, and most of the time fleeing occurs because for some reason or another... it's a kid, it's somebody who just makes a decision that's irrational. 
    Most people stop.

    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I think there is a simple remedy in that case... in this case, and that is, to pull over and stop and yield to lawful authority. 
    It's the criminal that initiates the reckless conduct and endangers the public. 
    The law enforcement officer is simply trying to apprehend the suspect and uphold his duties of office. 
    In this case--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Cassidy, I did want to call to your attention one thing. 
    You, on page... is it 20 of your brief +/? 
    you refer to the decisions of Evans and Temkin, and you say that this Court... well, you tell me what... you said the Court had implicitly approved of the court of appeals' decisions in those cases.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="3455.962" stopTime="3469.359">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    --Only to the extent the issues presented on the petitions for the writ before this Court were exactly the same question presented in the reverse, and this Court declined hearing--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3469.359" stopTime="3473.994">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is a denial of certiorari an implicit approval of anything?
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="3473.994" stopTime="3483.929">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    --No, certainly not authority, Your Honor, but some indication that this Court has approved of that analysis as opposed to this Court's... the Ninth Circuit's analysis in this case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3483.929" stopTime="3491.015">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Gee, I hope not. 
    I have voted to deny certiorari in a lot of cases whose analysis I don't approve of.
speaker="terence_j_cassidy" startTime="3491.015" stopTime="3626.763">
    Mr. Terence J. Cassidy 
    Accepted, Your Honor. 
    Quickly, petitioners would prevail because there was no Fourth Amendment claim in this case, so even if this Court were to determine that the Fourth Amendment applied, not only was there no seizure in this case, but no Fourth Amendment claim was asserted. 
    In terms of the factual circumstances, petitioners respectfully submit Deputy Smith was acting appropriately, and that in fact Mr. Lewis did initiate and cause Mr. Willard to proceed and flee from Deputy Smith. 
    Mr. Willard admitted in deposition that he knew Deputy Smith was trying to stop him initially and during the course of the pursuit and if, in fact, this pursuit was coming to a conclusion because these two individuals decided to stop, you don't yield to lawful authority in the middle of the road. 
    The simple fact of the matter is, they crashed the motor cycle in the middle of the road, because had they made good their left-hand turn about a 150 feet down the road or so there's a barrier that would not let police vehicles through but the motor cycle would make good its escape. 
    I think there is a valid justification in the fact that pursuits are conducted and oftentimes result in finding suspects who have committed more serious crimes, and I think that's an important policy consideration that this Court should look to. 
    In addition, with all the discussion we've had here today, petitioners would respectfully submit that it seems clear that Deputy Smith is entitled to qualified immunity on the grounds that the law was clearly not established sufficiently in May of 1990 to hold Deputy Smith liable. 
    Moreover, if this Court determines that there is potentially a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, then we would submit the appropriate legal standard is conduct that shocks the conscience, and Collins is controlling. 
    The cases which fall in between the cracks, so to speak, are those to be left for the States to decide. 
    That's specifically the type of policy choices that should be made by the people of the various States through their local representatives, but should not be thrust upon them by the judicial expansion of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Thank you. 
    With that, submitted.
