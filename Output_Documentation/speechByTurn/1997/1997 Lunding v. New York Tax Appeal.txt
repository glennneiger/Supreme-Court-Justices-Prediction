    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In calendar year 1990 I was a lawyer practicing law in the City of New York and residing some 38 miles from my office in the State of Connecticut, some 9,000 feet, plus or minus, over the State border. 
    It is something I did not think of when I moved to the State of Connecticut that I would be here today on my on behalf, challenging a statute of the State of New York as discriminating against me as a nonresident in taxation.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    A little less than 2 miles over the State line, Your Honor, into Connecticut.

    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Right.

    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --No, it does not, Your Honor. 
    I do not urge that the distance from the State line is legally relevant in this case. 
    What is legally relevant, though, is the question of the constitutionality of New York State tax law 631(b)(6), which entirely denies--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, you don't argue, do you, or maybe you do, that in apportioning this income for people who work full or part-time in New York, that New York has to allow personal deductions of various kinds to out-of-State residents, do you? 
    I mean, deductions that don't relate to the production of income in New York?
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="155.753" stopTime="157.894">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --Well--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="157.894" stopTime="169.842">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Let's talk about that kind of deduction. 
    It doesn't relate to the production of your income in New York. 
    Now, does New York have to worry about personal deductions of that kind?
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="169.842" stopTime="258.570">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --Well, the money is fungible, Justice O'Connor, and a substantial portion of my income and a much more substantial person... portion of other taxpayers' nonresident-in-New York income is earned in the State of New York. 
    I think there could be made a persuasive argument that, because of that, it is a requirement of the Privileges and Immunities Clause that nonresidents be allowed to take deductions in proportion that their New York income bears to their total income for personal expense items. 
    It is not necessary to reach that point in this case, and that's particularly because the nature of alimony is very different from the nature of other personal expense items in several respects. 
    In the first respect, in the State of Connecticut, as well as in other States, the amount of alimony is based, must be based upon the payor's total income from all sources. 
    Inevitably... one case so holding is Wanatowitz v. Wanatowitz, which is found in 533 A. 2d. 
    Because of that, inevitably in the setting of the amount of the alimony my New York income was taken into account. 
    So that's point number 1. 
    There's a direct connection there between the alimony and my New York income which is not present if it were a charitable deduction, or a real estate tax, or any number of--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="258.570" stopTime="274.130">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Couldn't you say, too, that you couldn't afford a very nice house in Connecticut which perhaps you have if you didn't make a good deal of money in New York, and therefore that New York ought to allow your property tax in Connecticut to be deducted?
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="274.130" stopTime="294.505">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --That may be true, but it wouldn't... but the property tax would not be determined based upon my New York income in part. 
    That's the difference I'm articulating here. 
    Alimony specifically is determined on the basis of total income. 
    Property taxes are determined on the basis of the value of the real estate in question, and therefore not so clearly connected to--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="294.505" stopTime="304.240">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but that would be true even... supposing your divorce took place while you were getting all your income in Connecticut, and then you later started to practice in New York and had the same alimony, would that make it a different case?

    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --Well, we--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="306.682" stopTime="313.976">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You're relying on the fact that your alimony is partially determined by your New York income, but we'd have the same case before us if that were not the fact.
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="313.976" stopTime="331.156">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --Right. 
    I believe I must say that that is correct, and it's because this statute has as its unitary basis for discrimination nonresidents and no other factor. 
    It is, of course, true that only that factor is really before this Court, and to some degree all other elements are extraneous.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="331.156" stopTime="349.939">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, I'm not sure that that's the way the State of New York would see it. 
    Won't... wouldn't they say we're not discriminating based solely on residence, we're discriminating based on (a) nonresidents, and (b) the fact that this particular deduction was not related to the earning of income in New York?

    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --Let me go back and state the analysis here under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. 
    The first element is, is this statute discriminatory against nonresidents. 
    There's a two-prong test. 
    I will answer your question, but in a long way, if I may. 
    The first test is to be satisfied is, is this statute discriminatory? 
    Well, this statute is discriminatory. 
    It has one sole, unique, intentional purpose, which is to discriminate against nonresidents by denying this particular adjustment to income. 
    That element is satisfied in this case. 
    The State of New York is unclear actually on that point, but objectively we certainly assert that it's satisfied.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="400.693" stopTime="402.743">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Lunding, let me ask you about that.
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="402.743" stopTime="403.024">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Yes.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="403.024" stopTime="411.129">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Because I had always thought of alimony as an income-splitting between the payor and the ex-spouse.
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="411.129" stopTime="412.011">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="412.011" stopTime="446.693">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Now, I could see, if you were presenting us with a situation where what... New York lets you deduct the tax to your ex-spouse so that New York gets the tax on that amount of money that you earned in New York, but you would like to take the deduction while on the income side, if there is any income, it is to the exspouse, who is a Connecticut residence, so it seems to me you say, let me take the sweet and New York will be stuck with the bitter.
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="446.693" stopTime="489.411">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Well, I would not agree with that conclusion, Your Honor, but I would point out this about the nature of alimony. 
    The statute calls alimony a deduction, and we... we're talking about personal deductions here. 
    Alimony is not really a deduction at all. 
    For Federal purposes and for New York purposes it is an adjustment to income, meaning it is... and it is taken out of the income of the payor, transferred to... functionally the responsibility to pay tax transferred to the income of the payee, or the recipient for tax purposes. 
    On your Federal return that's the way it works, and if you're a resident in New York that's the way it works, and that's irrespective of where the recipient lives.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="489.411" stopTime="489.952">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes.
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="489.952" stopTime="490.551">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Right.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="490.551" stopTime="494.815">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And in the Federal union that's fine, because the IRS is going to get it either way.
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="494.815" stopTime="495.065">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Right.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="495.065" stopTime="501.429">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    The husband or the wife, it could be, deducts it, and the one who receives it pays income on it.
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="501.429" stopTime="501.978">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Right.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="501.978" stopTime="511.644">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But when you're in one State and you're dealing with nonresidents, in the generality of cases if you have a marital situation it's in the State of their residence.
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="511.644" stopTime="512.105">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Yes.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="512.105" stopTime="541.945">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So one State is going to get the income to tax, the other State is not going to get that tax, so there seems an imbalance there, and my only question is, why is it a violation of Privileges and Immunities to say that when New York doesn't get the chance to tax the one who's getting the money, getting the alimony, it shouldn't have to give a deduction to the one who's paying it?
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="541.945" stopTime="612.571">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Well, my point there was, if I had been a resident of New York there would have been an adjustment in which I would have been absolved entirely for the tax on the alimony amount, and it would have been transferred to my spouse. 
    Now, the New York statute doesn't require for that operation for a resident that the spouse live in New York. 
    The spouse could live anywhere in the world, and if the spouse did not live in New York there would be no tax captured by New York on any part of that transferred income, so this is really, I believe, a factor which is not a motivating factor for New York, and if you look at it in terms of the incidence of the tax as to residence, it apparently is completely irrelevant in the economic analysis. 
    In the case of nonresidents, in any event the residence of the recipient is also irrelevant. 
    The statute doesn't say, which it could, if the recipient lives in New York, and therefore we tax that money in New York, we let you off the hook, Connecticut taxpayer. 
    It hits everybody. 
    This is... these are another example of extraneous elements that are not really involved here, where the only basis for discrimination is nonresidence and everything else is--

    Does New York have to treat residents precisely the same as nonresidents in every category of taxation?
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="625.841" stopTime="638.838">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --Well, Austin v. New Hampshire teaches us that New York has to treat nonresidents under a rule of substantial equality of treatment, and--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="638.838" stopTime="654.119">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Can that substantial equality of treatment be based on a theory that the income... pardon me, that the deduction or the adjustment must be related to the income that's earned in New York, and income-producing activities in New York?
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="654.119" stopTime="695.195">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --As regards personal expenses, the answer is no, because money being fungible, as a practical matter, looking at the actual, practical impact of the tax, which is the method of analysis, not labels, not anything else, but the actual practical impact, there is a discrimination here. 
    There is a higher tax paid by nonresidents than by residents. 
    It is not insubstantial in this instance or in any other, and it is much worse in the case of people with proportionately greater New York-source income in proportion to the whole, and therefore New York may not, the petitioners urge, distinguish between the two in the manner that this statute does.

    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --Or... well, it would be... yes, that is correct, and the amount of course, would vary according to how much alimony, and in proportion to the total income, but in that scenario the amount which would be paid by the nonresident in New York tax would be greater than the amount that would be paid by a resident of New York. 
    I mean, in whole dollars, not in proportion to anything.

    I frankly don't remember. 
    But that's ball park, and it is progressive, and they do tax... they do take into account in setting the rate worldwide income, and that could be another basis upon which it could be said as a matter of the Privileges and Immunities Clause that they also must allow some proportion of worldwide deductions, whatever they may be, or adjustments, because strictly speaking alimony is not a deduction, not subject, for example, to the Federal limit on deductions, but an income transfer, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out.

    Well, the actual effect in any particular case will, of course, vary according to the personal circumstances, where the receiving ex-spouse lives and many other factors, but the effect of this statute in all cases compared to the situation if the statute were not there will be to discriminate against nonresident taxpayers who pay alimony, because this reduction in their income, taxable income, will obviously discriminate.

    The tax rate in New York is... I don't remember, 8 or 9 percent. 
    The deduction in Connecticut is at the rate in Connecticut, and therefore there still is something left over to be discriminatory on that regime, 4-1/2 percent, whatever it is, the difference between the marginal rates in the two States, but--

    --Well, that... and in any event, that is not the... yes, that's correct, but the issue in the privileges &amp; immunities context, in light of Austin v.

    That is part of what the case says, and therefore I would not agree that there is a... in this context a greater degree of latitude than in others. 
    In fact, in the taxing area petitioners would argue that this is a case where a substantially heightened scrutiny is required, a rule of substantial equality is required, and it is our position that it has not been met in this instance.

    Well, the only criterion that needs to be addressed... well, I guess I under... I'll answer the question in two parts. 
    The only criterion that needs to be addressed in this case is evidently whether alimony as an adjustment, and I've stated the unique aspects of that, so--

    If that's all we do, then we're going to have another case on the next item, and another case on the next item.

    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    --Well, the simple principle view... the simple principle view is that when you're talking about taxes which fall by their terms upon personal service income... and this is a personal income tax in New York. 
    That's the label that goes on it. 
    That's what it taxes, my personal individual income in New York. 
    When the State wishes to tax a nonresident's personal income, the bright line rule would be that if there are personal deductions, no matter what they are, or adjustments, such as alimony, no matter what they are, then they must be allowed in the proportion that the New York State income bears to total income, period.

    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Well, responding to Justice Scalia, the bright line rule which will avoid what... the problem he foresees is to just say, if you tax personal income, you must give all personal deductions that the State gives to its own residents in the proportion that the income in that State bears to total income.

    New York has a rule, which was stated in a case called Martin v. Lavine, L-a-v-i-n-e, in 1976 and elsewhere, including in the intermediate appellate court in Brady v. State, that when a tax statute is challenged in New York, generally speaking, you cannot have a representative action.

    It favors... well, it... well, I think the standard under Austin v.

    There are no reasons for it which are cognizable, and accordingly it's a rather simple matter that this particular exaction and the statute which gives rise to it is unconstitutional.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Lunding, I, too would like to have, if not a bright line rule, at least a bright line principle, and I have this reservation about the one that you suggested. 
    You suggest a line to be drawn essentially between personal expenses and... or deductions and business deductions, deductions for the production of income in the other State. 
    My reservation comes for this reason. 
    You also suggested, and I thought with some cogency, that because New York takes into consideration worldwide income when the rate is set, therefore, New York ought to take into consideration worldwide deductions.
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="1607.940" stopTime="1608.689">

    Yes.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I thought our test was something along the following lines, that a statute that discriminates against nonresidents must be justified by a substantial reason for the discrimination against the nonresidents, beyond the mere fact that they're citizens of another State. 
    What do you think the reason is that's offered by New York here, and is it substantial?
speaker="christopher_h_lunding" startTime="1733.852" stopTime="1792.219">
    Mr. Christopher H. Lunding 
    Well, there are two reasons. 
    One is that there exists untaxed income, meaning they can't reach it because of the Due Process Clause under Shaffer v. Carter, and for that reason they're free to discriminate as they please, which is their actual position as regards personal deductions, adjustments, or whatever. 
    That part of the position is foreclosed by Travis v. Yale &amp; Towne, which says because the statute does not condition its discrimination on the existence of untaxed income, whether that exists or not is irrelevant to the constitutionality of the statute on its face, so that reason number 1, Travis takes out. 
    The only other reason that... well, my colleague will speak for himself, but the only other reason that I foresee here is the lack of connection argument which we've been talking about for most of this oral argument, and we allege that there is a sufficient connection and obvious connection, and that therefore this statute is unconstitutional on its face-- 
    If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder... well, I have no time remaining.

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is really whether New York is required by the Privileges and Immunities Clause to afford nonresidents an alimony deduction because it affords the same alimony deduction to residents. 
    In New York's view, New York is not so required because the basis upon which New York taxes residents and nonresidents is completely different. 
    New York's taxation of residents is based on the fact that they reside within New York, residence giving New York plenary jurisdiction over their income from every source worldwide. 
    With respect to nonresidents, the basis of New York's taxation is that nonresidents--

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    --That is correct, Justice Scalia. 
    Residence also affords the State an opportunity to take into account certain personal activities of its residents that it is not in our view required to take into account for purposes of nonresidents, and under the Privileges and Immunities Clause absolute equality of treatment has never been the hallmark.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2088.536" stopTime="2223.507">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But absolute equality of treatment, I found it awfully easy to construct bizarre examples. 
    That is, I just imagined a person at $100,000 income, all out of New York, and $50,000 alimony, and all you have to do is, you multiply by 4 percent, and that person is paying, what, 4 percent times 50,000 I guess is $2,000, and then apply your formula, and your formula will be [dollar]s 100,000, the total income, over Federal, minus the alimony, which will be 50, so you get a multiple of 2, and so you have the New York person paying 2,000, the Connecticut person paying 4,000. 
    And if, by the way, the person had a bad year, and his income went down to where it was close to the judicial decree for alimony, suppose he had 100,000, his alimony was 90, you're going to get results that are going to be phenomenal. 
    I mean, what will happen is the New York person on [dollars] 1,000 will pay... let's say, if it's 10 percent, they pay 1,000. 
    You'd have to multiply by a multiple of 10, and you would discover that the Connecticut resident has a $10,000 tax in New York, or if it's 8 percent, $8,000, and his real income is 10,000. 
    Am I wrong in those? 
    I mean, I just... all I did was apply the formula, you know. 
    I took the formula. 
    It says, he has [dollars] 100,000, he has 90,000 alimony. 
    For New York purposes, he has [dollars] 10,000 income. 
    He pays, let's say, 8 percent, or 10 percent. 
    That's [dollars] 1,000. 
    Then it says you're supposed to take the New York total, which is [dollars] 100,000, right, and then you have in the... that's the denominator, his Federal, but not counting alimony, so that's 10. 
    So 100 is 10 x 10, so you multiply 10 times the New York tax, and you discover you've got [dollars] 10,000 in tax. 
    Wow. 
    I mean, I could create, you know, worse ones, or I suppose there are a lot of better ones, but it seemed to me that it was pretty easy to create odd examples, and... which seem very unfair. 
    Now, am I wrong about the ease of doing that, or is there some justification for that, or is it just bizarre that a person would have, say, half his income in alimony and yet all of his income out of New York, or that he could have a bad year, or what?

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    Your mathematics are entirely correct, and your application of the formula are correct. 
    The justification for it that New York has offered is, I guess, twofold. 
    The first one, again, is this is exactly the result that is contemplated by this Court's decision in Shaffer and by this Court's decisions in the portion of Travis upon which we rely, and has been accepted--

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    --The taxpayer in Travis also specifically challenged a provision of the New York... then New York tax laws, section 360, subdivision 11, which permitted nonresidents the deductions available to residents only if and to the extent connected with New York income, and the taxpayer specifically challenged that provision in its brief in this Court arguing that it would, for example, disallow the Connecticut resident who worked in New York the deduction for his real property taxes while at the same time allowing the New York resident a deduction for the real property taxes on the New York residence.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2293.444" stopTime="2304.020">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Was it hypothetical, or was there something in the case, that this taxpayer said, I want a deduction for my real property tax or my life insurance premium and they're not giving it to me?
speaker="andrew_d_bing" startTime="2304.020" stopTime="2386.937">
    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    I believe that because of the posture of that case and because of who the taxpayer was that issue was hypothetical. 
    The taxpayer in this case was a Connecticut corporation that employed a number of Connecticut residents in New York as well as residents of other States and was challenging the entire personal income tax treatment of nonresidents, including personal exemptions, including the fact that it was required to withhold only with respect to nonresidents in this deduction provision. 
    So there were a number of provisions that were being challenged by the employer rather than by any particular taxpayer who was pointing to him or herself and saying, this tax adversely affects me this way, but that example was included within their brief, and I believe that that example was what this Court responded to when it said that the State is permitted to limit the deduction in the case of nonresidents to those expenses that are connected with the New York income, as settled by the Shaffer case. 
    I think they were referring to that particular contention of the taxpayer in the Travis case, and subsequent to Travis, this Court has repeatedly in summary dismissals in effect permitted States to recognize that the difference in tax treatment which is mandated by the Constitution, the fact that we can only reach the nonresident's State-source income, permits, justifies a State treating personal deductions differently in the case of nonresidents.

    You say personal deductions, so I gather that you are making the distinction between expenses for the production of income and personal expenses, and you are not relying to any extent on the peculiarity of alimony, that it is a two-way thing, one gets a deduction, the other gets income.

speaker="andrew_d_bing" startTime="2492.064" stopTime="2538.074">
    Mr. Andrew D. Bing

    First, we don't tax the nonresident with respect to anything that occurs outside New York, and in our view we are not required, as a result of that, to take into account with respect to the nonresident anything that is unrelated to the economic activity that that nonresident is doing within the State of New York. 
    Again, we're put in the posture of not being able to afford equality of treatment. 
    From the very beginning, this is not a case where New York has gone out of its way to single out nonresidents.

    But he's not asking for the entirety of the deduction. 
    He's only asking for a percentage of the deduction that is equivalent to the percentage of his total income which consists of New York income. 
    I mean, your answer would be a good one if he was coming in and saying, give me a full deduction, and you say, well, we can't tax you on your out-of-State and therefore we don't have to give you a deduction. 
    But he's saying, don't give me the whole deduction.

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    We don't dispute that that is a reasonable approach. 
    In fact, it's one that New York did follow between 1961 and 1987. 
    We do believe, however, that New York is not required to afford a proportionate deduction, and we believe that our rule is, in fact, a better rule because it recognizes that the alimony simply has nothing to do with where petitioner earns his income.

    The net effect of that is to increase his New York tax, because it makes the denominator so much bigger in your fraction.

    So that in a way his activities out of State... this is a second way in which activities out of State impact on the tax he pays in New York in kind of a perverse way, because if he's a very generous person, he'll end up with a higher New York tax.

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    It's because with respect to married people we don't allow income-splitting unless they're both residents.

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    Well, the treatment of marital income generally was addressed in '87, and at that time New York abolished the filing-separately-on-the-same-return status that married people had previously enjoyed and went to more or less full income-splitting for the first time, which is premised on the assumption that spouses share total marital income equally. 
    Again, that was the assumption underlying treatment of people who are still married to each other, and because alimony, as you pointed out, is a tax-shifting device rather than a true deduction, the treatment of alimony with respect to nonresidents was designed to bring it into congruence with the treatment of income-splitting for people who are still together, still married to each other.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    But there's the countervailing consideration, isn't there, in the fact pointed out by your brother that alimony is characteristically assessed on the basis of total income, and therefore there is a very strong relationship between the amount of alimony ordered and income earned in New York.
speaker="andrew_d_bing" startTime="2934.603" stopTime="2994.142">
    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    There is a relationship, but in our view the controlling standard is the one set forth by this court in the Gilmore case, which looks to the origin of the claim in characterizing an expense as personal or business under section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to marital dissolution. 
    In Gilmore, simply because the expenses were incurred to preserve and to protect the taxpayer's income-producing assets, it was not enough to give them a sufficient nexus to make them related under section 162 to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
    We argue the same standard ought to apply in a case like this, that the alimony in this case, related though it may have been to petitioner's... the amount of petitioner's worldwide income, including the New York-source income, was not incurred to produce that income, or incurred in carrying on the trade or business that generated that income, and that that should be the test with respect to alimony or any other personal expense.

    The deduction would not be allowed in computing New York-source income, that is correct, because it does not relate to the production of the New York-source income. 
    I guess I'd like to address the policy reason. 
    What is it about these personal deductions and about the nonresident status that seems to be... that justifies what we're doing, and again, we're not simply saying we're doing it because Shaffer and Travis and Goodwin and the others say we can. 
    We're doing it because we think it's perfectly reasonable, and it's entirely justified for New York to say with respect to nonresidents, all we have jurisdiction over regarding you is what you do here, your economic activity here, and that it's reasonable and permissible for us to say to those people, we will allow you deductions with respect to the production of the income, the net income from your economic activity.

    We'll tax you on your net income, but we're not going to let you take into account either losses or deductions arising from expenses in out-of-State businesses over which we have no jurisdiction, and we're also not going to take into account personal expenses that you may incur in your personal life in some other jurisdiction, even though with respect to people who reside in New York we will allow them. 
    New York has believed and continues to believe that that is a substantial justification and a legitimate reason for what New York has done in this case.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why aren't those personal expenses... I mean, if 20 percent of your income is from New York, why isn't 20 percent of those personal expenses fairly attributable to New York income? 
    I mean, you're sort of adopting the premise that all of your personal expenses come from non-New York State income. 
    That seems to me an unreasonable premise.

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    Again, we're not saying that the contention is... is being argued for in terms of this would be a reasonable approach is not true. 
    We're not saying it's an unreasonable approach, but we are saying that we don't think the Privileges and Immunities Clause--

    Requires--
speaker="andrew_d_bing" startTime="3205.714" stopTime="3265.120">
    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    --requires that absolute equality, or at least that percentage equality of treatment. 
    And again, these expense actions have nothing to do with where Mr. Lunding earned his income, and there really is no principle basis, other than just saying, well, 20 percent of the income, 20 percent of the deductions, for looking at what happened in Connecticut. 
    There's no reason for us to say well, it could be 20, but it could be more than 20. 
    We could say that with respect to his medical expenses he's entitled to more than that because it was really primarily related to his getting back and forth to New York and dealing with the rush-hour traffic. 
    I mean, there's no principled reason, no constitutional principled requirement for New York to be forced under the Privileges and Immunities Clause to adopt a rateable approach, even though, as I said, that is one that New York has followed in the past.

    --Can I just give you one hypothetical that keeps running through my mind and just ask you to comment on it? 
    Supposing you've got a Connecticut resident and a New York resident, both of whom make exactly the same amount of money, both of whom derive all of their income from New York... they're commuters. 
    One of them is a commuter and one lives in the city, and one of them, the one who lives in Connecticut, donates a substantial amount of money to the law school in New York and wants a charitable deduction. 
    The one who lives in New York donates a substantial amount of money to Yale in Connecticut. 
    The one who gets the deduction is the one who makes a donation to the New York recipient.

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    --In computing the New York-source income portion of the equation, that's correct, but in computing the tax as if a resident, which is the number by which the fraction is multiplied, you do treat the nonresident as if the nonresident were a resident, so that there is... again, this doesn't affect the computation of the fraction, because the charitable contribution--

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    --I believe that the... obviously the... when you computed the New York... the taxes if a resident, on the part of the New York resident, then obviously you'd stop, because that would be the answer. 
    The percentage of that that would be paid by the nonresident wouldn't be affected by the formula, by the fraction, which is the other thing, because New York-source income is a net number without any reduction for... itemized deduction such as the charitable contribution.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3365.376" stopTime="3371.711">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I thought, to oversimplify it, that the New York resident would get the deduction and the Connecticut resident would not, in my hypothetical.

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    In looking at the New York fraction, Justice Stevens, there's no difference in the New York-source income number... there would be no deduction in computing New York-source income for the charitable contribution.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    That's not a constitutional point, so any constitutional holding that permitted you to do what you've done here would permit Justice Stevens' hypothetical. 
    All it would take would be a Federal statute that does the same thing that this statute did here. 
    A delegation imposes... you know, convinces the other Members of Congress to write a little thing which says that New York-source alimony is not... you know, the way they did it here, they'd do the same thing for charities. 
    They could do the same thing for anything, so it would be easy under the Constitution to replicate just that problem, wouldn't it?

    And that's what's worrying me. 
    Of course, if it's constitutionally permissible to do this, the States that are always anxious to get more money could think of, you know, dozens and dozens of ways to produce the kinds of results that we were talking about.

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing

    Maybe the distinction is that New York treats nonresidents as just purely mechanical money-making machines, whereas it treats its own people as whole persons and citizens who have all sorts of interests other than making money, because that's what you treat the nonresident-- 
    --They're New Yorkers, after all. 
    Yes. 
    [Laughter] 
    Or they're non-New Yorkers.

    Mr. Andrew D. Bing 
    --In fact, as to New York State, that is a permissible... in our view, that's all right. 
    That's a distinction that we seek to draw. 
    It's a distinction that New York and other States have always, at least since 1920, thought that they had the power to draw, and it's a reasonable distinction based on the fact that we argue that we should not be required to take into account the fact that yes, Mr. Lunding does have a personal life, but it's a personal life that is related to Connecticut, not related to any of the other places from which Mr. Lunding derives his income.
