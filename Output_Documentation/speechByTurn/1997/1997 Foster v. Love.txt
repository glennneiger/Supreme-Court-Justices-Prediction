    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-670, Murphy Foster v. Scott Love. 
    Spectators are admonished not to talk until you get out of the courtroom. 
    The Court remains in session.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This is the Federal Election Day case up from Louisiana. 
    As Your Honors know, the 42nd Reconstruction Congress put the Federal Election Day statute on the books in 1872. 
    The question presented is whether the Federal Election Day statute nullifies Louisiana's open primary system under which all registered voters, regardless of party affiliation, vote for their candidates for Senate and United States Representative. 
    Under Louisiana law as we know it since 1976, if a candidate receives a majority of the votes in the October primary the candidate is declared elected, and there's no contested election on Federal Election Day, shall we say saving the poor working man a trip to the polls in nonpresidential election years.

    General Ieyoub, does any other State, to your knowledge, have this system?

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Oklahoma has a similar system, as does Hawaii, Your Honor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="122.814" stopTime="133.260">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And they each provide, as Louisiana does, for an open primary and no general election if a candidate gets a majority?

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Now, California has a system, I believe, of allowing crossover voting in primary elections, is that right?

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub

    I believe that's correct.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And some States allow crossover voting. 
    In other words, there's a primary election to pick the party's candidate, but parties... people who belong to another political party may cross over and vote--

    Yes, Your Honor.

    But in effect Louisiana and you say several other States don't treat the primary election as a party primary.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    No, Your Honor, it does not. 
    Everyone has a right to vote in the open primary in October, regardless of party affiliation.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    And all candidates run in the primary regardless of the party affiliation, so that if there is not a majority vote, then the two top vote-getters go into--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="193.232" stopTime="201.656">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    I guess it was not always that way. 
    It wasn't until the late seventies.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --That's correct, Your Honor. 
    I do not know why they made that change, Your Honor, but the change was made in 1976, and it actually went into effect in 1978, and since 1978, Your Honor, we have proceeded under the open primary law manner of election.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="220.370" stopTime="236.311">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, you... do you concede that Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact laws affecting the timing of election of Members of the Congress?
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="236.311" stopTime="262.147">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Congress may at any time alter regulations as it see fits, but I would point out that in 20 years, almost 20 years of the open primary, Congress has never moved to try to alter Louisiana's manner of electing its representatives to Congress so as to force a determinative election on Federal Election Day, and Your Honors, the--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="262.147" stopTime="276.098">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I guess the question, really, is whether the statutes that Congress did pass are contrary to Louisiana's scheme, as was held in the court below.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="276.098" stopTime="309.409">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --No, Your Honor, I would argue that it is not. 
    At the time the statute was passed by Congressman Butler and Senator Thurman in 1872, primaries were unknown. 
    They did not foresee primaries. 
    Primaries were a creature of the 20th Century, as fully stated in this Court's decision in United States v. Classic, but they did have the foresight to make exceptions for death or failure to elect, in which case they allowed elections other than on Federal Election Day.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="309.409" stopTime="319.376">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, do you say that Louisiana's system creates a vacancy, so the vacancy statute applies?
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="319.376" stopTime="329.591">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Louisiana's system certainly allows for the election of a candidate in October, as opposed to actually electing on Federal Election Day.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="329.591" stopTime="340.970">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, except the Federal statute fixes the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November as the day for election for the Members of Congress.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="340.970" stopTime="352.989">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    That's correct, Your Honor, and Louisiana's statutory scheme does, in fact, set a date on the first Tuesday after the first Monday. 
    It does do that. 
    We simply--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="352.989" stopTime="359.241">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But the election, if there's a majority vote in the primary, does not occur on that date.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="359.241" stopTime="385.159">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --Well, that's correct, Your Honor, and I submit that what we have here is an old statute and new circumstances, in which case I think that we have to look to the legislative purpose and the legislative history, as Chief Justice Taney said, looking, if necessary, to the public history of the times in which the statute was passed, and Justice Holmes saying you can look to the respective minds of Congress.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="385.159" stopTime="394.794">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So you accept the proposition that Louisiana law de jure authorizes elections before the Federal election date?
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="394.794" stopTime="424.333">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    That is correct, Your Honor, a person can be elected de jure under Louisiana's scheme, but what we're saying here is that Thurman and Butler wanted to protect the right to choose, and that is protected by Louisiana's statutory scheme. 
    What was important, what is important is, as Hamilton said, the right of the people to choose those whom they... who will govern them, and we allow that. 
    Louisiana's statutory scheme allows that. 
    That was what was--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="424.333" stopTime="460.438">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But the question is when it's allowed, and I know that it's called an open primary, but would you explain to me why that isn't a misnomer? 
    As you've said, everyone can vote. 
    That's the time everyone votes. 
    It's not like a party primary, and in order to be in the running you must participate. 
    Now, why aren't those two features, when they're combined... everyone votes. 
    Everyone who wants to run must be in on this inning. 
    Why doesn't that add up to an election?
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="460.438" stopTime="466.003">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --Well, Your Honor, there is an election on October... in October.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="466.003" stopTime="468.925">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So then that is the Election Day.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="468.925" stopTime="483.604">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    That is the election primary date, Your Honor, and if a person receives a majority of the vote, and only in that instance, they are declared elected, and there would be no determinative election on Federal Election Day.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="483.604" stopTime="502.776">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes, but my question to you is, why don't we just call it what it is, that is, an election, since everybody votes, and everybody who wants to be in the running is there? 
    Why isn't... why is it labeled primary? 
    It is an election, and it seems to me, being an election it conflicts with the Federal single Election Day.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="502.776" stopTime="520.246">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Well, Your Honor, it is an election. 
    It is also a system of voting that winnows down the candidates in many cases, where you have two individuals with the highest vote totals going into a general election on Federal Election Day, but--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="520.246" stopTime="528.923">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But you could do that consistent with the Federal day by having, if there are two people, then you have a run-off, as can happen in some States.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="528.923" stopTime="530.194">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="530.194" stopTime="531.173">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Later on, before January.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="531.173" stopTime="550.409">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    That's correct, and that is possible, but the State legislature of Louisiana, which we contend has the primary authority to set the manner of elections, has acted in such a way as to hold this scheme, the open primary scheme, as the law of our State. 
    If we look at the hist--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="550.409" stopTime="569.790">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But what interest of Louisiana would be affected if Louisiana said, we're going to do our same thing, except we're going to do it on Federal Election Day and, if need be, in the 20 percent of the cases, we'll have a run-off. 
    Then you would be acting consistently with all of the State goals, and with the Federal law.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="569.790" stopTime="581.939">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --Louisiana could do that, Your Honor, but what we're saying here is that Louisiana's open primary scheme in no way really clashes or conflicts with the Federal Election Day statute.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="581.939" stopTime="591.285">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, it does conflict, because it has an election on a day other than the day specified by the Federal statute. 
    That's why we're here. 
    Isn't that a clear conflict?
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="591.285" stopTime="600.061">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub

    Congress has decided that it wants the election to occur uniformly on a given day in November throughout the United States.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --Well, Your Honor, we submit that under the sovereignty of the State we have a right at least to set the manner in which our representatives to Congress will be elected, and it does not conflict in the sense that it's closely--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="636.325" stopTime="642.791">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    There is no constitutional authority on the part of Congress to determine the time, uniformly throughout the country?

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --There is, Your Honor, but as was pointed out by Mr. Madison in his answer to Mr. Monroe's question about the Times, Places, and Manner Clause, the States should have the primary responsibility. 
    The reason why the Federal Government might have some control is that they were afraid that if the Federal... I mean, if the State legislatures did not act appropriately, it could bring about the dissolution of the Union, and that's what--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="671.438" stopTime="682.966">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Is it us... is it up to this Court to decide whether Louisiana has acted appropriately in determining whether a pretty clear Federal statute is going to be applied or not? 
    Is that what you're asking us to do?

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    I am... I think that Congress has a right to decide whether or not there is a determinative election on Federal Election Day. 
    Under Article I, section 5, also--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="695.714" stopTime="698.425">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Do you think that this is a justiciable controversy?

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --No, Your Honor, I do not think it's a justiciable controversy, because I fail to see the injury that the respondents have really suffered. 
    They had a right to vote. 
    They had the right to vote in October. 
    Now--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="711.413" stopTime="728.875">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So that-- 
    --But I want to make sure I understand your position. 
    Your position, then, is not really an argument about whether the statute applies, and if so, how, and whether there is an inconsistency between it and the Louisiana statute. 
    Your position is that this issue really does not belong in the court.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="728.875" stopTime="795.970">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --Yes, Your Honor, that is my position. 
    It does not belong in the court. 
    The right of an individual to vote in any manner is not absolute, and this Court so stated in Burdick v. DeCoushy, that the manner of voting is not necessarily an absolute right. 
    Now, if Your Honors would look at the appendix, joint appendix on page 43, one of the respondents says, I did not vote in the October open primary in which Billy Tauzin received a majority of the vote and was thereby elected outright under Louisiana law. 
    I was, therefore, prevented by the Louisiana law from exercising my right under the Constitution and Federal law to vote in an election. 
    She did not vote in the primary, and now she's saying that since I did not vote in the manner in which Louisiana prescribed, I have been deprived, and I have been injured, and Your Honor, we say that will not do. 
    That is just not correct, and the matter should not be in this Court.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="795.970" stopTime="814.300">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Then your view is that no voter, as long as they could vote in something they called a primary, would have standing to object to Louisiana's deviating from most of the country in having what is the election a month before everyone else does.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="814.300" stopTime="833.143">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Well, Your Honor, I would say that certainly there would... in our situation, where there is an open primary and an October election, when one fails to vote they have not really suffered an injury to the extent that this Court, or to the extent it would create a justiciable controversy in which this Court--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If you... General Ieyoub, that's how you... if you fail to vote you have no standing, and if you vote you haven't been injured, I suppose, so the result would be that no individual voter could ever challenge the violation, or claim violation of the congressional statute.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub

speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="891.932" stopTime="952.783">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    The history has been, Your Honor, that in the past most of the time they have been elected during the primary, and I will point out that under Article I, section 5, the Congress has the authority to challenge the seating of any individual elected to Congress and after 20 years Congress has never moved to remove the credentials of any Louisiana Senator or Congressman because they were elected in October as opposed to November. 
    I think the results would be unreasonable and impractical to say that if a Congressman got over 50 percent of the vote in a primary, they're not qualified to serve in Congress. 
    The fact that they would get 50 percent of the vote is an indication of the favor that the people hold him in, and to say that just because it was in October as opposed to an election day in November, that they do not have a right to serve after the people have chosen, I think would lead to unreasonable--

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Well, Your Honor, I made a big deal about it in response to a question by Justice Souter, and I think it's a big deal when you really come down to it. 
    I think that... in Ex parte Siebold this Court construed Article 1, section 4 not as any Federal juggernaut just totally wiping out regulation, or the manner of regulations that were passed by the State, but what they asked for, what this Court said was that we need cooperation between the Federal sovereignty and the State sovereignty, a harmonizing combination into one system of regulations made by the two sovereignties. 
    That's what we have here in Louisiana. 
    The open primary system, it doesn't really clash or conflict. 
    What it does is, it harmonizes two sovereignties, putting together election regulations.

    I don't understand why the harmonizing doesn't work against you, because it seems so easy for Louisiana to comply.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="1246.485" stopTime="1305.404">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Your Honor, that is within the purview of the State legislature to do exactly what you say. 
    They chose not to do it in the last legislative session, although they were faced with that issue. 
    We argue, however, that the history of the adoption of Article I, section 4, title 2, section 7 and its adoption, indicates that at the time it was passed, at the time the... first of all, it indicates that the State has the primary authority to regulate the manner of elections. 
    Second, it indicates that they didn't foresee primaries, and that primaries have been seen by this Court as an integral part of the electoral process, and that what the statute fathers of... in 1872 were trying to do was to ensure the right to choose, and the people of Louisiana have a right to choose their representatives that go to Congress.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is it not a fact that at least in presidential election years the percentage of voter turnout at the primary is only around 30 percent or so, whereas the percentage of turnout at the November election is in the fifties and sixties percent?

    I mean, of course, as in Ex parte Siebold. 
    Of course regulations made by Congress are paramount and supersede those of the State, but only... and here I quote one of this Court's great judges, Justice Bradley... but only insofar as the two are inconsistent and no farther. 
    We say there is no conflict, no clash between the Federal Election Day and Louisiana's primary law. 
    As Justice Bradley said so well in Siebold, let a spirit of national as well as local patriotism prevail. 
    Let unfounded jealousies cease, and we shall hear no more of the impossibility of harmonious action between the national and State governments on a matter on which they have a mutual and vital interest.

    The key issue in this case, Your Honors, is that this is not an attack on Louisiana's prerogative to maintain this type of election system. 
    Justice Ginsburg got it exactly right. 
    Louisiana can maintain what it has, but it has to conform it to the requirements of Federal law, and that would mean this primary, which is really an election, on Federal Election Day, with a run-off thereafter as required by section 8.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    There are statutes, as my colleagues have indicated, where you could end up with a two-party primary, and the same candidate on the ballot in November, so that it's only one name, or you could have a situation where one party doesn't make a nomination, and again there's only one name.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2132.260" stopTime="2156.316">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And Louisiana presumably could go to a system whereby they still have their primary election but they provide that the... if there is a majority winner at the primary election date, that name has to go on the General Election ballot before it's official that there's an election. 
    Now, will that do it?
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2156.316" stopTime="2177.401">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    --No, Justice O'Connor. 
    In response to your hypotheticals, those are all situations in which the party primaries are not conclusive as a matter of law. 
    The party primaries have merely nominated a person who may appear on the November ballot. 
    The Louisiana October primary is conclusive as a matter of law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2177.401" stopTime="2195.011">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well then, all then... if that's your argument, then all Louisiana would have to do to meet your contention is to say the October primary isn't conclusive. 
    The person still has to be alive in November and be on the ballot, and it's that time that he's officially elected.
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2195.011" stopTime="2219.997">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    If it's not possible, if it's not legally possible for the winner of the primary in October to lose in November, if it's not... if a State doesn't allow for some other candidate to appear on that ballot, if by winning that October primary you have won the election, that... you're selected for office, that's the violation of the Federal statute.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2219.997" stopTime="2230.775">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but then you're... then you have trouble dealing with the question whether... where both parties nominate the same candidate, and there is only one candidate on the November ballot.
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2230.775" stopTime="2263.748">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    But that satisfies Federal law because those primaries, Chief Justice Rehnquist, were not conclusive. 
    They did not select, as a matter of law, the person for Congress. 
    A primary, as traditionally understood, merely selects a person to appear on a ballot, either a partisan nominee, or otherwise serves the function of... it's a ballot access funnel, and it winnows down the number of candidates who will ultimately appear on a General Election ballot, but it doesn't select Members of Congress. 
    An election does, and that's the crucial--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2263.748" stopTime="2288.362">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Then you're back to the Chief Justice's earlier question. 
    All you have to change in this law is the determination that he's elected, and just say, you know, he'll... this is just a primary, and he'll be the only candidate on the ballot in November. 
    I don't see how you can get around that, unless you want to repudiate those State laws that allow partisan primaries, both of which can name the same candidate.
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2288.362" stopTime="2290.334">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    --Justice Scalia, we don't--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2290.334" stopTime="2299.939">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That candidate's the only name on the ballot, and the same would be the case in Louisiana. 
    Whoever gets a majority in the primary, his will be the only name on the ballot. 
    What's the difference?
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2299.939" stopTime="2316.502">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    --The difference is, Justice Scalia, is that the hypotheticals you gave me, the two... there are two partisan primaries. 
    The part... that each provide a place on the ballot. 
    Neither primary is conclusive as a matter of law. 
    This Louisiana October primary is conclusive, and merely delaying the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2316.502" stopTime="2335.793">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I understand that. 
    But I'm asking the Chief Justice's question. 
    If all that you changed about Louisiana law was the statement that the primary is conclusive if someone wins a majority, if you just change that and say he's not elected then, he will be the only name on the ballot in November, would that make you happy?
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2335.793" stopTime="2337.285">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    --No, Justice Scalia.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2337.285" stopTime="2343.998">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Then you've got to tell me why that's any different from the two-party primary that puts one name on the ballot in November.
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2343.998" stopTime="2358.069">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    It's not... Justice Scalia, that's not an election, because there's not the possibility... State law has not allowed for... assuming there's no write-in possibility, what section 7 requires is an election on Federal Election Day, which--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2358.069" stopTime="2401.888">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But you're saying one thing more. 
    You're saying there's got to be a... how shall I put it +/? 
    a legally unconditional opportunity for voting on the November date. 
    That's what you're saying, isn't it? 
    Not merely a possibility. 
    You're saying that the possibility has got to be legally unconditional. 
    Now, if the voters make a choice, as in the Earl Warren case, that would not be a problem under your criteria, because the law was not precluding the possibility of the voting that you're talking about. 
    You're saying that the law cannot preclude that opportunity, and this law does in the 80 percent of the cases. 
    Isn't that what you're arguing?
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2401.888" stopTime="2403.146">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    --Absolutely, Justice Souter.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2403.146" stopTime="2434.539">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right, and do we have to get into this other issue? 
    I mean, I don't know, maybe in California my recollection is they all provided for writeins. 
    I don't know whether they do or don't. 
    Maybe all these other... I don't know what Louisiana will do. 
    I mean, here the statute says now a candidate who receives a majority of the vote that's cast for office in a primary election is elected. 
    Now, do we have to go into the question of what happens if that is illegal under the statute and they decide to fix it up by declaring him elected or not? 
    Is it necessary or not necessary for us to go into that?
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2434.539" stopTime="2444.284">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    It's not necessary, Justice Breyer. 
    A declaratory... affirming the court of appeals, and the declaratory judgment of the court of appeals as satisfactory, then it will be the prerogative of the--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2444.284" stopTime="2467.030">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    In other words, the court of appeals just dealt with this language, so if they decide to fix it up through this... saying, okay, they changed the words, so a candidate who receives the majority of the votes cast for office in a primary election will have his name placed on the ballot in November and no one else will, and there are no write-ins. 
    If that's how they fix it up, then we have to deal with this question we're now discussing?

    We'll also have to deal with the writing of an opinion in this case. 
    Yes.

    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    The reasons that I would provide is that the State statute is in hopeless conflict with Federal law.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Mr. Baker, did I understand you to agree with me... I think General Ieyoub did... that when you have the two things, one is everybody votes in this, call it what you will, in this thing, and to be in the running you must run in this thing, that whatever label you put on it, that is an election, unlike a primary, where only Democrats can vote in one, Republicans can vote in the... they're not specific. 
    This is everybody who wants to vote votes in this. 
    Everybody who wants to run runs in this.

    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    --Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, which leads me to respond to a point made by my colleague, the Attorney General. 
    The Attorney General suggested that partisan primaries were unknown in 1872, and he's absolutely right, so this is not a situation of applying old law to new facts. 
    We're applying old law to, in fact, an election system that Congress exactly understood at the time it enacted this statute. 
    Congress... in 1872 there were elections. 
    There were no pre-election primaries. 
    But Congress also anticipated that States in these elections might have majority vote requirements.

    It is argued that it would be fine to have a statute that says, no write-ins, and the only name on the ballot, and that this statute is the same, but that argument is unconvincing, because... and now I want you to fill in the blank.

    The reason I ask the question is, I think what you're saying is, there's got to be voting on the November date which is operative to elect, and in my silly hypothetical there would in fact be voting in November that would be operative to elect, and so that's why I'm asking.

    Now, wait a minute, there is a choice. 
    You... I mean, you don't say there has to be a choice, because you say it's okay if you have two separate primaries and you have no choice on Election Day.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why should it make any difference that in one hypothesis the reason you have only one name is on the ballot is there were two separate primaries and in both of those the same person, and in the Louisiana case there were a number of people on the ballot and only one person survived.
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2909.308" stopTime="2928.803">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    The difference, Justice... Chief Justice Rehnquist is that the... that those primaries, neither primary elected as a matter of right the person to office. 
    Each primary merely selected a person who happened to be the same person to appear on that ballot.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2928.803" stopTime="2932.166">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And why does that make a difference?

    Because the State law has provided for its conclusive election in November.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask a question... we're talking about a lot of hypotheticals here. 
    Since the decision of the court of appeals in this case, do you know whether or not the Louisiana legislature has given any attention to what remedy it might provide for this, or are they just sitting waiting for us?
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="2960.613" stopTime="2976.585">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    Yes, Justice Stevens, they looked at this in the most recent legislative session. 
    There were some efforts to address the problem, and then they decided apparently to wait until this Court's disposition of this case, so the legislation went nowhere.

    Mr. M. Miller Baker

    So I guess you'd be satisfied if we allowed the... you know, the first and the last in the primary to be put on the ballot. 
    Right?

    --Right--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --That's the problem. 
    I can understand why you'd want to limit it, because if you can limit it any way at all, even with one vote, or even with the first and last, you've distinguished your case. 
    I understand that. 
    Now we don't have to reach the others. 
    But what's worrying me now is that if we say here there is no election, it's not an election, then there may be X other States that suddenly will discover they don't have an election in November for the reason that it is more than theoretically possible that both parties have selected the same nominee, and that's what is driving this concern, and at the moment I don't know the answer to that. 
    It seems to me a genuine concern, and that's... I mean, everybody's asking you to focus on it. 
    I don't want to give up before getting the most out of your thought on this that I can.
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="3095.300" stopTime="3113.533">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    --Well, Justice Breyer, if a State's ballot access selection device is not conclusive as a matter of law, that ballot access selection device in the form of a primary would pass muster under the Federal statutes.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    In other words, you're saying that if Hawaii or other States that don't have write-ins in November do end up with the Democratic and Republican parties selecting the same candidate, that their election will be invalid. 
    That's your position.

    Mr. M. Miller Baker

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --I think if people had focused on this we'd have a few briefs here from other States that would be concerned about it, and so I'm a little uncertain what to do.

speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3148.815" stopTime="3189.571">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Baker, I thought that you had answered my question that this is an election when everybody votes. 
    I thought that was your distinction between party primaries that happen to come up with the same candidate but not everybody votes together, and this, which you agreed, I thought, that it is an election because everybody votes and everybody who's running must run, that those two things in combination equal an election, and if that's so, then you would distinguish your case from the party primaries that may happen to come up with the same candidate.
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="3189.571" stopTime="3223.826">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    --That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and for the added reason that those party primaries don't as a matter of law select the congressional officer. 
    They simply have selected a nominee who will appear on a ballot, and if by happenstance the same person has been chosen by the respective Democratic and Republican primaries, the election is still held in... the conclusive election is held in November, and the primaries were not legally... were not the legal selection of the congressional officer.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3223.826" stopTime="3235.823">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And Louisiana has been candid in describing its system, because it says, if you have somebody who comes out of this race, whatever it is, with a majority vote, that person is elected.
speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="3235.823" stopTime="3298.075">
    Mr. M. Miller Baker 
    Correct. 
    That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and section 8, the companion statute to section 7, 2 U.S.C. section 8, is a statute that answers this... that gives us the answer in this case. 
    Elections in 1872 were like the elections that Louisiana has today. 
    Everybody appeared at the polls. 
    Everybody voted. 
    In most States, a plurality election was sufficient to elect a person to Congress, but a number of States have majority vote requirements as does Louisiana today, so therefore Congress inserted section 8 into title 2 to provide for the contingency of a failure to elect on Federal Election Day, and that's the statute that Louisiana could follow and have its post Federal Election Day run-off if it so chose to do that. 
    If there are no further questions, that concludes my argument.
