    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 97-16, Ohio Forestry Association v. Sierra Club. 
    Mr. Stewart.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="9.037" stopTime="89.730">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    The National Forest Management Act requires the United States Forest Service to devise forest plans for each of the units within the national forest system. 
    That the plans are to be revised at 10 to 15-year intervals, and they perform two basic functions. 
    First, they provide general guidance to Forest Service employees in the management of the affected unit and, second, they serve a public informational function by giving the public general information about the likely management activities within the forest and, while the plans vary widely from place to place, all forest plans contain projections concerning anticipated timber harvesting activities within the national forest, and it's that feature of the plan that's at issue here today. 
    I'd like to start by saying that in our view it would be misleading to frame the question presented in this case as whether forest plans are reviewable. 
    We're not asking for a per se rule in this case and, indeed, we're really not asking for a special rule for forest plans. 
    What we're saying is that the Court should examine the particular plan provision that is at issue and ask whether the decision or determination reflected in that provision is reviewable under ordinary principles of administrative law and, in our view, the timber harvesting projections at issue in this case don't meet that test. 
    The harvesting--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well then, in most cases the plans aren't unified documents?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="92.812" stopTime="114.366">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --The plans are unified documents. 
    That is, the plan is bound together. 
    It is a single document, but it contains a variety of provisions and some provisions may reflect decisions having immediate on the ground impact, others will not, and the question should be whether the particular plan provision at issue in a case has immediate on the ground impact, and--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="114.366" stopTime="118.899">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Can you give me an example of a provision that would have immediate impact?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="118.899" stopTime="159.025">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --One of the cases we had in the Ninth Circuit this past summer and fall was a case in which the Forest Service amended the standards and guidelines contained in a plan that regulated the manner in which timber harvesting activities would be conducted and the document that adopted the plan amendment said, these amended standards and guidelines will not apply to ongoing timber harvesting activities. 
    And we were sued in that case and the plaintiff's contended that the agency had behaved unlawfully in failing to apply the new standards and guidelines to ongoing projects. 
    In the end we prevailed on the merits in that case, but we conceded that that was a justiciable controversy, because the decision not to make the standards and guidelines immediately applicable would have immediate on the ground impact.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="159.025" stopTime="168.741">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, I take it you'd agree here that if their claim were that your plan was allowing motorcycles into a bird watching area or something that like, that would be immediately justiciable on your theory, would it not?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="168.741" stopTime="169.222">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    That's correct.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes.

    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    And our view is that--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="170.594" stopTime="176.728">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Stewart, the respondents have filed some supplemental affidavits, have they not?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="176.728" stopTime="177.329">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --They have.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="177.329" stopTime="187.075">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Is there anything... should we consider those and, if so, is there anything in those that would reflect an immediate actionable matter?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="187.075" stopTime="228.793">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    I think the Court frankly has discretion whether to consider them or not. 
    They are part of the record below. 
    I think probably the more normal course would be not to consider them because they were filed after the court of appeals issued its decision and consequently they weren't part of the record that was before the court of appeals. 
    We don't believe, in any event, that the affidavits affect the justiciability of plaintiff's facial challenge to the plan. 
    That is, the affidavits may suggest that there are individual timber harvesting activities which are having, or did have before they were enjoined, immediate on the ground impact and those specific timber harvesting activities would have been subject to judicial review. 
    That wouldn't mean that the plan level projections were suitable for judicial review.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="228.793" stopTime="232.814">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Was this action brought under the Administrative Procedure Act in the district court?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="232.814" stopTime="246.245">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    The National Forest Management Act doesn't contain its own judicial review provision, so that the suit was brought under the APA. 
    Now, the harvesting projections contained in the Wayne plan are contingent and uncertain in several important respects.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="246.245" stopTime="260.974">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Would you be saying the same thing if it were the timber companies complaining and saying this plan doesn't reserve enough land for timber harvesting, it gives over too much land to other uses and excludes harvesting?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="260.974" stopTime="287.241">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    Well, if, for instance, the timber industry contended that particular areas of the forest had been improperly designated as unsuitable for harvesting I think you'd really have a different sort of justiciability problem. 
    That is, that sort of decision would be final in a way that the suitability determination here is not. 
    That is, if land is designated as off limits for harvesting there's not some subsequent site specific decision as to whether timber will actually be harvested. 
    I think, though, that to establish--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="287.241" stopTime="296.037">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The difference is that in the case posited by Justice Ginsburg it is clear that no harvesting will occur.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="296.037" stopTime="297.620">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --That's correct, and here it's--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="297.620" stopTime="299.750">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Whereas here it is not clear that harvesting will occur.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="299.750" stopTime="320.723">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --That's correct. 
    Now, I think the industry plaintiff might still have difficulty establishing the redressibility component of standing, because the plaintiff would have to show that redesignation of the land as suitable for timber harvesting was ultimately likely to lead to a decision actually to harvest timber and to the award of a contract to the particular company, so there would be a different sort of justiciability problem. 
    Now--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="320.723" stopTime="329.389">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Could I ask just sort of a background question? 
    I'm a little confused about the whole... as I understand it, about... most of the land in the national... in this forest is owned privately.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="329.389" stopTime="330.910">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="330.910" stopTime="336.433">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And is the clearcutting and the timber that's cut down, is that all on private land, or is that on public land?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="336.433" stopTime="342.257">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    No. 
    The only thing we're talking about here, and the only part of this area that the plan regulates is the federally owned land.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="342.257" stopTime="343.749">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It's only federally owned land?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="343.749" stopTime="344.270">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="344.270" stopTime="347.779">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So that about 80 percent of the forest, the plan just doesn't apply to?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="347.779" stopTime="365.143">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    I'm not even sure if you would call that the national forest. 
    It is land within... this is an odd sort of national forest in that it consists of three or four noncontiguous segments and it's interspersed with privately owned land, but the management plan takes into account uses on surrounding property, but it does not regulate those uses.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="365.143" stopTime="368.954">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So the plan itself just regulates activities on Government owned property?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="368.954" stopTime="369.445">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="369.445" stopTime="371.405">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And that's only about 20 percent of the total forest?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="371.405" stopTime="435.037">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    It's... that's correct. 
    It's around 176,000 federally owned acres. 
    Now, the forest plan contains projections as to the possible aggregate quantity of timber that might be harvested on the forest during the plan period, but those harvesting projections are not binding. 
    It's not uncommon for the Forest Service to harvest substantially less timber than it is allowed to harvest on a particular unit. 
    And I think, second, even leaving aside the determination as to aggregate quantity of timber, the forest plan leaves the Service with very substantial latitude as to where within the forest harvesting will occur. 
    For example, this forest plan designated approximately 126,000 acres within the forest as suitable for timber harvesting, but it projected that less than 8,000 acres within the forest would actually be harvested during the first 10 years of the plan and until we know where within the forest the Service intends to harvest timber, various things remain uncertain. 
    First, we don't know whether particular people will be hurt, whether their activities within the forest will be impaired by the harvesting that does occur.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="435.037" stopTime="439.349">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What if they claim that they use the entire forest? 
    That would cover that problem, I assume.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="439.349" stopTime="471.582">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    I think if they literally claimed that they use the entire forest, they... at least at the motion to dismiss stage, that would take care of it. 
    At the summary judgment stage they would be required to furnish evidence to that effect. 
    Second, even aside from the uncertainty as to what people will be injured, we really don't know whether logging will be rational until we know on what site it is designated to occur. 
    That is, it's integral to the Forest Service's implementation of the National Forest Management Act that the propriety of timber harvesting can vary widely from site to site even within a particular national forest. 
    That's why--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="471.582" stopTime="485.162">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Suppose they said that about 80,000 would be targeted for timber... out of the 126,000 acres total, and they said, oh, about 80,000 are eligible for timber cutting. 
    Would the standing calculus, the ripeness calculus here vary?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="485.162" stopTime="515.313">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --I don't think that it would vary because the 80,000, whatever figure the Forest Service projected would still only be a projection. 
    We still wouldn't know whether the Forest Service would actually harvest timber up to that amount and until it conducted the site specific analysis of particular tracts we wouldn't know whether it made sense to harvest timber there, so I think in a sense this is a paradigmatic example of a case in which deferral of litigation until a latter stage in the process would conserve the resources of the court and prevent unnecessary litigation.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="515.313" stopTime="567.529">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Stewart, your... the Sierra Club at least has raised one answer to that argument and I'd like you to comment on it. 
    They say that if, in fact, they have to wait for site specific decisions they will, in order to maintain their objection to the plan, have to challenge every single one of them, because part of their argument is that there is just a legally erroneous imbalance here between the timbering decision... the timbering allocation and the nontimbering allocation, and so they say I think at one point in their brief that if they do what you claim they should do they're going to have to file something like 40 lawsuits and that would not conserve judicial resources. 
    They're addressing, in other words, the hardship prong both to themselves and, I suppose, to the courts under Abbott Lab. 
    What is your response to that?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="567.529" stopTime="601.750">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    I think there are about three different responses. 
    The first is that if it is, in fact, true that there is a particular plan level determination that is dispositive with respect to a number of timber sales then, if the plaintiff files suit to challenge an initial sale and persuades the district court or the court of appeals, if the case is taken up on appeal that the plan level determination is irrational, that determination will be preclusive in subsequent litigation between the same parties, so a single party is not going to have to relitigate the same issue over and over. 
    The second thing we would point out is that both the Eighth and Eleventh--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="601.750" stopTime="622.395">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Excuse me. 
    How could you ever come to a determination in a single suit that the overall plan level is irrational? 
    The Government will come in and say, well, even if we did set aside too much for logging activity, had we set aside less, we still might have decided that this was the tract that we were going to log on.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="622.395" stopTime="649.583">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --I mean, I think one example of a situation in which a plan level determination might be dispositive is if the plaintiffs came in and said, here is a large area within the forest and the Forest Service should have left that area entirely off limits to logging, and it was irrational for the Forest Service to permit any logging within that area, and if they persuaded the court that it was indeed irrational to permit logging anywhere within that area, that determination would be preclusive.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="649.583" stopTime="665.845">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It wouldn't go to the whole plan, though, just to allowing that area to be logged. 
    It would be very hard, it seems to me, in any individual case to challenge the overall determination that X number of acres should be logged.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="665.845" stopTime="677.012">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    I think... I think... well, I think it is certainly true that it's hard to imagine a site specific activity that would present a suitable vehicle for the court to review the whole plan, and I think if--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="677.012" stopTime="682.124">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Do you concede that there has to be some mechanism for reviewing the whole plan?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="682.124" stopTime="682.635">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --No.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="682.635" stopTime="689.570">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That every governmental determination, no matter how high the level of generality at which it is made, must be subject to judicial review?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="689.570" stopTime="722.231">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    No, we don't. 
    If it were the case that the Federal courts had unlimited time and resources and if it were the case that the role of the Federal courts was to monitor the agency's protection of the public interest, then it would be a strong objection to our theory that there will be no site specific action that brings the whole plan before the courts. 
    But, in fact, as this Court noted in Defenders of Wildlife, the role of the Federal courts is to protect the rights of individual litigants and Forest Service employees whose specialty it is to manage the forests spend years devising these plans, and to expect--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="722.231" stopTime="736.521">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Why? 
    Why is it... why can't you just say, they wouldn't have cut these trees if they'd had a legally correct plan? 
    This plan is not legally correct. 
    We don't know what they would have done with a legally correct plan, but they wouldn't be cutting these trees.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="736.521" stopTime="737.369">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --I mean, the--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="737.369" stopTime="748.749">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So why wouldn't they be able to challenge it just as an agency which takes action pursuant to a rule? 
    You would say, the rule isn't valid, therefore... we don't know if they would have done it with some other rule or not, but they can't do it from this rule.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="748.749" stopTime="783.912">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --Well, I think in a sense this is a familiar sort of problem in administrative law. 
    That is, it's often the case that a particular agency action will be brought before a court that implicates a narrow, specific regulatory provision, and a court will be told by the parties, in order to understand why this action does or doesn't make sense, you have to have an appreciation of the larger legal context, and the parties will provide the court at least with general information about what that context is. 
    But to say that you can review a specific action within a larger context is different from saying that you review the context as such. 
    The plaintiffs are always free to challenge individual site specific actions.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="783.912" stopTime="806.855">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Stewart, what they basically, as I understand it, want to attack is a policy of allowing clearcutting, or even aged forest management, whatever euphemistic term you want to call it, but clearcutting, and they say that the overall plan envisions clearcutting and that's wrong, and they want to challenge that concept.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="806.855" stopTime="817.522">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    And our point is that they have not been harmed in any way by the clearcutting projections contained in the plan unless and until clearcutting actually occurs. 
    I mean, one of the noteworthy things about--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="817.522" stopTime="831.861">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you, would you take that position if the statute said in so many words, or at least there was a reasonable legal argument for saying clearcutting shall be prohibited, period? 
    Would they have a right to challenge a plan that authorized clearcutting if the statute clearly, or at least arguably prohibited it?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="831.861" stopTime="833.924">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --No, and I think--

    Unknown Speaker 
    You'd say no?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="834.505" stopTime="850.283">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --No, and I think this falls squarely within this Court's decision in National Wildlife Federation in which the Court said, absent an instruction from Congress, that review should proceed at a higher level of generality. 
    Ordinarily, we... the Court entertains challenges to regulations only when the regulation is applied to a particular set of facts.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="850.283" stopTime="862.742">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So if the regulation is unlawful, you can't do the clearcutting, right? 
    I mean, if you have a plan that's unlawful and you clearcut in a particular place, how could you do it if the regulation, i.e. the plan, was unlawful?

    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--

    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    We intervened here because we believed that the respondents, or, rather, the plaintiffs had raised issues which we felt were inappropriate both as to justiciability and as to the merits.

    So that the plan does have some concrete effect?
speaker="steven_r_quarles" startTime="920.968" stopTime="948.508">
    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    The decision gives it concrete effect. 
    The decision said that because the Forest Service was biased the plan was unlawful and, in fact, when the Sixth Circuit decision was remanded to the district court, the district court read the Sixth Circuit decision as saying that the Forest Service could not, in fact, prepare a lawful plan, that the entire plan was unlawful, and enjoined timber sales, so we are clearly injured.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="948.508" stopTime="967.959">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But the redress you seek is the reinstatement of the plan and I assume that's because it gives you some specific advantage. 
    I can't see how you can have it both ways, and to say that the Sierra Club has no standing if they set aside the plan but that you have injury if the plan is set aside, it seems to me is just inconsistent.
speaker="steven_r_quarles" startTime="967.959" stopTime="991.916">
    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    Our belief is that neither we nor the Sierra Club typically have standing to challenge a general plan, and that only in very unusual circumstances will a plan be site specific enough to provide both ripeness and Article III standing, including redressibility.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="991.916" stopTime="1015.470">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're claiming the ability to challenge the proposition that there can be no plan, which is to say there can be no timber sales in this area. 
    You're not claiming that this particular plan has to be brought back in... I mean, the source of your injury is not that the... every jot and tittle of this plan isn't valid.

    If it said no clearcutting it would still allow some other forms of cutting, and if the plan was remanded and the Forest Service proceeded to redo the plan, the Forest Service still has the discretion to offer very little or very much timber, and there is a redressibility question.

    Of course, on the other side, the... as I understand it plans do not mandate cutting, plans authorize cutting, so that if a plan said there may be clearcutting on every acre of this property, as far as... I suppose your position would be that the Sierra Club still would not have a ripe claim because they would still have to wait to see on a site specific basis whether clearcutting would be allowed on this acre.

    Optimality?

    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    The National Forest Management Act requires that for even aged management, clearcutting in particular, that the Forest Service at the time of the sale has to find that clearcutting is the optimum method, or that other even aged management is the appropriate method for timber harvesting on that site. 
    And that's why clearly, in most instances, even if it said clearcutting will be allowed, it's important to see the site specific analysis to determine whether or not it is appropriate for that site, and that's what the statute says.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Can I ask you a quick question about... I'm a little nervous about the Government's answer to my last question, which was qualified at the end that it was ripe if that's what the statute provided. 
    So imagine that 5 years from now, having won this case... you won it... then the Sierra Club, at the point when they've actually going to clearcut, the saws are there, I mean, every legal thing is done, the trees are about to come down, at that point they come into court and they say, look, the trees are being cut down. 
    We certainly have standing to complain, and one of our legal arguments is that the plan that led to this particular sale is legally invalid. 
    Do you know any reason why they would be unable to make that argument?

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Fine. 
    Thank you.
speaker="steven_r_quarles" startTime="1286.099" stopTime="1456.364">
    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    Certainly they could, and I think that's an important issue to raise, because what both... what respondents and their amici said in their briefs is, they thought that the plan should be challenged before it can be implemented, and I remind you that these are 10 to 15-year plans and we are 10 years from the date on which... 10-1/2 years from the date on which the plan was first proposed. 
    40 sales have proceeded. 
    Under respondent's theory, the Forest Service would have been paralyzed to do anything for these last 10 years until the validity of the plan had been established, and we believe that's inappropriate. 
    The three bias issues that I would like to talk about are first the... or the three merits issues, are first the issue of bias in favor of the timber harvesting by virtue, it seems, of the very statutes that require the Forest Service to provide for that activity. 
    The second is the Sixth Circuit's overturning of the Forest Service multiple use allocations on the basis that the plan overvalued timber, undervalued wilderness recreation, when the agency's broad discretion and technical expertise should have elicited judicial deference. 
    And third, that they concluded even age management is restricted to exceptional circumstance when that very proposition had been addressed and rejected by the Fifth Circuit in an exhaustive opinion which the Sixth Circuit did not even cite or address. 
    I think at the outset it's worth noting... observing that the bias and merits rulings and the standing rulings, the justiciability rulings, are cut from the same cloth. 
    Each set of rulings in its own way demonstrates the Sixth Circuit's failure to acknowledge the limited authority of the Federal courts to inject themselves into areas of policy that have been entrusted to the political branches, and this is particularly true in the case of the bias proposal of the Sixth Circuit. 
    Respondents did not attempt to defend that, but they did say that it's dicta, and that this Court should ignore it. 
    That seems to be very wrong to me as an idea. 
    We don't believe it's dicta, but even if it is, the suggestion that this Court should ignore it seems to be in error. 
    First of all, the Sixth Circuit clearly gave that dicta for effect, and that effect that they wanted was to have the agency note it and alter their behavior accordingly and to have the district courts in the circuit note it, and that's exactly what happened on remand. 
    The district court, in a transcript we lodged with this Court, reviewed the bias ruling and found that it made the entire plan unlawful, and that the Forest Service would be incapable of preparing a lawful plan under that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1456.364" stopTime="1460.076">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Quarles, you don't have too much more time. 
    Why was the bias ruling wrong?
speaker="steven_r_quarles" startTime="1460.076" stopTime="1517.334">
    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    --The bias ruling in my view is wrong for several reasons. 
    First of all, it was made without any reference to the administrative record. 
    There is nothing in the administrative record to demonstrate that bias and the court, in fact, used the bias ruling to avoid providing any deference to the agency, even though this is the kind of case that requires deference... broad discretion, technical expertise... and, as this Court said in Chevron, circumstances where Congress entrusted to the agency to solve competing interests. 
    This is exactly such a case, because Congress entrusted to the agency to solve competing demands by multiple users of the forest, so in that sense I think it's very wrong. 
    It's also wrong in the sense that typically there is supposed to be a presumption of agency regularity and good faith, and the only time that I'm aware when they found bias has been in extrajudicial circumstances, and that's not the case here. 
    They just simply said it was bias. 
    And the third reason that is so extraordinary--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1517.334" stopTime="1519.215">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't know what you mean by extrajudicial circumstances.
speaker="steven_r_quarles" startTime="1519.215" stopTime="1591.924">
    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    --Circumstances in which it was outside of the legal framework, where somebody had gone on television, a judge had gone on television and made a comment, or something like that. 
    But the third reason I think is the most extraordinary, and that is, the court found that bias in the statutory mission of the agencies. 
    It found it in three statutes, the first the 1897 Organic Act, which requires the Forest Service to establish forests for purposes of continue... furnishing a continuous timber supply to meet the needs of the American people. 
    A second statute that returned 25 percent of the revenues to local communities for use for roads and forests, and a third statute that returned a part of the revenue to the Forest Service for purposes of reforestation. 
    Without acknowledging that those were statutory provisions, the court pointed to those three reasons as to why there was bias in the Forest Service, and I would maintain the notion that an agency's following the law is a bias, which allows the court not to provide deference to the agency, is an extraordinary notion that goes well beyond the bounds of judicial behavior. 
    More importantly, under that bias theory--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1591.924" stopTime="1596.836">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I suppose we can't say anything about all this if we agree with your first point, that there's no ripeness here anyway.
speaker="steven_r_quarles" startTime="1596.836" stopTime="1604.480">
    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    --That's correct. 
    If there... if we find there is no justiciability, then this Court need not comment on it.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1604.480" stopTime="1606.413">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The district courts in the Sixth Circuit continue to believe it all?
speaker="steven_r_quarles" startTime="1606.413" stopTime="1626.126">
    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    Well, that's an interesting question. 
    Of course, it would say vacated on other grounds, and this was en banc reviewed, and so there's always a question whether they would believe it. 
    I think that this dicta is so extraordinary that the notion that, because it's dicta this Court can't address it, is a notion that--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1626.126" stopTime="1627.685">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    You'd like some dicta from us, too, wouldn't you?

    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    --Yes. 
    [Laughter] 
    Exactly. 
    The notion that this... the notion that the farther a circuit court goes in dicta beyond its proper judicial function the more this Court has to stay silent seems to me to be highly inappropriate, and I believe this Court has the supervisory power to inform lower courts when they clearly have violated the separation of powers limitations, so for that reason, yes, I think it is perfectly permissible, but certainly a cautious court would say that once justiciability isn't there, that there's no need to go on to any of the merits, including the dicta. 
    The--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1669.896" stopTime="1673.957">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You wouldn't just say a cautious court, a principled court should do that, shouldn't it? 
    [Laughter]
speaker="steven_r_quarles" startTime="1673.957" stopTime="1722.190">
    Mr. Steven R. Quarles 
    --That, too, Your Honor. 
    The uneven age management issue, I... well, first of all let me say that the notion about multiple use allocation, the bias toward timber, that was proven wrong. 
    If the Court had provided deference and looked at the administrative record, the fact is that primitive recreation received 26,000 acres, whereas timber harvesting will only occur on 7,000. 
    That's 15 percent of the forest that went to primitive recreation, 5 percent that would have gone to timber harvesting. 
    They make much of the fact that 126,000 acres were found suitable for timber harvesting, but the plan is clear that in the life of the plan only 7,800-and-some-odd acres would actually be harvested. 
    I think that's very important. 
    The second thing is, is that... thank you.

    That obligation is to come up with a plan that maximizes the net public benefit. 
    They didn't do that in this case, because they only protected 10 percent of this forest for recreational users like the respondents.

    They discuss the undervaluation, cautioned by their own experts, that they ignored, they talk about how the whole purpose of the plan's timbering program was to generate more animals like deer, skunks, squirrels, possums, of which there is an overpopulation in the area.

    That part we don't defend. 
    We do believe that was dicta, and that's highlighted by the concurrence. 
    But one other point I want to emphasize here, to really understand this whole case the Court needs to understand what it is, the injury that led to this case. 
    This case arose because Forest Service administrators only protected 10 percent of the only national forest in the State of Ohio, the sixth most populous State in this country, for this kind of back packing, undisturbed recreational use. 
    Now, that is the same kind of decision that the Government has conceded in their brief creates an injury, in this respect. 
    The Government has conceded that a decision not to close roads, for example, or as mentioned earlier, a decision to close off a forest area to offroad vehicle use, is an injury that's being inflicted. 
    This plan inflicted that injury when they basically said, we will not close off more of this forest from a wide range of activities--

    Yes. 
    Your Honor, in the complaint itself, I believe it is paragraph 25 talks about NEPA violations. 
    That allegation was based upon one principal argument that not enough alternatives made allowances for larger areas of protected 6.2... in other words, back country hiking. 
    We also specifically address in paragraph 20 of the complaint the failure to consider the road situation properly. 
    We also in our briefing extensively discuss the problem of undervaluation of the demand for back country hiking.

    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes

    The one thing the court of appeals did, besides talk about timbering, is how this plan failed to properly consider the demand for recreational uses of the forest.

    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    It did in terms of timber, but it also talked about it in terms of the Forest Service simply not valuating properly the demand for these other uses. 
    But even as to the timber program, Your Honor, there clearly is standing in this case. 
    This... there is no question, under a plan like this, there will be timbering. 
    This is not... the Government may be correct that... as to where and when the timbering will occur, but there is no question that there will--

    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    --Yes, there is, Your Honor, and we believe not only is the plan, the timing of this case the best time for challenging plan decisions which are unlawful, but it may be the only time, because in fact the Government has maintained a mantra in the courts below that goes like this. 
    It's either not ripe, or it's not relevant. 
    It's not ripe because you're too early, or you haven't exhausted your administrative appeals, the plan isn't finalized. 
    Now, we waited till we had exhausted our administrative appeals required by the Government's regulations in this case. 
    Now, when you go to tie up a project the Government's position has been highlighted in the ICL v. Mumma case that, well, wait a minute, this project only has to do with deciding whether this location fits the plan's conditions and serves the objectives of the plan. 
    It does not involve any review of the balancing act, the trade offs, the multiuse determination which is the core of all plans. 
    Therefore, it's not really raised by the project.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2399.333" stopTime="2445.414">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But your... it seems to me the premise of your argument is that every governmental decision needs to be reviewable immediately, and that... let's assume the FCC decides that it's... we are going to have no more than 5,000 radio stations per State, and let's assume that no State currently has any more than 3,000. 
    Now, that may be a very stupid policy for the FCC to adopt, but unless there's... unless there's some special provision for immediate judicial review, do you think that that generalized determination could be immediately reviewable when nobody is affected by it immediately?

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, no, because the... it seems to me on the analogy with Justice Scalia's hypothesis the injury in your case occurs when the hiker goes to the tract to hike and can't hike in it, or finds that the timber company's saws are waiting to cut, so the injury is imminent. 
    Isn't that the analogy?
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="2481.418" stopTime="2491.283">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    Well, Your Honor, our complaint is not just with timber, it's with a wide range of activities, including roadwork, road reconstruction, and many of those--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    And if the... you know, if the road building equipment is there and they're about to lay the asphalt, no question, I assume, on the Government's part you've got your standing.

    --Well, in... the plans... this plan would be purposeless. 
    It would be a meaningless exercise taking years of energy, millions of dollars, if the plan wasn't going to try to accomplish its objectives. 
    Its objectives. 
    For example, since the Court has focused on timbering, although I think that it's not the heart of this case, which is--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2520.235" stopTime="2522.728">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but can't you... I don't mean to cut off your argument, but--

    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    --That's all right.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2523.198" stopTime="2545.661">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --can't you make the same argument with respect to any prospective governmental determination that has not yet been implemented? 
    You can always say, they wouldn't be saying this, or writing this, or promulgating this unless they intended, in fact, to do what they say, and so if your argument is sufficient, it seems to me it really cuts the ripeness doctrine out of the law.
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="2545.661" stopTime="2581.626">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    Well, Your Honor, this is not a typical Government decision, in the sense that number 1 the very purpose of NFMA is served by having review of the plan at the earliest stage possible. 
    Secondly, this... by law, this plan is to set the objectives for the forest and these objectives, whether it's having more ORV or timbering to generate more deers, whether it's to have more hiking area, can never be achieved unless what the plan suggests be done be done.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2581.626" stopTime="2595.984">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right, that may be, but isn't the question before you whether your objection to these objectives cannot be raised and fairly litigated until the moment at which they start to implement it? 
    Isn't that the problem before us?
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="2595.984" stopTime="2606.092">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    Yes, Your Honor, and the reason it's not a problem is for three reasons. 
    First of all, the first injury is inflicted the moment the plan is finalized, because that injury is, they haven't closed off more of the forest.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2606.092" stopTime="2651.040">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But nothing may change from what is, and I suppose this is the problem lurking behind all of this. 
    There may be some things that will immediately injure somebody in this plan, or... but you're coming to a court which this abstract challenge. 
    You say, court, go over the whole thing. 
    There's lots of problems with this, and it's sort of a super... you're putting the court as the superadministrator over an agency when nothing is done, has been done, and courts, you know, are accustomed to thinking small, to having a concrete case where somebody is hurt or is about to be hurt, but this sprawling, what... first it's clearcutting and then it's the motorcycles and the birds. 
    It's just everything, and that's kind of overwhelming for a court.
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="2651.040" stopTime="2693.110">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    Your Honor, first of all, the heart of the injury here, I have to emphasize, is not having more area protected. 
    That's the claim. 
    For the State of Ohio, this is a... this forest is so small, to give you an idea, it's a... if you put it all together in a square, it's about 20 by 15 miles square. 
    You can hike this whole forest, across it, in a day. 
    The respondents, as put out in the administrative record, made clear, live in this area. 
    They use it every day. 
    Now, let me address the issue of too big a decision. 
    The real decision here and that we're arguing about is that basic decision, the equation that led to so little of this forest, which is a unique resource for the State of Ohio, being made available for back country hiking.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2693.110" stopTime="2729.485">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Now, even if you were right about that, couldn't a court just say what, essentially, this district court did. 
    The district court didn't throw it out on justiciability. 
    It looked it over and it said, we have to be extremely deferential to an agency at this just going in threshold stage. 
    Now, you have conceded that the bias part, the Sixth Circuit shouldn't have said... I think you said that... that this is not a dishonest, corrupt agency, so if you got to the merits at this abstract stage, wouldn't the agency be owed the utmost deference?
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="2729.485" stopTime="2796.880">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    Your Honor, the agency is owed deference but not absolute deference, obviously, as this Court has emphasized, Motor Vehicles Manufacturing Association being a good example. 
    A close look at this record, as I was trying to indicate earlier, shows the classic indicators of arbitrariness. 
    When an agency completely fails to explain or even analyze a warning from their own experts, when an agency violates its own regulations and fails to factor in the negative impact of timbering, when an agency justifies a timbering program to get more deer when their own regulations say you've got to consider what's surrounding the forest and there's a deer problem throughout the private holdings around the forest, that reaches a level of arbitrariness under this Court's standard, even with deference. 
    And to get back to the injury question on ripeness, the reality of the situation is, this plan is being implemented. 
    We're not dealing with a plan attack where nothing has happened. 
    Secondly, the plan will be meaningless unless they do do things. 
    Third, as Justice Scalia emphasized, and I think it's critical in this case, this is not like the NWF case. 
    This is not 2 million acres. 
    This place is so small that literally, as indicated in the--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2796.880" stopTime="2825.530">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What is the... if you'd focus, it would help me. 
    If you'd first assume with me that you didn't clearly argue... I know you don't want to make this assumption, but let's assume that you clearly... or did not argue clearly that you're trying to protect the hikers, the bird watchers, et cetera, from the motorcycles. 
    Assume that all that is at stake is a claim that you made that we are harmed by clearcutting. 
    All right. 
    Focusing solely on that now, I'm curious as to why it's ripe.

speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2826.839" stopTime="2852.148">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What they've said, the Government, is it will be ripe at the point when somebody has a definite plan to cut the tree, i.e., the permissions have been granted, this tree will be cut. 
    At that point you would come in and say, this tree is going to be cut. 
    We think that's unlawful because it flows from an unlawful plan, making just the arguments you make now. 
    Now, why can't you do that?
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="2852.148" stopTime="2901.291">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    --Your Honor, if literally this Court were to rule that the entire multiuse analysis, which means factoring in total demand for recreation, for hiking, total demand for hunting, total demands for wildlife preservation, total demands for timbering, that whole equation and balancing that goes on in a plan can be reviewed in the context of a single timber project, then that would lead to the review that we're seeking. 
    The problem is and the reality is that the record concerning the plan has been completed. 
    The siting of a particular timber sale is not what we're concerned about. 
    We're not concerned about that tree over there, or that tree over there. 
    We're concerned with how much of the total area is going to be protected from any timbering. 
    And I have to emphasize this. 
    Perhaps I can get this one point across. 
    Timbering is being viewed here--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2901.291" stopTime="2928.540">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Excuse me, but if and when they go beyond what you think the amount of the area that should have been allowed for clearcutting, then certainly that whole issue would come up. 
    For example, if you think it's arbitrary and capricious to allow any clearcutting at all, then the very first logging enter... attempt would enable you to challenge that portion of the general plan which allows any clearcutting, wouldn't it?

    Number 1, the factors that go into that siting have nothing to do with the plan decision. 
    All that you do in a project level is decide, does this meet the plan's standards, will it meet the plan's goal.

    If they had not put aside 40 acres, or 4,000, or whatever they'd done, they'd put aside some different amount, and we have no way of knowing it would have been this tree.

    --The reasons we don't think that ripeness in this case calls for tying it to a particular project is twofold. 
    First of all, because the project specifics do not illuminate, they aren't really relevant to the larger plan decisions, secondly the whole purpose of NFMA is to get a plan and get it clarified as early as possible, and third, there are many projects which occur of which we don't even get notice. 
    I guess since the Court wants to focus on the timbering, which I have to emphasize again is... it's the collection of activities that's the injury here, many of which happen instantaneously when the plan's adopted. 
    But a timbering example. 
    In this plan, there is provided for what are known as wildlife openings. 
    It sounds wonderful, but really what it is about is doing three--

    I didn't--

    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    --Openings.

    --Openings.
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="3105.505" stopTime="3147.072">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    Openings, and under the plan the Forest Service is going to go in and cut all the threes in 3 to 5-acre areas, up to 17 cuts in a 1,000-acre area through the designated areas. 
    The purpose is to promote deer and other wildlife associated with it. 
    Now, the Government has suggested to you there's some big, formal decision making process, and appeals, and a real clear opportunity to challenge all this. 
    That's not the way it works. 
    A forest ranger one day will decide, hey, the plan calls for wildlife openings. 
    Under their own regulations and rules, that is categorically excluded from any further formal analysis and any appeal process, so the forest ranger decides, okay, I'm going to go over here, I'm going to cut down 5 acres, and we're going to have a wildlife opening, and the next day he'll pick another area.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3147.072" stopTime="3169.279">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    I think you're making a pretty good argument for the fact that you can go in before the moment of the cutting, and maybe you can go in now, because you're saying, I won't get notice and, in fact, the hardship of waiting until they start cutting will in practice mean we'll never get to challenge them, but that's a very different thing, I think, from the challenge to clearcutting as such.

    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    Well--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    I mean, that... I can see the... your argument there, whether it wins or not, is much stronger than your argument with respect to clearcutting tracts which will require further administrative action, which you will have notice of.
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="3181.325" stopTime="3198.307">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    --Well, Your Honor, timber cuts... the timbering program is much more than just the big sales. 
    For example, a lot of prep work goes in before the first tree is cut, even for a big sale. 
    They have to build trails, some of which may be a short couple of miles, which are categorically excluded from any appeal process or further assessment.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3198.307" stopTime="3202.591">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, but do they build those trails before the timber cut is approved?
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="3202.591" stopTime="3259.055">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    Your Honor, they build trails both for timber cuts, in which case they would not build them before they're approved. 
    They also build trails to do what is known as timber management, which is to do things to the timber to make it grow faster. 
    They also for the purposes of wildlife openings... and again, if we're talking about openings just to create more deer habitat. 
    They will go in... these rangers are making these kinds of decisions under a plan every day, and a good percentage of those decisions are not subject to any formal decisionmaking process, and I'm not even mentioning now the whole issue of roads and ORV trails and, you know, the other things the Court is uncomfortable with, although I assure you they were raised in the administrative record and have been a subject of discussion below. 
    The real issue here is, how much of this forest is going to be available for the millions of Ohioans who want to go hiking somewhere and not run into a motorcycle and not watch timber being cut and not have huge openings, and not have too many deer running around causing accidents on the road on the way in.

    If we wanted substantiation for the argument that you're now making, is it contained in any other decisions of any other courts, or in the record here?

    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="3283.392" stopTime="3304.045">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    --Your Honor, the Forest Service's own regulations, and their own Forest Service handbook, which is certainly available to the Court, talks about projects being categorically excluded. 
    They have fire break limitations, they have a whole list of certain kinds of things that are excluded from formal decisionmaking and appeals. 
    So it is true that on the large timber sales we get a notice, but even there, Your Honor, they are certainly impending.

    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes

    It is so small, and even if you do timber, at its peak of timbering in the Wayne it was providing barely over 1 percent of the timber that comes out of Ohio.

    --at all should be allowed here?
speaker="frederick_m_gittes" startTime="3346.664" stopTime="3385.530">
    Mr. Frederick M. Gittes 
    --Your Honor, I didn't use zero, but our contention was the timbering program was illegal, and the reason clearcutting came up is because, since the forest plan chose as its objective trying to create habitat for more deer, which nobody needed, that automatically meant clearcutting, because the Forest Service's own analysis says, if you want to clear the forest the cheapest and fastest way to do it is to cut everything. 
    Therefore, that's why the plan said 80 percent of all cutting's going to be by clearcutting. 
    But it's the timber program that was the complaint here, and the heart of the complaint wasn't even that. 
    It was, give us more of this forest, if not all of it, so the people of Ohio can have one place--
