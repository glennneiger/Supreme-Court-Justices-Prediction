Brogan v. United States

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1579, James Brogan v. the United States. 
    Mr. Holtzman.

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, may it please the Court-- 
    The narrow issue presented by this case is whether or not a simple exculpatory no, unelaborated upon in any way, is actionable under 18 United States Code 1001. 
    The answer to that question is no. 
    It was never the intention of Congress that it should be, and Congress' intention is manifested by the 1934 incarnation of the statute, which is basically the one that we're dealing with here. 
    And I base my conclusions on the fact that in United States v. Gilliland, a 1941 decision of this Court, the Court held that the purpose of the statute, and Congress' intention in passing it, was to protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversion which might result from deceptive practices which are described in the act itself.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="67.770" stopTime="72.096">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what part of the text of the act do you rely on for the exculpatory no?
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="72.096" stopTime="171.041">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    Well, the portion of the... the text itself does not have a provision excluding from its coverage the exculpatory no. 
    However, it's my position that you cannot divorce the meaning of the statute from what it was that Congress intended the function... the statute to serve and, as I say, the Court in Gilliland recognized that, and most recently in United States v. Woodward the Court again indicated that that was the purpose of the statute and the intention with which the statute was passed by the Congress. 
    And, indeed, I might also add that United States v. Lambert, which is a Circuit Court of Appeals case, the perversion of governmental function was characterized as the hallmark of a 1001 violation. 
    It's the petitioner's position that a simple exculpatory no made in response to a Federal agent's question as to whether or not the individual committed a particular crime cannot have the effect of perverting governmental functioning and, indeed, following Gilliland there ensued a landscape of jurisdiction which came to be conveniently called the exculpatory no doctrine which began in the 1950's in the district courts and then the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Paternostro in the early 1960's----

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Holtzman, may I clarify what your point is? 
    It's not that you're saying it isn't a false statement. 
    Are you saying it isn't... it can't be material? 
    Is that--
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="182.053" stopTime="190.657">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --No. 
    My point is that... my point is that the statement is false, or the statement can be false--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

    Make any false statement.
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="205.090" stopTime="234.530">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --Yes. 
    The statute that we're talking about is basically the 1934 incarnation of the statute, which had some subsequent changes but not of any significance in connection with the issues involved in this case. 
    In 1948, for example, the statute which, prior thereto, included false claims as well as false statements got divided up into two separate sections of the code.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="234.530" stopTime="239.185">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But still, it's... the words you're dealing with is any false statement.
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="239.185" stopTime="256.116">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    Yes. 
    In fact, actually the statute, Your Honor, says false... when it refers to oral utterances refers to statements in the plural, and I'd like to reserve a little time to address that very directly, if I may.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="256.116" stopTime="267.657">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But your argument, then, is based on legislative history that, as you said, no is a false statement, and nonetheless it doesn't come under the words, any false statement because?
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="267.657" stopTime="286.400">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    Well, the courts have interpreted statement to mean those statements which are capable of perverting governmental functioning, and therefore the use of the term statement in the statute cannot refer to the type of statement that we're talking about, namely, the exculpatory no.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Pardon me?

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And in fact it is quite extraordinary that a court would take this rather simple language and derive some other meaning from it, isn't it? 
    I mean, we have plenty of cases from this Court precedent saying the first thing we do is look at the language of the statute.

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --I'm not disagreeing with that proposition as a general matter. 
    What I am saying, however, is that this Court has repeatedly recognized that where the application of the statute, plain meaning application of the statute would pervert or thwart Congress' intent or produce absurd results, then there is the--

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --Well, the absurd result that would ensue here is the fact that, as Gilliland indicated, the purpose of the statute, or the intention of the Congress was to prevent the perversion of governmental functioning. 
    The kind of--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Gilliland gives this Court's opinion as to what Congress' intent was, but that simply doesn't prevail over the language of the statute, which, as Justice Ginsburg points out, your client's answer is clearly within it.
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="364.557" stopTime="379.925">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --No... well, I respectfully disagree on this ground. 
    As I say, at one time as many as eight circuits took the position that I'm articulating, to wit that you had to look to Gilliland to find out what the--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="379.925" stopTime="387.486">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's why we granted certiorari, because there's a conflict between the Second Circuit and the other circuits. 
    That's why we're here, to resolve that question.

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --Yes, I understand that. 
    I understand that very well. 
    The point that I was trying to make was that the exculpatory no, in the context that we're talking about, is incapable of, as a matter of law, and so the circuits have held, of perverting governmental functioning.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="407.070" stopTime="410.492">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But there's no requirement in the statute that it pervert the governmental function.
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="410.492" stopTime="449.820">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    No, but this Court, as I say, has held in Gilliland that that is what the statute is about, that the statute was passed with the intention of preventing and punishing those false statements the effect of which is to pervert governmental functioning, and the juris... this... the juris... excuse me, the jurisprudence that has grown up surrounding this has pointed directly to that. 
    In other words, that the reference to the term statement does not embrace a statement that does not have the potency, the power to undermine governmental functioning in this particular--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="449.820" stopTime="457.271">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, does that mean that in every case in which the officer who hears the false statement knows that it is false, that the false statement is therefore outside the statute?
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="457.271" stopTime="494.662">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --In substance, yes, it does, because as the lower courts have indicated, that an experienced Federal agent, when he hears the exculpatory no, especially in this case... this presents perhaps a wonderful context in which to view it... didn't ask the question, and doesn't normally ask the question as to whether or not the individual has committed the crime in order to evaluate the truth or the falsity of the statement. 
    Instead, it's generally a... an investigative technique, and the--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="494.662" stopTime="501.738">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes. 
    I assume if your client had given a truthful answer, the answer would have been used and admitted against him, wouldn't it?

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --Indeed, I believe it would, Your Honor.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="503.518" stopTime="505.283">

    So I assume it's a good reason to ask the question.
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="505.283" stopTime="508.344">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    It is a good reason, but on the other hand in the circumstance--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="508.344" stopTime="510.375">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    It's not merely an investigatory technique.
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="510.375" stopTime="533.411">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --Well, it is an investigatory technique in the sense that, certainly in this case, this was a prelude, so to speak, to induce the cooperation of the petitioner to perhaps testify against other individuals that the Government had evidence against were culpable in connection with this acceptance either of bribes or gratuities.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="533.411" stopTime="540.488">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But in any case, whether there is or is not a statutory violation is a function of the governmental agent's state of mind.

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Oh, I thought it was, because I thought you said that if the governmental agent who hears the false answer knows it's false, that it therefore does not fall within the violation--

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman

speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="562.384" stopTime="578.909">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    Well, the touchstone is whether or not the response is going to send the Government off on a wild goose chase or, in the alternative, is the exculpatory no response, nothing different than, really, silence, and just sends the Government agent back to his office to continue doing--

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    Well, my response to that is, first of all I don't take the position that lies are protected as a general proposition. 
    I think that the Government took the view that the Fifth Amendment does not protect lies. 
    I might say that the exculpatory no jurisprudence, in addition to articulating the considerations from Gilliland, have also expressed a solicitude for the Fifth Amendment, although they've never... no court that I know of has indicated that a violation of the Fifth Amendment occurs as a result of cornering a suspect into either, on the one hand incriminating himself, which is somewhat incompatible with the accusatorial nature of our system of justice or, on the other hand, committing a 1001 violation.

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --Well, in Bryson there's a distinction because of the fact that... as I recall the facts in Bryson... I think we're talking also perhaps about Knox as well... there was the opportunity by the individuals in those cases to contest the questions that they wound up answering falsely. 
    In other words, in Bryson, if I remember correctly, it was a situation in which the individual had to file an affidavit with the NLRB indicating that he was not a communist. 
    In Knox it was a case involving the filing of tax forms with respect to gambling earnings and employees, et cetera. 
    And in each of those cases certainly there's a distinguishing factor in that each of those individuals had the opportunity, by the process of litigation, if you will, rather than being confronted by agents in their house, of litigating the propriety of the questions being posed to them and whether or not--

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --I don't... I think in one of those cases there was an indication, and perhaps in both of them that there was an indication that subsequent case law indicated that the individuals in those cases would ultimately have prevailed had they taken that course. 
    That is my recollection of those cases.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    What... why do you say, assuming that it's part of the basis for this statute, and a necessary element for conviction under this statute, that Government functioning have been impaired? 
    Why isn't the conduct of an investigation concerning bribery and corruption within a Government agency, why isn't that investigation part of the Government's function?
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="762.958" stopTime="777.204">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    It is part of the Government's function, but the question is whether or not the false exculpatory no response perverts that function, and I suppose that one way in which I can dramatically illustrate it is the Rogers case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="777.204" stopTime="780.889">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    It would have facilitated it. 
    I don't deny that for a moment. 
    But on the other hand, the question is, did it pervert it? 
    Did the Government do anything different than they would have done had he simply remained silent and, indeed, I might point out to you that there was not a scintilla of evidence at this trial that after the response from Grogan the Government went off and did anything that they wouldn't otherwise have done had he remained silent.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Since he did, he had two options, to tell the truth or to lie. 
    By telling the truth, he would have facilitated the investigation. 
    By lying, he prevented that facilitation from occurring. 
    Why does that not impede the investigation?
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="830.433" stopTime="847.644">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    It doesn't pervert the investigation. 
    Perhaps we're talking semantics between impeding. 
    The Government investigative agent's job is to go out and investigate the commission of crimes so as to bring them to prosecution. 
    If the--

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --No, no, I'm not asking the Court to hold that, by the way. 
    I'd like to make that clear. 
    What I'm saying is that certainly there are Fifth Amendment implications in this, as recognized by the circuit courts of appeals over the course of 30 years and while, as I said moments ago, no court of appeals has said that this practice violates the Fifth Amendment, certainly the courts have said that it comes uncomfortably close to doing that. 
    And I don't know that the opinions of all of these courts of appeals on that subject, namely the notion of coming uncomfortably close, that the Government is going to corner you and either force you in effect to incriminate yourself or, alternatively, violate another criminal statute, especially where there's an opportunity, if the statute were to be so interpreted as to permit that, where you can have all kinds of absurd results. 
    For example, in this case the very offenses with respect to which the questioning occurred were ones, with one exception, one payment, the statute of limitations had passed.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="992.399" stopTime="994.242">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, that's all the more reason for him to tell the truth.

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    Well, I might say to Your Honor that if he had been advised of that, that might be all the more reason to tell the truth. 
    The Government, of course, I might say had a theory about this case, namely that it was a continuing offense, and that therefore the statute of limitations hadn't passed, although the district court ultimately ruled that it had. 
    But what I'm suggesting to Your Honor is that if this statute is permitted to be wielded in this way, in disregard, in effect, of what the intention of Congress was in enacting it, then you have a situation in which it is subject to tremendous abuse, and I might also mention--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1028.759" stopTime="1058.014">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We don't limit statutes on the basis of the particular evil that Congress was trying to remedy. 
    I mean, many statutes go beyond the narrow evil that Congress was immediately concerned with. 
    Their language is a bit broader, and it includes some stuff on the fringes, and that's simply the case here. 
    There is nothing whatever in the statute about impeding the investigation. 
    That's a substantial limitation on the statute, and you want us to read it in even though it's not expressed?

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Do you know any other laws we do that to? 
    We say, well, the law doesn't say anything about this, but really... really, what Congress was really worried about was not what it expressed so expansively. 
    It was really worried about something more narrow, so we're going to just read the statute that way. 
    That's an extraordinary way to read statutes.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Are there any words in the statute that you--

    --I mean, do you put any weight on wilfully or knowingly at all, or--
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="1110.508" stopTime="1160.441">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    No. 
    I cannot... I can't... and I cannot place any emphasis on any particular words in the statute. 
    As I say, the exculpatory no jurisprudence evolved as a result of this Court's decision in Gilliland and the circuit courts of appeals' understanding as to how this statute was to operate, and one of the ways it was not to operate, and one of the things that Congress did not intend, was for this statute to be used in the fashion that it has been used. 
    And even the Government, I might say, in its policy statement has eschewed the use of the statute in this very way. 
    If you look at the Government's policy statement with respect to prosecutions under 1001, the Government says that such prosecutions should not ensue where there's just a simple exculpatory no response, unadorned, unelaborated upon.

speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="1164.425" stopTime="1178.793">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    No, but I would suggest to Your Honor that it's of some significance that the Government's own view, the agency that is in charge of prosecutions of the Federal law, has adopted this policy, and--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1178.793" stopTime="1214.091">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It seems to me-- 
    --It is significant. 
    I would worry about it. 
    It seems to me that you're reading Gilliland for far too much. 
    The question in that case was whether or not the statute should be confined to property loss, or... to the Government, and the Court said, oh, no. 
    This statute was designed to prevent perverting the function of the Government, it applies to all agencies with all jurisdiction of the Government, and that ended it. 
    It was basically a way to reject a narrowing construction. 
    It was not itself a narrowing construction, or am I misreading Gilliland?
speaker="stuart_a_holtzman" startTime="1214.091" stopTime="1267.805">
    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --No. 
    My understanding is the enactment prior to 1934, which was interpreted in Cohn, or the statute was interpreted in Cohn, the incarnation prior to 1934, indicated it was directed only at pecuniary losses. 
    The Secretary of the Interior, in order to aid enforcement of New Deal legislation, went to Congress in view of the Cohn decision and apparently urged that there be a statute that would protect the Government against something beyond or in addition to pecuniary interests, and Gilliland indeed indicated that the statute, which was the '34 enactment, was calculated to prevent and the intention of the Congress was to prevent the perversion of governmental functioning, and it's from that point of departure--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1267.805" stopTime="1272.740">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Yes, but that was in the context of rejecting a narrowing construction, much of the kind that you're offering to us here.

    Mr. Stuart A. Holtzman 
    --No, no. 
    It may have been... it may have been... it may well have been in that context, but the fact of the matter is that Gilliland certainly was interpreted for 40 years in the way in which I'm indicating. 
    Namely, the exculpatory no doctrine found its origin in the 1950's, and by the 1960's, and I'm talking about district courts in the fifties, but by 1960 Paternostro, the Fifth Circuit, based upon exactly what I'm referring to, namely the language of the Gilliland decision, interpreted the statute as not being applicable to this type of situation.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I don't... I agree with Justice Kennedy. 
    I think your reading of Gilliland is, I believe, mistaken. 
    I see only one sentence in there that... in the opinion that talks about the perversion, and it says the amendment indicated the congressional intent to protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversion which might result from the deceptive practices described. 
    Now, it doesn't say that was the only intent of Congress. 
    It says that is one of the intents of Congress, and I have great difficulty seeing how you can draw out of that one sentence, one statement, in fact how the courts of appeals have drawn out of that one statement--

    I was about to say, I... thankfully I'm not alone in this interpretation. 
    There have been eight courts of appeals which have taken the same view that I have taken, or that I'm advocating at this point, and it's based, certainly, on the Gilliland decision coming from this august body.

   Argument of Seth P. Waxman
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="1698.613" stopTime="1732.351">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    Section 1001 makes it a crime for anyone knowingly and wilfully to make any materially false statements within the jurisdiction of a Federal agency. 
    That language, by its terms, applies to Mr. Brogan's statements to investigative agents in this case. 
    Whatever policy justifications one might proffer for an exculpatory no exception, there is no support for it in the statute or, for that matter, in its legislative history.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1732.351" stopTime="1769.243">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    General Waxman, can I just... this was not on your watch, I'm sure, but I'm just curious as to why it took so long for this issue to come before this Court, and that there are so many circuit courts that have adopted the exculpatory no doctrine over what, 20 years, more than that, and the Justice Department itself has provided in its manual to United States attorneys that where the statement takes the form of an exculpatory no, 18 U.S.C. section 1001 does not apply regardless of who asks the question. 
    How did all this happen?
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="1769.243" stopTime="1826.780">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Well, that's a pretty broad question, and I'll try and give as many answers to it as I can. 
    As to why it hasn't come up before this Court more often, I think one reason may be that the Government frequently, in exercising its prosecutorial discretion about which crimes to devote its prosecutorial resources to, frequently prosecutes, tends to concentrate its resources on criminal behavior where something more than a mere exculpatory no was involved. 
    But even in cases where we prosecute a mere exculpatory no... for example, the Bryson case in this Court, the Woodward case in this Court... the doctrine of exculpatory no is so obscure and, notwithstanding the representation that there is some wall of authority out there by the court of appeals recognizing it, which in our view more resembles a rubble than a wall, it simply is not a doctrine that has stood as a major impediment to the kinds of prosecutions that the Government chooses to bring.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1826.780" stopTime="1843.103">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But your manual for United States attorneys recites it. 
    Where the statement takes the form of an exculp... frankly, I wouldn't have known what an exculpatory no was until this case came up, but your manual-- 
    [Laughter] 
    You know, where the statement takes the form of an exculpatory no, 1001 does not apply.
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="1843.103" stopTime="1856.753">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Justice Scalia, our policy statement is just that. 
    It is not... does not purport to be an interpretation of what the law requires. 
    The Justice Department has never taken the position in any court that the exculpatory no is--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    If it were my decision, and I think I do have a voice, I would say that we might alter the language of the guideline a little bit. 
    I don't like the use of the word appropriate in the guideline, but the U.S. Attorney's manual is full of policies that represent just that, determinations by the Attorney General about how to allocate what are, after all, scarce prosecutorial resources. 
    Now, one of the reasons that motivated our policy was that in the broad scheme... realm of possible Federal crimes a simple exculpatory no, or a false statement to an agent, is not up in the pantheon, along with many of the other things that we have to deal with, but another reason--

    For example, the statute of limitations runs on a crime, you go to the suspect's house and you say, did you do it, and he says no, so you get him for a false statement. 
    Is there any such thing? 
    It doesn't fit the definition of entrapment, but you have been saying so far it's not a very serious crime, but is there also some concern with abusive use of this question?

    That is true, and this case, of course, was prosecuted and the jury was instructed after, although it was just after this Court rendered its decision in Gaudin.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --Absolutely, and the lower courts are uniformly concluded that.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But don't we attribute the agent's knowledge... he made a report to the agency. 
    He says, the employer said that these union representatives took bribes, gave a list.

    Would it still be... meet the materiality requirement?

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman

    It may very well, you know, alter the judgment of the agency itself in deciding whether to recommend, the prosecutor in deciding whether this is a case that's worth prosecuting and, as Justice Scalia pointed out in response to my colleague's questions, his response to that question, even assuming that the agent... agents in this case believed that he had taken bribes, or taken payments prohibited by the Labor Management Relations Act, his response, no, did... was capable of influencing, and--

    --I agree. 
    Now, let me extrapolate a little. 
    Once you accept that, like most statutes, this statute won't be taken with complete literalness. 
    Then the next part of the argument, I take it, is, let's look to where this statute... what it was aimed at. 
    It was aimed at procurement, getting money from the Government, and then Harold Ickes said, let's extend it to all regulatory programs, and then no one thought at the time, apparently, that one function of one Government agency is to investigate crime, and therefore, by happenstance, it makes every statement made to a criminal investigator a separate crime. 
    I'm not saying it doesn't do that, but it could have been happenstance.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Well--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2952.850" stopTime="2991.475">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So that being so, it wouldn't be so surprising to exempt from that statute which makes making statements not under oath the same evil as making perjury under oath, under amazingly strict conditions. 
    And now we write a little exception into that statute which is the same in the statute as the fairly wellknown prosecutorial exception for the exculpatory no is in respect to perjury. 
    In other words, carry it over, all done sub silentio, without a word in the statute. 
    Now, I take it that that's what the courts of appeals were doing, and it isn't totally without support, is it?

    So I take it your strongest case here would be to say, take the prosecutorial history of the perjury statutes, note the problem of abuse with the exculpatory no there, and sub silentio bring it in here in a statute that really, just by happenstance, covers all crimes being investigated as opposed to what Harold Ickes thought.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --I think what's interesting, Justice Breyer, is, if you look at the perjury cases there is no exculpatory no doctrine under the perjury statutes. 
    It's not something that has arisen under the perjury statutes, and the Government feels perfectly free, where it can prove a knowing, false statement under oath in a judicial matter, and it's something that comes within 1621 or 1623, to charge it.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    General Waxman, perjury is a statement under oath, and I was thinking in the noncommunist affidavit case, when you have to write out your signature, and you affirm that this is true, there's a more deliberate quality to that than just blurting out no. 
    So the cases that you were asked about that involved an oath, it seems to me that there is more of a deliberation involved on the defendant's part, and that's why I thought you had the statement in the manual that it's not appropriate. 
    I didn't think that that was... it didn't sound to me like it was simply a resource allocation decision.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --Well, I'm happy, personally happy to see that the word is gone, but in any event, you know, it's interesting, your pointing out a distinction that is between a false denial that's deliberative, as opposed to one that's not quite deliberative. 
    That's a distinct... the various courts of appeals that have recognized some form of this "doctrine" have come up with an amazing number of distinctions, but to my knowledge that's not one of them.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Well, that, of course, is not the law in almost any of the circuits that have adopted this doctrine, and it's also one that would be totally artificial.

    Well, it's what... insofar as what the judge allowed into the record it's what happened in this case. 
    That is not what happened in this case, and it's also why this prosecution was not even in fact inconsistent with this policy, but the judge excluded from evidence the conversation that followed the socalled "exculpatory no" in this case.

    There is not a... an absolute, a priori distinction, but there is a... there... the following distinction does exist. 
    The latter question is a pure question of fact. 
    The former question is a mixed question of fact and law, and in order for the Government to convict somebody with respect to a false no in response to the former question, presumably we would have to prove that the defendant knew the elements of the crime of bribery.

    This is a statute which I think the record shows has been applied by the Government over the years in a very responsible fashion. 
    I mean, the fact that, notwithstanding all the years that this has been in effect, the petitioner is not able to come up with, even hypothetically, let alone a real decided case in which the Government has abused its authority speaks volumes.
