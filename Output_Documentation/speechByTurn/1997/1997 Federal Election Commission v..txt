speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="40.578" stopTime="174.931">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    In holding that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, was a political committee within the meaning of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the court of appeals misinterpreted this Court's decisions, and it did so in a case it should not have reviewed on the merits, for the respondents do not have standing. 
    AIPAC is an association engaged in issue advocacy and lobbying. 
    The FEC investigated a complaint filed by individuals who disagree with AIPAC's policies, and the FEC concluded that AIPAC had, quote, likely made inkind contributions aggregating over 1,000 in a calendar year. 
    The commission then considered whether AIPAC was thereby a political committee under the act, in which case it would be required to disclose all receipts and disbursements over 200 dollars, whether or not they were related in any way to a campaign, and it would be limited in how much money it could receive, and from whom. 
    The commission, interpreting the statute in light of this Court's decisions in Buckley and Massachusetts Citizens for Life, concluded that, because campaignrelated activity was not a major purpose of AIPAC, its incidental campaign spending did not require it to comply with the act's restrictions on political committees. 
    In concluding that the FEC acted, quote, contrary to law, the court of appeals erred in two ways. 
    Let me just say a few words about the merits and then address the standing issues. 
    In Massachusetts Citizens for Life, this Court deemed it, quote, undisputed that an organization making nearly 10,000 in campaignrelated spending was not a political committee because its major purpose was issue advocacy, not election activity. 
    In so holding, this Court relied on its earlier conclusion in Buckley that, quote, to fulfill the purposes of the FECA, the term political committee need only encompass organizations that under... that are under the control of a candidate, or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Has the FEC changed its notion of who are members within the meaning of the statute so that the expenditures that were made here might be ones that were for publications that went to members, in which case the statute wouldn't be involved at all?
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="205.652" stopTime="218.367">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Justice O'Connor, a great deal has happened with respect to the membership issue and the law relating to who consti... what... who is or is not a member since the FEC made its decision in this case, and let me--

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman

    It did after the decision in this case, but that regulation was struck down by the court of appeals in a case that it decided a few years after the FEC made a decision in this case.

    --That is correct, and--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --Well, I... I agree that it is, like many other things in this case, somewhat mysterious, but I think what the en banc court of appeals concluded, and I think correctly, is that for purposes of deciding this case, the FEC's determination was that the people that AIPAC considered members were not, in fact, members, and that the FEC is now in the process of determining... of fixing on a definition of membership which it has not yet done, but still takes the position that membership can be defined in a way to exclude all people who pay 50 dollars a year in dues to AIPAC.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --Absolutely AIPAC took that position, and in fact the joint... the general counsel's brief and report that are reprinted in the joint appendix devote a very substantial portion of time addressing AIPAC's contention that these papers... these people were just its members, and therefore these weren't expenditures or contributions in any regard. 
    The commission concluded otherwise, and the commission is now propounding a rule which, if adopted--

    --General Waxman, isn't it--
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="386.424" stopTime="394.373">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --would permit them to adhere to that insofar as AIPAC still has the same rules with respect to membership as it did at the time.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="394.373" stopTime="402.090">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --But isn't it true that, if they follow the definition of membership that the D.C. Circuit has followed in the case Justice Ginsburg referred to, then these people would be members?
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="402.090" stopTime="425.986">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Well, I don't... I don't think that the... my problem with answering the question, Justice Stevens, is that the D.C. Circuit did not apply, as we understand it, a rule with respect to who was a member. 
    The D.C. Circuit simply struck down the commission's prior rule, which required, as a bright line test, that no matter how many dues anybody paid, and no matter how affirmatively they tried to be a member--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="425.986" stopTime="426.736">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    They had to vote.
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="426.736" stopTime="476.373">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --there was a bright line requirement that you had to be able to vote for at least one member of the governing body. 
    That was, in many ways, the ratio decidendi of the commission in this particular case, and that was struck down. 
    But in Chamber of Commerce, the D.C. Circuit left open the possibility that an organization like AIPAC, which requires only 50 dollars to establish oneself as a member, might properly be deemed to be not a member by the FEC, and in fact in the petition for... in its... in its opinion denying rehearing in Chamber of Commerce the court of appeals emphasized that it is open, still open to the commission to define membership in a way... I mean, it wasn't addressing this particular case, but to define membership in a way that would or wouldn't include AIPAC members.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --I think you can and should reach the merits. 
    No one in this case, even AIPAC in response to the disposition at the administrative level, has challenged the membership issue. 
    It's not been briefed anywhere. 
    It's a factsensitive question, and it may very well be true, Justice O'Connor, that if the court of appeals opinion is sustained, or you otherwise dispose of this case in a way in which the commission will have to reevaluate it, that antecedent question will have to be litigated again. 
    But right now, it seems to me the law of the case, as it comes up, and it's not a question presented--

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --General Waxman, just... I don't understand. 
    First you're saying, don't reach the merits because there's a standing hurdle, but if you should find there's no standing hurdle, skip over another possible hurdles... this is my concern. 
    This question, political question, is not easy, and it could be a really important thing to a lot of organizations that just have mailing lists, that don't have duespaying members. 
    Why should we decide that question in a case where it may well be that this particular organization qualifies as a membership organization, so the question is really academic for AIPAC? 
    Why shouldn't we hold off on such a question until we're sure we have the kind of entity that would be affected by it?

    Justice David H. Souter 
    It seems to me the only thing we could do, if we are going to advert to that issue at all, is to say, it is in a state of ferment, and the one thing that seems clear is that there is going to be a redetermination, whatever the result may be, of what membership means at the commission level, and we ought to send this case back so that... so that if it ultimately comes to us it will come to us on a concept of membership, which is... which for the foreseeable future will be the permanent one and will give us a good reason to go the length of the adjudication that you want.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --Well, I do acknowledge that there is some appeal to that approach, but I would just ask the Court to look at this from the perspective of the commission. 
    The commission is now in the position of having been told by the en banc court of appeals that virtually any voter in the country can haul it into court whenever it makes a determination that a group, whether it's a civic or religious, or my family, or any other group has made more than 1,000 dollars in political spending, and therefore is required to file with the courts as a political committee, and... so in other words, that... virtually any voter can bring the FEC into court, because that's the standing rule they've applied, and that this... that the commission's efforts to apply the major purpose test that this Court enunciated is wrong, and in fact any group, incorporated or otherwise, that makes more than 1,000 dollars of what the commission would deem to be inkind, coordinated or independent expenditures is a political--

speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="744.140" stopTime="777.673">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Absolutely right. 
    It is a question... for purposes of the law of the case, there has been a determination by the commission in this case that AIPAC's, the people that AIPAC was communicating with were not members. 
    If we are wrong and, in fact, the major purpose test doesn't apply, on remand the FEC will have to consider and take AIPAC's views whether or not, in light of the court of appeals decision in Chamber of Commerce AIPAC's members are, in fact members under the act. 
    It is a very tricky--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="777.673" stopTime="828.246">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    General Waxman, I understand your anxiety about standing, and that sounds perfectly sensible, but I... what I don't understand is why you don't have a second step and say, if you should decide standing, then send it back to the commission. 
    The commission doesn't know yet what its membership thing is, but when it gets its act together this case may well be moot as far as a political committee is concerned, so I certainly understand why you want to urge standing first. 
    What I don't understand is why you're not telling us, but if we're wrong about standing, this case should not be... the ultimate question in this case should not be reached because it might fold at the commission level on what Justice O'Connor said at the very first is a threshold question, a preliminary question.
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="828.246" stopTime="837.039">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman

speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="917.554" stopTime="1010.610">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    We think... we believe that the Court erred in holding that respondents held standing in this case, either under the statute or the Constitution, to challenge the commission's decision. 
    In cases like Heckler v. Chaney and Linda R. S. v. Richard D., this Court has reiterated a fundamental background principle that ordinarily complaints that an agency has failed to take enforcement action are not subject to judicial review, but under the court of appeals' interpretation, as I said, it's now open to almost any voter to bring the FEC into court whenever it decides not to file an enforcement action against a religious, civic, issue advocacy, or any other group that may have made incidental election expenditures. 
    We believe that Congress did not intend that result, but even if it did, for Article III purposes we believe that respondents have not carried their heavy burden to establish either that they have suffered particularized concrete injury in fact, or that they will likely obtain the single remedy that they allege will redress them. 
    That is, a retrospective order of disclosure, and nothing else. 
    The FEC... and this is... I think the court of appeals erred in assuming to the contrary. 
    Unlike most other agencies the FEC has no authority, no matter what the court of appeals or this Courts decide, to order AIPAC to produce anything. 
    In fact, Congress' preferred remedy for a violation of the act, a conciliation agreement, certainly need not require this disclosure and is exempt from judicial review.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1010.610" stopTime="1020.308">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But isn't there this difference, General Waxman... and maybe I'm wrong on this and I just don't remember it that well... but if the FEC decides not to do anything, can't the litigants then proceed independently?
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="1020.308" stopTime="1026.025">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    In other words, if the FEC decides not to do anything, could the respondents sue AIPAC?
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1026.025" stopTime="1026.446">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="1026.446" stopTime="1131.311">
    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    Absolutely not. 
    Under 437g(a)(8), which is the judicial review provision that's at issue in this case, a third party... there is no third party right of action. 
    There is no private Attorneys General provision here similar to what there is in so many other cases. 
    Here, what happens is, the act provides that any person can make a complaint with the commission alleging that the FECA has been violated. 
    If the commission dismisses the complaint, and now I'm referring to the judicial review provision here, a party aggrieved by an order of the commission dismissing a complaint may file a petition against the commission in the District of Columbia, and under subsection (C) of that provision, in the event that such a complaint is filed, the authority of the Federal District Court and the court of appeals is simply to declare whether or not the FEC has, quote, conformed, acted in conformity with the law, or contrary to the law. 
    If the Court concludes that the FEC has acted contrary to the law, the case goes back to the FEC to allow the commission to conform itself to the law. 
    Only if it fails to do that may an individual bring a cause of action against the party that he or it alleges was violating the act. 
    This is a very, very unusual and limited review provision that reflects, we think, Congress' recognition of the fact that while it's important to regulate, for the benefit of the public, campaign expenditures, campaign spending, and disclosures, there are very, very First... important First Amendment--

    --These plaintiffs filed an administrative complaint with the commission under 437g(a)(1), and when the commission voted, 6 to nothing, not to proceed further on their complaint that the... that AIPAC should be required to file these reports and register as a political committee, they brought a suit in the district court against the Federal Election Commission under these provisions. 
    And I think... one of the things that demonstrates why there is so little standing in this case is reflected by the fact that in their original complaint, filed in the district court, these respondents alleged, among other things, that they were voters, and that they had been injured in the fact that they had been deprived of certain information they might have wanted to have as voters. 
    Their amended complaint deleted that allegation, and alleges standing on the grounds that they are political competitors in the court of public opinion.

    If Congress, instead of using the word aggrieved, had said, any person who suffers the following injury, and then just listed the things that you'd said, can do whatever it says there, would that have violated the Federal Constitution?

    Yes because... so it's constitutional, do... because I thought person aggrieved in a statute, the word aggrieved traditionally traces back... though that isn't clear, it traces back to Sanders Brothers, and cases that did use that to refer to a private Attorney General, at least arguably so, and then that's why I wonder if it's constitutional.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    I... it... it certainly does not always show they don't have standing, but I think it's instructive to compare this statute or their claim of standing here with a claim of standing under the FOIA, for example. 
    FOIA provides a personal right in an individual to ask the Government, to have that individual ask the Government for information, and if the Government doesn't provide that person information, that person is injured within the meaning of the statute and can bring a lawsuit, and there's no issue of redressability, because if the Court agrees with the individual he gets the document that exists. 
    The Federal Election Campaign Act doesn't create rights in particular individuals to get particular information. 
    It creates an obligation on certain persons and parties that are regulated by the act to provide kinds of information to the Government which the Government then makes available to the public generally, so--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1345.848" stopTime="1357.250">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But the public, each member of the public may not have a right in the sense of having a means by which necessarily it can compel the disclosure of the information, but each member of the public has an interest in getting that information.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    And I understand your redressability point as a separate point, but simply with respect to the particularized injury, why isn't the interest, the statutorily provided interest in getting information sufficient on that first point?

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman 
    --Because I don't think... and we do think that the stronger argument, the clearer argument against Article III standing is redressability both because of the discretionary nature of the decision, the particular aft powers and lack thereof of the commission, and particular facts in this case, but with respect to Article III injury in fact, these... even the court below acknowledged that there would not be sufficient particularized injury in all voters. 
    The court of appeals concluded that these were, quote, affected voters, but its definition of the term affected was, because they are alleging that... assuming that they are, in fact, suing as voters, that AIPAC may have participated in an election that they may have voted in they might have been deprived of information that they could have used, therefore, they... these individuals--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but isn't the argument stronger than that? 
    They are being deprived of information by virtue of the fact that they don't know whether there was, in fact, a contribution made. 
    The deprivation of the information is not contingent. 
    That's actual. 
    They don't know something, and that something that they don't know, it seems to me, is what the statute has given them an interest in finding out.

    Mr. Seth P. Waxman

    This... we're talking about who has standing to haul an agency into court and demand that the agency go and get information from particular individuals, even if the agency otherwise might conclude that they should... they are a political committee and they probably ought to report, but it just chooses not to exercise its prosecutorial discretion that way, and--

    There were two possible legal conclusions that the commission could reach. 
    One is, AIPAC is a corporation, and corporations can't make expenditures, and therefore AIPAC has violated 441b. 
    The commission voted 4 to 2 to conclude that they had, but decided not to proceed with any sanction at all, even a civil fine, because a) the law was so unclear, and b) it was a very close question on the facts, and those two--

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    First of all, our amended complaint certainly pleaded information standing and information injury. 
    Joint appendix 11, paragraph 6, the FEC's improper action has deprived plaintiffs of their legal right to learn the amounts and beneficiaries of AIPAC's unreported campaign expenditures in their capacity as voters and members of the public. 
    The only difference between standing in this case and standing in a FOIA case concerns the issue of redressability. 
    We certainly have a... within the zone of interests of this statute an interest as voters and members of the public in obtaining information concerning campaign contributions. 
    The Government admits in is reply brief that voters and, we would add, members of the public, are primary intended beneficiaries of this--

    It's all buried under the Defense Department or other agencies.

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    The only difference, though, goes to the question of redressability. 
    What the statute says is that the plaintiffs may file an administrative complaint seeking disclosure, and if that complaint is dismissed, they may go to court and say that's contrary to law, just what the respondents did, and then the question is, well, if there is a favorable ruling on the merits for the respondents, is it likely... Bennett v. Spear... that the ruling on the merits will, in fact, result in the disclosure that they seek. 
    That is the case here, for five reasons that are very different from the circumstances in Linda R. S. Number 1, a favorable ruling on the merits for the respondents would result in... would essentially mean that AIPAC is under a statutory duty to disclose the information that the respondents seek. 
    Second, the commission has power to order that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1920.288" stopTime="1925.629">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Are you saying that in that situation the FEC would have no discretion to decline prosecution?

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --I'm not saying no discretion. 
    That's not our burden. 
    All we need show to establish redressability is that it is likely that enforcement action would be taken that is likely to result in the producing of that information, and for four additional reasons that is the case here. 
    The second reason is that under the statute, 437d(a), the commission does have power to order AIPAC to disclose this information. 
    437d(a) states the commission has the power to require any person to submit such written reports and answers to questions as the commission may prescribe.

    --there are many cases, are there not, where anyone can come to an agency and say, agency, I want you to consider this, like, I want you to make a rule on that, and the agency statute is broad enough to say yes, we have to take petitions from anybody.

    That is undisputed. 
    They have a right to make an administrative request seeking disclosure, and if their complaint is dismissed, go to court, as they did, and it is likely to result in disclosure in this case for the two reasons that I've said so far, and for a third reason, that when--

    We maintain that what happens after AIPAC makes these communications to its contributors, that these contributors then not only go out in their individual capacities to make campaign contributions involving themselves in campaigns, but that they then report back to AIPAC that they have done so.

    Power vests... is at the top, and the 50 dollar contributor does not have much right to determine a policy of that... of the organization. 
    That's what the record shows so far, and based upon that, and if we have to litigate it further, yes, we have to litigate it further, but we staunchly maintain that these contributors are not members, but even if they were, there would be another basis for finding, upon further investigation, that AIPAC is engaged in political campaign contributions of a different sort, which I just mentioned.

    [Laughter]
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="2346.399" stopTime="2539.258">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --The commission has... when the commission finds a violation it is under a mandatory legal duty under section 437g(4)(A) to attempt to correct such violation. 
    Now, the likely way to correct a disclosure violation, by which I mean a failure to disclose information that should be disclosed, particularly where the information to be disclosed is readily available, is to demand that the information be disclosed. 
    Certainly, to maintain that it is not even likely that a good faith attempt to in... to correct a disclosure violation will not in any way involve a demand for disclosure of readily available information is absurd. 
    It is likely that a good faith enforcement of this statute under this provision to correct a disclosure violation will result in disclosure where the information is readily available. 
    Point 4, the record here shows that the information sought by the respondents includes types of information that is readily available. 
    What we're seeking essentially is, to which candidates did AIPAC contribute, and since the manner of contribution was inkind, essentially having the paid staff of AIPAC drum up support in the field for those candidates, how much time did the AIPAC staffers devote to those particular campaigns. 
    How much effort did they put into it? 
    This kind of information doesn't require elaborate reconstruction of records and broad disclosure this is simple information that is the core information that we're entitled to get and that we want to know. 
    We want to know this simple type of information. 
    AIPAC cannot plausibly claim that it doesn't know who its paid staffers were who engaged in these activities. 
    The paid staffers can't plausibly claim that they can't remember what candidates they supported, or what they did. 
    This is readily available information that can be disclosed. 
    The last point is that, on the record before the Court, when the FEC, during the investigation of this case, asked AIPAC for information, there wasn't recalcitrance and nondisclosure by AIPAC. 
    AIPAC complied with the FEC's requests for information. 
    What we have in the totality of circumstances, the record here and this legal framework, which gives the commission power to order disclosure, a likelihood that disclosure will result if AIPAC is found to be a political committee because the major purpose test is invalid. 
    Now, when we get to the merits, we face a fundamental question which Justice Ginsburg has been pressing what question should be decided first, the membership question, or the major... or whether... or the validity of the major purpose test. 
    I suppose... we put a lot of energy into briefing the major purpose test, and we're convinced that it's wrong, and then the Court... and we would like the Court to decide that question, but if the Court is troubled by the question and thinks the D.C. Circuit should not have reached it, it would be a permissible disposition of this case to say that the membership question ought to be addressed first. 
    I can't raise an argument against that.

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    I don't... the bottom line argument they say that I find in their reply brief as well, that's what the dicta in Buckley said. 
    The court of appeals properly held that this dicta in Buckley literally construed and applied in the way that the FEC has applied it here... for the first time, I might add. 
    This is the first time that the FEC has applied the major purpose test in this way... is contrary to law because it would eviscerate the statute. 
    It simply makes no sense to exempt from political committee status an organization that makes a million dollars in campaign contributions simply because they're rich and have got 9 million dollars to spend on something else.

    Well, but we would say under Heckler that we would... if Heckler applied, if the APA applied, that there would not be total denial of judicial review here. 
    There is law to apply. 
    Under 437g(4)(A) a conciliation agreement by the FEC must be one that corrects the violation. 
    That's law to apply, and if they... the court of appeals correctly determined, if the FEC's gave mere lip service to AIPAC's disclosure obligation and dismissed our complaint saying, well, we agree with AIPAC that they don't have to do it, we have a right of judicial review, and there is law to apply. 
    This statutory framework contemplates active judicial involvement in the determination of appropriate remedies for violations.

    What I did concede is that if Chamber of Commerce destroyed our contention that the AIPAC contributors are members, that certainly might say that we don't have standing, but it remains an open question. 
    It's just another legal issue in... to be decided in the case, and so I guess I'm moving a bit in your favor on... in the direction that you're going on that, Your Honor, because we have a collection of legal issues that need to be decided, the membership question, the major purpose test question, and in the way that's been discussed possibly that's linked to standing. 
    Presum... yes, remand for consideration of the issues in a different order I would think would be a permissible disposition.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Isn't the major purpose test necessary to prevent this statute from being applied to many, many entities and transactions that were far from the contemplation of the Congress?

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    What we're dealing with is a dual purpose organization. 
    The test is not necessary to protect dual purpose organizations from having their noncampaignrelated activities disclosed. 
    Dual purpose organizations can avoid that kind of disclosure through the simple expedient of setting up a separate organization or a special segregated fund. 
    Section 441b(b) expressly provides for that contingency, and then section 431 says that, well, when a corporation has set up a special segregated fund for purposes of campaign activity, only the activities of the special segregated fund constitute a political committee, and only those activities are subject to disclosure.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2813.588" stopTime="2849.308">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, is that so easy? 
    That is, what worries me about your position on the merits is that vast numbers of organizations who suddenly send a letter to their members once, who they think are members, the... you know, Congressman Jones helped save the Brazilian cardinal, and the... the bird-- 
    [Laughter] 
    --and we think that he's a wonderful thing, and really nice, and that's it, and all of a sudden they have to disclose everybody under the sun, and... you know, for all kinds of other things that really had nothing to do with that particular letter that somebody thought was a nice idea to send.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="2849.308" stopTime="2887.979">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Well, two points about that. 
    First of all, it sounds to me like the organization that you're describing would be... may likely be constitutionally exempt under the Massachusetts Citizens for Life exemption. 
    Now, if you've got a small issue advocacy organization that only makes an occasional independent expenditure and that would be burdened by the administrative requirements of setting up a special segregated fund, then clearly under MCFL they're entitled to a constitutional exemption. 
    They have that safeguard. 
    AIPAC's not that kind of an organization, a large, sophisticated organization, able to meet many administrative requirements. 
    They haven't claimed that--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2887.979" stopTime="2894.398">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    By the way, the person, before he wrote the letter, talked to Congressman Jones and said, what do you think of that? 
    Oh, a great idea, he said. 
    I like--
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="2894.398" stopTime="3042.868">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --So you're saying it's a contribution, and... well, I think I have to say two things about that. 
    Number 1, you know, every person is presumed to know the law, and if you run afoul of the law inadvertently, but in the manner that you've described, certainly there is enforcement discretion that the FEC has, can exercise and say, now, this one time thing you did, you made a mistake, it wasn't a wilful violation, you didn't know what you were doing, you can't do that kind of thing, don't do it again, and that would be an appropriate disposition of that case. 
    What we have here with respect to AIPAC is years and years and campaign after campaign of extensive contributions to candidates, and the public needs to know which current officeholders were the recipients of AIPAC campaign contributions so they can know in the next election cycle who they should vote for, considering that factor. 
    But your hypothetical might be one that could both... that might fall either within the constitutional exemption, or that might be appropriately subject to disposition by the FEC's enforcement discretion, in that manner. 
    But on the facts of this case, based upon the voluminous investigation that we have here, there are very substantial campaign contributions over an extended period of time here, and I think that distinguishes this case from that hypothetical. 
    All we need show to establish redressability is a likelihood that a ruling on the merits will result in disclosure. 
    We've shown the likelihood. 
    The Court... not only is the major purpose test not necessary to protect against what... the danger that the FEC hypothesizes, it's not sufficient to do so, either. 
    Under the test that the FEC has clarified it to be, a dual purpose organization that has as a major purpose campaign contributions will be a political committee even if another major purpose of the organization is pure issue advocacy, yet under their own test, as they apply it, that organization as a whole would be a political committee and be subject to all... full disclosure. 
    For this reason, of all its activities, including the noncampaign activity, the test is neither necessary nor sufficient to accomplish the goal that's put forward for it, and it eviscerates the statute, because the problem is, it exempts from disclosure campaign contributions, not just noncampaign activities. 
    If there are no further questions, I have presented the argument that I intended to present.
