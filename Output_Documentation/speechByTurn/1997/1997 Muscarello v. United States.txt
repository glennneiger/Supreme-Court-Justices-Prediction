Muscarello v. United States

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-1654, Frank Muscarello v. United States, and Number 96-8837, Donald E. Cleveland and Enrique GraySantana v. United States. 
    Mr. Klonoff.

    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    This case raises the issue left open in Bailey v. United States, what it means to carry a firearm under 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1). 
    Petitioner submits that for four principal reasons carries a firearm means, bears a firearm on one's person. 
    First, the plain meaning of the phrase, carries a firearm, directly supports petitioner's position. 
    Dictionaries repeatedly and consistently equate carries a firearm with having a firearm on the person. 
    Second, the Government has not cited a single dictionary that defines the phrase, carries a firearm, to mean transporting or possessing a firearm in a vehicle. 
    Instead, the Government improperly isolates the word carry, rather than looking at the specific context, carries a firearm, but although the term carry has multiple definitions, this Court has made clear in Deal v. United States and elsewhere that when a dictionary offers multiple definitions, all but one of those meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context. 
    Here, the context is carries a firearm. 
    Third, the Government's view would make carries a firearm the same as transporting a firearm, but section 924(b) and numerous other gun provisions use the word transport, showing that Congress knew how to get across the concept of transport when it wanted to.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Do any of those other provisions speak of transport in relation to a crime of violence, or a drug crime, or is it just transport in the abstract?
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="113.486" stopTime="135.665">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Well, there are a whole variety of provisions, Justice Souter. 
    I guess one that comes to mind is 18 U.S.C. 926 (a), which talks about transporting, shipping or receiving a firearm or transporting a firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry such a firearm. 
    That is the closest analogy.

    For an unlawful purpose, you say?

    No, it does not use that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="138.819" stopTime="143.099">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    For a lawful purpose. 
    For a lawful purpose? 
    It's a crime to transport it for a lawful purpose?
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="143.099" stopTime="150.112">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --Not... transporting, shipping or receiving for any lawful purpose from where he may legally possess.

    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I didn't realize we'd gone that far yet. 
    [Laughter] 
    In any case, I take it the other references to transport as a prohibition did not make the limitation that this prohibition has on carries.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="173.898" stopTime="176.758">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Not in that precise terminology, that's correct.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="176.758" stopTime="187.472">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So that to read it as the Government would read it I think probably would not, therefore, just duplicate, in effect, all of the other prohibitions on transportation, correct?
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="187.472" stopTime="190.456">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Well, we think that it would. 
    In fact, the Government itself in its--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="190.456" stopTime="209.198">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Maybe I'm not getting my point across. 
    I thought the reason that it wouldn't was that there's a limitation. 
    There's a restriction here, in relation to a drug crime or crime of violence, and that restriction does not occur in the instances in which transportation is specifically prohibited in other parts of the statute. 
    That's the only point that I'm trying to--
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="209.198" stopTime="218.256">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --No, I understand, but the during and in relation to is a separate component, but in terms of the meaning of the word carry we think that it is instructive to look at the other statutes.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --I still don't think you're understanding Justice Souter's point. 
    He's saying that just as you say the word firearm must be taken into account in determining the meaning of the word carry because that's part of its context, so also the phrase, in relation to a crime of violence or a drug offense must be taken into account in gathering the meaning of carry, because that is part of its context.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="243.560" stopTime="244.668">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Oh, I agree with that point, Your Honor.

    No, there are not.

    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --No, and that is correct, Your Honor. 
    There are some types of firearms as defined in 921 that you couldn't physically have on your person, of course.

speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="286.917" stopTime="298.303">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    That's correct. 
    Of course, the definition of firearm in 921 is for the entire Chapter 44, and it's not surprising that there may be situations that don't fit every circumstance, and that would--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="298.303" stopTime="306.220">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So then if you had a land mine in your... in the trunk of your car or in the back of the utility vehicle, that would be carrying it?
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="306.220" stopTime="312.875">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --It would not be. 
    Our definition of carrying is limited to on the person. 
    There are some kinds of firearms--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="312.875" stopTime="318.481">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So there are some kinds of firearms that cannot be carried and therefore there's no violation of the statute, in your view?
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="318.481" stopTime="323.246">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --Well, there could be a violation for using in those circumstances, or--

    Transporting.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="323.902" stopTime="329.618">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --Exactly, under other provisions, so there are a number of ways you could get at the same conduct. 
    If Congress wanted to--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="329.618" stopTime="340.832">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But are there any statutes in which Congress has defined something like firearm, punishing its carrying, but then the firearm is so defined that it cannot be carried? 
    I don't understand how that works.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="340.832" stopTime="387.593">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --Well, it only... as I said, it only applies to a small number of the firearms contained with the definition of 921(a)(3), and again we don't think it at all surprising that when you have a statute that's applied to the entire firearms chapter, that there may be one or two types of firearms as defined that you could not physically carry on your person. 
    That is a problem for Congress to fix under the proposed legislation, which would expand to include possession. 
    That would be encompassed, and I would submit that's a problem that Congress has to fix. 
    There are some oddities of the statute under any possible interpretation, but we don't think that the mere fact that some conceivable type of firearm could not be carried on the person should inform this Court's interpretation of the words, carries a firearm.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="387.593" stopTime="410.085">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    What about Judge Trott's view that whatever line is drawn here it would make no sense to say to the savvy criminal, hide the gun and you're home free. 
    Just don't keep it on your person. 
    Keep it where you can get at it when you need it. 
    Would that be a sensible line to attribute to Congress?
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="410.085" stopTime="481.493">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Judge Trott's analysis is entirely flawed. 
    If the Court looks at his opinion, he talks about the absurdity of a situation where somebody has a gun on his person and then puts it on the car seat and all of a sudden he's scott free. 
    That's not at all the position we're arguing. 
    We're not focusing entirely on the point of arrest, and if the Government can prove to the jury that the individual had the firearm on his person at some point during and in relation to the crime at issue, he would be prosecuted. 
    So in Judge Trott's example, there is adequate evidence under petitioner's definition of carries a firearm to convict that person. 
    Now, let me just respond, though, to Your Honor's question. 
    I submit that Judge Kozinski has it right in terms of what the everyday criminal thinks, and he thinks of carrying a firearm as packing heat, and I would give the Court an example that illustrates the point. 
    Two individuals are in a car. 
    They're on the way to engage in a bank robbery and they're very close to the scene. 
    The gun is under the back seat, or in the trunk, or wherever. 
    One individual says to the other as they're getting ready to pull up, hey, are you carrying the gun? 
    Where the gun is in the trunk or in some other place, no one would say, yes, I'm carrying the gun. 
    He'd say, no, it's in the trunk.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="481.493" stopTime="506.655">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, let me ask you this. 
    Suppose the person with the gun physically had it in his hands and put it in the car in order to go and have a drug transaction and in order to have a weapon available to facilitate carrying out the drug transaction. 
    You say the person would have carried the gun when he was putting it in the car.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="506.655" stopTime="514.668">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Depending on the crime. 
    For a crime of possession with intent to distribute, that's correct. 
    He had the gun on his person. 
    He would be carrying it. 
    He could have--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="514.668" stopTime="519.587">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I mean, carried it for use at the time the drug sale is made, for example.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="519.587" stopTime="521.024">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --Yes, during and in relation to.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="521.024" stopTime="529.897">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So can he be charged with carrying the gun because he carried it to the car, where he then put it where it was not immediately available?
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="529.897" stopTime="551.933">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Under our view yes if... as long as the Government can also show the during and in relation to, and for example, a possession with intent to distribute situation, where you're putting drugs in the car, you're putting your gun in the car, seems to me there's more than sufficient evidence there, and again, that's why I think Judge Trott's analysis is faulty, because in many of those situations you will have sufficient evidence of carries a firearm on the person.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="551.933" stopTime="568.834">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In every case, Mr. Klonoff, where you have a drug in the trunk... a gun in the trunk, a gun in the glove... someone carried it and put it there, so under your analysis, much would depend on how we define in relation to. 
    I mean, how far back can you go.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="568.834" stopTime="580.157">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    That is true. 
    In our case, though, there was a gun in the locked glove compartment. 
    There's no evidence of when it was put there, and the Government couldn't conceivably make the argument that that gun was carried to the--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="580.157" stopTime="590.995">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So it follows from your analysis that the informed drug dealer will have a drug... will have a gun in his car at all times, when he goes shopping, when he goes to church, and when he distributes the drugs.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="590.995" stopTime="602.803">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --If he's reading up on the statute that might be correct, but again, that's a problem-- 
    [Laughter] 
    And that goes back to what Judge Trott said. 
    But the point is, is that those oddities, we submit, are for Congress to fix.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="602.803" stopTime="614.861">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What are the oddities? 
    That's... I mean, I carry plants in the back of my car in the trunk, I think, haven't I, when I go to the nursery, pick up the plants, put them in the trunk, carry them to my house. 
    I always thought I was carrying the plants.

    We both find that odd. 
    What are the oddities on the Government's interpretation? 
    You said that was odd, and I'm not certain... I want to know--

    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --There are several. 
    First of all, under the Government's own theory, since movement is required, if an individual was sitting on a couch and the gun's next to him, he's not carrying it, so there's immediate access but the Government says it's not carried. 
    Secondly, it's not clear whether the Government's position--

    Not in my case. 
    I... if a drug connection was really evolving, it... let's say the drug transaction started down in Symphony Hall, and he had some guns hidden in a building near Symphony Hall, and once he made the conversation with the drug dealers they really knew they were going to a motel, and he went over to a building, grabbed his guns, and brought them and threw them in the trunk at that... while the drug transaction was moving, that would be different. 
    But in my case, sometime earl... much earlier in the afternoon, when he didn't know that where there was going to be a meeting, what the quantity was of... what the negotiations were, was he going to get the drugs fronted or was he going to rip the drugs off, there was no specific plan, he was charged with an attempt to commit possession with intent to distribute cocaine. 
    He wasn't... the other charges were dismissed. 
    That's the charge that he made a conditional plea to, so in our case he would be not guilty.

    To carry, you don't have to move the firearm. 
    You can carry a firearm by just having it inside your pocket.

    If you have the money in your pocket you are carrying money. 
    If you have even an unloaded firearm in your pocket, you are carrying a firearm, and the... what the transport theory does is, it might convict someone that has an unloaded derringer in the trunk, but it won't convict the big drug dealer that has an automatic machine gun in the next room that's sitting there, so... I mean, not that that has... we have to draw a line somewhere, but I just want to point out our thinking about this. 
    Again, there's no linguistic reason to define carry as an auto... as transporting, and pure transport has enormous problems, as I think we've pointed out to you.

    Mr. Norman S. Zalkind 
    Well, Justice Breyer, then you... you're adding to the interpretive problems even further. 
    You're getting into ambiguity with that, and if you're getting into ambiguity we start to think about the Rule of Lenity, because we're talking about very serious crimes. 
    In the Cleveland and Gray case, they got 10 years to begin with. 
    Forget about the firearm. 
    They start off with 10 years of their lives, and now we have this enormous minimum mandatory 5 years that's going to be added, and if they're not convicted of that the judge could have... in that case he could have used the guidelines, bump it up two more levels anyway. 
    So it isn't that the trial judges don't have power to penalize bad behavior, but we're talking about carrying firearms, a sort of narrow class of separate minimum mandatory crimes for people that are being severely punished, so--

    That would be the line that's drawn, would be at that point.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Most dictionaries seem to... which I'm sure we've all been looking at since this case arose, they seem to say two different things. 
    They say carry means to convey or transport as in a cart or a car, and also they say, to have or bear about one's person, as a watch or a weapon, locomotion not being essential. 
    I mean, they seem to have both concepts in there, so which one do we look to, and do you think movement is required?
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="1720.479" stopTime="1725.540">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    Our position is that Congress intended it to refer to both, and that movement is--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1725.540" stopTime="1733.396">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="1733.396" stopTime="1769.257">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --Yes, and I'll tell you why. 
    Ordinarily the word carry, with its etymological roots and its many common usages, refers to locomotion, but because common experience tells us that people move a lot, unlike vehicles, which sit parked in garages or at the curb for long periods of time, I think the concept that you have to have movement at a particular moment with a person has kind of dropped out or become vestigial. 
    And as a result when it's talking about carrying it on a person, although in point of fact if movement were required it wouldn't make any difference, because people do move, and the inference that someone has moved, if they have one on their person, would be very, very strong, but--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1769.257" stopTime="1772.583">

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --Yes, and my only qualification I would give for that, if the defendant is just storing a gun in the car in his garage, for example, I don't think that he's carrying it.

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    I... carry and transport, as the dictionaries, as every dictionary I think recognizes, there is a lot of overlap between the terms, but there's a couple of features that clearly... I think three things that clearly distinguish them. 
    First, carry requires that the person who's carrying it accompany the item that's carried. 
    I don't think transport requires that. 
    Second, carrying is more commonly used, and this may be just a question of connotations, but where the person who's doing the carrying also intends to use it, it's much more common to say that it's carried than used, and an example I'd give simply would be, if you're talking about a flashlight that maybe in the glove compartment of a car, it would be unusual for somebody to say, I transport a flashlight in the glove compartment of my car. 
    I don't think it would be unusual to say, I carry a glove... a flashlight in the glove compartment.

    I... you know, I don't... ordinarily it would be the driver, but it could easily be the passenger too, or instead of.

    Is it still being carried?

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    Our position is that it's still being carried. 
    It's still being carried because if the gun... it may or may not be in relation to a drugtrafficking offense, but if the gun is being moved from one place to another so that it can be of use and available in a drugtrafficking crime, then it is being carried.

    It's very strange for Congress to convey those two quite different meanings.

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --I think... let me approach that in two ways. 
    One is, the case with the caboose, I do think that would be a carry, but the term, the fact that the term carry, when you get a vehicle that's sufficiently large, the Queen Elizabeth, or something like that, whether... the defendant is in one place, the gun is in another, whether the term carry has some fuzziness in that kind of a case I don't think should affect the fact that in a case like these, which is where you have it in a vehicle and where I think it would ordinarily be said that the gun is carried--

    Those cases just make the point more vivid, and the point is, it seems strange... sure, the word can bear each of those meanings, but it seems strange for Congress to pick that word without using an additional word to cover both of them.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="1986.153" stopTime="2003.975">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --I... yes. 
    Your Honor, I don't think it is strange, for two reasons. 
    One is, I do think what Congress was getting at was the act of taking that gun to the scene of a drug transaction, just as the defendants were doing here, and it was not material to Congress whether defendants did that in a suitcase, on their... in a pocket, in the car, in the trunk, or on the seat. 
    They--

speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2016.079" stopTime="2060.235">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    Right, and I think that that's crucial, because what Congress... as this Court I think recognized in Bailey, what Congress was concerned about was not just criminalizing their possession of someone who keeps a gun in their house and who then... they were worried that that, the fact that someone keeps a gun in their house should not be a predicate liability here if it has no other relationship to the crime or if it's just a matter of intent. 
    But where someone takes the intentional act of taking the gun and taking it with that person, as these defendants did, so it would be at the scene of the crime... in fact, in the case of Cleveland and Gray, it would be essential to commit that crime because they were intending to rob drugs from another, a dealer, then I think that is the crime that Congress was trying to get at.

    The two things I don't see about your definition. 
    The first thing I don't see... these may or may not be relevant, but I don't see why you say the train, why he's carrying it in the train, unless he happens to be Sidney... who was the person, Averell Harriman or someone, who owned the train and was also the engineer at the time. 
    Then I guess he's carrying it, but otherwise I would think he's arranging to have it carried. 
    I don't understand that part, and I also don't understand this last part where you say having it on the person is carry within this, because I would have thought on your theory that's what Kozinski was talking about, packing a gun. 
    That is, I thought that the second definition in there, in the dictionary, was referring to the instance where there is no physical movement but you say, are you carrying a gun, and the answer to that question is yes, even if the person has never moved an inch, because sometimes carry means packing, and I don't see why you bring either of those two things within your definition.

    I guess... I think that because of common... under common experience people do move very frequently, the word no longer requires much in the way of movement at a particular moment when it's on the person, but if the Court were to hold otherwise that would be satisfactory with us.

    There are numerous statutes that authorize Federal officers to carry firearms. 
    But equally important, State law consistently recognizes that carry can be used to mean all of those things in a wide range of different contexts and statutes, and--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Before you get off the example you gave about these other statutes, I think it seems to me that the petitioners have an adequate response to that, and that is that when you talk about permissive statutes authorizing Federal agents to carry guns you can apply the principle that the authorization of the greater is implicitly an authorization of the lesser.

    --I agree with--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2399.442" stopTime="2415.092">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So that if you author them to carry a gun in the sense of bear it on their person, you obviously authorize them to take it from place to place whether it's in the trunk of the car or on the seat, but you cannot use the greater includes the lesser for criminal punishments.

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --But Your Honor, I don't believe that we are trying to use the greater to include the lesser here. 
    I think you could construe those statutes that way, but you also could look at those dozens of statutes and say that Congress used the natural word there, carry, to refer to a whole variety of things that they were referring--

    If there is this amount of different possibilities in the meaning of ambiguities, then surely the Rule of Lenity comes into play somewhere.

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --Your Honor, I would think it would, but not in this case, because I don't think there is any ambiguity, any substantial ambiguity in the question of whether you can be said to carry something in a vehicle. 
    I think that that's clarified by all of the ordinary canons of statutory interpretation. 
    I'd like to make one point related to the State laws, which is petitioners argue that Congress was unaware of all these numerous State laws and therefore we shouldn't pay any attention to them in construing section 924(c). 
    Well, when Congress enacted section 924(c) in 1968 it said the statute provided for prohibition of carrying unlawfully during a predicate offense. 
    When they said carry unlawfully, they were exactly intending to pick up, and they knew that they were intending to pick up State law on carrying. 
    An unlawful carry was a carry that was primarily in violation of State law. 
    There were very few Federal laws that governed carrying at the time. 
    Now, there's no denying that in 1968 there were numerous State statutes that prohibited carrying in a vehicle, and when Congress removed that--

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --That's right, and it was only the ones they were... they were referring to State law which plainly recognizes that carrying can... some States it could refer to a vehicle, some States it couldn't, but the term... the ones that we've heard of person say, carry on a person, and the ones that require immediate accessibility say, carry about a person.

    Oh, I don't know, it seems to me if I'm a person reading... isn't that the test? 
    If I'm a person reading a statute, would I be given adequate notice that that's what it's about? 
    It's a statute making it unlawful to carry a firearm, and you think I'm put on adequate notice that it's if I have it in the trunk of my car I'm carrying--
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2535.247" stopTime="2538.839">

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --I don't care about State statutes or anything else. 
    You could have dozens of them, but if the language doesn't give fair notice to whoever's going to be... going to get this mandatory minimum--
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2548.443" stopTime="2595.346">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --I think if someone were to read this statute and take... and say to his confederate in crime, say, well, you know, let's make sure that we have the gun on the seat of the car and not in your pocket, because if it's in your pocket you're going to be carrying it when we're driving to the drug deal, I think that would be a pretty improbable event, that most likely someone would read the statute and say, there's a severe penalty that Congress has imposed for this, and we should make sure that we're not carrying it, and we can't carry it in the car, we can't carry it on our persons, we can't carry it in any way. 
    I just want to add, though, about State law that when Congress removed the requirement of unlawfully in 1984 they were plainly intending to broaden the reach of the statute, and so it's really just a little question that from the time the statute was enacted in 1968 until the present, it's referred to carrying in a vehicle as well as carrying on a person.

    One of the reasons why the Court in Bailey construed the term use a little bit narrowly was to still leave some room for carrying. 
    That principle shouldn't be applied here to construe the term carrying narrowly and therefore leave a complete gap in the statute for things that people--

    Right, but it's the point... the offense has to be committed with the gun, and that is not the formulation that Congress used in 924(c), where it said during and in relation to. 
    The gun has to be carried during and in relation to. 
    But I think most significantly 924(b) is a broader statute because transport is a broader statute and as I said, where... what Congress had in mind was that the defendant him or herself is going to be the one who not only has the gun in the car, but then... with the idea that it will be used at some later date, I think it's much more natural to use the word carry than transport, which refers just to the bare movement from one place to another for some purpose or for somebody else to use it or for all... for all kinds of other possible reasons.

    In Cleveland and Gray's case I think probably it would be, because they were going to use the gun in order to rob the dealer and... to steal drugs from another drug dealer, and I think--

    It's been used that way since 1968. 
    There's... no court has ever said that it's not used that way, and I think that's a reflection of the way that term would ordinarily be used and ordinarily understood by Congress at that time and at each of the times that it's amended the statute since then.

I think that Congress was very concerned with seeing to it that the conduct that leads up to the possible use of a gun, this was... the carrying offense is really meant to kind of take care of the preparation for use, and for Congress it was of no moment whether someone takes a gun, puts it in an attache case, locks it, and carries it--

    You say preparation, but the statute says during and in relation. 
    You say during any crime. 
    Surely the during has a different connotation than preparation.

    Mr. James A. Feldman

speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2915.484" stopTime="2941.973">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --I'm talking about in preparation for the use. 
    I'm really not talking about, here, in preparation for the crime, and I think what Congress was trying to get at was that if someone takes a gun in preparation to commit a drug offense and puts it in a suitcase... Cleveland and Gray, for example, in this case had taken... they took... they planned to rob the other dealers. 
    They put the gun in a bag. 
    They put it in the trunk of their car and waited for the call to determine the rendezvous point where they would meet them. 
    Now, if they had instead... and it happened it was far enough away they needed to take the car, so they got in the car and drove there.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2941.973" stopTime="2943.847">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --But robbery is a separate offense.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2943.847" stopTime="2945.175">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2945.175" stopTime="2945.987">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That isn't the drug crime.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2945.987" stopTime="2990.064">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    That's correct, but their drug crime was attempted possession with intent to distribute. 
    It was going to be their attempt to get the drugs. 
    But if they had carried... the rendezvous point had been a couple of blocks from where they were and they had carried the bag in their hands rather than in the trunk of the car, it would have made no difference from what Congress was trying to get at in this statute. 
    What they were concerned was getting that... people taking that gun to the scene of the crime and especially as this Court has interpreted use, I think they didn't want to have to wait until someone actually pulls it out and starts using it in a very active sense in order to say that that... we want to keep that gun away from that drug offense, and whether they take it there in their car, or take it there in a bag I don't think was of great significance, nor should be in interpreting the statute.

    Is carrying... the half of carrying that doesn't consist of on the person, is that always transportation?

    No, it's not always--

    I don't want to lead you into the hole.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="3012.041" stopTime="3012.353">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --Yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3012.353" stopTime="3055.976">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But I am sort of bemused by section 925, which says the provisions of this chapter, except for a few sections which are not the one we're talking about here, shall not apply with respect to the transportation, shipment, receipt, possession, or importation of any firearm or ammunition imported for, sold, or shipped to or issued for the use of the United States or any department or agency thereof, or any State. 
    Now, I suppose that that... you know, if transportation includes carry, I guess that would let the... or if carry is always transportation, the carry section wouldn't apply if you're using a... I don't know, a gun that's been taken from a Federal agent, which wouldn't make much sense.

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --My answer is no. 
    My answer is no for another reason as well, which is, as I said, I think transportation doesn't require that the defendant accompany the gun, and I think carrying does require that the defendant accompany the gun. 
    And again, that points out why the... the seriousness of this offense and the reason why Congress wanted to get at carrying, which is, they were concerned with the defendant taking the gun along so that it would be there and available for use at the time when the defendant is prepared to commit a drug deal to possess the drugs, to rip off another dealer, to sell the drugs, whatever it is the defendant--

    --I'm sorry--

    --carrying usually involves transporting it, but transporting it does not always involve carrying it. 
    I don't... does that help?
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3110.860" stopTime="3121.137">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --I thought carrying, at its heart, from Middle English on, was having somebody in a cart, or a car, and we often use the word transportation for that.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="3121.137" stopTime="3165.307">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    That's correct, and I think... I didn't... there's certainly a great overlap between the two words, but there are some different uses. 
    For example, where you take a gun to have it... to transport it to somebody else in another State, but you're not going to accompany it, I don't think you'd say that you're carrying it in that case. 
    So there are differences between the two statutes, and there's reasons why Congress would have chosen to treat them differently. 
    I also think, though, that where it's ultimately intended that the person who's doing the carrying is going to be the one who's doing the using also, it's much more natural to refer to carry rather than use, as, for example, you carry... as I said before, you carry a pen in your pocket, you carry a flashlight in your glove compartment. 
    You could say you're transporting the flashlight, but I think it's much more natural to say that you're carrying it. 
    Thank you very much.

    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Thank you. 
    The Government's argument in answer to Justice Breyer's question about where are the anomalies in the Government's position, the Government really couldn't answer what happens when a car is stopped, and if it does apply, then the whole theory of transportation makes no sense. 
    The Government couldn't answer the train hypothetical. 
    These are going to create enormous linedrawing problems for the, for future courts. 
    The Government really couldn't explain the passenger situation. 
    Where does this rule get them if the only person that can be charged under that theory is the driver, so we would submit that the Government--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, it seems to me in the great runofthemind cases the gun is in the glove compartment, or in the... in a bag under a newspaper on the passenger seat within easy reach, or even in the trunk. 
    We don't have too many cases... just like we don't have too many cases with missiles, we don't have too many cases with guns in cabooses, and--
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="3216.396" stopTime="3225.423">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --There are cases of guns in ships and trains, and there are many, many cases of guns in the back seat between the passengers, and the Government's position is anomalous there. 
    Now, in response to Justice--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3225.423" stopTime="3230.562">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Guns in the suitcase on the train. 
    I mean, if you get on a train, you chuck your suitcase up on the rack or in the back of the car.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="3230.562" stopTime="3260.377">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --Exactly. 
    In response to Justice O'Connor's question... this points up Justice Souter's point about the reason for construing carry narrowly... the Government does prosecute transport in precisely these circumstances. 
    We cite in our reply brief United States v. Albaron, the Fourth Circuit case, exactly the same situation, gun in a glove compartment on the way to a drug transaction, so there are statutes to get at precisely this situation. 
    In terms of the State statutes, we would disagree with the Government's position. 
    The Congress was not incorporating the whole sweep of State statutes. 
    It would be--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3260.377" stopTime="3265.204">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but on the State statutes let me ask you this question. 
    There are several State statutes that say carry on the person.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="3265.204" stopTime="3266.548">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --There are a few. 
    Most of the--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3266.548" stopTime="3270.468">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Would you not agree that if you're correct the words, on the person in those statutes are redundant?
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="3270.468" stopTime="3273.185">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --Those few statutes. 
    There are many statutes that say--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3273.185" stopTime="3276.699">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So at least some States thought carry was broader than on a person.
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="3276.699" stopTime="3314.700">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    --Well, most of the States say on or about, and many of them, 22 of them, and they're cited in the Cleveland brief, say on or about, or including broadly, in the vehicle. 
    Now, those 22 States would be surplusage under the Government's position. 
    You wouldn't need to say in the vehicle. 
    So the overwhelming weight of the State statutes, we submit, supports our position and not the Government's, and at most, as was pointed out in the questioning I think by the Chief Justice, all you get from looking at the State statutes ultimately is an application of the Rule of Lenity. 
    There is no way that you come to the conclusion that the Government's position is unambiguous, so we submit that that whole exercise simply demonstrates why the petitioner should prevail.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you to comment on one other thing that's kind of puzzled me? 
    In our opinion in Bailey we said that a person puts a gun next to him during the transaction, it just sits there, that's not use, and one reason why it's not use was, that would leave no room for carry to cover that situation. 
    Do you think that situation is covered either by carry or use?
speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="3332.255" stopTime="3338.221">
    Mr. Robert H. Klonoff 
    Well, I don't believe that the Court was referring to the situation where the gun was just laying there in terms of carry. 
    The examples of carry--
