Bragdon v. Abbott
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="10.108">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-156, Randon Bragdon v. Sidney Abbott. 
    Mr. McCarthy.
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="10.108" stopTime="78.994">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    Some risks are acceptable. 
    We know when we build a major bridge or a tunnel that there are risks of death during the course of construction, despite reasonable precautions, but these risks are acceptable because there are benefits to society and because the workers are not compelled to participate. 
    Ms. Abbott and her supporters believe the risk to the lives of dentists is outweighed by providing inoffice treatment to HIV positive patients without additional precautions. 
    Dr. Bragdon believes that when he provides service in the face of the risk of death, he should be allowed to take additional precautions. 
    This raises one of the fundamental questions in this case. 
    What is the proper legal standard for determining when to impose liability on a dentist facing a claim of discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act when the direct threat provisions are implemented?
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="78.994" stopTime="98.135">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. McCarthy, may I ask you to clarify at the outset whether you recognize that once the symptoms are visible, what is now described as AIDS, once a person has that disease, that that would constitute a disability?
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="98.135" stopTime="118.848">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    I think that's very likely, Your Honor, but our position is that the definition applies for disability, and the definition is when there's a physical or mental impairment and here we're talking about HIV, that substantial limits a major life activity, if that comes into play, then the person's disabled, then it seems very likely it would come into play if a person had visible symptoms of HIV disease.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="118.848" stopTime="121.941">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    You concede there is a physical impairment, or don't you?
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="121.941" stopTime="136.801">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    I don't... we don't concede that, although we see the force of the respondents' argument on that issue. 
    We note that the Fourth Circuit in Runnebaum found that there was no physical impairment and we're unwilling to concede that issue when a circuit court of appeals has made that finding.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="136.801" stopTime="151.970">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I thought it was curious that the American Medical Association took the position that it is a physical impairment under the act from the beginning, and the dental association, on the other hand, takes the opposite view.
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="151.970" stopTime="177.729">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    Well, I'm not sure what position the dental association takes with regard to physical impairment. 
    We don't think that it's really essential to the arguments that we are making in this matter. 
    Our arguments are directed to disability and... rather than a physical impairment. 
    There was, it appears to us, a great deal of confusion about those terms in Congress, where Congressmen and women sometimes didn't seem to understand the difference between impairment and disability.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="177.729" stopTime="184.474">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the act seems to go further, and say if someone is regarded as having the impairment it's covered.
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="184.474" stopTime="202.456">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    I think that the language of the act says, if someone is regarded as having such impairment, and when they say such impairment they're referring to an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, so the regarded as only comes into play if you have an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="207.839" stopTime="217.745">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    In our view it wasn't really argued aggressively, but the issue has appeared. 
    The Solicitor General, or the Department of Justice raised it in the First Circuit.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    I believe the respondent believes that it has, and the record is somewhat ambiguous on that.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="226.392" stopTime="228.145">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Really a pretty skimpy record on that point.
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="228.145" stopTime="229.664">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    There's a very skimpy record on that issue.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="229.664" stopTime="247.196">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But you are contending that a rational Congress would draw the line and exclude from this protection a person whose symptoms are not yet visible, yet include someone who would pose perhaps at least equal danger whose symptoms are visible?
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="247.196" stopTime="294.189">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    No. 
    We do not think that Congress excluded individuals with HIV disease. 
    We think that congress defined disability, and you have to meet it. 
    Whether you are symptomatic or not symptomatic, you have to have a physical impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, and our argument goes directly to the statute, and there are certainly... although there may have been efforts to pass legislation that excluded contagious diseases, they were not successful, and we certainly don't take that position. 
    We take the position that you have to meet the definition, and the reason the issue is raised in a case like this is because this particular individual is a classic example of a person who had no symptoms, no difficulties whatsoever. 
    The record is very clear on that, that she doesn't have any of the sorts of attributes that are attributed to some asymptomatic and certainly some symptomatic HIV individuals.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="294.189" stopTime="303.776">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, do you say that we have to focus on daily public and economic life activities, as oppose to the more private activities that are the... really the basis for the respondent's contention?
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="303.776" stopTime="369.399">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    We get to that language when we look at reproduction as a major life activity, and there are sort of two parts of that, and the first part is, well, this... how do you get away from the idea that it's so major... obviously reproduction is so major, it must be a major life activity. 
    And we escape from that argument, we believe successfully, by the fact that Congress already narrowed that definition to what's in the regulation, and I say Congress narrowed it to what's in the regulation because they adopted the language, major life activities, from the 1973 act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act, so it was already in place that major life activities is limited to functions such as living, breathing, working. 
    When we get to that, the question then becomes is reproduction on that list of major life activities, and the reason it isn't is precisely for the reason I think you made inquiry with respect to, Your Honor, and that is, you have to look at the context and purposes of the Americans With Disabilities Act in order to determine what goes on that list, and the context and purposes are, day to day independent living and economic self sufficiency.

    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    We're... I'm making reference to the Department of Justice title III regulations, but it's also important to make reference in the sense that I just described to the regulations that issued under the Rehabilitation Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act.

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="414.031" stopTime="446.983">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Suppose you have a Congress that's been taken over by the Republicans after 40 years of Democratic control and Democratic judicial appointments and Congress, this Republican Congress does not like the kind of decisions that Democratic judges are going to be making, can Congress say that the interpretation of statutes shall be governed by regulations issued by the Department of Justice? 
    I find that extraordinary.
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="446.983" stopTime="484.719">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    --It certainly was unusual, and we don't... and we don't really rely on it in that sense. 
    Our reliance comes upon... comes out of the fact that the... that Congress knew when it accepted the term, major life activities, that major life activities was already under a term under the Rehabilitation Act that had already had an existing regulation, so it incorporated that, and there are two... I think you're making a distinction that's worth noting, if I understand it correctly. 
    There are two different ways they look at that, and one is simply knowing that that language already existed, and the other is attempting to say through the Senate and committee reports that they were adopting that language, and those are two different ways of looking at--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="484.719" stopTime="487.080">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The whole Congress said that through the committee report.
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="487.080" stopTime="489.181">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    --They attempted to say it through the committee reports.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="489.181" stopTime="490.302">

    --on those reports.
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="490.302" stopTime="549.541">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    Oh, no, certainly the whole Congress did not, but the committee reports made that argument. 
    We're not suggesting that those committee reports are significant. 
    What I'm trying to get at is an answer to the question of what role does independent... day to day independent living and economic self sufficiency play in defining what is and what is not a major life activity, and we think we've in a sense solved the riddle to how do you determine what goes on that list, and the riddle and answer is, you have this principle basis now for deciding what should be on the list, and that is these goals of the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
    Once you have those goals in mind and have this principal basis, you then say a major life activity is a activity which, if substantially limited by a physical or a mental impairment, interferes with the ability to achieve day to day independent living and economic self sufficiency, and when you apply that test you'll find reproduction doesn't fit that list in whatever fashion we describe as reproduction, but learning, hearing, working, breathing do.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="549.541" stopTime="571.504">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    If you stipulate that 3 or 4 years hence it is highly likely that major life activities of the kind you've been discussing will be affected, is the person disabled, have disability within the meaning of the act in the first year, when we know that it's inevitable that there will be an effect 3 or 4 years down the line?
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="571.504" stopTime="576.720">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    Well, of course, in a sense it... we think of it as inevitable, but recent--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="576.720" stopTime="577.389">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Let's assume that it's--
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="577.389" stopTime="623.911">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    --But if we assume it's inevitable the definition of disability certainly does not seem to attempt to affect future disabilities, which is the question that that raises. 
    In fact, I believe the EEOC guidelines for title I specifically say they're not addressing... and now I can't remember the term... gene based disabilities, or disabilities that are going to occur in the future in that sense, and the argument that because you know, almost know for sure you're going to have disabilities later on, you should be classified as disabilities now, I think simply goes beyond the statute. 
    The statute not only defines disabilities in a present sense, but if you open up the statute to future disabilities, then you start looking at hypertension, genetic problems, Huntington's chorea disease, whatever might exist in the future.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer

    --If that's correct, then let's take a person who had some eating disorder, or couldn't... that's not on the list, I don't think, eating disorders, but people are terribly frightened of getting it, so he can't eat except in very, very unusual ways, a very serious problem. 
    People are frightened to death of getting it.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, I would think so. 
    [Laughter] 
    And then if that's so, why isn't reproductive activity, which includes the person having a sex life, I take it... I mean, you'd think perhaps that that is at least regarded in this society as a major activity, portion of human life.
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="686.903" stopTime="696.550">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy

    Well, the regulation didn't refer to eating.

    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    --And it almost certainly is a physical or mental impairment, but a physical or mental impairment is different than a disability, and we know that it's classified, probably classified as a physical impairment, certainly if you follow the regulations, but the question is, is it a disability, and we get to... in order for it to be a disability, it has to be a physical impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.

    I think that's correct, that the... you can't get at what is a disability by what is allegedly discrimination, but what I was trying to get at is, we're now talking about reproduction as a... we're now talking about caring for oneself as a major life activity, and we know it is a major life activity because it's on the list, and the AMA tries to put health care services under that, and our first argument is it really doesn't belong there. 
    It's not caring for oneself, but we haven't even discussed that--

    The other part of the major life activity argument that I wanted to get at is the idea, this idea of the principal basis in day to day independent living and economic self sufficiency being the guide. 
    The reason reproduction doesn't fit within that group is, people who have limitations in fertility, or impotent, don't normally have difficulties with day to day independent living or economic self sufficiency, and that's--

    Well, if we're talking about HIV, the first question is, is it an impairment, and the regulation suggests that it is an impairment, and when we're talking about whether it substantially limits a major life activity, like being impotent or like being infertile, it has no relationship to this concept of day to day independent living.

    The direct threat must rely on an individualized assessment based on a reasonable judgment, relies on current medical knowledge, and in Arline this Court said courts should normally defer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health officials. 
    On those standards, assuming, as I think is correct, after 15 years and hundreds of thousands of people dead as a result of this disease, I gather after 15 years and hundreds of thousands of deaths, there isn't one case... maybe just one... in which a dentist, despite hundreds of thousands of dentists who do treat AIDS patients, there isn't one case in which one of those dentists documentedly caught AIDS from a patient.

    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    Well, there are two parts to that question, and first of all, we believe that assertion by the respondent is simply wrong. 
    The... in June of 1994 the CDC reported that there are seven HIV infected health care workers. 
    Seven with known occupational injuries, seven with known HIV exposures, and no other identifiable source of HIV. 
    The respondent dismisses these seven as--

    Mr. John W. McCarthy

    If I said health care workers, I misspoke. 
    They're all dental health care workers, and the CDC labels these as possible because it uses the term possible to mean anything that's less than absolutely certain, but when you look at the way the CDC treats these, they're all apparent occupational transmissions that occurred in the dental care setting, and any logical analysis under our way of looking at things would... by ours, I mean the legal system's, would include these were more likely than not occurrences. 
    And so--

    And the studies go on to indicate more often, much more often than not there is no such HIV test, and this passive surveillance system that revealed this finding is by the CDC itself disclosed to be as much as 90 percent underreported.

    I want to speak for just a minute, if I can, to the question of then current medical knowledge. 
    Assuming we get to the appropriate legal standard, which is good faith and reasonable judgment, relying on the objective standard of then current medical knowledge, what is advanced here by respondents and even by the First Circuit to a certain extent is the CDC, as if it were a public health authority that made a pronouncement here, and this is truly an emperor with no clothes. 
    The CDC has issued reports. 
    They are guidelines. 
    It establishes standards, and no place in the CDC guidelines does it indicate that there's no significant risk. 
    In fact, it specifically recognizes the unique nature of most dental procedures also may require specific surgery... strategies. 
    Universal precautions are minimum guidelines and there's no reason why additional precautions shouldn't be taken, and that's what the guidelines say, and if I can just say one more thing--

    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    --The standard is to look at thencurrent medical knowledge, and I think that's the only fair way to determine whether or not you're going to impose civil rights liability. 
    That's what's suggested by the amicus brief of the AMA here and in Arline, where they cite similar cases under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the point is that then current medical knowledge is the only way to judge it. 
    I don't really think the information has changed, but there's one significant piece of evidence here, and the First Circuit pointed it out, and that's how this emperor ended up having no clothes, is they had the CDC at the district court level, through a witness who was testifying, a litigation witness in a litigation posture from the CDC, making four different declarations that ultimately say something like, the risk is safe to treat, the dentist care in the... in this setting, and the point is you don't have that any more. 
    You just have the CDC guidelines by themselves, and that's why I ask you to look at the CDC guidelines, because they don't say there's no risk.

   Argument of Bennett H. Klein
speaker="bennett_h_klein" startTime="1537.815" stopTime="1601.207">
    Mr. Bennett H. Klein 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    The problem of discrimination against individuals with HIV was squarely before Congress when it enacted the ADA. 
    And the committee reports reflect a concern that unless there were clear protections against discrimination for all individuals with HIV, people with HIV would hide their condition. 
    As the First Circuit correctly found, Sidney Abbott, a woman infected with the virus that causes AIDS has a disability within the meaning of the ADA. 
    And this Court can affirm the First Circuit's decision on three alternative grounds. 
    First of all, this Court can affirm the First Circuit if it finds that reproduction is a major life activity. 
    In addition, the Court can affirm the First Circuit if it finds, as reflected in the committee reports and as the First Circuit also noted in its decision, that everybody with HIV, a fatal, contagious, incurable disease, is substantially limited in many different major life activities.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1601.207" stopTime="1605.960">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Klein, you say as noted in the committee reports. 
    That isn't the same as the statute, is it?
speaker="bennett_h_klein" startTime="1605.960" stopTime="1630.986">
    Mr. Bennett H. Klein 
    It's not the same as the statute, and I think that what is noted in the committee reports, which is the people with HIV are limited in major life activities, is consistent with the plain meaning of the... the phrase that Congress did choose. 
    Which was substantially limited in one or more major life activities. 
    As an incurable, fatal and contagious disease, people with HIV cannot engage in procreation or intimate sexual relations.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1630.986" stopTime="1722.326">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, why can they not? 
    The... the difficulty that I'm having with your argument is that you are... you are using the judgment that your client made, a... a very responsible moral judgment, as being equivalent to the limitation that the statute talks about and that the regs talk about. 
    And without certainly any disrespect for the moral judgment that your client has made, I don't find it that easy to transfer from the moral limitation that she has placed upon herself to the limitation that the statute is speaking of. 
    The statute speaks in terms of... of there being a substantial limit upon an activity. 
    And the regulation... I take it the regulation that's closest to it is the one set out on... on page 7a of the Government's brief. 
    And let me just read the sentence that gives me the... the greatest difficulty in... in relation to your case. 
    I am reading from the middle of page 7a-- 
    "A person is considered an individual with a disability for purposes of Test A, the first prong of the definition, when the individual's important life activities are restricted as to the condition, manner, or duration under which they can be performed in comparison to most people. " 
    "Can be performed" sounds to me like a physical capacity to perform them. 
    It doesn't sound like a responsibly, self imposed limitation. 
    Could you address the difficulty I'm having in getting from "can be" to moral limitation?
speaker="bennett_h_klein" startTime="1722.326" stopTime="1763.075">
    Mr. Bennett H. Klein 
    Yes. 
    And I'd like to address both under the... the meaning of the term "substantial limitation" and also the regulation that you quoted from. 
    The... the term "substantial limitation", by its plain meaning, doesn't mean that somebody is precluded from engaging in the activity, or even chooses not to engage in the activity. 
    "Substantially limited" cannot have that meaning. 
    Indeed, somebody couldn't be... ever be substantially limited in the major life activity of breathing if one had to be precluded from engaging in that activity. 
    Now, the regulations, which you quoted, indicate that a person cannot engage in the activity or cannot perform the activity under the same conditions or manner or even duration as somebody who does not have that impairment, or the average member of the population. 
    A person with HIV--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1763.075" stopTime="1766.756">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And the question is, why are those conditions moral conditions rather than physical conditions?
speaker="bennett_h_klein" startTime="1766.756" stopTime="1772.570">
    Mr. Bennett H. Klein 
    --Well, the... the limitation flows from the physical impairment of HIV.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1772.570" stopTime="1788.681">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No. 
    But the... the... the physical impairment of HIV, certainly at the asymptomatic stage that we're talking about here, does not in any... as I understand it... does not in any way limit the physical capacity to engage in reproductive function, whether it be male or female.
speaker="bennett_h_klein" startTime="1788.681" stopTime="1805.041">
    Mr. Bennett H. Klein 
    Well, I think that a person is limited... a person cannot perform an activity under the same conditions as somebody without the impairment if... if, for example, they can transmit a deadly disease to a sexual partner, if they can infect their child, and also because--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1805.041" stopTime="1810.637">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, you can say that, but is it true? 
    Yes. 
    I keep saying, why is the moral condition equal to the physical condition? 
    Why is that so?
speaker="bennett_h_klein" startTime="1810.637" stopTime="1828.930">
    Mr. Bennett H. Klein 
    --Because it all flows from the inevitable fact of the contagiousness of H... not only the contagiousness of HIV, but the fatality of HIV. 
    For example, reproduction is not simply the act of conception. 
    It... procreation and reproduction also involve raising and nurturing a child. 
    As a fatal disease--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1828.930" stopTime="1852.514">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, there again, that... that's... that's a fine statement. 
    And... and people who reproduce ought to consider how they're going to nurture. 
    But I'm not sure that that's what the statute is talking about. 
    And I'm not sure that that is what the courts have meant thus far in talking about reproduction. 
    I presume they have been talking about reproduction as in fact a physical, biological activity that results in the birth of a baby, in the normal course.
speaker="bennett_h_klein" startTime="1852.514" stopTime="1876.631">
    Mr. Bennett H. Klein 
    --Well, I think the plain meaning of the statute does not... does not preclude the re... does not require a preclusion of the activity. 
    In other words, just the phrase 
    "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, but for that impairment. " 
    --but for the existence of HIV, reproduction and procreation and the choices and decisions that people have to make around it would be very different.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, do... do you concede that it's strictly a moral limitation or a moral mandate that you're client followed? 
    I... I suppose a person with tuberculosis, which I assume can be very infectious and contagious, stays away from other people and we don't just call that a... a moral choice. 
    It is an objective limitation on that person's ability to interact with other people in society.

    Are there laws against it? 
    I mean... I mean, I can understand that if we quarantine everybody with tuberculosis. 
    Then it's not a moral choice. 
    And then you're compelled. 
    But you think it's not a moral choice if someone... I mean, let's say I have a very contagious cold. 
    And I decide, you know, not to... not to go on an airplane. 
    Is... is that a moral choice?
speaker="bennett_h_klein" startTime="1926.014" stopTime="1933.911">
    Mr. Bennett H. Klein 
    Well, I don't think that the key choice is a moral choice.

    And as the First Circuit noted--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1933.911" stopTime="1966.653">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but it flows through a choice about what I ought to do in relation to other people. 
    I ought not to expose the airplane full of people to my cold.

    And it seems to me that that moral choice is crucial to... to the... to the consequence that you draw from the physical act... the physical infection. 
    But... but are all good sens... I've been interrupted before you answered my question... are there... are all sensible safeguards for the public's safety moral choices?

    And the... then, even though you haven't shown symptoms yet, you haven't shown symptoms, you're not... you're not... you're not that... I mean, that... that is not so obvious, but I... can I ask you another... a different a slightly different--

    I read the ABA brief. 
    And it says none of the documented cases... the 42 they're talking about... involved a dental practitioner. 
    You know, I don't read these briefs with a absolute dental practitioner... was it a dental... I assumed it didn't have somebody who was in the dentist's office.

    And in Section 12201, referred back to... to standards under the Rehabilitation Act, which was Arline. 
    And deference to the health care provider is inconsistent with the statute. 
    Because the statute covers health care providers as places of public accommodation. 
    And... and Congress found, in 12101, that there was discrimination on the basis of disability in health services--

    There is, in 42 U.S.C., Section 12188, a provision entitled "Enforcement". 
    And Subsection B of that Section 12188 is entitled "Enforcement by Attorney General". 
    And it gives in its subparts a duty to investigate possible violations of the public accommodations provision and authority to bring lawsuits.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, that's just like the criminal law.

    I would have to... but... but that... that is the general prohibition of discrimination in the furnishing of public accommodations. 
    And public accommodations or elsewhere defined to include these health facilities. 
    Now, one of the regulations that has been carried over verbatim, as we were talking about, from the previous regulations, and one that was very much before Congress because it was quoted, set out in this Court's opinion in the Arline case, is the definition of physical impairment, to include any physiological disorder or condition affecting the hemic or lymphatic systems. 
    And that of course includes HIV infection, as the current regulations specifically state it does.

speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2737.743" stopTime="2753.532">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    In... in the statute itself. 
    And there is the point made that... in... it's Section 12211, I am told--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2753.532" stopTime="2767.480">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Wallace, while that is on the burner, may I ask... as I understand it, there's no dispute here that HIV is a physical impairment.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2767.480" stopTime="2769.483">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --Yes, that is correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2769.483" stopTime="2781.674">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And so the only question is whether it's a disability. 
    And those two questions shouldn't be confused. 
    So we're talking about is it a disability, given that it is a physical impairment? 
    And there are some physical impairments that are not disabilities.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2781.674" stopTime="2860.308">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    In... in order to be a disability, it must substantially limit a major life activity. 
    So there are two further questions once it... it is determined that it is a physical impairment. 
    One is whether it affects a major life activity and whether... and the second is whether it substantially limits that major life activity. 
    The major life activity which was the focus of this case and on which both courts below relied was reproduction and impairment to the reproductive capacity. 
    That, in the very same regulation that I quoted, is really implicit in that regulation. 
    Since impairment is defined as a disorder or condition that, among other things, affects the reproductive system, it is hard to see how that would have any relevance unless reproduction were a major life activity, a substantial limitation of which could be a disability under the Act. 
    Because it's hard to see how impairment of the reproductive system would relate to any other major life activity.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2860.308" stopTime="2866.943">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, you can have cancer. 
    You... you could have ovarian cancer. 
    That would be an impairment of the... of the reproductive system, which could cause a disability.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2866.943" stopTime="2870.455">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    It... it... it's--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2870.455" stopTime="2889.115">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And not necessarily a disability associated just with reproduction. 
    I... I understood the regulations went through all the major physical functions of the body, or physical whatever doctors call them, including the reproductive system, the breathing system and so forth. 
    Isn't that right?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2889.115" stopTime="2908.850">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --And the... and I might add that the current regulations also refer to HIV disease specifically as an impairment. 
    And the... the list--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2908.850" stopTime="2935.306">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We don't have a problem with whether it's an impairment. 
    We have... I have a problem with your saying Since reproductive disease is an impairment, the... affecting the ability to reproduce is a disability, in that automatically the ability to reproduce is a major life activity. 
    I don't understand that leap. 
    Just because they mention the reproductive system along with all the other organs of the body.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2935.306" stopTime="2972.623">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --All right. 
    All right. 
    Well, that is just one indication, perhaps not a conclusive indication, but it certainly looks in the direction of concern about impairment to the reproductive system. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals approached this question in what we believe was an exemplary fashion. 
    The Act does not itself define what is a major life activity. 
    And so the Court of Appeals said We'll think of the ordinary meaning of "major", which is significant in comparison with other activities.

    Let me ask... let me ask one other question. 
    Suppose the dentist has AIDS, not the patient. 
    Would it be discriminatory for an HMO with more than 15 people to refuse to hire the dentist or, alternatively, to require that the dentist disclose this to the patients?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="3054.718" stopTime="3068.757">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --Well, the last footnote in our brief points out that the... the question of HIV infection in health care workers and whether they are otherwise qualified really raises different issues.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3068.757" stopTime="3076.163">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Why does it raise different issues if the... if the chance is infection because of the close proximity between the dentist and the patient?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="3076.163" stopTime="3106.992">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Because it's the health care worker that's in charge and control of whether the precautions are taken or not, the patient will be subjected to risks over which the patient has no control. 
    But if the health care worker follows the universal procedures that have been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and the Dental Association and the Medical Association and other professional groups, the health care worker can limit any possible risk--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3106.992" stopTime="3112.615">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So then it would seem to me the answer to the question is that this doesn't have to be disclosed and the... and the dentist has to be hired.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="3112.615" stopTime="3119.411">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --Well, the... the question of disclosure really is not addressed by this Act.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3119.411" stopTime="3125.535">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, suppose there were a policy by the HMO that the... the person has to disclose to the patient so the patient has a choice.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="3125.535" stopTime="3131.989">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    There's... there's nothing in the Act that I'm aware of that addresses that question.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3131.989" stopTime="3135.212">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, let's assume that that would be a discrimination under the Act.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="3135.212" stopTime="3184.824">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, it's very close to the question that the Court had in Arline, in which you tried to specify some standards to be used to be sure that there was meaningful protection afforded to what were handicapped individuals within the meaning of the Act, and that only real, rather than conjectural, risks of the kind found here by the Court of Appeals, after a very careful review of the evidence, would be used to hold the person unqualified for protection, because the Act is an anti discrimination act, which could be undermined if each person can choose for himself whether to discriminate. 
    Now, I do say... want to say that implicit in the findings is that--

   Rebuttal of John W. McCarthy
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="3239.452" stopTime="3296.637">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I would just like to address a couple of issues. 
    One, on the question of deferral, in this case, there isn't anything to defer to for the reasons we disclosed before. 
    And even the Department of Justice, in its interpretive guidelines, indicates that when you're looking to public authorities, they are sources of information that include. 
    There's no suggestion that the public health authorities have any particular power here. 
    Now, there very well... may very well be a different situation, where the public health authorities have addressed an issue directly and the courts would have reason to defer to them. 
    But there isn't in this situation, because there aren't any public authorities that have spoken to the issue. 
    That includes the American Dental Association, which isn't a public health authority, but gets cited as if it's one. 
    It's a... it's a 501(c)(6) business league, and it made a policy statement... and it made a political decision about what it recommends. 
    And it shouldn't be determinative of whether or not an individual member is guilty of a civil rights violation, as opposed to following their policy.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Did you introduce expert testimony at the trial?

    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    Yes, we did.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Of your own?
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="3300.120" stopTime="3362.566">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    Right. 
    It wasn't at trial, but introduced it in response to the motion for summary judgment. 
    With respect to the... I call them the reverse cases, where health care providers have brought these claims of violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and have lost every time. 
    It's important to note, I believe, that it's conceded in this case that it's easier to transmit HIV from a patient to a doctor than it is from a doctor to a patient. 
    And there are... all the experts on both sides conceded this. 
    Dr. Molinari, the plaintiff's expert, wrote an article on it. 
    It's at Fed. App. 137a, and in his deposition at 139a. 
    And Dr. Marianos, the CDC expert, made the same concession that there is not any argument about that particular question. 
    The plain... the Respondents have raised very many policy issues in this matter. 
    And some of them are certainly worthy of serious consideration. 
    But those issues belong for consideration with Congress and not with the Court. 
    We rely on the statute. 
    We believe, if the statute is relied upon, the conclusions we've advanced will be--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    How many cases of AIDS had there been approximately as of 1994?
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="3366.497" stopTime="3382.738">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    --I... I don't know that figure. 
    I recall hearing the term "million", but I would be guessing wildly to say it. 
    I do know that there are hundreds of thousands of cases of HIV, where it's not known how the transmission occurred. 
    And that, we think, it important when you're looking at this question of under reporting.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3382.738" stopTime="3395.396">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right. 
    Suppose the worst that could have happened is that he though there was a risk of 7... if he'd looked into it, 7 cases in a million. 
    That's about 1 in 120,000. 
    That's certainly not lightning. 
    What are we supposed to do?
speaker="john_w_mccarthy" startTime="3395.396" stopTime="3411.309">
    Mr. John W. McCarthy 
    Well, the question is, does he... what's the then current medical knowledge? 
    He has all of this information before him, including OSHA, these seven cases, what's occurred in other cases. 
    We certainly believe there's good reason for him to believe and take the position that there could be risk. 
    And it was a reasonable judgment for him to make. 
    Thank you.
