    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case concerns whether police officers must have a higher justification than reasonable suspicion if they damage property while making a no-knock entry to execute a search warrant. 
    The officers here sought to apprehend an escaped convict who had committed numerous violent acts and had stated that he would never return to prison. 
    While executing a no-knock entry at respondent's house to execute a search warrant to look for that fugitive, the officers broke a single garage door windowpane. 
    Based on that property damage, the Ninth Circuit held that the officers must have a higher justification for foregoing with the general principle of knock and announcement.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And another preliminary matter. 
    Do you accept the notion that the Fourth Amendment does impose some kind of restraints on the amount of force that officers can use in effecting a no-knock entry?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="144.976" stopTime="175.407">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Yes, Justice O'Connor. 
    The two questions are distinct, in our view. 
    If the officers have reasonable suspicion to forego knocking and announcing, they may use the force reasonably necessary to effectuate the entry. 
    A case of excessive or wholly needless property damage would be assessed under a reasonableness standard that took into account whether or not it was actually reasonable to go through the door or to go through the window, or to engage in some other property damage.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Another preliminary question. 
    Assume probable cause.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Your argument here would be the same if there were no warrant but the police had probable cause, would it not?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="195.432" stopTime="205.718">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --Our answer is the same with respect to the no-knock clause of the warrant, Justice Kennedy, if that is what your question is getting at. 
    The officers here had probable cause to search the premises.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="205.718" stopTime="206.128">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I understand.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="206.128" stopTime="220.516">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    And the magistrate put a no-knock provision in the warrant. 
    Our view is that when the officers executed the entry, they had reasonable suspicion to believe that they would face danger if they knocked and announced, so if I understand--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="220.516" stopTime="228.213">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But you would... the... you would make the same argument here whether or not the no-knock waiver was in the warrant or not?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="228.213" stopTime="265.216">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --Yes. 
    Yes. 
    As the Court made clear in Richards, the question is whether the officers' reasonable suspicion at the time they make the entry. 
    There may be circumstances that dissipate that reasonable suspicion if the officers have gone to the magistrate, the magistrate authorizes a no-knock entry, and what the Court made clear in Richards is that if those circumstances dissipate the reasonable suspicion, it would not be reasonable for the officers to forego knocking and announcing, notwithstanding that the warrant contained a no-knock clause. 
    As the Court made clear in Richards, reasonable suspicion is the standard by which to judge foregoing with knocking and announcing.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="265.216" stopTime="309.375">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Frederick, may I go back to the question that was... I think Justice O'Connor asked you, and that is, you said that there could be a Fourth Amendment control of excessive force. 
    What would be the implementation of that? 
    Suppose the agents here had come in like gangbusters and destroyed everything in their path, and also picked up some incriminating evidence, what would be the consequences? 
    You said the Fourth Amendment is involved, how? 
    Do we exclude the evidence that would be garnered in such an unreasonable search?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="309.375" stopTime="356.997">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    I think your question poses two distinct points, and let me address them separately, if I may. 
    The reasonableness of the method of making the entry would be assessed by looking at what force was necessary to get in quickly. 
    The remedy that might occur if the officers engaged in excessive property damage, we submit, would be compensation for the damaged property and not necessarily the exclusion of the evidence, for if the officers had properly made a no-knock entry supported by reasonable suspicion but not engaged in the unnecessary property damage, they still would have found the same evidence, and they would have found the same evidence at the same time, so the remedy that would be appropriate in the case of needless property damage would be compensation and not the imposition of the exclusionary rule.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="356.997" stopTime="363.342">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But supposing there is authority, though, and there's no Fourth Amendment violation, and they break the door down of a third party, don't they have to pay for the damage?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="363.342" stopTime="365.152">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Yes, Justice--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="365.152" stopTime="369.475">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So the obligation to pay for the damage isn't dependent at all on whether it was justified or not.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="369.475" stopTime="396.293">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --No, Justice Stevens. 
    In fact, the statute that you may be referring to is 31 U.S.C. 3724 provides... Congress has provided that where a law enforcement activity has resulted in property damage to an innocent third party, the Attorney General can pay compensation for that law enforcement activity. 
    That would not necessarily be the case for a criminal wrongdoer. 
    There would not be an obligation on the part of the Government to pay for property damage that occurred for a wrongdoer, so--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="396.293" stopTime="404.948">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, it would... is this person... at the time of the entry, this... the property owner was not a wrongdoer. 
    Of course, you found out later he had some stuff in the house, but--
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="404.948" stopTime="436.408">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --That's correct. 
    I mean, the officers are always operating on the information that they have when they make the entry. 
    The question, you know, to be clear, is that if the officers have reasonable suspicion to believe that there would be a danger if they knocked and announced, that carries with it the authority to make whatever property damage is reasonably necessary to effectuate that entry. 
    The case that Justice Ginsburg posits is where the officers have engaged in wholly needless property damage that's unrelated to--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --What did the officers do here by way of property damage?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="440.202" stopTime="463.776">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --They broke a single garage door windowpane, Mr. Chief Justice, and they did so because they had information from a confidential, reliable informant that guns were kept in the garage, or that they might be kept in the garage, and the purpose of making that break in the garage door windowpane was so that an officer could secure the garage in the event that the people in the house went to the garage to get the guns.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="463.776" stopTime="524.415">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Frederick, I am less concerned about... well, just as concerned, I suppose, but I am less troubled by what the Fourth Amendment might provide than I am by section 3109, which says the officer may break open any outer or inner door or window or any part of the house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance, which didn't occur here, or when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in the execution of the warrant, which didn't occur here. 
    I don't see what the purpose of that statute is unless it is meant to exclude other break-ins, which isn't to say that the other break-ins would exclude all the evidence that's found, and I assume that your answer to what would happen if there's a violation of 3109 is the same thing as your answer to what happens if you use excessive force, right?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="524.415" stopTime="525.928">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Yes, it would be, Justice Scalia.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="525.928" stopTime="529.469">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The exclusionary rule would not apply, but you'd be liable for whatever damage you've caused.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="529.469" stopTime="530.330">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="530.330" stopTime="538.754">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay. 
    Well, why shouldn't I read 3109 that way, saying these are the only... these are the only reasons why a Federal officer can break anything in a house?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="538.754" stopTime="556.425">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    For two reasons. 
    The first is that for 40 years this Court, starting in Miller v. United States in 1958, has read the language of 3109 which we have set forth in our opening brief at page 2, to essentially codify the common law rule of knock and announcement and its exceptions.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="556.425" stopTime="559.618">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it... but it clearly doesn't, unless you're wrong about what the common law allows.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="559.618" stopTime="564.991">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Well, our view, Justice Scalia, is that the Court has never construed the terms of this statute literally. 
    It read into--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="564.991" stopTime="566.874">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I see. 
    We've never construed it to mean what it says.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="566.874" stopTime="619.948">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --Absolutely. 
    That's correct, and if you were to start... if you were to start reading this language literally, there are several decisions that would have to overruled. 
    Miller v. United States read into this a requirement that knock and announce be done for arrest warrants. 
    It read into the statute an exclusionary rule. 
    In Sabbath this Court read into the statute a requirement that not... force did not have to be used, notwithstanding that it says, may break open, so the Court has read this language and has stated several times that the language is to be understood against the backdrop of principles of common law that have been in effect for hundreds of years, and that the language is not to be read literally, and our view is that there's no reason at this point to go back to a literal, textual reading of section 3109 when the Court has never--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="619.948" stopTime="624.580">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What effect does 3109 have if we do that? 
    Is it just a superfluous statute?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="624.580" stopTime="625.822">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --Well, the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="625.822" stopTime="630.694">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Just sort of there to say, you don't really mean just this, do whatever you like?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="630.694" stopTime="648.206">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --No. 
    The language is an expression of congressional policy that Federal officers should conduct their entries by using the general principle of knock and announcement unless there are reasons that would just... be justified in not doing so.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="648.206" stopTime="648.607">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It doesn't say that.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="648.607" stopTime="649.728">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    I understand, Justice Scalia.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="649.728" stopTime="655.773">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Does it do anything other than what our decision says the Fourth Amendment does with respect to the States?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="655.773" stopTime="682.009">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your question is that... first, our position is that the statute is coextensive with the Fourth Amendment requirements, so that the requirements on Federal law enforcement officers are no greater or lesser than they are on State officers as prescribed under the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness provision.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="682.009" stopTime="690.455">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So then you really don't... this is just kind of a statement that doesn't matter, because the Fourth Amendment certainly binds Federal officers.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="690.455" stopTime="735.024">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    That's true. 
    As a matter of history, the language in the statute came well before the Supreme Court began to interpret the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement to impose a knock and announce requirement constitutionally, so as a matter of history there is a reason for section 3109. 
    It's just that as it has been construed by this Court, the statute itself does not impose a higher requirement on Federal officers than it would on State officers, who are in the dangerous situation of executing warrants. 
    In fact, all Federal courts of appeals, including the Ninth Circuit, have recognized an exception for officer safety under section 3109, notwithstanding that the textual language does not contain such an exception.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="735.024" stopTime="744.839">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We're talking about whether you have to pay for the window or the door. 
    I mean, you're not talking about letting the culprit skip away under the exclusionary rule if this provision has been violated.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="744.839" stopTime="747.872">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="747.872" stopTime="762.792">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If the provision... I mean, I don't know that there is such a massive importance in interpreting 3109 so broadly, because if it has been violated, the only consequence is that the window has to be paid for, or the door that's broken down has to be paid for.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="762.792" stopTime="778.352">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    That would certainly be our view if the Court were not to accept its prior cases, which hold that the common law rule of knock and announcement has been, in effect, codified by section 3109. 
    I'd like to emphasize two other points.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="778.352" stopTime="788.390">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Let me ask you one question. 
    Did the Sabbath case take any position on whether there might be an exclusionary rule in connection with the violation of 3109?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="788.390" stopTime="797.537">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    I... yes, I... although I'm... I actually don't recall, Justice Scalia. 
    I think that as this Court noted in--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="797.537" stopTime="809.422">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, no... I see now in the first paragraph it says, we hold the method of entry vitiated the arrest and therefore that evidence seized in the subsequent search should not have been admitted at petitioner's trial.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="809.422" stopTime="809.752">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="809.752" stopTime="816.797">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So that if we say this violates 3109, unless we do something to Sabbath you get an exclusionary rule right along with it.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="816.797" stopTime="832.598">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    That's correct, and in Sabbath itself the Court read the words forcibly break essentially out of this statute, because the facts there were that the officer entered an unlocked door. 
    I would like to underscore that the Ninth Circuit's teaching--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="832.598" stopTime="851.991">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That wasn't a holding of the case, of course. 
    That wasn't a holding of the case. 
    It was just an assumption which never had to be applied. 
    Oh, I don't think that they reversed the judgment of the lower court. 
    This... you know, the first paragraph-- 
    --They didn't exclude the evidence-- 
    --They said in the first paragraph the evidence will have to be excluded.

    Mr. David C. Frederick

    --Where did it come from--

    That's correct, Justice Breyer.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="873.966" stopTime="890.847">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right. 
    So it must... it says it came from the field code in New York in 1880, or something, and so at that time they must have think... thought there was some different rule of law that forbids something, and then they said, despite that different rule of law, this permits something. 
    How did it work? 
    What were they thinking, do you know? 
    You may not know--
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="890.847" stopTime="1042.834">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Well, as the law of knock and announce developed, it developed in the law of civil trespass where property owners brought trespass actions against law enforcement officers for unlawfully entering premises. 
    Now, the legislative history, even into the New York statute, is not clear as to why the New York drafters of their statutes put it into the law, but one theory might be that the... New York and in Congress wanted to create an affirmative grant of authority to officers so that they could avoid trespass actions. 
    But that's just speculation on our part, because there is... the historical evidence simply is not clear as to why certain aspects of the common law of knock and announcement were specifically written into 3109 and others that had been well-recognized, including officer safety, from the 1822 decision of Reed v. Case, were not, so I think that it would be pure speculation as to exactly why an affirmative grant was placed into the statutory provisions, Justice Breyer. 
    Let me point out that the Ninth Circuit's twotier rule places an unreasonable burden on law enforcement officers. 
    No-knock entries routinely involve some damage to property. 
    In the Richards case, for instance, the officers had to ram the door and kick it in in order to make the entry. 
    If officers need more than reasonable suspicion to justify a no-knock entry involving property damage, they may have to face the choices of having evidence suppressed at trial or facing greater personal risks when knocking and announcement. 
    We submit that the officer should not be forced to make that kind of calculus at a dangerous situation such as executing warrants. 
    Moreover, the Ninth Circuit's approach provides no practical guidance to officers. 
    Warrant execution entails high risks and requires split-second judgments. 
    It is unclear what level of information will meet the higher tier of specificity required by the Ninth Circuit. 
    The level of justification for a no-knock entry should not turn on the fortuity of the officers encountering an unlocked door or window. 
    Reasonable, just suspicion justifies the property damage that is reasonably necessary to effectuate that entry and, in fact, if the Ninth Circuit's rule is accepted by this Court that something more than reasonable suspicion is necessary if property damage is the result of the no-knock entry, that will, in effect, swallow the rule that this Court announced in Richards.

speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="1098.833" stopTime="1141.830">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    That's correct, Justice Kennedy, but I hope that, when you do write that opinion saying that, you distinguish between the reasons that the officers have for foregoing with knocking and announcement and the reasons that they have for the particular method of getting into the premises. 
    A fortified door that is barricaded, has steel reinforcements, will require a different tactical method than a door that is a screen door, that may be wide open. 
    Our view is that reasonable suspicion justifies getting the officers inside the premises as quickly as possible. 
    How they go about doing that, though, is going to turn on the reasonableness of the fortifications that they encounter when they execute the search warrant.

    It should not be the rule that if people engaged in criminal conduct use some of the fruits of their activity to fortify their homes, which would there... or premises, and thereby lead to greater property destruction if officers have reasonable suspicion to make a no-knock entry, should entitle them to greater Fourth Amendment protection than people who do not engage in such fortifications. 
    What... and our view is that those two questions should be decoupled so that it is clear to all that officers may dispense with knocking and announcement if they have reasonable suspicion. 
    Unless the Court has any further questions at this time, I'd like to save remaining time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Michael R. Levine
speaker="michael_r_levine" startTime="1205.530" stopTime="1284.705">
    Mr. Michael R. Levine 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    At 6:15 in the morning of November 5th, 45 armed officers surrounded the home of Mr. Ramirez. 
    They planned this. 
    This wasn't something that arose spontaneously at the door, like in Richards v. Wisconsin. 
    This wasn't a case where they were recognized as officers where they had to take an immediate action, kick in the door. 
    This was a planned breaking of a window of a residence. 
    Who among us would not have risen to the defense of our wives? 
    Who among us would not have arisen to the defense of our children? 
    50 Percent of Americans have guns in their homes. 
    The Government should have thought this through a little better. 
    The norm, this Honorable Court, the norm from time immemorial, from Semayne's Case and even... even before, as Wilson points out, the norm has been that before officers may break and enter the home, our last refuge in this world that's shrinking smaller and smaller all the time, before they can make that entry, they have to announce their identity, they have to announce their purpose--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1284.705" stopTime="1293.738">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but I suppose that if the door had been unlocked here and they just burst through the door and everything else was the same, the fear of the occupants would have been precisely the same.

    No, Your Honor, we're not talking about a broken windowpane.

    Mr. Michael R. Levine

    Mr. Michael R. Levine

    The reason is that... and the protection of the safety of the residents. 
    Common law recognized that when people break property, people will be frightened and will spring to the defense of themselves and their family, and will engage in a shoot-out. 
    Things will escalate.

    It has a general rule that helps guide its application of the rule of reason.

    Mr. Michael R. Levine 
    --The statement in Richards v. Wisconsin, the test of reasonable suspicion that the Government talks about and that this Court talked about, though, in the context of destruction of evidence, that has to be construed at least with regard to a planned assault on a residence, as opposed to a spontaneous happening at the door, that has to be construed, it seems to me, to include the manner of entry and the degree of danger. 
    It's like Tennessee v. Garner. 
    The Government just wants to have a quantum reasonable suspicion, but that's not what you did in Tennessee v. Garner. 
    That was the case where you said the police officer couldn't shoot the fleeting felon. 
    You have to consider the end result, the fleeing of the... the death of the felon. 
    In Winston v. Lee, which Garner cites, you recall that was the case where the police wanted to compel surgery to remove a bullet from the suspected robber, and they said they need to get the bullet, and this Court said quite clearly that, wait a minute, what's the danger if we remove the bullet? 
    We have to balance that. 
    What is the Government's interest in getting the bullet? 
    And at first the bullet was only half an inch, and they said, well, that's okay, go ahead, but then it turned out the bullet was a lot closer, this person might die. 
    Justice Scalia, writing for a unanimous court in Whren, I believe last term, you said that there's a certain class of cases, a narrow class of cases like Tennessee v. Garner, like Winston v. Lee, like Welsh v. Wisconsin, the case where the police chased a man in through the house without a warrant to get... they wanted to arrest him for drunk driving in order to get... they said, we have to preserve the evidence. 
    You put in that class no-knock entry, Wilson v. Arkansas, because you said in that narrow class of cases we have to do a full balancing test, and that was a unanimous Court.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Isn't the test that applies, though... is there some disagreement about this, that... I'm reading from Richards v. Wisconsin.

    I point, Your Honor, to petitioner's appendix 11a, where the Ninth Circuit also says, we have touched upon all of these cases because our review is necessarily fact-bound. 
    Our cases do not describe a simple straight line. 
    Police must have some leeway in balancing the demands of the knock and announce requirement against other safety considerations. 
    Nevertheless, the courts must ultimately determine whether the police struck that balance properly. 
    I read that language as saying they're doing a balancing, and this word, this mild exigency showing more is simply saying, if there's a greater intrusion, give us more evidence justifying the intrusion. 
    That's all they're doing. 
    And if you read McConney, the en banc decision of the Court in 1973, you see that they begin immediately saying that the test is a reasonable belief in danger, but as a specific application of that test we look to whether... one factor, an important factor is what they're saying, ultimately.

    Okay, but also in the agreed stipulation of facts, to which your client apparently agreed, it said that other information from the Government's informant indicated that the defendant, Ramirez, was possibly involved in drugs which he kept in the garage. 
    The informant also indicated there were supposed to be several guns in the garage, and what we had here was breaking of a windowpane in the garage so that this... officers could surveil... conduct surveillance of that space as they entered.

    Now, he's not saying I saw Shelby with a gun. 
    He's not saying, I overheard Shelby to say he was going to shoot police when he comes in, and remember, the origin of the officer safety exception comes from Reed v. Case, where you have a situation precisely like that, where the person is saying, I'm going to shoot anybody who comes in the house. 
    That's the officer safety exception.

    --I can understand why a policeman, knowing that, might think he ought to see if somebody's going to run for a gun, and if I can understand that based on this record, then it seems to me the standard makes the answer favorable to the Government, so that's what I was asking you to respond to.
speaker="michael_r_levine" startTime="2358.248" stopTime="2559.791">
    Mr. Michael R. Levine 
    --Well, there are supposed to be guns in the garage. 
    They're not... guns are not in the garage. 
    This would be a different case and a different balance might well have been struck, but there are supposed to be guns in the garage, and the district court made a finding of fact based on a stipulation, and the finding was that there was no evidence that Mr. Shelby was armed while in the residence or that he presented a danger to the 45 officers. 
    If I may, I'd like to turn to the statutory argument. 
    Your Honors, 18 United... oh, this case, of course, is a Federal case, so we are also controlled by the Federal no-knock statute, 18 United States Code section 3109, and if the Court should decide... actually, the Court doesn't even have to reach the constitutional question if it decides my way on the statute. 
    Now, under the plain meaning of the statute, as was pointed out earlier, no-knock... knock and announce was required. 
    If you compare the, as a matter of fact, the statute with the New York statute that it was based on, which can be found in, Your Honors, at page 44 of my brief... page 44 of my brief, if you look at the statute that was enacted as part of the field code, you can see that the Federal statute tracks verbatim the New York statute, except for the last sentence. 
    Now, the last sentence, we see Congress is changing the New York statute. 
    It adds on the statement that officers can also... another exception is to go in and rescue, or liberate, as they say, a person who's trapped in the house, so we have Congress, Congress making a specific decision to enact specific exceptions. 
    They enacted this one particular exception to liberate, which comes from a common law case, I believe in 1619, the Wilshire case, which Justice Thomas cited in his opinion for the Court in Wilson. 
    That's where a bailiff was trapped in the house and the other bailiffs had to go in and rescue him. 
    But we see, then, that this lends support to the argument that Congress knows exactly what it's doing. 
    This is officer safety. 
    This is the consideration that Congress is taking into account. 
    Congress is making the political judgment. 
    As Justice Breyer pointed out, these are difficult judgments. 
    Congress, the representatives of the people, are making a judgment here. 
    The judgment is this: in general, officer safety, or apprehension, officer safety is best assured and the safety of the people is best assured when they comply with the rule of Semayne's Case.

    Mr. Michael R. Levine 
    I don't see that. 
    It's true that the Court, this Court has interpreted the statute to broaden its coverage. 
    It's true that the Court has done that. 
    Other court... this Court has done that in the past to broaden the coverage to further what this Court saw as the fundamental values behind the statute, so the Court did say that it also covers arrest warrants even though the terms only say search warrants. 
    The Court did say that it covers the case of just walking into the front door instead of breaking in the front door in Sabbath.

    They've never made an argument... it seems to me they've waived any argument.

    There's no rule. 
    If you invoke inevitable discovery, it's gone.

    Well, that's fine, but that... does mere reasonable suspicion and not a higher degree of suspicion become necessary if you're going to do substantial property damage?

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I agree with Judge Kozinski. 
    But to set forth a rule that you don't, you know, property damage--

    Why--
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="2984.139" stopTime="2995.777">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --not to require officers to have proof to a near certainty, or proof beyond a reasonable doubt that you or someone in your home poses a danger to officers if they knock and announce their presence.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --Well, if property damage does not have to affect probable cause, does it affect the exigent circumstances that are necessary for the extraordinary means of entry?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="3004.643" stopTime="3014.109">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    We would suggest that the use of the term, exigent circumstances, creates and has created problems, and so we would suggest a different analytical formulation.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, the special circumstances one.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="3014.270" stopTime="3030.940">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    What we would suggest is that the means of entry be analyzed separately so that if the officers have information that they are facing barricades or that one particular part of the dwelling is fortified but another part is not, that that would be the reasonable circumstance that should be--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3030.940" stopTime="3033.812">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I'm not sure how that's so different from what the Ninth Circuit said.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="3033.812" stopTime="3045.149">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --What the Ninth Circuit held was that the officers needed to have higher evidence of the danger to themselves. 
    A person can live behind a fortified dwelling and not pose any threat to anybody.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3045.149" stopTime="3058.870">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're saying the same degree of certainty that this criminal is in there, only the same degree... 20 percent chance he's in there... you need that to break a little window, and you also need that, and no more than that, to take out a wall.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="3058.870" stopTime="3092.781">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Yes, Justice Scalia. 
    If the officers have reason to believe that if they knock and announce they are going to face danger, the fact that the persons inside who posed that danger to them, have put fortifications up that require more property damage, should not entitle them to higher Fourth Amendment protection. 
    The officers, if they have a reasonable suspicion, should be able to take the means reasonably necessary to make the entry even if that damages a lot of property if the property is... if that means is reasonably calibrated to the need to get inside.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3092.781" stopTime="3107.048">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If you get me to adopt that rule I may well up my interpretation of what a reasonable suspicion consists of. 
    If I know that the consequence of a reasonable suspicion is I'm going to lose the side of my house, I might well require your agents to be a lot more sure than I otherwise would.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="3107.048" stopTime="3119.918">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    And Justice Scalia, we're wrestling with that question right now in the lower Federal courts as to whether a reasonable suspicion to forego knocking and announcing... you know, what exactly that consists of. 
    It certainly is different than a Terry pat-down frisk.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3119.918" stopTime="3128.113">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, it ought to be... it ought to be fairly substantial, should it not, in light of the long tradition of knock and announce? 
    I mean, I don't--

    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    It is not, Justice O'Connor, and that is why our office has struggled with--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3135.319" stopTime="3142.845">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    We all have in mind what happened at Waco. 
    I think we do have some concerns here.

    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --No, and we share those concerns, Justice O'Connor. 
    It's just that the standard should not be a fluid one. 
    It should be one reasonable suspicion standard, however that comes to be defined by the courts as they struggle with those instances when the officers need to invoke the exception to the general rule of knock and announcement, and that will evolve as courts wrestle with this.
