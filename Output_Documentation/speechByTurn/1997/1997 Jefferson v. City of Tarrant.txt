Jefferson v. City of Tarrant

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-957, Melvin Jefferson v. The City of Tarrant, Alabama. 
    Mr. Pantazis.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="9.888" stopTime="36.610">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The supreme court of Alabama has held there is no section 42 U.S.C. section 1983 claim for a cause of action if the victim dies from the perpetration of the act. 
    The issue before this Court is, when the decedent's death results from the deprivation of a Federal right occurring in Alabama, does the Wrongful Death Act govern the recovery of the decedent's estate?
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="36.610" stopTime="39.062">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Are you going to address the jurisdictional issue?
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="39.062" stopTime="40.562">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    I will, if... Your Honor.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="40.562" stopTime="41.874">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    I think you should.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="41.874" stopTime="59.055">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    The Federal issue has been totally adjudicated by the supreme court of Alabama, and under the Cox case this Court has held an exception, or held that jurisdiction is found where there's no further Federal issue to be adjudicated and cannot be adjudicated at the lower court.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="59.055" stopTime="71.690">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But the Federal issue could become academic if you go back and on the State claim there's a determination that there was no wrongful conduct on the part of the city.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="71.690" stopTime="95.681">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Under... in Cox it's my understanding, Your Honor, is that the Court held this exception: where the Federal claim has been finally decided and with further proceeding on the merits in the State court to come, but that which later review of the Federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case. 
    That was the third exception.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="95.681" stopTime="110.268">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But here you could conceivably, if you should prevail on the State claim you could then bring up that you should also have had a 1983 claim.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="110.268" stopTime="115.938">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    I don't believe so. 
    I think the supreme court of Alabama has already adjudicated that in this particular case.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="115.938" stopTime="132.088">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And they would then say, it's law of the case, and so we deny... in dealing with the appeal you would have a final disposition, and you could come here again. 
    In that respect it's different from Cox v. Cohn.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="132.088" stopTime="142.286">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    I think it is different, but I think the rational of Cox is, looking at this particular issue, this Court... the Alabama supreme court has adjudicated it to the fullest degree under the Federal issue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="142.286" stopTime="165.278">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The issue isn't whether they have adjudicated it finally and will not come back to it. 
    You're quite right that they wouldn't come back to it. 
    The issue is whether we could pick it up later on, after they simply say, it's law of the case, there is no Federal cause of action. 
    At that point you have a final judgment, the whole thing has been dismissed, and you could come here. 
    Is there some reason why you couldn't come here?
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="165.278" stopTime="173.165">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    It would require duplication in trying the case twice, and I think that's part of the rationale that Cox looked at.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="173.165" stopTime="191.486">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Sure. 
    Well, that may well be, but we're bound by the Federal statute, which says that the case has to be finally decided by the highest court of the State, finally decided, and the highest court of the State is going to have this case back again, or may well have the case back again on the State law claims, no?
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="191.486" stopTime="202.903">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    It could, but the problem, Your Honor, is that the third element in Cox specifically, I think, addressed that rationale. 
    It said that the Federal claim was adjudicated in the Federal... in the State court.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="202.903" stopTime="239.137">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But it says where further Federal... it says, but in which later review of the Federal issue cannot be had, and under the law of the case, Alabama could conceivably change its mind if there were some intervening decision, perhaps by the Eleventh Circuit. 
    Probably it won't, but nevertheless, you can't say, in which later review of the Federal issue cannot be had. 
    that's just not... that's... you just haven't complied with that exception. 
    Now... and maybe you might ask us to have some further exception and say, well, it's duplicative, or something like that, but I don't think you can come within exception 3.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="239.137" stopTime="247.291">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Well, I think, though, the rationale in exception 3, if it does not meet this case, it should meet this case, and maybe the Court should accept that as a further--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="247.291" stopTime="288.774">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I think perhaps the rationale of section 3 was your... a case called California v. Stewart that was decided on... where the State court says, this evidence is inadmissible because it was violative of Miranda. 
    The State wants to appeal that. 
    If it goes back to the trial court, the State is prevented from getting that evidence in, so it's lost forever the right to review that claim because the trial court won't accept it, and if there's a guilty verdict, or a not guilty verdict, the State never will have an opportunity to review it. 
    You, on the other hand, will, as my colleagues have pointed out, have... could have an opportunity to have this reviewed in a later proceeding.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="288.774" stopTime="300.769">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --I think that, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not believe that we will, because I think the supreme court of Alabama has reviewed the issue and has accepted it for that particular purpose.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="300.769" stopTime="318.215">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Let's assume that, as I think my colleagues have assumed, that the supreme court of Alabama is going to say, as Justice Ginsburg, this is the law of the case, we've decided it, but this is simply a necessary step for you to then bring the case to us, and you will not have the final judgment argument made against you at that time.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="318.215" stopTime="347.359">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    If that rationale holds, then this case would be tried once with a State remedy, which would exclude the entire 1983 cause of action. 
    It would then go up before the supreme court of Alabama, and they, as Justice Scalia points out, would probably say, we've already covered this, you know, the issue is moot, and we'd be here again 2 or 3 years on the same issue, having gone through the system without any... moving the case any further.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="347.359" stopTime="350.795">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, that's always-- 
    --That's a happy ending. 
    You could lose on the State claim.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="350.795" stopTime="351.874">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    That's true.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="351.874" stopTime="352.841">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And then the whole thing could be washed out, right?
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="352.841" stopTime="353.122">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    That's true.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="353.122" stopTime="357.854">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The problem is that's always true when you take an interlocutory appeal.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="357.854" stopTime="358.667">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    That's correct.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="358.667" stopTime="378.270">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It's always true, so the statutes balance and allow you sometimes to take an interlocutory appeal, sometimes not, but we have a statute here that doesn't allow it. 
    It says final, and is there anyway around that? 
    I mean, I don't see... the word is final. 
    It doesn't allow this interlocutory thing to come up.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="378.270" stopTime="378.956">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Well--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="378.956" stopTime="380.081">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So how do we get around that?
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="380.081" stopTime="400.384">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --I personally do not believe the supreme court of Alabama will adjudicate the same Federal issue again, and the reason is the defendants in this case are going to say, this case is already decided. 
    That was already addressed. 
    The parties were before it. 
    It was a final order on the 1983 issue. 
    That's over with. 
    And I--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="400.384" stopTime="417.972">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We don't resolve finality issue by issue. 
    I mean, our cases make it clear that if any of the claims in the case are still alive, the judgment is not final, and there are claims still alive here, the State claims.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="417.972" stopTime="418.722">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --The State claims are.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="418.722" stopTime="447.694">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So the only way you can get out of the problem is to say, this comes within one of the exceptions, to wit, there's no other way to appeal this Federal claim unless I can appeal it now, which was the situation in the case that the Chief Justice described, but I don't see why that's the situation here. 
    It seems to me you can come back up here. 
    I know it takes 2 more years, and we're duplicating effort and all of that, but that's what this statute envisions. 
    I mean--
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="447.694" stopTime="457.174">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    I believe the Court could expand, if that's the term, in the Cox rationale and to allow this particular appeal.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="457.174" stopTime="462.406">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --Yes, but how could... I mean, it's like a trial judge. 
    The trial judge makes a ruling against you at the beginning of the case.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="462.406" stopTime="462.953">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Yes.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="462.953" stopTime="482.211">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    You run up to the court of appeals, you say, you know, judge, an awful lot of time and effort's going to go by. 
    Why don't you and the court of appeals reverse him now? 
    And if we have a statute that says final, we can't do it. 
    We have to look to some other statute that gave us the interlocutory right, or that gave us, you know, the certificating right. 
    We couldn't do it on a word that says final.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="482.211" stopTime="482.664">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Right.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="482.664" stopTime="487.193">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And that's the dilemma, it seems to me, here. 
    I'm putting that because maybe you can think of something.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="487.193" stopTime="488.130">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Well--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="488.130" stopTime="488.833">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I don't know what it is.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="488.833" stopTime="524.022">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --The difference in that is that if it is an issue, an evidentiary issue or something, it would be adjudicated and revisited at the end of the trial, as all evidentiary issues. 
    The issue of whether you have a cause of action has reached the highest level it can reach in Alabama, and it has been adjudicated at the highest level it can reach within the Alabama system, and that issue has been taken care of both from a fact standpoint and from a representation of the parties, and I don't believe the supreme court of Alabama can go back and review it. 
    It's already said, I've made that decision on that issue. 
    I think that we would be--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="524.022" stopTime="544.795">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Suppose there were some intervening decisions. 
    Couldn't you tell the Alabama supreme court, you made a mistake here, there are some intervening decisions from this Court, or from a court of appeals of the Eleventh Circuit, which there might well be, please take another look at this? 
    They have the discretion to do that. 
    The rule of law of the case is discretionary, I take it, in Alabama.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="544.795" stopTime="571.113">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --They possibly could do that, Your Honor, but in... because the supreme court of Alabama has ruled on a motion to dismiss pleadings... this was not a summary judgment. 
    It was a motion to dismiss pleadings... it dismissed the counts in this case that involved 1983, and they're forever gone, and the supreme court of Alabama has ruled that issue finality. 
    Those issues are no longer present in the State court and in the trial court.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="571.113" stopTime="600.118">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    If you were to prevail on the State claim and then ultimately prevail here on your 1983 case, you wouldn't have to have a whole new trial. 
    Couldn't you get some mileage from the State, the trial on the State claim in which you succeeded so that you wouldn't have to duplicate all that evidence?
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="600.118" stopTime="620.844">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    I would think not, and the reason is because the State measure of damages in Alabama for wrongful death is the wrongfulness of the conduct of the defendant. 
    It is not compensatory. 
    It is purely punitive, and if... 1983 against municipalities is compensatory damages only. 
    There is no compensatory damages for wrongful death.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="620.844" stopTime="623.141">

    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Well, the issues that would be tried in the case in the... for the wrongful death, the issues and the evidence and even the measure of damages, what the jury is allowed to consider, would totally be different.

    The conduct--

    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --It may not, Your Honor. 
    It may... a lot of it would parallel, but a lot of it... there's also issues that would be allowable in '83 from an evidentiary standpoint that wouldn't be allowable or relevant just for a wrongful death case.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Pantazis, just for fun, why don't you tell us about the merits of the case. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="664.093" stopTime="817.439">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Okay. 
    It is fun. 
    [Laughter] 
    Your Honor, this case involves a lady who was an elderly black lady in Tarrant, Alabama. 
    She died in a fire. 
    She had both legs amputated previously. 
    She died when her husband... when the house caught on fire and her husband tried to pull her to a first floor window, could not get her out. 
    The firefighters of Tarrant City arrived. 
    On two requests he asked them to pull her out. 
    On both requests, two different firefighters, they both refused. 
    His son and her son approached, and got there. 
    When he did, he pulled her out. 
    She was laying on the ground. 
    They refused to administer any first aid. 
    They refused to even take her pulse. 
    The allegations in the complaint, and as the record reflects, this was a custom and practice of depriving black citizens in Tarrant, Alabama of fundamental equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, and we had filed a section 1983 cause of action, and as this Court knows, section 1983 does not provide a remedy, remedial damage remedy under that section. 
    We have to look for guidance to 1988. 
    1988 tells us that we look first, or consider first the State common law and State statutory law, and if that is not inconsistent with the purpose and policy of the Federal Constitution, the United States laws it's intended to protect, then we apply it, but if it is, that is the balancing test, or that is the test that the courts must look at. 
    This Court in Robertson v. Wegman has held that the purpose and policy of 1983 is to compensate and to prevent prevention of abuses and power by those acting under color of State law, or in my words, deterrence, and if you apply that standard to what we have in Alabama, or we're left with in Alabama... because what's left are two State statutes. 
    One of them is the wrongful death statute, which is cited at 6-5-410, and as I've indicated is purely compensatory. 
    Even the supreme court's decision in this case states that, I think, in the first or second paragraph... excuse me. 
    It's purely punitive. 
    I said compensatory. 
    I misstated. 
    It's purely punitive, and the jury charges, they're admonished never to consider any compensatory aspects, just punitive, it certainly frustrates the purpose of compensation.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="817.439" stopTime="826.715">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Why... you say it frustrates the purpose. 
    A moment ago you said the purpose is deterrence, and it certainly doesn't frustrate the purpose of deterrence. 
    It's a classic example of a deterrent remedy.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="826.715" stopTime="838.382">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    That's correct, it does satisfy the second element of deterrence, but it frustrates the first element of underlying policy of compensation. 
    There is a second statute that comes into play.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="838.382" stopTime="841.600">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, it doesn't satisfy it. 
    I don't know that it frustrates it.
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="841.600" stopTime="862.481">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Well, it runs in conflict with it, Your Honor. 
    There's a second statute that frustrates both, is inconsistent with both policies, and that is section 11-93-2, which arbitrarily places a limit of $100,000 on any recovery against a municipality, which would apply in this case with no 1983 cause of action.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="862.481" stopTime="864.856">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But we don't get to that, do we?
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="864.856" stopTime="866.058">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    We do--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="866.058" stopTime="869.980">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, we don't get to it because of the Federal rule, right?
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="869.980" stopTime="878.945">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --Well, if we have no 83 claim, as the supreme court of Alabama has said, it's all State. 
    The supreme court did not modify its wrongful death--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="878.945" stopTime="895.218">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but your argument, as I understand it, is that even to the extent of the deterrence there is a frustration of purpose here because the punitive damages cannot be recovered against the municipality. 
    Isn't that your argument?
speaker="dennis_g_pantazis" startTime="895.218" stopTime="931.079">
    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --That is... that is an argument. 
    We take the position, Your Honor, that because it's purely punitive, that it doesn't comply with the compensatory aspects, while it may comply with the deterrence. 
    The court, the supreme court of Alabama has said that in removing the 1983 action, and that's what it did, it dismissed it, said that we are now under the wrongful death. 
    While we're under that statute, we're also under the statute that arbitrarily limits us to $100,000 damages, and that frustrates both deterrence as well as compensation.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="931.079" stopTime="936.405">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but you never get to that limit because of the effect of the Federal law, do you?

    Well--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="937.093" stopTime="943.543">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Because whether there is a limit or whether there isn't a limit, you can't get any punitive damages against the municipality--

    --Well--

    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --I disagree, and the reason I disagree is, the supreme court said there is no 83 claim, so we're not under any Federal law for this case, as it sits now at the trial level.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but you don't claim an independent Federal basis for challenging the $100,000 limit on punitive damages for wrongful death in Alabama if it didn't involve a Federal claim, do you?

    Exactly, Your Honor.

    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Yes. 
    I do not challenge it. 
    I agree with your statement. 
    I do not challenge it because what we're saying is, if we have a 1983 claim, then the limitation would not apply, and that's why it's so important that this Court consider and instruct the supreme court of Alabama that our 1983 claim is not satisfied by the Alabama wrongful death statute, because if it does apply, if we have an 83 claim, the arbitrary caps do not apply. 
    If we don't have an 83 claim, if the case is as it's left right now, without any reference to 1983, then all of the State laws would apply, and we would have a purely punitive remedy and a $100,000--

    We are asking for the damages as listed in the Weeks case, which was a district court case in Alabama, which did say that the estate's damages are the measure of the pain and suffering, the funeral expenses of the decedent's heirs, or the descendents, and that is what we think the typical compensatory damage is that is encompassed in 49 States.

    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    If the complaint reads that way, that may be an inartful pleading, but we're asking that the Court compensate the estate, and in compensating the estate, the Court look at traditional compensation measures for wrongful death, which, like we've indicated, 48 or 49 States... the only one I'm unsure of is Massachusetts... have held that when you compensate for death, the beneficiaries or the descendents are the ones whose... are the ones who suffer the loss and suffer the pain and also pay the medical bills and pay the funeral expenses.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Pantazis, there's a distinction, I'm sure you are aware, between survival statutes and wrongful death acts, and one is thought as compensating the bereaved family members, and the other is thought as going to the estate, as the claims that the decedent would have if she had survived, her pain and suffering, and that goes to the estate. 
    But you seem, in your answer to Justice O'Connor, to blend those two, and I was wondering why you cast your complaint in survival act terms, and yet in your response just now about the family members you seem to be shifting over to the wrongful death mode.

    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    --I was going to explain even further what problem we have in trying to implement a 1983 remedy here. 
    Because the wrongful death statute is purely punitive, it doesn't take anything in nature from compensatory damages. 
    One example of two cases I have had. 
    One was a 32-year-old Georgia Tech engineer with children, making X dollars. 
    He dies in an accident that there was a slight negligence. 
    It was enough for a cause of action. 
    That recovery was very nominal, because the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct was minute, maybe applicable. 
    Another case in which I represented an 82-year-old Episcopal priest who was a ward of the church, was involved in an accident, but in that case the defendant's conduct violated the law. 
    They put an unreasonably dangerous load, and as a result, that case had tremendous damages. 
    The point I'm trying to make is, the recovery, as you have indicated, is unfair in one regard. 
    It's also unfair as to the compensation aspect. 
    It is the only State, and the reason I say that, Massachusetts used to have a similar rule, but I believe... I'm not sure... they have changed the rule. 
    It's the only State that has this punitive damage statute, and it totally frustrates a 1983 action that deals with compensation for the injured, the person injured, as the statute says.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Pantazis, going back to the Chief Justice's question about where the court in Weeks got its law, if I understand your answer, it got its law from sort of looking generally to the common law recovery rules beyond the State.

    You go... it says you consider first the State law and the State statutes, but where they're inconsistent, and in this particular case not only inconsistent but totally devoid of the underlying purposes because of the two Alabama statutes that defeat them, you must supplement that with a Federal remedy, and that is what Weeks did, and that is what we're asking this Court to instruct the supreme court of Alabama to do.

    I would suspect that in most cases in which you have 1983 claims they're joined with State law claims, because conduct that violates section 1983 typically would also violate some State law, and most attorneys would bring both a State law claim and a Federal claim, so if the Court creates a new precedent here, a new exception to Cox, it would not be one of limited applicability, but would apply broadly to a wide range of 1983 cases.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    My understanding of Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, and it's a very complicated case, but my understanding of it was that on the facts in that case the Federal claim could not survive regardless of the result on remand, which is why it was necessary to review it in the interlocutory posture. 
    Regardless of whether the petitioner in that case won or lost, the Federal claim would be gone, and that's not the case here, because the 1983 claim could well survive the State law proceedings. 
    It may not, which is why it's not within the second exception, but it may, which is why it's not within the third.

    --relief for the injuries that the decedent suffered. 
    Although it's brought under what's called the Wrongful Death Act in Alabama, I believe that's properly characterized as a survival action. 
    If you're seeking relief for injuries to the decedent, it's survival. 
    If you're seeking relief on your own behalf, it's a wrongful death action. 
    This is a survival action, as I understand it. 
    It was brought by the representative of the estate.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, it would be under the wrongful death action, although again I think it's properly classified as a survival claim, and the... must be brought by the representative of the estate, and they're entitled to punitive damages to punish the wrongful death of the decedent. 
    Alabama's view is that you cannot compensate the dead, and from the beginning... it's a very old statute, almost going back as far as Lord Campbell's Act... they've recognized that it's punitive in nature. 
    It's brought to punish. 
    It's original title was An Act to Prevent Homicide, and they've adhered to that interpretation.

speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2154.380" stopTime="2166.875">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, that's the most likely one. 
    I suppose there could be some argument, even if they lose on the State law claim, that it shouldn't for some reason or another be given collateral estoppel effect. 
    I don't... I can't at this point--

    She was already dead.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right, but then your point... I want to be sure I have it fairly in mind. 
    Your point is that even though the denial of a Federal claim is the law of the case as far as Alabama courts are concerned, and there's virtually... there's always the possibility, but there's... it's already been decided. 
    The case would still be alive, so the plaintiff could come back here and make the same argument he's making today.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.

speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2225.306" stopTime="2250.326">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Yes. 
    Of course, unless... my brother pointed out they would have to go through the perhaps futile exercise of preserving the claim before the Alabama supreme court, but that's true in every case of nonfinality. 
    You can expect that the court that has already decided the Federal issue will most likely adhere to its position. 
    If that were enough to get it outside the finality rule there would be no finality rule, because that's true in every case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2250.326" stopTime="2256.028">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Maybe Cox did cut way back on what the finality rule had been before, of course. 
    But anyway--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2256.028" stopTime="2307.617">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    It recognized what some have said a more pragmatic approach, but my point is that this is not within any of those exceptions, largely because the underlying claim that still remains alive, although a State law claim, is based on the same underlying allegations and it involves the same parties. 
    It could well have an effect on whether the Federal claim survives. 
    Turning back again to the merits in Robertson v. Wegman, the policies of 1983 are compensation and deterrence. 
    There is no adverse impact on 1983's compensation policy in this case for the reason recognized in Robertson, that when the only claim for compensation is by the representative of the estate, that compensation interest is not duplicated. 
    The reality is, you cannot compensate the dead.

    It was simply based on the fact that the claim was brought by the representative of the estate and therefore, as the complaint in this case, looked to the injuries that the decedent suffered.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Roberts, can I ask just a little more basic question? 
    Would you agree that the question whether punitive damages are available in the 1983 case is a Federal question, and that's what both Smith v. Wade and Fact Concerts decide, so that if a State denied a punitive damage remedy 1983 would trump the State denial?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2433.831" stopTime="2442.593">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, it would depend under what guise. 
    Certainly if the State had a rule there are no punitive damages--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2442.593" stopTime="2442.812">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2442.812" stopTime="2449.356">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --in 1983 even against individuals, I would agree that would be inconsistent with Federal law. 
    But if it was a more narrowly applicable rule, for example--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2449.356" stopTime="2471.065">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I'm just asking broadly. 
    In other words, if it were just a damage question in this case, the Federal law would trump the State, contrary State law. 
    If it was... for example, years ago there used to be, in the wrongful death field there would be a $10,000 limit on recovery. 
    If the State had such a limit on recovery, do you think that would defeat a larger recovery for... in the 1983 case?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2471.065" stopTime="2478.344">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --No, and I want to emphasize that that question, although it was adverted to earlier, is not before the Court today. 
    The Alabama supreme court did not address--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2478.344" stopTime="2484.639">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, it's a question whether it's before the Court as to whether one views this as a damage issue or a question of standing.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Even if you view it as a damage issue, the validity of State caps on wrongful death recovery and whether they're overridden by 1983 is a difficult issue.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Okay. 
    But if you would agree that on the issue of punitive damages Federal law would trump the State law whichever way it went... here it's kind of perverse... why isn't the same rule appropriate for compensatory damages, that if a State denies compensatory damages and the Federal law generally allows it, why wouldn't the State... Federal law trump it there--

    Yes, if a State law purported to bar recovery of compensatory damages in a normal 1983 case we would... the Court should find that inconsistent with 1983, but it's difficult to argue that a State limitation on recovery in a wrongful death action or a survival action is inconsistent with 1983, when 1983 has no survival or wrongful death provision.

    We do think that's wrong, and we also think it's inapplicable even in this case, because the one thing the court did in Weeks is say, you get no recovery for injuries to the decedent, because we're going to give you wrongful death... we're going to measure compensation based on your loss as a survivor. 
    Then you don't get any recovery for losses to the decedent. 
    Here, the only claims that are sought are what are technically survival claims for injuries to the decedent, so even under the approach in Weeks there would be no recovery in this case.

    A person who dies loses whatever tort actions that person may have had before the person died. 
    That was probably the basic rule.

    There probably were quite a few that hadn't. 
    What were the people thinking when they passed 1983? 
    I mean, they were worried about, say, like the local sheriff in the south might murder somebody, or might beat him up, and what were they thinking? 
    They were thinking that we give a cause of action to people when they're beaten up but we don't give a cause of action to people when they're murdered. 
    That would be such an obvious question that maybe somebody thought about that and talked about it.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Not in the... there are references, of course, in the legislative history of 1983 to murders, lynchings, and of course Congress did provide remedies for those in the Civil Rights Act. 
    There's a specific remedy in section 1986 which allows a cause of action for the widow or next of kin. 
    There is a criminal provision now codified at section 242 which could also be invoked in cases of murder, and there was 1988 which says, look to State law to fill gaps in this remedial program and, to the extent States allowed survival or wrongful death actions, perhaps the Congress thought that those would be invoked to recover in those situations. 
    Most States had survival and wrongful death provisions when 1983 was enacted.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Well, whether it was Federal common... whether it was Federal common law or State common law, it was unambiguous that in the absence of legislative change there was no recovery in the case of wrongful death.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Well, Swift v. Tyson didn't cover statutes, did it? 
    I mean, if you had to have a statute for a wrongful death or a survival recovery, that wasn't something that the Federal courts just undertook to provide for themselves.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2926.257" stopTime="2942.985">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    No, not at all, and this Court recognized in the Brame case 6 years after 1983 was passed that at the common law... and it didn't differentiate between State or Federal, but at the common law they thought it was beyond question that there was no wrongful death or survival action.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    And of course they did not assume that there could be a separate concept, did they, of Federal common law at that point? 
    I mean, there was just a generalized concept of common law.

    Mr. Roberts, it was neither State nor Federal. 
    The common law was this mystical concept we inherited from England. 
    It was English common law, was what that term would normally refer to.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2981.689" stopTime="2987.749">

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You would agree, wouldn't you, Mr. Roberts, that if there was no survival statute or wrongful death statute in a State, a particular State in 1871, and they pass it in 1890, that would nevertheless control in cases after 1890?

    --At the time. 
    Now, the other prong under Robertson v. Wegman they ask, what is the effect on deterrence, and here again there's no adverse effect on 1983's deterrence policy by application of the Alabama law. 
    To find an adverse effect, the Court has to hypothesize a city employee who is familiar with the intricacies of the wrongful death law and 1983 law and who, solely to avoid subjecting his employer to liability under 1983 for compensatory damages, would kill rather than injure the victim of his constitutional violation even though--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Roberts, isn't it... and this is a Federal claim, and it picks up on State law, auxiliary State law, that you could have a result on this... under this Federal claim for relief of no recovery at all in Alabama and a whopping recovery in the neighboring State, all under this Federal cause of action. 
    It seems to me that the State law that says no recovery would be inconsistent--

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Well--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3076.183" stopTime="3080.056">

    --and the Federal court would have to supplement it from some other source.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3080.056" stopTime="3103.625">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --The fact that you get a different result from State to State, as this Court recognized in Robertson, is, of course, a necessary consequence of the terms of 1988. 
    It says that you're... if you're borrowing State law. 
    You're necessarily contemplating that there may be a different result in one State than in another State, and the Court reiterated that point in Carlson v. Green in distinguishing the remedy it was creating there.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3103.625" stopTime="3126.679">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    You could have minor variations, who are the survivors might be different in one State or another, some might have grandmothers and some might not, but this kind of basic variation of the question is, is it incompatible with the idea of a recovery to have this setup which says, you get... you end up getting nothing?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3126.679" stopTime="3136.721">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, I think it begs the question to say that 1983 assumes there's going to be recovery in cases of survival and wrongful death. 
    198--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3136.721" stopTime="3144.281">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is there any other State in the union that has this situation where the only recovery under State law is punitive damages?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3144.281" stopTime="3160.101">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Massachusetts used to have that rule. 
    It changed it. 
    At this point Alabama is the only State that remedies wrongful death through punitive damages alone. 
    That doesn't make it an illegitimate policy, based on the--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3160.101" stopTime="3175.393">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    For an Alabama claim Alabama could do whatever it wants, have a cap on punitives and no cap on damages if one survives, which I understand is the law in Alabama.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3175.393" stopTime="3210.206">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --But the only way to have a survival or wrongful death cause of action under 1983 is by incorporating the State law, because when 1983 was passed there was no survival or wrongful death at common law. 
    The Congress knew that if it wanted to create an exception to that it had to be done legislatively, as it had been in Lord Campbell's Act, as that Congress did in section 1986. 
    The opinion, Justice Ginsburg, you announced this morning indicated... and I'm going just on the basis of the announcement... that when Congress in the same statute provides a remedy in one section and not in the other, you don't assume that--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3210.206" stopTime="3231.103">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Ah, but we've already crossed that bridge, haven't we, in this series of laws? 
    How about 1982 and &lt;nineteen eighty-three&gt; [= 1983] with respect to damages? 
    1982, if I remember correctly, just speaks in terms of declaratory relief, and yet you can get damages for a violation of 1982, can't you?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3231.103" stopTime="3233.431">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --I believe so, yes.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3233.431" stopTime="3235.993">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Right next to 1983, which says damages.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3235.993" stopTime="3286.067">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    But here you're talking about an exception to the prevailing common law rule, and when you have a narrow exception in one section, I think the only logical inference is that Congress did not intend it in the other section. 
    There was no doubt Congress knew what the prevailing law was, no recovery for survival or wrongful death. 
    The most that can be said is that they would give you that right if you had one under State law. 
    1988 would provide it. 
    Here, Alabama does provide such a right, and it doesn't leave them with no remedy. 
    Under the Alabama rule you still have a remedy under 1983 applying the Alabama rule against individuals, and this Court has recognized repeatedly in Robertson, in Carlson, and in Fact Concerts, that the most effective deterrent is an action against the individuals. 
    In fact, the situation--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3286.067" stopTime="3297.969">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And that would be if you take Alabama law wholesale. 
    If you could identify the individual firefighters, then you would be subject to the $100,000 cap. 
    Is that right?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3297.969" stopTime="3305.482">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Oh yes, and again, I don't think that issue is before the Court because the only... because that's not part of the wrongful death statute. 
    Those are general--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3305.482" stopTime="3308.950">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But on your reasoning I take it there would be no incompatibility there.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3308.950" stopTime="3355.477">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --I think not, largely because at the time 1982 was passed many States... I'm not sure if there was quite a majority or not, but many had such caps. 
    Congress put a cap in in the only wrongful death provision it provided in 1986. 
    The situation in Alabama under the Wrongful Death Act is quite similar to the situation this Court has formulated under Bivens. 
    We know from FDIC v. Myer that you have a Bivens action against Federal officials, the individuals, but no Bivens action against the agency. 
    Here, applying the Alabama Wrongful Death Act you have a 1983 action in the case of wrongful death in Alabama against individuals for punitive damages, but you do not have one against the municipality.

    Mr. Dennis G. Pantazis 
    Thank you. 
    Your Honor, you had indicated that Robertson had an exception. 
    Robertson does have an exception. 
    On page 1997 it says, we intimate no view, moreover, about whether abatement based on State law could be allowed in a situation in which the deprivation of the Federal right causes a death, which is exactly what we have here. 
    One final statement. 
    If 1988 did not intend for this Court to review the State court's common law and statutes to determine whether or not they were inconsistent, they would have left that sentence out, but they didn't. 
    The sentence, a statement that this Court and all Federal courts are to view the State common law and the State statutory laws for their inconsistency to the policy of the Federal 1983, and that I think answers Your Honor's question of why and how this Court has to review the State laws.
