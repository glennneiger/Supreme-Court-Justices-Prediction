Salinas v. United States

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in No. 96-738, Mario Salinas v. United States. 
    Mr. Enriquez.
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="9.606" stopTime="125.331">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves the interpretation of the RICO statute and the Federal theft, bribery and embezzlement statutes. 
    Concerning the Federal bribery statute, this case presents the issue of whether this prosecution in Federal court, of State officials, is within the scope of the statute, even though it does not... the conduct complained of does not impinge upon... upon, affect or divert Federal or even State or even any local funds whatsoever. 
    Concerning the RICO statute, this case presents the issue of what are the elements of a RICO conspiracy and how that should be charged to a jury. 
    Because of the nature of the prosecution in this case, State officials being tried for primarily State law violations in Federal court, it raises great issues concerning Federalism and the federalization of State crimes. 
    As to the Federal bribery statute, it is our position that the statute itself does not reach as far as a prosecution in this case. 
    Of course, the... the funds which funded the bribery did not involve any State, Federal or local funds; but, more importantly, no Federal funds, no local funds, no State funds, whatsoever, were diverted. 
    18 U.S.C., Section 666 contemplates the kind of transaction where, for example, money is embezzled from the government, where there is a theft of government property, or, in the bribery context, where government funds are diverted as a result of the bribe. 
    And what I mean by this, for example, is where money is, for example, paid to a government official, and then a... a bid is awarded or a contract is given or a lease is awarded or a grant is made or a job is given, something of that nature.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="125.331" stopTime="134.617">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, it's clear the statute would apply in those cases. 
    But are you suggesting there is no Federal interest in how Federal prisoners are treated when they're housed in State facilities?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="134.617" stopTime="171.373">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Not at all, Your Honor. 
    I am saying that there... I do recognize that there is a Federal interest in how the prisoners are treated. 
    And... and I think that could be vindicated probably in a properly worded statute that is directed to that. 
    But this statute is not directed to that. 
    Additionally, if I may point out, the government's interest is... is probably satisfied if, for example, it makes sure that the grant that it's giving or... or the Federal funds that... that it is awarding are to an organization that, for example, shares it views... shares its views or its policies.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="171.373" stopTime="193.053">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But our... our inquiry, really... we think probably that Congress is the one to decide whether the government's interest is satisfied. 
    So I don't think there's any separate inquiry. 
    If... if the statute covers this, then the government's interests would be satisfied by an application of the statute, I take it.
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="193.053" stopTime="212.784">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Well, yes, it would be, Justice Rehnquist, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    It would be, but it's our position that the purpose of this statute is a protection of property statute. 
    That's what this statute is directed at. 
    That's the focus of it. 
    That is what the government is... is trying to take care of.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="212.784" stopTime="227.544">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Then why... why... why is this statute... I gather the government gave 860... or $850,000, and about 915,000 a year, to house 100... 100 Federal prisoners... up to 100.
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="227.544" stopTime="228.194">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="228.194" stopTime="230.912">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    That's about $9,000 or $10,000 a prisoner.
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="230.912" stopTime="231.947">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Yes, Justice Breyer.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    To create a certain kind of a room, a cell.
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="234.413" stopTime="235.232">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Right.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="235.232" stopTime="261.466">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And now that room or cell was misused. 
    So why doesn't it affect the... exactly the... the very, very expenditure that the Federal Government made? 
    We'll give you a thous... we'll give you this prisoner, $10,000, to create a certain kind of cell that is to be used in a certain kind of way. 
    And now, this... your client took a bribe to use it in a different way. 
    So why does that not directly affect the Federal expenditure that was at issue?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="261.466" stopTime="295.188">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Well, because in... in... in the trial court level, the judge faced the issue of whether this conduct in this case, the... the conjugal visits or the contact visits, were... were illegal. 
    And the jury was not asked to find whether that was improper conduct in this situation. 
    And what they were asked were whether bribes were paid for contact visits. 
    The... the purpose of the statute, as we see it, is a protection of property statute. 
    We see it from... from the internal structure of the statute.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="295.188" stopTime="309.698">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't quite grasp the... the answer to your question. 
    Is there... is there a doubt, is it disputed that conjugal visits are unauthorized for... for Federal prisoners housed in this jail?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="309.698" stopTime="311.331">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Yes... yes, ma'am.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="311.331" stopTime="314.934">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So why would that have to be put to the jury? 
    That's a given, right?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="314.934" stopTime="335.265">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    No... no, ma'am. 
    The... the judge, in instructing the jury, said that the question of whether there were conjugal visits or contact visits... and that was disputed in the evidence... was not the issue. 
    The question was, was their payment for these visits, whatever their nature may have been.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="335.265" stopTime="344.287">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, why would there have been a need for the briber to bribe if the conjugal visits were lawful?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="344.287" stopTime="366.284">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    I... I think it's because it was a policy of the sheriff's department not to allow conjugal visits. 
    And... and, of course, the sheriff indicated that the visits that occurred were not conjugal... conjugal visits. 
    Although they were very liberal, as far as the number of contact visits that were allowed, he denied that conjugal visits occurred.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="366.284" stopTime="381.394">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, wouldn't there also be a Federal interest in... in not wanting its... its contract jails to be used for bribery, even if in fact the briber gets a very bad deal?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="381.394" stopTime="383.262">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Yes, I... I think there is--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="383.262" stopTime="390.000">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So, if that's the case, then what difference does it make whether, in fact, these visits were, in fact, lawful or not lawful?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="390.000" stopTime="423.321">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --Well, because this statute is directed to the protection of property. 
    That is the... the structure of the statute. 
    That is the history of the statute. 
    For example, this... this statute is not limited to bribery. 
    It is... it also deals with theft of government property. 
    It deals with embezzlement of government funds. 
    And... and it's talking about something... something of value, something monetary, something that can be measured, being taken away as a result... or being given out... the government largess being given out as a result of a bribe given to a government official. 
    That didn't occur--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="423.321" stopTime="434.979">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, suppose... suppose the jail official charged with purchasing the food for the prisoners is taking a... a bribe and a kickback, and siphons off $10,000 a month. 
    And, as a result, the prisoners get much worse food.
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="434.979" stopTime="435.796">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --Yes.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="435.796" stopTime="437.013">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is that covered by this statute?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="437.013" stopTime="445.986">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Yes, it is covered by that statute, because then there is... is something that was taken from the Federal funds or from the State funds, but not the local funds.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="445.986" stopTime="448.604">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    No... no; these are State funds. 
    These are State. 
    It just is in the Federal facility.
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="448.604" stopTime="469.935">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Yes, sir, it... it is... Justice Kennedy, it is covered by this statute, because the statute, in my reading of it, says, not only are we protecting Federal funds, but state, we're going to protect your funds, we're going to protect your property, we're going to protect you from bribery. 
    So, yes, from the plain reading of the statute, it does cover that situation.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="469.935" stopTime="485.027">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Suppose the Federal Government gives money for a museum or for a dam, and a State official improperly says to the public, I'll charge you to use the dam, and keeps the money. 
    Or, I'll only let you use the dam if you bribe me.
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="485.027" stopTime="485.677">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Mmm-hmm.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="485.677" stopTime="487.629">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Is that covered by the statute?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="487.629" stopTime="521.736">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    I... I think it would be probably not covered by the statute, because nothing was taken from the Federal Government or the State government or the local government. 
    The... there was no taking of funds from these entities. 
    And so I don't think it would be covered by the statute. 
    And I don't think this statute is intended to cover all of those situations. 
    For example, from the legislative history, it... and from the reading of the statute, it makes it clear that not all prohibited transactions are covered, even if the agency receives--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="521.736" stopTime="526.538">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, that... that... that's a bit tautological to say that not all prohibited transactions are covered.
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="526.538" stopTime="526.921">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="526.921" stopTime="537.460">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Where... where in the statute do you find the language that would make it not applicable, say, to Justice Breyer's question?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="537.460" stopTime="563.360">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    I find it in... in the bribery portion of the statute that says that in order for it to be a violation, there has to be... it has to involve a transaction... business transaction or series of transaction of government, involving more than $5,000. 
    That $5,000 figure is something that is carried through, throughout the statute, not only in the bribery provisions, but also in the theft and embezzlement provisions.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="563.360" stopTime="566.562">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So you say the amount of the bribe would have to be $5,000?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="566.562" stopTime="571.700">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    No, Your Honor, I do not. 
    Under the terms of the statute, the amount of the bribe can be any amount.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="571.700" stopTime="574.668">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Then what does the $5,000 refer to?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="574.668" stopTime="590.677">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    It refers to the value to the Federal Government or the State government or the local government of what was taken away from them. 
    Similar to the embezzlement and theft provisions that say, if... if money is taken from the Federal Government, embezzled, and it's $5,000, then it's a violation under the statute.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But you don't tie it into the text of this provision, Mr. Enriquez; that... that... that's what troubles me. 
    Why not... I... I find it difficult to... to see that there's any business transaction or series of transactions involved here. 
    What... what is the business? 
    You... you... or you've conceded that point, haven't you--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, you didn't put it that way in your brief. 
    I... I wish you had focused on the... on the text, 
    "in connection with any business transaction or series of transactions. " 
    That does seem to... to call to mind that there have been a deal. 
    Transaction doesn't... I wouldn't call assigning someone to a cell a transaction--

    --I... I wouldn't either, and even--

    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --That's right. 
    I... I don't see it that way, Your Honor. 
    We feel, Justice Scalia, that the statute applies when... for example, more appropriately, let's someone comes to an official, who has the power to disburse Federal funds or Federal largess, and... and they pay him something, and then he gives the contract.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="665.310" stopTime="666.995">

    A bid.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    I... I think that's... there's a possibility of that reading. 
    But I think when you look, Justice O'Connor, at the structure of the statute that talks about the other parts, embezzlement and theft of property, they're talking about taking it... taking it from the government.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="699.133" stopTime="738.224">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but we're looking at (B), somebody who corruptly solicits or demands for the demand of any person... that could be for the benefit of Beltran... or agrees to accept anything of value from any person... and he agreed to accept money from Beltran... intending to be influenced or rewarded... which he was... in connection with a transaction of the government or agency... the transaction being the housing of Federal prisoners, pursuant to the contract.

    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    I... I guess our position, Justice O'Connor, is that the... the only transaction there was a transaction between the marshal's office and the County of Hidalgo to establish this agreement. 
    And... and I don't think that... unless it be under some kind of third-party beneficiary theory or some other kind of... of theory, that that would bring Beltran--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="762.139" stopTime="774.447">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    It isn't that complicated. 
    The jail agreed to house the Federal prisoners.

    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --That's right. 
    But it... it didn't have anything to do with, for example, whether he should be in the jail or not. 
    That was something that was strictly the marshal's... the U.S. marshal's decision. 
    He's the one that decides how many people... Federal prisoners... are going to be in that jail or whether they're going to be housed in that jail or another jail.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="793.677" stopTime="813.472">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the reason the government wants a statute like this is to avoid the unseemliness of giving large sums of Federal money for services to the Federal Government that are being carried out in a corrupt fashion by the entity and the employees charged with conducting it.

    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    There's something in the legislative history that... that talks in terms of bribery, which influences Federal funds. 
    Additionally, another indication that this is its purpose is illustrated by reference to what is, in essence, what... what I consider the com... the companion statute to 666, which is 18 U.S.C., Section 201, which is also a bribery statute, and which, it can be said, was the impetus for the creation of Section 666. 
    And Section 201 is referred to in the legislative history. 
    Section 666 was enacted because, in interpreting Section 201, many courts had given a narrow definition to agents of government, or who was acting on behalf of the government, to come within the scope of that bribery statute. 
    However, this Court interpreted Section 201, in... in the case of Dikson v. United States, and stated, quote, the regulation and oversight of the funds is aimed precisely at the harm that occurred here: diversion of Federal money to unauthorized purposes... diversion of Federal money to un... unauthorized purposes.

speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="1079.058" stopTime="1223.853">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --No... no. 
    Additionally, within the bribery... the bribery provisions, itself, it has two elements in there. 
    What is the amount of the bribe? 
    It can be any amount. 
    And, then, what does it have to deal with? 
    It has to deal with a transaction involving $5,000 or more. 
    And... and that is something that is carried out throughout the terms of the statute, not only in this bribery provision, but in the theft and also in the embezzlement provisions. 
    May it please the Court: 
    Concerning RICO, it's our position that in order to be found guilty of a RICO conspiracy, the government has to prove that the defendant either committed two predicate acts or agreed to commit two predicate acts. 
    We believe this is so, first of all, because it's a natural reading of the RICO substantive, which states that the essence of the violation is to conduct or participate, through a pattern of racketeering. 
    That is, the performance of two predicate acts. 
    It doesn't speak in terms of joining a conspiracy or simply joining an enterprise. 
    Indeed, the indictment in this case read in that fashion. 
    It alleges that the defendant conspired to conduct or participate. 
    It says nothing about conspired to join an enterprise. 
    Even the case law cited by the government indicates that in reading RICO substantive and the RICO conspiracy statutes together, that that's the natural reading... conspire to conduct or participate... not simply to conspire to join. 
    Well, we... we feel that this pattern of racketeering element is what makes this RICO statute so unique. 
    This is the core of the statute. 
    And that conduct or participating in a pattern of racketeering is what brings one within the scope of this statute. 
    And we feel that the government is seeking to circumvent this core requirement in the statute. 
    In... instructive on this issue, again, is the legislative history of the statute, where the principal sponsor of the bill pointed out that even to come within the proscription of... of Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act, which is RICO, and which contains the conspiracy provision, to even come within its prohibition, the individual has to commit the crimes, the predicate acts. 
    And if he doesn't do it, then he's simply not within the scope of the statute.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1223.853" stopTime="1230.376">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    That has been rejected in the context of... of RICO.

    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --It has been rejected by the government's own decisions in, for example, the Neapolitan case, where it held against our position, but they discussed the idea of whether Pinkerton would apply in the RICO conspiracy context, and the court... the court--

    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --It was the 7th Circuit, Your Honor. 
    And... and, in addition, in that discussion, they pointed out that the Department of Justice manual indicates that Pinkerton should not be used in this context. 
    Additionally, if we get into the... the... the question of traditional conspiracy law, which rules do we import from traditional conspiracy law into what is admittedly a new and drastic statute? 
    I think if we look, like, for example, in the Pinkerton case, it talks about an agree... that if you... if the substantive statute requires an agreement of... of two people or more, then you can't have a conspiracy violation. 
    That is traditional conspiracy law.

    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --Justice Ginsburg, I would suggest to the Court that that is a logical reading, because if you can't get them under RICO substantive, how can you get them under RICO conspiracy? 
    And... and so I think, under RICO substantive, this Court has instructed us that... in the Reves v. Ernst B. Young case, that in order to be within RICO, it's not simply enough to be somehow associated with the enterprise, but, rather, you've got to participate by management or control of the enterprise. 
    And so, in... in your hypothetical, if they can't get you for RICO substantive, then I think it may be fair that they can't get you for RICO conspiracy. 
    And as a practical matter, in the cases that... that are charged below, I... I... I've never seen a case where they don't charge RICO substantive and RICO conspiracy also, anyway.

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The first statute before the Court, the bribery offense, which is stated in Section 666, specifies four elements. 
    First, the defendant must be an agent of an entity that receives Federal benefits. 
    Second, the Federal benefits received by that entity must exceed $10,000 in a 1-year period. 
    Third, during that 1-year period, the defendant must accept something of value, intending to be influenced in a transaction of the entity. 
    And, fourth, the transaction must involve something of value.

    And I think, in many cases, in that situation, the... say, the government gives money to a local agency, in turn, to hand out money, the local agency won't be getting... won't be getting a deal for it.

    Transaction is one implementation of that... of that business, such as allowing... allowing a prisoner to have more privileges than he would normally, under the generally applicable rules. 
    There are also situations, I should say, where the courts have held "business" to cover situations where one local agency is an intergovernmental entity, where it... where the local agency doesn't have the authority to do something on its own, and they've said, well... and, say, one entity's representative votes on an intergovernmental board... and they say, well, this is clearly a business, because it's... it's engaged in a... you know, in a relationship with another entity.

    So... I mean, it has... the bribe has to be roughly contemporaneous with the... with the receipt of Federal funds.

    [Laughter] 
    --the... the... it operates on the... it operates on a prophylactic principle, which is that... which is that Congress is entitled to insist that any entity to which it gives money be free of significant corruption.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --It's perfectly reasonable from Congress' point of view, you know. 
    But I'm not sure it's still reasonable from the poor defendant's point of view. 
    He... he thinks he's stealing the money from... from... from an agency that hasn't gotten any Federal aid. 
    And, all of a sudden, within a year, it gets Federal aid. 
    That doesn't seem fair.
speaker="paul_r_q_wolfson" startTime="2618.706" stopTime="2631.613">
    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --Well, the... the receipt of Federal funds is a... is a... is... was seen by Congress as a jurisdictional... as a jur... and... and has been seen by the courts as a jurisdictional requirement that brings Federal authority along with it.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2631.613" stopTime="2666.537">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But there is a simpler way that's consistent with the words "business transaction". 
    The Federal Government gives almost everyone in... you know, not almost everyone, but an awful lot of people money. 
    And many of them are businesses or, many that aren't businesses, buy things and sell things with the money. 
    And they may, even before they get the money, make contracts that have to do with the money they're going to get. 
    And commercial bribery often involves bribing a selling agent or a purchasing agent in respect to such money and the use thereof. 
    And that would be a natural reading of the words. 
    We wouldn't have to struggle with business transaction, et cetera.

    Well--

    I'm not saying I would; I just point that out.

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --I mean, in this regard, I do think it is actually useful to remember that the statute was enacted while the Dikson case was... while the Dikson case, under 18 U.S.C. 201... while that issue was percolating in the courts. 
    And there were many cases that have been prosecuted under Section 201 that would not fit a commercial bribery situation, where the Federal Government gave community organizations grants, and said to the community organizations, you go out and relieve poverty with this money. 
    And... and--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2709.732" stopTime="2711.249">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    There are different ideas of how to do it.
speaker="paul_r_q_wolfson" startTime="2711.249" stopTime="2860.579">
    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --Yes. 
    Well, I do want to point out, there is another... there is a limitation... there... there is a limitation that is in the statute, which is that the... which is that the... there are two limitations I do want to point out. 
    First of all, the... the defendant has to be an agent of a local organization. 
    And he has to be able to act on behalf of the organization. 
    So it may not be that every single employee of every organization is covered. 
    There is a level of, I think, responsibility, official responsibility, that is covered... captured in the term "agent". 
    And the other point is that the statute covers... this is in subsection (B)... benefits under a Federal program that covers a variety of forms of Federal assistance, and that... the legislative history and the courts have... have... do point out that there are some purely commercial transactions between the government and, say, somebody who the government buys computers from, just without any kind of Federal programmatic aspect. 
    I mean, if the government just goes out into the open market and spends $10,000 for fungible equipment, that's not necessarily ben... that's not benefits under a Federal program or form of Federal assistance. 
    There is a... there is an aspect of the implementation of a Federal policy that comes with those words. 
    I want to turn at this point to the... the other issue before the Court, which is the RICO conspiracy issue. 
    Our posissue... our position on that issue... excuse me... is... is quite straightforward, which is that the RICO conspiracy provision follows traditional principles of conspiracy law. 
    And under the traditional principles, the government is not required to prove that the defendant... the conspiracy defendant agreed personally to commit the offense that is the object of the conspiracy. 
    The government needs to prove only that the conspirators agreed among themselves that the offense would be committed by one or more of them, and that the defendant associated himself with that... with that agreement. 
    Nothing in the RICO conspiracy statute suggests that Congress intended to depart from this well-settled rule. 
    Congress used, really, a term of art, 1962(D). 
    And that term has a settled common law meaning, and there is no indication in the statute that there are any additional elements of proof.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2860.579" stopTime="2886.562">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm not sure that I know of another statute which requires, you know, multiple acts by the same person. 
    I mean, it can be argued that you cannot conspire to violate (C) unless you conspire to have a person... it may not... it may not be the person you're prosecuting.
speaker="paul_r_q_wolfson" startTime="2886.562" stopTime="2887.346">

    Right.

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    I... I think that may be right. 
    That is, let's say a group of people get together and say, you know, we want to have a... a... a conspiracy of some kind. 
    It may be that the conspirators must foresee that a person carry out... a... one person carry out two predicate acts of racketeering.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2910.245" stopTime="2911.162">

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --Right. 
    No. But I think that the... but what... I think it is important to point out, as I think what Justice Ginsburg's colloquy with my colleague pointed out, one thing RICO clearly was intended to get at was the... the person who sits at the top of the organization, who effectively insulates himself. 
    And to... to use, sort of, that classic example, suppose the... the middle people in the organizations go to the top... the organized crime chieftain and the say, you know, we really want to get into the business of arson. 
    And we... we... you know, we have a plan... you know, we're going to start burning down buildings for... you know, for... for hire. 
    And the head of the organization says, you know, that sounds good, you know, do you have any particular plans in mind? 
    They say, no, but, you know, we think we've got it. 
    I think that, in that situation, you know, it falls squarely within the... the coverage of the statute. 
    And by agreeing to that... I mean, the... the chief has really, you know, has really allowed the... allowed the thing to go forward. 
    And his agreement is... is essential, in that case, to the... to the achievement of the... of the enterprise, which have the necessary structure. 
    As the plan is presented to him, there clearly is a pattern, because there is to be continuity, plus relationship. 
    And the... the... the requirement is satisfied that there be two predicate acts of racketeering.

   Rebuttal of Francisco J. Enriquez
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="3017.978" stopTime="3160.523">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    It... the discussion that General Wolfson engaged in with this Court concerning RICO conspiracy, the great debates that went on in Congress concerning the enaction of this statute, the legislative history, all of that was directed to RICO substantive. 
    RICO substantive, itself, is directed to the heads of the enterprises, the people that manage or control. 
    Ernst... Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young indicates that... that that's the idea. 
    So it... it just doesn't seem unfair that if you can't get them under RICO substantive, that there's apparently a great discussion in the legislative history that... that would indicate, well, we... we can get them under RICO conspiracy. 
    The... the focus here is, what is the object of the conspiracy? 
    And the object of the conspiracy, in... in our view, is not simply to join an enterprise that... that operates in that fashion, but to... to personally agree to commit two specific acts of racketeering. 
    That's what the whole discussion in the legislative history was about, not limited RICO substantive or RICO conspiracy... just to when the statute would or would not apply. 
    I would suggest to the Court, concerning both of these statutes, Section 666 and... and the RICO statute, that there are certain areas of government which historically this Court has indicated to us, under the Constitution, have been deemed within the province, or primarily within the province, of States. 
    For example, education, domestic relations, State officials and criminal law. 
    This case has two of those areas: State officials and criminal law. 
    And it has been established, in the context of State officials, that before it can be said that Congress intended to reach their conduct or regulate their conduct or affect their status or qualifications of State officers, it must be clear that the officers, under the circumstances of the case, are within the scope of the statute. 
    And that's the clear statement rule. 
    Unless... under that rule, unless the officers are clearly within the scope of the statute, they're not. 
    And even if they are arguably--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3160.523" stopTime="3170.961">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr.... Mr. Enriquez, the statute here says, whoever being an agent of a State, local or Indian tribe, so there's no doubt that Congress meant to include those... those persons, is there?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="3170.961" stopTime="3176.632">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct. 
    The question is, under the circumstances of the case. 
    For example--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3176.632" stopTime="3183.286">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So you say we must read each clause in the Act with... with that in mind, even though it was clear that Congress intended to include State officials?
speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="3183.286" stopTime="3201.664">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    --Yes, because, all... all of a sudden, we have a situation here where Congress is indicating that it wants to work upon or... or affect State officials. 
    And when you... when that happens, then it becomes an issue of Federalism. 
    And it's, I feel, to be determined under those rules.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3201.664" stopTime="3203.533">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Are you suggesting there's a Tenth Amendment--

    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez

speaker="francisco_j_enriquez" startTime="3256.650" stopTime="3303.548">
    Mr. Francisco J. Enriquez 
    And I understand that... that the... the government's position on this is that it's under the Spending Clause and that, by virtue of spending, they can go ahead and regulate. 
    But I... I think this goes beyond the cases that they've cited. 
    None of the cases that they have cited on this regulation issue are criminal law cases. 
    All of the cases that they have cited speak in terms of... of conditions or... or incentives to the States. 
    None of them speak in terms of... of something as coercive as, we're going to put your... your officials in jail. 
    So I... I think, when you get to that point, then we run into a Spending Clause problem. 
    It doesn't seek to justify itself under the terms of... of the Commerce Clause, and so I think it does exceed the scope of the Constitution, as applied in this case.
